The being whose nature or essence is thus the necessitating ? and therefore , for our thought , the explanatory ? ground of its existence , is , of course , God : " if any one asks , what sort of Idea the Idea of that being is , the supposition of whose nonexistence is thus an express contradiction , I answer : ' T is the first and simplest idea we can possibly frame , or rather which ( unless we forbear thinking at all ) we can not possibly extirpate or remove out of our minds , of a most Simple Being , absolutely Eternal and Infinite , Original and Independent .

" It Nay , worse ; as a disciple of Clarke 's argued , unless there is in God 's essence a sufficient reason for his existence , we have no rational assurance that he may not some day lapse into nonentity . It is plain and certain that any alteration of existence of a being may as possibly be affected without a cause or reason , as the existence of that being can either be supposed to be originally determined without any cause or reason , or to continue to exist without any cause or reason . If therefore the first cause existed originally without any cause or reason , it may be mutable or corruptible in its nature , and so may carry within itself the cause , ground , or reason of its ceasing to be.12 These were theological ways of saying that the position of a universe in which existence was at no point grounded in necessity would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo long afterwards described with a more adequate rhetoric : " La fin toujours imminente , aucune transition entre titre et ne plus titre , la rentree au creuset , le glissement possible a toute minute , c'est ce precipice-la qui est la creation . " In the case of one being , then , Clarke , and a numerous company of other philosophers and theologians of the time , were as averse as Spinoza or Leibniz from admitting that existence has no determining reason . God 's existence , at all events ,  | could not be supposed to be an accident . It is true that many of those who affirmed this ? and Clarke among them ? at the same time raised somewhat quibbling demurrers to Anselm 's ontological argument , which involved the same dialectic ; yet there were , apparently , only a small minority 13 who were prepared to deny that there is an ens necessarium , i. e. , an entity of which the essence is such that it would not be what , qua essence , it is , if it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one such instance , and to leave all the rest of the world of existents with no point of support in the World of Ideas ? or , what was the theological expression for the same conception , in the divine reason ? To this question the philosophy of Spinoza ( like that of Abelard and of Bruno before him ) had given an emphatic answer in the negative . Every fact of existence must be held to have its roots in the eternal order , in the necessities belonging to essences and their relations ; and every essence , likewise , must have its flowering among existents . That the necessary actualization of all possibles is affirmed by Spinoza also has not been evident to all of his expositors . With some logical implications of his system , and with a few of his express statements , it seems to conflict . To suppose him to have accepted the principle of plenitude would , it has been suggested , entail the contradiction that all successive entities and events must exist simultaneously . For the necessity of their existence would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be irrelevant . We do not ? or the mathematicians of Spinoza 's time did not ? say merely that , given a plane triangle , it is necessary that its interior angles should some day become equal to two right angles . As little could one who maintained that the universe by logical necessity contains all things capable of existence admit that some individual things come into being after others . But in4 dividual things do come into existence one after another ; and we ought not to impute to Spinoza without clear warrant a doctrine inconsistent with this truism . Again , he sometimes definitely says that we may have " ideas of non-existent modes " i. e. , of particular objects which have no being apart from the conceiving intellect.14 Furthermore , he declares that " no definition involves or expresses any particular multitude or  | definite number of individuals " ; e. g. , the definition of a triangle tells us only the " nature " of a triangle and implies nothing as to the number of triangles that exist . Hence it is argued that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for Spinoza a non-necessary , and therefore arbitrary , selection from among the far more numerous things which might have been . But this way of interpreting him is , I think , quite impossible . The principle of sufficient reason , as he lays it down , applies to non-existence as well as to existence : " of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned , alike for its existence or its non-existence. " 15 And it is " the intellect of God , in so far as it is conceived to constitute the divine essence , " that " is in reality the cause of all things . " is Could there be any reason lying in the nature of this fundamental cause why some things that are capable of existence should not exist ? Manifestly not ; there is nothing that can be conceived , i. e. , nothing that is not self-contradictory , which does not " fall under an infinite intellect . " Since , then , God can conceive of all essences , since neither he nor the universe would be rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked it , since " whatever we conceive to be in the power of God necessarily exists , " 17 and since this power is unlimited ( except by the impossibility of conceiving or producing the self-contradictory ) , it follows that " from the necessity of the divine nature must follow an infinite number of things in infinite ways ? that is , all things which can fall within the sphere of an infinite intellect . " 18 Indeed , Spinoza in some passages infers the necessary existence of all possible finite modes of each attribute directly from the principle of sufficient reason , without recourse to the argument from the existence of God as cause  --  his existence being itself , in fact , deduced from the same principle . While the essence " triangle , " taken separately , does not of itself imply the existence of any triangles , their existence does follow " from the order of the material universe as a whole ( ex ordine universae naturae corporeae ) ; for from this it must follow either that a triangle necessarily exists , or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is self-evident . From which it follows that a thing necessarily exists if no cause or reason can be given which prevents  | its existence . " In other words , the class " triangles " is one possible species of material bodies ( with respect to shape ) , one mode of " extension " ; and both the species , and any individual of the species , will have actual existence , unless there is a " reason " which renders this impossible ; and such a reason would consist solely in the fact that its existence in some manner involved self-contradiction . Similarly , God 's necessary existence can be proved simply from the fact that " no cause or reason can be given which prevents him from existing , or which rules out his existence . " For it would be " absurd to affirm of an absolutely infinite and supremely perfect being " that his existence involves contradiction.19 There are thus in Spinoza two distinct arguments for the existence of God . The first is the ontological argument , simply from the definition of causa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this argument is applicable solely to God , since there can ( it is assumed ) be only one such essence . The other is the argument from the necessity of the existence of anything whose existence is not precluded by some logical impossibility ; and that is applicable to all essences , though the essence " God " has with respect to it one unique advantage , inasmuch as ( Spinoza assumes ) it is evident that an essence defined as having the properties of " absolute infinity " and " perfection " can not be debarred from existence by any intrinsic or extrinsic logical impediment . And to these two proofs correspond the two ways of deducing the principle of plenitude : the first indirectly , through the conception of God whose existence is already independently proved by the ontological argument , the second directly , from the same premise by which , in the second proof , God 's own existence is established . It has , however , been suggested by at least one learned commentator that Spinoza affirms the principle of plenitude only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter exist . But this interpretation not only conflicts with the truism that the logically necessary is no more so at one time than another , but is also expressly repudiated by Spinoza , both in the Short Treatise and the Ethics . Those , he declares , are in error who contend that , " if God had created everything that is in his intellect , " so that there would now be nothing more  | left for him to create , he could not now be said to be omnipotent . On the contrary , we must , Spinoza says , conceive " that God 's omnipotence has been displayed from all eternity and will for all eternity remain in the same state of activity . " 20 It would be an absurdity to imagine that at some former time he created a world different from that which he now creates ; for this would imply that his intellect and will were then different from what they now are . If his creation had at one time been incomplete or imperfect , he would have been at some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . In short , there can at no time be any " cause whereby he could be moved to create one thing rather or more than another . " Thus " from the supreme power of God , or from his infinite nature , an infinity of things in an infinity of modes ? that is , all things ? have necessarily flowed forth , or always follow by the same necessity , just as from the nature of a triangle it follows from all eternity and to all eternity that the sum of its three angles is equal to two right angles . " 21 The existence of all possible beings at all times is therefore an implicate of the divine nature . Our principle of plenitude ? in what may be called its static form ? is thus inherent in the very substance of Spinoza 's doctrine . From the timeless immutability of the World-Ground he argues directly to the necessary " fullness " and also the necessary invariability of the temporal world 's contents . But the paradox of that principle is more apparent in his philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this fact which has led certain expositors to the misinterpretation to which I have referred . From the eternal logical necessity belonging to an essence there is , in truth , no valid argument to any conclusion about existence in time . For time itself is alien to that necessity ; it is an alogical character of nature . Whatever is true of an essence is true of it all at once ; but what is true of the temporal world is not true of it all at once . Becoming and change , as such , simply do not fit into an eternal rational order . The attempt to pass over from that order to one in which some things have their being at one time , and quite other things at a later time , is a non-sequitur , and worse ; but this was required by the principle of plenitude ? was most  | clearly of all so required when that principle was regarded as an implicate of the principle of sufficient reason . If a literal realization of all genuine possibles is essential to a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every event should have occurred , from all eternity , in a totum simul ; but nature is not a totum simul . What makes this paradox more apparent in Spinoza is the fact that the notion of species plays , as a rule , no such part in his system as it does in many others equally committed to the same principle . As frequently interpreted , the " fullness " of the universe was sufficiently realized if every kind of being was always exemplified in the temporal order ; species , not individuals , were the units for which Nature cared . But Spinoza usually leaps at once from the divine attributes or the " infinite modes " to individuals existing at one time and not at others , and in differing numbers at different times . That , in this sense , nature is not constant , nor constantly " full , " was evident ; and Spinoza therefore , while asserting the principle of plenitude , was driven into inevitable and glaring inconsistencies in his application of it . An increasing realization of this difficulty we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radical reinterpretation of the principle . Spinoza had thus expressed the principle of plenitude in its most uncompromising form and had represented it as necessary in the strict logical sense . Everything shared in the same completely sufficient reason for being that the existence of God was by most philosophers conceived to possess . But Spinoza ( unlike Bruno ) had not made a great deal of the aspect of the principle of plenitude which was to be most fruitful of consequences in the eighteenth century ; what most interested him in his own doctrine was not the consideration that everything that logically can be must and will be , but the consideration that everything that is must , by the eternal logical nature of things , have been , and have been precisely as it is . It was this consequence of his dialectic , the sense of the utter inevitability ( amounting to the ultimate inconceivability of the opposite ) of every characteristic and every vicissitude of human life , that was most congenial to his own moral temper and seemed to him most fitted to free men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity rendered teleological ways of thinking about things inadmissible ; since nothing could conceivably have been otherwise , nothing could be said to manifest purpose or preference , a choice of good where evil , or a lesser good , might have been genuinely possible ; hence these very distinctions lost their meaning . The alternative view , that there is only one point at which a reason for existence can be found in the realm of essence , was represented by a great body of philosophical and theological opinion , both before and after Spinoza . According to this view , while there is , indeed , an ens necessarium , the being which necessarily exists is itself a pure Will , a power to choose independently not only of external causes but also of rational motives . To make the divine will subject even to the constraint of reason would be to deny its freedom and its sovereignty over all lesser things . Hence the existence of God involved no necessity that the world of finite beings should exist . The more extreme and consistent form of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , to share the privilege of existence with other beings , could be held to belong to the essence of deity . This thesis had , indeed , a double historic root . It was primarily a manifestation of that apotheosis of irresponsible will which constituted one side , though only one side , of the orthodox theology of Christendom . It could also be deduced from one of those two conflicting Platonic conceptions of God which were the heritage of what is called Christian theology . If the essence of deity was the same as the Idea of the Good , if the differentiating attribute of the Absolute Reality was self-sufficiency , God , even though he did create a world , could have no reason for doing so . Nothing in his essential nature made it necessary or desirable for him to bring a universe of imperfect beings into existence . The creative act must therefore be conceived to be entirely groundless and arbitrary in itself , and therefore in its inclusions and exclusions . As Duns Scotus , or a follower of his , declared , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , since from them the creatures nothing is added to his goodness , any more than the addition of point to a line lengthens the line . " 22 Thus from medieval as well as Greek philosophy it had come  | down as an axiom that nothing could be more contradictory of the very notion of deity than to admit that anything in the existence of such a being is dependent upon , or in any degree affected for better or worse by , the existence or action of any being conceived as distinct from it . Perhaps the most extraordinary triumph of self-contradiction , among many such triumphs in the history of human thought , was the fusion of this conception of a self-absorbed and self-contained Perfection ? of that Eternal Introvert who is the God of Aristotle ? at once with the Jewish conception of a temporal Creator and busy interposing Power making for righteousness through the hurly-burly of history , and with primitive Christianity 's conception of a God whose essence is forthgoing love and who shares in all the griefs of his creatures.23 When applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this syncretism which here concerns us ? the doctrine of the self-sufficiency of deity implied , as we have already seen , that from the divine ? that is , from the final and absolute ? point of view a created world is a groundless superfluity . The existence of creatures , as Augustine had said , " is a good which could in no way profit God " ; and therefore , he had added , the question why God chose to create is a self-contradictory as well as impious one , since it seeks for a cause for that primary act of sheer will which is the cause of all other things 24 ? except certain other acts of sheer will permitted certain of the creatures . For Augustine , and a long line of successors , the PlatonicAristotelian conception of the self-sufficiency of deity thus became an essential safeguard against the doctrine of universal necessity . If the world-generating act had been determined by any motive , had had any ground even in the divine essence , it would not have been free ; but since any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its freedom could not be doubted . The connection of the two ideas was summed up by Augustine in a neat sorites which played a great part in European thought for many centuries : ubi nulla indigentia , nulla necessitas ; ubi nullus defectus , nulla indigentia ; nullus autem defectus in Deo ; ergo nulla necessitas.25 Two potent elements in the philosophical tradition , then ? the Platonic and Aristotelian apotheosis of self-sufficiency and  | the Augustinian insistence upon the primacy of will in the constitution of reality ? both alike could be construed as implying that the being which necessarily exists , though it has in fact generated other beings , did so by an essentially motiveless , unaccountable , and therefore accidental ? and , indeed , incongruous ? exercise of its freedom . Upon this theorem the changes are rung interminably by seventeenth- and eighteenthcentury philosophers and divines . Descartes is especially insistent upon it : God must have been tout- ? I-fait indi$erent 1 crier les choses qu'il a creees . For if some reason , or some appearance of good , had preceded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to create what was best ; but , on the contrary , because he determined to make the things that are actually in the world , for this reason they are , as it is written in Genesis , very good ' ; that is , the reason of their goodness depends upon the fact that he willed to make them.26 For Descartes this dependence of things upon the Absolute Will extended , not merely to their existence , but to their essences or natures . ' There is nothing in the essence triangle ' which makes it intrinsically necessary that the sum of the interior angles of such a figure should be equal to two right angles , nothing in the nature of number which requires that two and two should make four . What to us appear as " eternal truths " are in reality " determined solely by the will of God , who , as sovereign legislator , has ordained and established them from all eternity . " 27 So far , at least , as existence is concerned this same consequence is deduced from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bishop Pearson 's Exposition of the Creed ( 1659 ) declares that God is in respect of all external actions absolutely free without the least necessity . . . . Those creatures which are endued with understanding , and consequently with a will , may not only be necessitated in their actions by a greater power , but also as necessarily be determined by the proposal of an infinite good ; whereas neither of these necessities can be acknowledged in God 's actions , without supposing a power beside and above Omnipotency , or a real happiness beside and above All-Sufficiency . Indeed , if God were a necessary agent in the works of creation , the creatures would be of as necessary being as he is ; whereas the necessity of being is the undoubted prerogative of the First Cause 28  | This was equivalent to saying that the only way of escape from such a philosophy as Spinoza 's ? then still to be published ? lay in holding that God had no reason in his creative activity and could not possibly derive any satisfaction from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes sound like echoes of classical passages setting forth the Epicurean conception of the " careless gods " ; when Ronsard , for example , hymns the " goddess Eternity " in a strange mixture of pagan and Christian imagery , one is reminded as much of Lucretius as of Aristotle . La premiere des Dieux , ou bien loin de souci Et de l'humain travail qui nous tourmente ici , Par toi-meme contente et par toi bienheureuse , Tu regnes immortelle en tout bien plantureuse 29 But when Drummond of Hawthornden rewrote Ronsard 's hymn in English and converted it into a finer and more consistent piece of Christian Platonism , he retained this passage , but elaborated it and gave it further point , by bringing the notion of self-sufficiency into conjunction with that of creation : No joy , no , nor perfection to Thee came By the contriving of this world 's great frame ; Ere sun , moon , stars , began their restless race , Ere paint 'd with purple clouds was Heaven 's round face , Ere air had clouds , ere clouds weept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth bore flowers , Thou happy lived ; World nought to Thee supplied . All in Thy self Thy self Thou satisfied ' ? The question , disapproved by Augustine , to which such a conception nevertheless perennially gave rise , 31 was pointedly expressed by a late seventeenth-century Platonist , John Norris : since God is ... In himself compendiously blest , . . . ... Is one unmov 'd self-center 'd Point of Rest , Why , then , if full of bliss that ne'er could cloy , Would he do ought but still enjoy ? Why not indulge his self-sufficing state , Live to Himself at large , calm and secure , A wise eternal Epicure ?  | Why six days work , to frame A monument of praise and fame To him whose bliss is still the same ? What need the wealthy coin , or he that 's blest , create ? 32 Milton in this matter , as in others , is an interesting example of a mind beset by cross-currents ; but in the main it was towards the assertion of the arbitrariness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejects at times the extreme nominalistic doctrine of Descartes ; the essences of things , and the truths concerning the intrinsic relations of essences , are logically prior to any will , so that not even God could alter them ; thus he declared in the Treatise of Christian Doctrine that " a certain immutable and internal necessity of acting right , independently of all extraneous influence whatever , may exist in God conjointly with the most perfect liberty , both which principles in the divine nature tend to the same point . " Yet this , Milton evidently felt , inclined too much to determinism ; for a little later he asserted virtually the opposite : it can not be " admitted that the actions of God are themselves , Ij necessary , but only that he has a necessary existence , for Scripture itself testifies that his decrees and therefore his actions , of what kind soever they be , are perfectly free . " n And the consideration of the divine self-sufficiency leads Milton to give especial emphasis to the motivelessness of the deity 's exercise of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theological sense in which goodness consists in the actual conferring of existence upon other beings . His " goodness was free to act or not . " s4 " Questionless , " we are told in the Christian Doc-trine , I'l it was in God 's power consistently with the perfection of his own essence not to have begotten the Son , inasmuch as generation does not pertain to the essence of Deity , who stands in no need of propagation ; 35 ? an observation repeated in Paradise Lost : No need that Thou Shouldst propagate , already infinite , And through all numbers absolute , though One . The implication of this , that there appeared to be in the nature of things not only no reason why any world of imperfect  | creatures should exist , but every reason why it should not exist , Adam almost makes explicit , when briefly expounding some points of theology to his Maker : Thou in Thyself art perfect and in Thee Is no deficience found ; . . . Thou in Thy secrecy although alone , Best with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a somewhat odd thing for Adam to say under the circumstances , it proves to have , in the poem , some dramatic motivation ; for this proleptic quotation from Aristotle 37 serves the human interlocutor as a polite opening for a reminder that he is not himself self-sufficient , and therefore needs a companion in Eden . But what is clearest about the passage is that Milton the theologian saw in this juncture of his narrative an opportunity to affirm once again that a selfabsorbed and unproductive God would be not less , but , if possible , more divine , and that there is no necessity and , indeed , no reason for the existence of any creature . Milton 's zeal for this thesis is the more curious because his theology here seems out of harmony with his ethical creed and moral temper.38 As recent writers have pointed out , he was no Puritan rigorist , but in many respects a typical mind of the humanistic Renaissance , delighting in the splendor and diversity of the sensible world ; and the excellence of man did not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most distinctive of the divine attributes . It is not by an attempt to approximate or to become absorbed into the divine sufficiency through ascetic selfdiscipline , the cultivation of a contemptus mundi , or a withdrawal from those Relations dear and all the charities Of father , son , and brother , that man attains his good . " Propagation , " indeed , was the first of duties imposed upon man by a deity himself represented as only tardily , unessentially , and ( relatively to his possibilities ) meagrely propagative : Our Maker bids increase , who bids abstain But our Destroyer , foe to God and man ?  | Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection , and beget Like of his like , his image multiplied , In unity defective , which requires Collateral love and dearest amity.3s There were thus in the thought of Milton some significant and instructive internal strains , characteristic not only of the man but of the historic juncture in which he lived . But our present concern is only with one element in this complex of mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal elaborating upon the same ancient theme ? now with Spinoza definitely in mind as the chief representative of the error to be attacked . No doubt , the Archbishop of Cambrai grants , it may be said to be " plus parfait a un etre d'etre fecond que de ne 1'etre pas " ; " I but it does not follow that the divine perfection requires " an actual production . " The possession of a power is sufficient without the exercise of it ? a strange proposition , but one to which Fenelon was driven as the only escape from Spinoza 's 1argument that an omnipotent being must also of necessity be omnificent . This theological paradox was apparently rendered more plausible to Fenelon by the undeniable truth that , though the gift of speech presumably makes human beings Any other view than this would make " the creature essential to the Creator , " an indispensable part or aspect of his being . He " more perfect , " their perfection is not necessarily proportional to their use of that faculty : " il arrive meme souvent que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is , then , nothing on the side of the divine essence which necessitates the generation of everything , or even of anything : " nothing is more false than to say that God was obliged by that order which is himself to produce all that he could that is most perfect . " As little can it be said that there is anything on the side of the finite essences which could constitute a reason for their being : If God considers the essences of things , he finds therein no determination to existence ; he finds only that they are not impossible to his power . . . . Thus it is in his positive will that he finds their existence ; for as to their essence , it contains in itself no reason or cause of existing ; on the contrary , it necessarily contains in itself non-existence.40  | would " produce eternally and of necessity , " and so would have no freedom ? and no long ante-mundane sabbath ; and the ens perfectissimum would be , not a God above the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finite beings conceived as the expression of this fundamental generative necessity.41 These reasonings of a priori theology were doubtless somewhat elusive to many minds even in the seventeenth and the early eighteenth century ; but the same conclusion could be defended on more empirical grounds . It could be argued that ? whether or not there be any inherent disposition to create in the divine essence ? at all events the actual scope and specific contents of the created world give evidence of the arbitrariness of the choice of its Author . Samuel Clarke , for example , develops at some length the contention that the universe is full of facts which can not be reconciled with Spinoza 's doctrine ? i. e. , which are not necessary ' in the sense required . All things in the world appear plainly to be the most arbitrary that can be imagined . . . . Motion itself , and all its quantities and directions , with the laws of gravitation , are entirely arbitrary , and might possibly have been altogether different from what they are now . The number and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nature of the things themselves . . . . Everything upon the Earth is still more evidently arbitrary , and plainly the product , not of necessity but will . What absolute necessity for just such a number of species of animals or plants ? 42 In such a doctrine , obviously , the principle of plenitude had no proper place ( though sometimes , as by Archbishop King , the two were inconsistently combined ) . That principle ostensibly gave certain important a priori knowledge about the constitution of the world of existents , though it was supposed to be also capable of empirical confirmation . But the anti-rationalistic theology which insisted upon the arbitrariness of the di . vine decrees had affinities rather with scientific empiricism Since such matters as the number of species , the continuity of discontinuity of the differences between them , the quantity anc original distribution of matter , the existence or non-existence of vacua , are purely arbitrary , the facts respecting them mus be ascertained through experience or remain unknown . It was therefore natural that the philosophic poets whc  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even rational constraint should reject the principle of plenitude and its implications . Drummond of Hawthornden , for example , is at pains to declare explicitly that there is an infinite number of Ideas which never are actualized , since God does not so choose ; in the Hymn to the Fairest Fair Truth is pictured as standing before the throne of Heaven holding a mirror Where shineth all that was , That is , or shall be ; here , ere ought was wrought , Thou knew all that Thy pow'r with Time forth-brought , And more , things numberless that Thou couldst make , That actually shall never being take . Milton likewise seems to have been as antipathetic to the principle of plenitude as to that of sufficient reason , and makes no use of it for his theodicy , either in Paradise Lost or in the Treatise of Christian Doctrine . The notion of a hierarchical scale of nature is , indeed , not lacking , and the law of continuity is clearly expressed . All things are composed of One first matter all , Indu 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in things that live , of life ; But more refin 'd , more spiritous , and pure , As nearer to him plac 'd , or nearer tending , Each in their several active spheres assign 'd , Till body up to spirit work in bounds Proportion 'd to each kind . . . 43 . . . . Flowers and their fruit , Man 's nourishment , by gradual scale sublimed , To vital spirits aspire , to animal , To intellectual , give both life and sense , Fancy and understanding , whence the soul Reason receives.44 There are passages in which the poet dilates upon the magnitude and variety of the sensible world ; and in the prose treatise he repeats without qualification the pregnant scholastic maxim that " entity is good , non-entity not good . " 45 But the general view which he adopted forbade him to suppose that all possible forms necessarily exist or even tend to exist . On the contrary , the original act of creation was not merely belated but also ex-  | tremely restricted . How little the dialectic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most clearly shown by his adoption of the doctrine of Jerome and of Origen ? which Thomas Aquinas and Dante had expressly rejected 4 ( ? according to which the creation was at first confined to " heavenly essences , " spiritual or ethereal natures . It was only after the disappointing behavior of many of this highest order of possible creatures that the Supreme Being ( whose self-sufficiency here seems quite completely forgotten ) , by second intention , bethought himself of the possibility of " repairing that detriment " by the creation of " another world , " including the earth and man and its other inhabitants ? In other words , by calling into being a certain number of possibles of a lower order.47 In the next generation the principle of plenitude was more explicitly assailed in stodgy verse by Blackmore in his Creation ( I712 ) : Might not other animals arise Of diff'rent figure and of diff'rent size ? In the wide womb of possibility Lie many things which ne'er may actual be : And more productions of a various kind Will cause no contradiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these quick rotations show Things from necessity could never flow , But must to mind and choice precarious beings owe.46 It is , then , chiefly in its connection with these preoccupa ? tions of Leibniz 's predecessors and contemporaries , and witl .. their conflicting doctrines concerning the relation of the worlc of finite existents to the logical order of essences constitutin ? the primary object of the divine intellect , that his principle o sufficient reason is historically to be understood . The principlh was , first of all , an affirmation of the fundamental proposition common to Spinoza and to most of those who in nearly al other respects were in complete disagreement with that phi losopher ? the proposition that there is at least one being whose essence necessarily and directly implies existence . Thi ontological argument , in short , is for Leibniz a part of the lav of sufficient reason ? a fact well recognized in the eighteentl  | 11 century . It is because that law is valid that we are entitled to ask , as the first question in metaphysics ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist rather than nothing ? For nothing ' is simpler and easier than something . " Now this sufficient reason of the existence of the universe can not be found in the series of contingent truths . . . . The sufficient reason which has no need of any other reason must be outside the sequence of contingent things , and must be a necessary being , else we should not have a sufficient reason with which we could stop.49 Here , then , the " sufficient reason " is nothing less than a logical necessity believed to be inherent in an essence ; it is specifically in this sense that Leibniz speaks of God as the ultima ratio rerum . But the principle further means for Leibniz that the existence of all , finite things must likewise in some manner be grounded in the rational order of Ideas and their implications ? in the world of possibles which , as it was commonly phrased , God had present to him " before the creation . " Here Leibniz is still at one with Spinoza , who , he observes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God is indifferent and that he decrees things by an absolute act of will . " 50 If there were so much as a single fact in nature which had its cause in a fiat not wholly determined by rational grounds , the world would eo ipso be an affair of " blind chance . " 51 And chance becomes no more satisfactory to the philosopher as a category for describing the ultimate constitution of reality by being piously called God . The supposition , exemplified in so many of Leibniz 's contemporaries , that the number of existents in general , or of the members of any given class of them ? of atoms , or of monads , or ( what was the purely theological form of the same difficulty ) of the elect ? constitutes a small selection from among the possibles , is not , to Leibniz , rendered less obnoxious by the supposition of a Selector , if his foible for that particular numeral is assumed to If the will of God did not have for a rule the principle of the best , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all ; or else it would be in some fashion indifferent to good and evil and guided by chance . But a will which always allowed itself to act by chance would scarcely be of more be itself fortuitous , a reasonless eccentricity of Omnipotence.  | value for the government of the universe than a fortuitous concourse of atom with no God at all . And even if God should abandon himself to chance onl in some cases and some respects , . . . he would be imperfect , as would th object of his choice ; he would not deserve to be wholly trusted ; he woul act without reason in those cases , and the government of the universe woul be like certain games , half a matter of chance , half of reason.62 In all this Leibniz was continuing the tradition of Platonisti rationalism in theology which during the previous half-centur had been best represented by the Cambridge Platonists , ti whose doctrine his own is also in many other points ver similar . Henry More , for example , had written in 1647 : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will , and not because it 's good , So that his actions will have no set measure , Is ' t possible it should be understood What he intends ? . . . Nor of well-being , nor of subsistency Of our poor souls when they do hence depart , Can any be assur 'd , if liberty We give to such odd thoughts , that thus pervert The laws of God , and rashly do assert That will rules God , but Good rules not God 's will . Why anyone should think it an enhancement of the dignit of either God or man to act , or even to be capable of acting without a determining reason , is to Leibniz , as it was to hi Platonistic precursors , wholly incomprehensible ; " it is a para dox to represent as a perfection the least reasonable thing in a. the world , of which the advantage would consist in bein privileged against reason . " Such a character as Clarke an King had ascribed to the First Cause might perhaps be aura uted by a poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concei ' ably , some " homme romanesque might affect the appearance of and even persuade himself that he actually possesses it ; bt there never will be found in nature any choice to which one not brought by an antecedent representation of good and bat by inclinations or by reasons . " 54 The freedom of indifferent , in short , " is impossible , but if there were such a thing , would be harmful . " If we leave for a moment the question of the meaning of th aspect of the principle of sufficient reason for Leibniz , and co  | sider the grounds of his faith in it , they appear , as in the passage last cited , to be chiefly two . Partly , he presents it as a sort of axiomatic proposition in psychology : just as all physical events must have efficient causes , so all conscious choices must have motivating reasons ; and these reasons must lie in the apparent values inherent in the objects chosen . This proposition , then , is for Leibniz an " eternal truth " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any source of determination , implies contradiction . . . . It is metaphysically necessary that there be some such cause . " 55 But at bottom Leibniz , like More , adopts the principle , it is evident , for reasons which may , in one sense of a highly ambiguous term , be called pragmatic . The conception of the world we live in which would follow from the rejection of the principle was intolerable to such a mind as his . It meant placing Caprice on the throne of the universe ? under however venerable a title . It implied that Nature , having no determining reason in it , flouts and baffles the reason that is in man . A world where chance-happening had so much as a foothold would have no stability or trustworthiness ; uncertainty would infect the whole ; anything ( except , perhaps , the self-contradictory ) might exist and anything might happen , and no one thing would be in itself even more probable than any other . Such a hypothesis was not one which Leibniz could entertain if any alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestionably have seemed to him a practically indispensable postulate if he had not believed it to be a logically necessary truth.55 There was , however , it may be noted in passing , one rather awkward consequence of the proposition that God can do nothing without a reason . This difficulty Samuel Clarke effectively pressed home in his controversy with Leibniz . The celebrated ass of Buridan , being , by hypothesis , a perfectly rational ass , was unable to choose between two equally large and equally appetizing bales of hay equidistant from his nose ; having no sufficient reason for preferring one to the other , the sagacious animal starved to death in the midst of plenty . Clarke pointed out , in substance , that Leibniz attributed to his Maker precisely such an irrational excess of rationality . There presumably confront even omnipotence , Clarke suggested ,  | some situations in which it is desirable to choose one or the other of two alternatives , though there is no reason why one should be chosen rather than the other . In these situations , then , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act at all . Leibniz was unable to deny that , if there are any such situations , this consequence must follow from his premises . ' T is a thing indifferent to place three bodies , equal and perfectly alike , in any order whatsoever ; and consequently they never will be placed in any order by Him who does nothing without wisdom . But Leibniz adds that there can not be , in any possible world , such a perfect balance of values between any two alternatives . 67 This assertion was manifestly difficult to prove and , on the face of it , highly improbable . Leibniz was involved in this embarrassment by that excessively simple and quasi-mechanical conception of volition , which , as we have seen , was one of the senses which the principle of sufficient reason had for him . Where there was no preponderance of value in one contemplated object rather than another , an intelligent agent would be as powerless to move as a piece of matter in an equilibrium of forces . But this was not the significant essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proposition that where there is an actual difference between possibles , that which by its own nature has the greater reason for existing must necessarily be created by God . Thus far Leibniz 's argument seems to place him on the side of Spinoza , as against the critics of that philosopher . The primary being exists by a logical necessity ; it is also necessary that all the things derivative from it should have " reasons " for existence lying in its nature and in their own ; and this might seem to mean that all things follow ex necessitate divinae naturae and that the existent universe is just such a system as Spinoz2 had represented ? logically inevitable in its least detail , sc that no alternative could ever have been so much as conceivec by an infinite intellect . From this consequence , however Leibniz professed to have found a way of escape . Tempera mentally wishful , like many other philosophers , to eat his cak and have it too , he conceived that his position was as effectu ally differentiated from Spinoza 's cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological or in its naturalistic or Epicurean form ? of a chance-world ; and the original and distinctive thing in his formulation of the principle of sufficient reason seemed to him to consist precisely in its indication of a third possible view opposed to both these extremes . His attempted differentiation of his position from Spinoza 's rested upon two points . ( a ) In Spinoza , the divine reason allowed the divine will no option , and , indeed , there was no distinction between them . Such a view seemed to Leibniz objectionable , partly for reasons similar to those indicated in passages already cited from other writers . He too , at least at times , desired a God who might be said to possess a will , and not merely an intellect consisting in an infinity of automatically self-realizing essences ; and to him too Spinoza 's metaphysics appeared to exclude the possibility of any moral philosophy . But he had also a special reason of his own for rejecting this feature of Spinozism ? a reason which at the same time , as he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leibniz observes , failed to see that existence must be limited not only to the possible , in the logical sense , but also to the compossible ; i. e. , that any actual world must be made up of entities which , besides being consistent with themselves , are also compatible with one another . And although , in the world of essences , all simple , positive natures ' find a place without conflict , when the world of concrete existents is considered not all combinations are possible . Essences , therefore , conceived as materials for translation into existence , come in sets , each set excluding some essences , but including all that form one compossible group . When this is borne in mind , Leibniz argues , it becomes apparent that there not only may but must have been a selection , namely , of one of those sets , and therewith the exclusion of all that did not belong to it , before any world of concrete existents could arise at all ; in theological terms , that the divine Reason before the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leibniz tells us , with an infinite number ? of models of worlds , any one , but only one , of which could conceivably be created . An act of choice is thus seen to be a logically necessary implicate of the very idea of an existent world . It seems to follow that the principle of plenitude does not hold  | for Leibniz in the same absolute sense as for Spinoza : " the question utrum detur vacuum formarum , i. e. , whether there are species which are possible but nevertheless do not exist " must be answered ( subject to a large qualification presently to be noted ) in the affirmative ; " there necessarily are species which never have existed and never will exist , since they are not compatible with the series of creatures which God has chosen . " 58 In his discovery of this notion of compossibility Leibniz took great pride , but it has no definite meaning until we know what the criterion of compossibility is supposed to be ; and about this he has little to say , and that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admits that no statement of that criterion can be given : It is not yet known to men from what the incompossibility of different things arises or how it comes about that different essences are opposed to one another , since all purely positive terms appear to be compatible inter seas Some hints of an explanation , however , are elsewhere discoverable ; and there is some , if not altogether conclusive , textual justification for Russell 's suggestion that the criterion of cornpossibility for Leibniz lay in an assumed necessity that any possible world should be subject to uniform laws . If a world , for example , is to contain motion , then there must also be for it invariable laws of motion . In some possible world , the law of inverse squares will be one of these laws ; and for that world , though not for other possible ones , any arrangement or movement of matter not in accordance with the Newtonian formula will be incompossible . Thus , in Russell 's phrase , " what is called the reign of law ' is metaphysically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be Leibniz 's meaning , he neither states it unequivocally nor gives it any detailed application or illustration . What , however , seems plain is that compossibility does not differ in principle from possibility , in the traditional philosophical sense of the latter term ; it is merely a special case of it . No truths concerning compossibility are contingent , but all inhere in the logical natures of the essences concerned . In short , both the make-up of each world and the limitation of the possibility of actualization to some one  | of them were among the necessities subsisting eternally in the realm of Ideas , antecedently to the choice of a particular one among the worlds to be the recipient of the privilege of existence . ( b ) Consequently , Leibniz 's introduction of the notion of compossibility did not of itself , as he sometimes seems to have supposed , essentially differentiate his principle of sufficient reason from Spinoza 's universal necessity . It was merely a refinement or elaboration upon the familiar conception of " possibility , " which Spinoza could without inconsistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether anything , and if anything , what , necessitated the choice of the actually existent world from among the possibles . But here Leibniz propounded a further distinction by which he professed to escape decisively from the deadly reproach of Spinozism . In maintaining that the divine will must necessarily be determined by the most sufficient reason , and must therefore infallibly choose the one best out of the many possible worlds , he is not , he explains , asserting the " brutal , metaphysical necessity " of Spinoza , but a " moral necessity . " For the opposite , i. e. , the choice of one of the other worlds , would not be impossible in the metaphysical sense ; it would not imply contradiction . The will , according to the principle of sufficient reason , is " always more inclined to the alternative which it takes , but it is not under the necessity of taking it . It is certain that it will take it without its being necessary for it to do so . " Thus a residuum of contingency is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found for the freedom of the will of the First Cause.62 The distinction which Leibniz here attempts to set up is manifestly without logical substance ; the fact is so apparent that it is impossible to believe that a thinker of his powers can have been altogether unaware of it himself . Without abandoning all that is most essential in the principle of sufficient reason he could not possibly admit that a sufficient reason " inclines " the will without necessitating its choice , and least of all in the case of a will supposed to be enlightened by an infinite intelligence . The choice of any world other than the best would , according to propositions which Leibniz frequently and  | plainly lays down , be as inconsistent with the essence of deity as non-existence would be ; as Leibniz admits even in one of the passages in which he is endeavoring to persuade his readers that his universe contains a real margin of contingency , " chez le sage necessaire et du sont des chores equivalentes. " n " The author of the world is free " only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things determinately . " When Leibniz says that , upon his principles , the opposite to the actual choice would not involve self-contradiction he confuses two things . The mere concept of the existence of any of the inferior and non-existent worlds is , by the hypothesis , free from contradiction , if taken by itself , in abstraction from the principle of sufficient reason ; but it was absolutely impossible that it should be selected for existence , since this would contradict both the perfection of God and the very notion of voluntary choice , of which the principle of sufficient reason is an expression . Nor , of course , could it be consistently maintained by Leibniz that , though the divine will was necessitated to choose the best world , the bestness of that world was conferred upon it by some spontaneous preference , some free act of valuation , on the part of the chooser . To no doctrine was Leibniz more bitterly opposed than to this . For him value was purely objective , and valuing a strictly logical process . The existence justifying good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essences is one of its inherent properties , known , indeed , by the divine reason , but belonging to the realm of essential or metaphysical necessity which is prior to will and regulative of it . The worth of an object is involved in its Idea in precisely the same way in which divisibility by other whole numbers without a remainder is involved in the Ideas of certain whole numbers.64 If , then , God had pronounced any other world best , he would have contradicted himself as absolutely as if he had asserted that four is not a multiple of two ; in other words , both were equally impossible to him , and therefore the existence of any other scheme of things than the one which actually exists was from all eternity impossible . An absolute logical determinism , then , is as characteristic of the metaphysics of Leibniz as of that of Spinoza , though the  | reasons why it is are somewhat more complicated in the former case , and though Leibniz lacked the candor and courage to express the certain , and almost obvious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without obscuring it by misleading if edifying phraseology ? especially by the verbal distinction , absolutely meaningless in the light of his other doctrines , between " necessitating " and " infallibly inclining " reasons . The real meaning , in his system , of the principle of sufficient reason thus resolves itself into the proposition that the existence of everything that does exist , and also its attributes , behavior , and relations , are determined by a necessary truth , or a system of such truths . The reasonableness of the universe which the formula affirms is , as with Spinoza , of the same type as the reasonableness of a geometrical system ? as geometrical systems were conceived by seventeenth-century logic . This could hardly be more plainly and emphatically declared than it is by Leibniz himself in one of the most important of his shorter writings , On the Primary Origination of Things ( De rerum originatione radicali , 1697 ) . In reality we find that all things in the world take place ( fieri ) according to the laws of eternal truths , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only according to material but also to formal necessities ; and this is true not merely generally , with respect to the reason , already explained , why the world exists rather than does not exist and why it exists thus rather than otherwise ; but even when we descend to the details we see that metaphysical laws hold good in a wonderful manner in the entire universe . . . . Thus , then , we have the ultimate reason of the reality both of essences and existences in one being , which is necessarily greater than the world itself , and superior and antecedent to it.65 The same cosmical determinism is manifest in a logical thesis of Leibniz most plainly expressed in certain writings of his published only within the past fifty years . This thesis is that all contingent truths are ultimately reducible to a priori or necessary truths . We , no doubt , because of the limitations of our human understanding , can not , in many cases , accomplish this reduction ; the distinction between the necessary and the contingent expresses a genuine and persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to our minds . A judgment which appears to us as con-  | tingent could by itself be shown to be necessary ? i. e. , to be simply the expression of the essential meaning or " nature " of the notions contained in it ? only through an analysis of those notions which would proceed in infinitum and is therefore impossible to a finite mind . But though we are unable to attain an intuitive apprehension of the necessity , in the specific instance , we can nevertheless be sure that the necessity is there , and is recognized by the mind of God , who sees all the natures and their relations through and through in a single perfect intuition or scientia visionis . Unless thus ultimately reducible to necessity no proposition can , according to Leibniz , be true at all ; for the truth of a proposition can mean only " the inherence of its predicate in its subject " directly or indirectly , so that the subject would not be itself without that predicate.66 In other words , no judgment is true unless its opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a self-contradiction . And the equivalence of this proposition to the principle of sufficient reason is explicitly stated : the verite primitive que rien n'est sans raison is said to be synonymous with the proposition that " every truth has a proof a priori drawn from the notion of its terms , though it is not always in our power to carry through this analysis . " 6 ' Not only by its clear implications , then , but by some of the formal definitions of it , the principle of sufficient reason is with Leibniz equivalent to the Spinozistic doctrine of the eternal , quasigeometrical necessity of all things.68 The fact that Leibniz had failed to establish any essential difference between his " sufficient reason . " and Spinoza 's " necessity " was by no means unrecognized in the eighteenth century . It was pointed out at length , with perfectly sound arguments , by the Halle theologian Joachim Lange in his Modesta disquisitio , 1723 , and in numerous other writings against the philosophy of Wolff , the systematizer and popularizer of the Leibnitian doctrines . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nature of God as light is derived from the sun , and make it strictly essential to him and a part of his nature or necessary . " The only way.in which , on Leibnitian principles , anything could , without contradiction , be other than what it is , would be as a possibility in  | some other world which does not exist ; in the actual world , which is also , by the hypothesis , the only world which God could conceivably have willed , everything is determined with the same " fatal necessity " as in the system of the Jewish philosopher.69 A similar observation ? not , perhaps , in this case , implying real disapproval ? later found a place in the less orthodox pages of the Encyclopedie . To the immense reputation which Leibniz had in the middle of the century that work bears conclusive testimony ; it remarks that " he alone confers as much honor upon Germany as Plato , Aristotle , and Archimedes together conferred upon Greece . " 70 But , it asks : How can Messieurs Leibnits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the contingency of the universe ? Contingency implies an equal balance of possibilities . But what is more opposed to such a balance than the principle of sufficient reason ? It is , then , necessary to say that the world exists , not contingently , but by virtue of a sufficient reason ; and this might lead us to the verge of Spinozism . These philosophers attempt , to be sure , to escape this ; . . . but it remains true that the sufficient reason does not leave contingency unimpaired . The more a plan has reasons which require its existence , the less are alternative plans possible ? i.e. , the less can they set up claims to existence . . . . God is the source of all created monads , which have emanated from him by continual fulgurations . . . . Things can not be other than they are.71 The passage shows clearly that one , and perhaps the principal , tendency of Leibniz 's insistence upon his principle of sufficient reason ? commonly esteemed in the eighteenth century one of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal necessity and to diminish the horror of that hobgoblin which had so terrified even Leibniz himself , the metaphysics of Spinoza . But it may perhaps be suggested that , even though logical necessity is as absolute and pervasive in Leibniz 's universe as in Spinoza 's , there is still an essential difference between the two , in that for Leibniz the thing that is necessary is the realization of value ; in other words , that the principle of sufficient reason , though it declares that only one world could ever conceivably exist , adds that this one must be the best conceivable  --  an addition not to be found in Spinoza . If , however , we observe what the " good " is that Leibniz regards as the ground of the existence of any particular thing , or of the actual world  | as a whole , we shall see that even this difference is both less and other than it at first sight appears to be . We shall at the same time see the principle of sufficient reason in the act of passing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leibniz often says plainly enough , be only one ultimate reason why anything exists , namely , that its essence demands existence , and will inevitably attain it unless interfered with by a similar demand on the part of some other essence ; and the superiority of the actual world to all the other abstractly conceivable ones consists in the fact that in it this tendency of essences to exist is realized in a greater measure than in any of the others . An exigentia existentiae 72 is inherent in every essence ; nisi in ipsa essentiae natura quaedam ad existendum inclinatio esset , nihil existeret . A mere " possible " is a thing frustrate , uncompleted ; and therefore " every possible is characterized by a striving ( conatus ) towards existence , " and " may be said to be destined to exist , provided , that is , it is grounded in a necessary being actually existing . " True , as we have seen , not all possibles do attain existence , since the requirements of cornpossibility exclude some of them . But , with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence the principle of the ontological argument . He comes even nearer than Spinoza to doing so . Spinoza 's principal ( though not his only ) argument , it will be remembered , ran thus : given the Idea of one directly necessary being as a point d'appui , the existence of beings corresponding to all the other Ideas ( within the limits of possibility ) is equally necessary.73 With Leibniz the point d'appui seems superfluous . While he is usually careful to speak of the other existents as logically dependent upon the existence of God , his emphasis upon the inherency of the propensio ad existendum in each essence separately is frequently so unqualified that it becomes difficult to see wherein the dependence consists . The necessity with which God exists would seem to be merely one instance ? though the extreme instance ? of this generic attribute of essence . The certainty of the realization of the propension in the case of the divine essence is , perhaps , due only to its exemption from the requirements of compossibility ; it is an essence hors concours , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place in the real world.74 The issue of that  | struggle in the case of the other essences seems to be determined wholly by their properties , not by the attributes of God . Leibniz does not hesitate to represent the emergence of the actual from among the possible worlds as the result of a quasi-mechanical process in which the world carrying the greatest weight of potential being inevitably pushed through to actuality : 75 From the conflict of all the possibles demanding existence , this at once follows , that there exists that series of things by which as many of them as possible exist ; in other words , the maximal series of possibles . . . . And as we see liquids spontaneously and by their own nature gather into spherical drops , so in the nature of the universe the series which has the greatest capacity ( maxime capax ) exists.76 Leibniz wavers , it is true , between two possible ways of taking this notion of " maximal capacity . " He necessarily admitted a gradation among the essences , of which the graded scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , was the expression . And he not infrequently seems to imply that , because of their differing " degrees of perfection , " some essences may have a greater claim , or a more potent tendency , to existence than others . Thus the fullness of the actual world would be rather intensive than extensive ; it would be measured by the rank , or degrees of excellence , of its component members , and not merely by their number . The following passage illustrates this way of construing the notion : The sufficient reason for God 's choice can be found only in the fitness ( convenance ) or in the degrees of perfection that the several worlds possess , since each possible thing has the right to aspire to existence in proportion to the amount of perfection it contains in germ . " But though Leibniz , undeniably , often inclines to this sort of phraseology in the popular writings with which eighteenthcentury readers were most familiar , the view it suggests was not logically open to him , and is not in fact carried out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it be assumed that the essence man " contained in germ " many times the " amount of perfection " attaching to the essence crocodile , and if it be further assumed ( as by Leibniz it is ) that the rules of compossibility forbid that two bodies should occupy the same space , then it would seem , according to the passage last  | cited , that a world containing only men and no crocodiles would be better than one containing both , since the crocodiles would certainly require matter and occupy space which might be devoted to the uses of human beings . But this is precisely the conclusion which Leibniz does not draw . As the author of a theodicy he is concerned to justify crocodiles ; he must show that the principle of sufficient reason requires that ? once more , within the limits of compossibility ? these creatures and all the other possible links in the Chain of Being , down to the lowest , shall really exist . What may , then , be called his actual working theory on the subject is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To say that some essences have an inclination to exist and others do not , is to say something without reason , since existence seems to be universally related to every essence in the same manner . " 78 And the superiority of the actual world consists in the number of different essences ? in other words , in the variety of types ? realized in it , not in their metaphysical rank or qualitative excellence . " Perfection is to be placed in form i. e. , as the context shows , in quantity of forms , or variety ; whence it follows that matter is not everywhere uniform , but is diversified by assuming different forms ; otherwise , as much variety as possible would not be realized . . . . It follows likewise that that series prevailed through which there could arise the greatest possibility of thinking of things as distinct ( distincta cogitabilitas ) . " 79 " The actual universe is the collection of the possibles qui forment le plus riche compose . " 80 " We must say , " writes Leibniz to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that he can " ; and it is precisely for this reason that the laws of nature are as simple as possible ; by means of such laws God was able " to find room for as many things as it is possible to place together . If God had made use of other laws , it would be as if one should construct a building of round stones , which leave more space unoccupied than that which they fill . " 81 Thus even the scientific assumption that the simplest explanatory hypothesis is always to be preferred appeared to Leibniz ? though the connection is hard to follow ? as a corollary of the principle of plenitude . The " good , " then , for the sake of which , and by reason of  | which , things exist , is simply existence itself ? the actualization of essence ; and the world that in the eternal nature of things was necessitated to be , was the world in which " the quantity of existence is as great as possible . " 82 Thus the difference between Leibniz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches the vanishing point . There are , of course , in Leibniz plenty of passages dilating in the conventional way upon the evidences of design in nature , the " fitness " of everything to everything else , and to man 's advantage , in particular.83 But his fundamental view , expressed in his most methodical and comprehensive summaries of his doctrine , was that each thing exists , not primarily for the sake of other things , not as an instrument to an ulterior good , but because its essence , like every essence , had its own underivative right to existence . And since this is realized ( so far as it is possible ) by logical necessity , and since its realization differs from what Spinoza had represented as following ex necessitate divinae naturae only by the limitations inherent in the rule of incompossibility , the metaphysical outcome of the two arguments is still essentially the same . Nevertheless , the difference between the Leibnitian and Spinozistic ways of putting what was , in logical substance , the same fundamental metaphysics , was historically important . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of plenitude , being necessary , can not properly be called either good or bad , Leibniz declared that , while necessary , it is also supremely good ; he thereby gave to that principle ( without qualification ) the status of a doctrine about value as well as ( with a qualification ) that of a doctrine about the constitution of reality . Spinoza , as we have seen , appears more interested in the thought of the necessity of the universe than in the thought of its plenitude . Leibniz was genuinely interested in both aspects of this dialectic ; but he was also somewhat afraid of the cosmic determinism to which it led him , while in the notion of the cosmic " fullness " he took , and he tended to impart to his readers , a lively imaginative and emotional satisfaction . The qualification to which the principle of plenitude was subject when taken as a generalization about reality did not ,  | in the concrete application of Leibniz 's metaphysics to questions lying within the purview of natural science , prove to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vacuum formarum , i. e. , of the non-existence of some possibles , it was a vacuum lying wholly outside the particular series of forms which defines the world that actually exists . Within this world no gaps of any sort could be admitted ; Leibniz had a horror vacui which he was certain that Nature shared . In its internal structure the universe is a plenum , and the law of continuity , the assumption that " nature makes no leaps , " can with absolute confidence be applied in all the sciences , from geometry to biology and psychology . " If one denied it , the world would contain hiatuses , which would overthrow the great principle of sufficient reason and compel us to have recourse to miracles or pure chance in the explanation of phenomena . " What this means , of course , is that since the general types of entity actually found in the world must obviously be possible and compossible , and since ( as Leibniz somewhat uncritically assumes ) all species of those types must be equally possible , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arbitrary , which is to say a fortuitous , exclusion of a possible from existence ? the inconceivability of which to Leibniz needs no further exposition.84 The principle of plenitude , and that of continuity as a special form of it , involve him in some embarrassment when he comes to consider the two questions of the existence of matter and of the possibility of physical vacua , the latter a topic still much debated among physicists during his lifetime . In some passages he comes near to deducing from these principles , as Archbishop King had done , a proof of physical realism.85 God must have created real matter , since if he had not , there would be not only an unrealized possibility of existence , but also a lack of coherency in things : " if there were only minds , they would be without the necessary connection with one another ( liaison ) , without the order of times and places . " This order " demands matter and motion and the laws of motion . " And if there is to be any matter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no empty spaces where matter might have been but is not . Leibniz therefore vehemently attacked  | the physical vacuists . But on the other hand , he found reasons , which it is not needful to set forth here , 88 for concluding that space is merely the " order of coexistences , " a form in which entities not really extended appear sensibly to one another ; and with this the material world , as conceived by ordinary physical realism , goes by the board , and material bodies are reduced to the equivocal status already mentioned . The principle of plenitude , in short , here comes into conflict with certain other dialectical motives which played an important part in Leibniz 's thought , and , at this particular point , gets the worst of it.87 When , from this point of view , he still continues to criticize the believers in the vacuum , it is not because they hold that empty spaces exist somewhere , but because they hold that real spaces exist at all.88 Meanwhile , of the reality of which matter is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds good literally ; nature is everywhere teeming with life , all of it accompanied with some degree of sentiency . " There is , " Leibniz writes in the Monadology , " nothing fallow , nothing sterile , nothing dead in the universe " ; and again elsewhere : " If there were a vacuum , it is evident that there would be left sterile and fallow places in which , nevertheless , without prejudice to any other things , something might have been produced . But it is not consistent with wisdom that any such places should be left . " 89 " In every particle of the universe a world composed of an infinity of creatures is contained . " 90 But , as the metaphysical argument already outlined implies , it is not of mere quantity or numbers that Nature is thus insatiably avid ; it is essentially the maximization of diversity that she seeks , the multiplication of species and sub-species and differing individuals to the limit of logical possibility . " Just as there is no vacuum in the varieties of the corporeal world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 91 Some notable consequences drawn from this aspect of the principle of plenitude in the eighteenth century we shall observe in later lectures .  | IT WAS in the eighteenth century that the conception of the universe as a Chain of Being , and the principles which underlay this conception ? plenitude , continuity , gradation ? attained their widest diffusion and acceptance . This at first seems somewhat strange . That a group of ideas which owed its genesis to Plato and Aristotle and its systematization to the Neoplatonists should have had so belated a fruition may well appear surprising ? especially as there was much in the intellectual fashions of ( roughly ) the first three quarters of the century which seemed inimical to these assumptions . Aristotle 's authority had , of course , long since been lost . Scholasticism and its methods were , among those who plumed themselves on their " enlightenment , " usually objects of contempt and ridicule . The faith in speculative a priori metaphysics was waning , and the Baconian temper ( if not precisely the Baconian procedure ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in science , and was an object of fervent enthusiasm among a large part of the general educated public . And the notion of the Chain of Being , with the assumptions on which it rested , was obviously not a generalization derived from experience , nor was it , in truth , easy to reconcile with the known facts of nature . Nevertheless there has been no period in which writers of all sorts ? men of science and philosophers , poets and popular essayists , deists and orthodox divines ? talked so much about the Chain of Being , . or accepted more implicitly the general scheme of ideas connected with it , or more boldly drew from these their latent implications , or apparent implications . Addison , King , Bolingbroke , Pope , Haller , Thomson , Akenside , Buffon , Bonnet , Goldsmith , Diderot , Kant , Lambert ,  | Herder , Schiller ? all these and a host of lesser writers not only expatiated upon the theme but drew from it new , or previously evaded , consequences ; while Voltaire and Dr. Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack upon the whole conception . Next to the word Nature , " the Great Chain of Being ' was the sacred phrase of the eighteenth century , playing a part somewhat analogous to that of the blessed word evolution ' in the late nineteenth . It was , probably , not chiefly to any direct influence of Greek or medieval philosophy that the conception owed its vogue in the eighteenth century . For it had been insisted upon by both of the two philosophers of the late seventeenth whose reputation and influence were greatest in the ensuing fifty years . Locke was not less explicit , though he was less exuberant , than Leibniz in repeating the ancient theses : In all the visible corporeal world we see no chasms or gaps . All quite down from us the descent is by easy steps , and a continued series that in each remove differ very little one from the other . There are fishes that have wings and are not strangers to the airy region ; and there are some birds that are inhabitants of the water , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are animals so near of kin both to birds and beasts that they are in the middle between both . Amphibious animals link the terrestrial and aquatic together ; . . . not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids or sea-men . There are some brutes that seem to have as much reason and knowledge as some that are called men ; and the animal and vegetable kingdoms are so nearly joined , that if you will take the lowest of one and the highest of the other , there will scarce be perceived any great difference between them ; and so on until we come to the lowest and the most unorganical parts of matter , we shall find everywhere that the several species are linked together , and differ but in almost insensible degrees . And when we consider the infinite power and wisdom of the Maker , we have reason to think , that it is suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe , and the great design and infinite goodness of the architect , that the species of creatures should also , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , as we see they gradually descend from us downwards . ' Addison made this aspect of the Platonistic metaphysics familiar even to that part of the public which left the works of philosophers and theologians unread , by repeated references to it in the Spectator ? for example , in No. 519 . Infinite Goodness is of so communicative a Nature , that it seems to delight in the conferring of Existence upon every degree of Perceptive Being .  | As this is a Speculation which I have often pursued with great Pleasure to myself , I shall enlarge farther upon it by considering that part of the Scale of Beings which comes within our own Knowledge . There are many other creatures . . . which have no other sense beside that of feeling and taste . . . . It is wonderful to observe , by what a gradual progress the World of Life advances through a prodigious variety of species , before a creature is formed that is compleat in all its Senses . . . . If after this we look into the several inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Instinct , we find them rising after the same manner , imperceptibly one above another , and receiving additional Improvements , according to the Species in which they are implanted . This progress in Nature is so very gradual , that the most perfect of an Inferior Species comes very near to the most imperfect of that which is immediately above it . . . . Nor is the goodness of the Supream Being less seen in the Diversity than in the Multitude of living Creatures . Had he made only one Species of Animals , none of the rest would have enjoyed the Happiness of Existence ; he has , therefore , specified in his Creation every degree of Life , every Capacity of Being . The whole Chasm in Nature , from a Plant to a Man , is filled up with diverse Kinds of Creatures , rising one over another by such a gentle and easie Ascent , that the little Transitions and Deviations from one Species to another , are almost insensible . This intermediate Space is so well husbanded and managed , that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some part of the World of Life . ' Another writer , the Anglican divine Edmund Law , was not content even with this picture of the fullness ' of creation , but , after quoting Addison , added that within each species as many individuals as are capable of existing together must have been generated : From the . . , observation that there is no manner of chasm or void , no link deficient in this great chain of beings , and the reason of it , it will appear extremely probable that every distinct order , every class or species of them , is as full as the nature of it would admit , or God saw proper . There are perhaps so many in each class as could exist together without some inconvenience or uneasiness to each other . This we are sure of , that nothing but an impossibility in the nature of the thing , or some greater ( sic ) inconvenience , can restrain the exercise of the power of God , or hinder him from producing still more and more beings capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude that everything is as perfect as possible in its own kind , and that every system is in itself full and complete . ' Out of the many special turns given to these general ideas , we shall in the present lecture consider certain of the deductions made from them with respect to man ? his status in the  | scale , his nature , and the ethical consequences to be drawn from these . A. The Chain of Being and Man 's Place in Nature . We have already considered the effects of the belief in the infinity of the world and the plurality of inhabited globes ? itself chiefly an inference from the principle of plenitude ? upon man 's conception of his place and consequence in the cosmic system . This belief , we have seen , did less to abate the self-esteem of our race than might have been expected and has often been supposed . But there were four other implications of the notion of the full and infinitesimally graduated Scale of Being which tended definitely to lower man 's estimate of his cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by eighteenth-century philosophers and popularizers of philosophical ideas . i . It was implied by the principle of plenitude that every link in the Chain of Being exists , not merely and not primarily for the benefit of any other link , but for its own sake , or more precisely , for the sake of the completeness of the series of forms , the realization of which was the chief object of God in creating the world . We have already seen that , though essences were conceived to be unequal in dignity , they all had an equal claim to existence , within the limits of rational possibility ; and therefore the true raison d'etre of one species of being was never to be sought in its utility to any other . But this implication was in conflict with an old assumption , highly flattering to man , which still persisted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . The physico-theology ' so much beloved by the writers of works of edification , deistic as well as orthodox , was in intent a proof of the existence of God ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For it rested in great part upon the supposition that all other created beings exist for man 's sake . Tout est cree pour l'homme is at once the tacit premise and the triumphant conclusion of that long series of teleological arguments which constitutes so large a fraction of the philosophical ' output of the eighteenth century ? and is one of the most curious monuments of human imbecility . This later age , in this , but repeats a strain heard frequently in the Middle Ages . The principal textbook of Scholastic philosophy had declared :  | As man is made for the sake of God , namely , that he may serve him , so is the world made for the sake of man , that it may serve him.4 Bacon had elaborated upon the theme : Man , if we look to final causes , may be regarded as the centre of the world ; insomuch that if man were taken away from the world , the rest would seem to be all astray , without aim or purpose , ... and leading to nothing . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is nothing from which he does not derive use and fruit . . . insomuch that all things seem to be going about man 's business and not their own.5 In a Protestant theological work of the late seventeenth century which was much admired in the eighteenth it is written : If we consider closely what constitutes the excellence of the fairest parts of the Universe , we shall find that they have value only in their relation to us , only in so far as our soul attaches value to them ; that the esteem of men is what constitutes the chief dignity of rocks and metals , that man 's use and pleasure gives their value to plants , trees and fruits.6 " In nature not only the plants but the animals , " says Fenelon , " are made for our use . " Predatory animals may seem an exception ; but " if all countries were peopled and made subject to law and order as they should be , there would be no animals that would attack man . " Yet the wilder beasts also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical address and courage , partly as aids to the preservation of international peace . For Fenelon too had some sense of man 's need of a " moral substitute for war " ; he proposed to meet it by maintaining preserves of " ferocious animals " in remote regions , to which those men whose fighting propensities needed outlet might repair . And the beneficence of nature was not least shown in thus providing fighting creatures of other species to kill , so that men might be relieved of the necessity of killing one another . ' The Creator has aimed , said Bernardin de StPierre ? whose Etudes de la Nature , 1784 , was looked upon as one of the masterpieces in this genre ? " only at the happiness of man . All the laws of nature are designed to serve our needs . " 8 Not only against this assumption that the rest of the creation is instrumental to man 's good but  --  - though less obviously ? against the premises of the teleological argument in general ,  | the logic of the conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this form of human vanity was prompted also by other considerations . Galileo had written : " We arrogate too much to ourselves if we suppose that the care of us is the adequate work of God , the end beyond which the divine wisdom and power does not extend . " 9 Henry More , clearly under the influence of the principle of plenitude , declared that : We are not to be scandalized . . . that there is such careful provision made for such contemptible vermine as we conceive them the lower animals to be . For this only comes out of Pride and Ignorance , or a haughty Presumption , that because we are encouraged to believe that in some Sense all things are made for Man , therefore they are not at all made for themselves . But he that pronounces this is ignorant of the Nature of God , and the Knowledge of things . For if a good Man be merciful to his Beast ; then surely a good God is bountiful and benign , and takes Pleasure that all his Creatures enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any enjoyment . " Descartes was , however , the foremost opponent in the seventeenth century not only of an anthropocentric teleology but of all forms of teleological reasoning in science . Aside from other objections , he found the theory in conflict with obvious facts . It is not at all probable that all things have been created for us in such a manner that God has no other end in creating them . . . . Such a supposition would , I think , be very inept in reasoning about physical questions ; for we can not doubt that an infinitude of things exist , or did exist though they have now ceased to do so , which have never been beheld or comprehended by man , and have never been of any use to him . " Most , indeed , of the greater philosophers of the seventeenth century repeat the same remark . Leibniz expressly concurs with Spinoza in the theorem non omnia hominum causa fieri.12 It is not surprising , he observes , that " we find in the world things that are not pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not made for us alone . " It is , in fact , " absurd , " said Archbishop King , to imagine that " the earth was made for the sake of mankind , and not of the universe " ; no one " who is not blinded by pride and ignorance " could ever suppose it . The same proposition is the principal burden of Bolingbroke 's polemic against all " divines " except King , in the Fragments , or Minutes  | of Essays , from which Pope probably got most of the ideas for the First Epistle of the Essay on Man . The agreement of the deist with the orthodox apologist is here complete . Bolingbroke professes , it is true , to scorn all theosophic speculation , all the pretensions of theologians to an acquaintance with the secret counsels of the Most High ; and for Plato and his followers , ancient and modern , he has an especially lively contempt . Yet he too , in the end , quietly assumes that he is not entirely ignorant of " the design of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic scheme as a whole is , Bolingbroke is sure , the true raison d'etre of the universe . We have no reason to think that " Infinite Wisdom had no other end in making man " ? or , indeed , any other link in the chain ? " than that of making a happy creature . " is The sensitive inhabitants of our globe , like the dramatis personae , have different characters , and are applied to different purposes of action in every scene . The several parts of the material world , like the machines of a theatre , were contrived , not for the actors , but for the action ; and the whole order and system of the drama would be disordered and spoiled , if any alteration was made in either.14 The universe , in short , was made in order that all possible forms of being might manifest themselves after their kinds . Thus what a writer of our own time has called the point de vue spectaculaire ? the cosmical piety and the sort of Romantic delight in the world which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's needs or hopes , but from its infinite richness and diversity as a spectacle , the prodigious sweep of the complex and often tragic drama which it exhibits ? was by no means unfamiliar in the early eighteenth century . " This favorite thesis of so many eighteenth-century writers was most tersely summed up by Goethe in his poem Athroismos ( 1819 ) : " every animal is an end in itself " : Zweck sein selbst ist jegliches Tier . 2 . A second consequence of the same sort was often drawn from the accepted view as to man 's relative position in the Chain of Being . The customary thing to say about this was , as we have seen , that he is the " middle link " in the chain . This did not necessarily or ( I think ) usually mean that the kinds  | above him and below him are equal in number . On the contrary , Locke thought that " we have reason to be persuaded that there are far more species of creatures above us , than there are beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the infinite Being of God , than we are from the lowest state of being , and that which approaches nearest to nothing . " 16 Addison puts the argument still more sharply ; the " space and room " upwards is infinite , and must all be filled ; but the number of grades below is finite . " Man was thus not midway in the series , but well down towards the lower end of it . He was the " middle link " in the sense that he was at the point of transition from the merely sentient to the intellectual forms of being . Did this suggest a flattering or a humbling view of man ? To the poet Young , who construed the notion of the middle position literally , it appeared to permit man to hold a rather high opinion of himself ; he is a Distinguished link in being 's endless chain , Midway from nothing to the deity . But to most of those who reflected upon the position in the universe which the theory assigned to man , it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made but a little lower than the angels , he was lower than the lowest of the angels , or other spiritual beings ; and the successive hierarchies above him were so numerous that when his mind dwelt upon them a sort of racial inferiority-complex naturally resulted . " The principall use of considering these scales of Creatures , " wrote Sir William Petty ( 1677 ) , " is to lett man see that beneath God there may be millions of creatures superior unto man . Wheras Hee generally taketh himself to be the chiefe and next to God . " For it shows him that " there are beings within ... the orb of the fixed .. Stairs . which do more incomparably excell man in the sense of dignity and infirmity then man doth excell the vilest insect . " 18 If , wrote a lady of quality in 1710 ? the authorship of the passage shows how completely a commonplace this way of thinking then was ? . . . if . . . we farther consider , that there being a Scale of Beings , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the infinite Creator to the smallest of his Productions , we have reason to believe ,  | that as we see an innumerable Company of Beings below us , and each Species to be less perfect in its Kind , till they end in a Point , an indivisible Solid : so there are almost an infinite Number of Beings above us , who as much exceed us , as we do the minutest Insect , or the smallest Plant , and , in comparison of whom , the most elevated Genius 's , the greatest Masters of Reason , the most illuminated and unweary 'd Enquirers after Knowledge , are but Children , such as hardly deserve to be of the lowest Form in the School of Wisdom , we can not but have contemptible Thoughts of our selves , can not but blush at our own Arrogance , and look back with Shame on the several Instances of our Folly . Methinks I see those bright Intelligences . . . who by the Dignity of their Nature are raised to sublime Stations , to the most intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , viewing us with a scornful Smile , but with a scorn that is mix 'd with Pity.19 Addison merely condensed this a few years later : " If the notion of a gradual rise in Beings from the meanest to the most High be not a vain imagination , it is not improbable that an Angel looks down upon a Man , as a Man doth upon a Creature which approaches the nearest to the rational Nature . " 20 The philosopher Formey reports the similar impression made upon him when he first became acquainted with the conception of the Scale of Being : How little cause have I to exalt myself above others , and whence can I derive motives for pride ? Heretofore I used to conceit myself one of the most excellent of God 's creatures , but I now perceive how great my delusion was . I find myself towards the lowest part of the Scale , and all I can boast of is , that I have a small pre-eminence above irrational creatures ; and this is not always so , there being many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary I see above me a multitude of superior intelligences . " There was , of course , nothing new in this belief in many ranks of " intelligences " superior to man ; the passages cited thus far merely illustrate its persistence , its recognized philosophical basis in the general scheme of the Chain of Being , and its effect upon man 's conception of himself . But in the eighteenth century the belief began to take on a more naturalistic form . This is illustrated in some passages of Bolingbroke . That there is an unbroken Chain of Being " almost from nonentity up to man " he supposed to be established by observation ; and like the Schoolmen whom he ridiculed , he found that , though empirical evidence here fails us , " we have the most  | probable reasons to persuade us , that it continues up to natures infinitely below the divine , but vastly superior to the human . " But these superior natures were not for him the angelic hierarchies , but simply the inhabitants of some of the other globes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the existence of higher links in the chain he gives an interesting reason , supplementary to the general postulate of plenitude : the fact that man 's intellectual powers so obviously fall far short of the maximal possibilities even of finite intelligence . We can not doubt that numberless worlds and systems of worlds compose this amazing whole , the universe ; and as little , I think , that the planets which roll about the sun , or those which roll about a multitude of others , are inhabited by living creatures , fit to be inhabitants of them . When we have this view before our eyes , can we be stupid or vain or impertinent enough to imagine that we stand alone or foremost among rational created beings ? We who must be conscious , unless we are mad , and have lost the use of our reason , of the imperfection of our reason ? Shall we not be persuaded rather that as there is a gradation of sense and intelligence here from animal beings imperceptible to us for their minuteness , without the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whom , though this be their highest stage , they remain very imperfect ; so there is a gradation from man , through various forms of sense , intelligence , and reason , up to beings who can not be known by us , because of their distance from us , and whose rank in the intellectual system is above even our conceptions ? This system , as well as the corporeal , . . . must have been alike present to the Divine Mind before he made them to exist22 Bolingbroke too , in short , in spite of his ostentation of agnosticism , wanted to have faith in the universe ; and this seemed to him impossible without the postulate that nature has somewhere produced better specimens of rationality than homo sapiens . But of the defects of his intelligence it is unreasonable in man to complain ; only a segment of the scale exists on this planet , and he happens to be the not altogether non-rational yet on the whole very stupid creature who occupies a certain point in the series ? a little higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabits , yet incalculably below the highest . If he , with his limitations , were wanting , the scheme would be incomplete , and therefore imperfect . Pope puts the same disparagement of man into four pungent lines :  | Superior beings when of late they saw A mortal man unfold all Nature 's law , Admir 'd such wisdom in an earthly shape , // The same notion was afterwards more cheerfully elaborated by Kant : Human nature occupies as it were the middle rung of the Scale of Being , . . . equally removed from the two extremes . If the contemplation of the most sublime classes of rational creatures , which inhabit Jupiter or Saturn , arouses his envy and humiliates him with a sense of his own inferiority , he may again find contentment and satisfaction by turning his gaze upon those lower grades which , in the planets Venus and Mercury , are far below the perfection of human nature.24 Kant , however , had discovered , as he supposed , a physical reason for this unequal distribution of degrees of rationality amongst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this early phase of his philosophical development , doubt , are conditioned by the constitution of the material bodies with which they are associated . " It is certain that man derives all his concepts and representations from the impressions which the universe makes upon him through his body " ; even " the power of comparing and combining " these impressions , " which may be called the faculty of thought , is wholly dependent upon the constitution of the matter with which the Creator has conjoined him . " 25 Now the greater the distance of a planet from the sun , the less it receives of the solar heat and energy ; and in order that life and intelligence may subsist on the more remote planets , the matter of which living bodies thereon are constituted must be " lighter and finer " and the physiological structure of organisms , both animal and vegetal , must be more delicately and intricately organized . Hence , Kant concludes , there is a law , " of which the degree of probability falls little short of complete certainty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension , the clarity and vividness of their concepts , which come to them from the impressions of the external world , their capacity to combine these concepts , and finally , their practical efficiency , in short the entire extent of their perfection , becomes higher and more complete in proportion to the remoteness of their dwelling-place from the sun.26  | Thus " the dullness of man 's wits , " the confusion ( Verwirrung ) of his ideas , his extreme liability to error , and the depravity of his moral nature ? of all of which Kant is no less sensible than Bolingbroke ? are the necessary consequences of the dependence of his mind upon a " coarse and inert matter . " But from these physical obstructions to mental activity the happier inhabitants of the outer planets are comparatively free . To what advances in knowledge will the insight of those fortunate beings in the higher celestial spheres not attain ! What fair effects will this clarification of their understandings not have upon their moral condition ! . . . What a noble imprint of its nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking natures which , like a quiet sea untroubled by the storms of passion , receive and reflect back its image j 27 Comment on this wild but pleasing speculation would be superfluous . But it would be hard to find a better illustration of the hold which the principles of the Platonistic tradition whose history we are examining had upon even the best minds of the eighteenth century . The illustration is the more noteworthy because , as we have seen , Kant was not prepared to maintain that all globes must have conscious inhabitants . He was nevertheless quite certain that , in a reasonably ordered universe , most of them must have , that life and intelligence can not possibly be confined to one small planet , and that the Scale of Being must extend far above man . He too finds consolation in the thought that so poor a creature as man is far from the best that nature produces . Upon even the most boasted achievements of our kind , on its necessarily inferior globe , the Jovians and Saturnians can but look down with condescending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines : the higher beings of these other spheres must " view a Newton " as we view a Hottentot or an ape . Bonnet in 1764 similarly derives from the postulate of the completeness of the Chain of Being light upon the inhabitants of other globes . Since it is a law of nature that no two leaves , or animals , or men , are completely alike , the same must be true of planets and solar systems . The assortment of beings which is characteristic of our world is probably not to be found in any other . Each globe has its distinctive economy and laws and products . There are perhaps worlds so imperfect relatively to  | ours , that there are to be found in them only . . . inanimate beings . Other worlds , on the contrary , may be so perfect that there are in them only beings of the superior classes . In these latter worlds , the rocks are organic bodies , the plants have sensation , the animals reason , the men are angels.28 3 . This , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by the traditional theology . The Church had always bidden the individual man walk humbly with his God and be sensible of his inferiority to countless creatures above him in the cosmic hierarchy . But it had often encouraged him to walk proudly among the creatures below him in that scale . Was he not infinitely removed in dignity from even the highest animals by his participation in the intellectual light of the divine Reason ? Yet when one began to consider seriously the implications of the principle of continuity ? which great theologians of the Church had taught ? it seemed to follow that man can be supposed to differ psychologically or physically from the nearest so-called non-human species only infinitesimally . The curious thing is that this consequence was , for the most part , so tardily drawn . Addison , while he finds matter for pride in man 's position as the nexus utriusque mundi , the link between the animal and the intellectual natures , nevertheless concludes his reflections on the subject thus : So that he who , in one respect , is associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Infinite Perfection as his Father , and the highest order of Spirits as his brethren , may , in another respect , say to Corruption , Thou art my Father , and to the worm , Thou art my Sister . Arguing specifically from the principle of continuity , Bolingbroke also was diligent in the effort to lower man 's too high conceit of himself ? though he thought that some had gone too far in racial self-disparagement . Man is , indeed , " the principal inhabitant of this planet , a being superior to all the rest . " But his superiority is only one of degree , and of a very slight degree . The whole chorus of theistical philosophers and divines boast it reason to be the distinguishing gift of God to man , that which gives him a preeminence and a right of command over his fellow creatures . . . . There have been those who have thought , that the human is a portion of the divine soul . Others have been more modest , and have allowed that the former is  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so high an order , that there is none superior , except the Supreme Being . . . . There is a middle point between these extremes , where the truth lies ; and he who seeks it may find it . . . . He will find . . . many such degrees of comparison between the human intelligence and that of various animals . He may be induced , perhaps , to think that intellectual faculties and corporeal senses , of the same and of different kinds , are communicated in some proportion or other to the whole race of animals . . 29 Man is connected by his nature , and therefore , by the design of the Author of all Nature , with the whole tribe of animals , and so closely with some of them , that the distance between his intellectual faculties and theirs , which constitutes as really , though not so sensibly as figure , the difference of species , appears , in many instances , small , and would probably appear still less , if we had the means of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Pope , when he translated these reflections into verse , heightened the emphasis on the more edifying aspect of Bolingbroke 's via media : Far as Creation 's ample range extends , The scale of sensual , mental powers ascends : Mark how it mounts to man 's imperial race , From the green myriads in the peopled grass . . . . How instinct varies in the grovelling swine , Compar 'd , half-reasoning elephant , with thine ! ' Twixt that , and reason , what a nice barrier , Forever sep'rate , yet forever near ! Remembrance and reflection how ally 'd ! What thin partitions sense from thought divide ! And middle natures , how they long to join , Yet never pass th ' insuperable line ! Without this just gradation could they be Subjected , these to those , or all to thee ! The pow'rs of all subdu 'd by thee alone , Is not thy reason all these pow'rs in one ? 31 In spite of Pope 's reversion to a more conventional strain in these last lines , he elsewhere attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which was " the reign of God , " to the sin of pride ? not that which caused man 's fall in the biblical narrative , but a pride which led him to separate himself unduly from the other animals : Pride then was not , nor arts that pride to aid ; Man walk 'd with beast , joint tenant of the shade ;  | The same his table , and the same his bed ; No murder cloath 'd him and no murder fed . In the same temple , the resounding wood , All vocal beings hymn 'd their equal God ! 32 Soame Jenyns seeks to alleviate this consequence of the principle of continuity by dwelling upon the many degrees of intelligence found within the human species ; while the psychological difference between the highest animals and the lowest men is scarcely appreciable , between either of these and the most highly endowed of civilized mankind the gradations are many and the distance wide . The farther we inquire into the works of our great Creator , the more evident marks we shall discover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable , than in that wonderful chain of beings , with which this terrestrial globe is furnished ; rising above each other from the senseless clod , to the brightest genius of human kind , in which , though the chain itself is sufficiently visible , the links , which compose it , are so minute , and so finely wrought , that they are quite imperceptible to our eyes . The various qualities with which these various beings are endued , we perceive without difficulty , but the boundaries of those qualities which form this chain of subordination , are so mixed , that where one ends , and the next begins , we are unable to discover . . . . The manner by which the consummate wisdom of the divine artificer has formed this gradation , so extensive in the whole , and so imperceptible in the parts , is this : ? He constantly unites the highest degree of the qualities of each inferior order to the lowest degree of the same qualities belonging to the order next above it ; by which means , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and shaded off into each other , that no line of distinction is anywhere to be seen . . . . Animal life rises from this low beginning in the shell-fish , through innumerable species of insects , fishes , birds , and beasts , to the confines of reason , where , in the dog , the monkey , and chimpanze , it unites so closely with the lowest degree of that quality in man , that they can not easily be distinguished from each other , From this lowest degree in the brutal Hottentot , reason , with the assistance of learning and science , advances , through the various stages of human understanding , which rise above each other , till in a Bacon or a Newton it attains the summit . " Yet , Jenyns adds , The superiority of man to other terrestrial animals is as inconsiderable , in proportion to the immense plan of universal existence , as the difference of climate between the north and south end of the paper I now write upon , with regard to the heat and distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for its authors or contemporary readers , in the first half of the eighteenth century , usually imply the consanguinity of man and the animals next to him in the scale . But the belief in such consanguinity is significant , for man 's evaluation of himself , only in so far as it minimizes the distinctiveness of man 's nature and denies the existence of a wide chasm between him and all other terrestrial creatures . And that chasm the principle of continuity had bridged for many eighteenth-century minds by whom the hypothesis of the transformation of species , then already beginning to emerge , was not accepted . Thus one of the effects often attributed to the influence of biological evolutionism had in fact come about long before the establishment and general diffusion of that doctrine , and quite independently of it . 4 . But it was not merely that man 's separation from the lower orders of living things was thus reduced to an almost inappreciable degree of difference . The definition of him as the " middle link , " in the sense usually given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution and the tragi-comic inner discord in him which results from this . The recognition of the fact that man is a creature not in harmony with himself was not , of course , due primarily to the influence of the notion of the Chain of Being . Other elements of Platonism , and in Christianity the radical Pauline opposition of " flesh " and " spirit , " had made this dualistic theory of human nature one of the ruling conceptions in Western thought ; and the moral experience of countless generations indoctrinated in it had seemed to give it poignant confirmation . But the place assigned to man in the graded scale which constitutes the universe lent to this conception still greater sharpness and an air of metaphysical necessity . Somewhere in that scale there must exist a creature in which the merely animal series terminates and the " intellectual " series has its dim and rudimentary beginning ; and man is that creature . He is therefore ? not in consequence of any accidental fall from innocence nor of any perverse machinations of evil spirits , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn by conflicting desires and propensities ; as a member of two orders of being at once , he wavers between both , and is not quite at home  | in either . He thus has , after all , a kind of uniqueness in nature ; but it is an unhappy uniqueness . He is , in a sense in which no other link in the chain is , a strange hybrid monster ; and if this gives him a certain pathetic sublimity , it also results in incongruities of feeling , inconsistencies of behavior , and disparities between his aspirations and his powers , which render him ridiculous . It is this aspect of man 's status as the link uniting the two great segments of the scale which Pope presents , in lines almost too familiar to quote , but too perfectly illustrative of the conception ? and too superb an example of Pope 's poetic style at its best ? to leave unquoted . Plac 'd in this isthmus of a middle state , A being darkly wise and rudely great , With too much knowledge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoic pride , He hangs between ; in doubt to act or rest ; In doubt to deem himself a god or beast ; In doubt his Mind or Body to prefer ; Born but to die , and reas'ning but to.err ; . . Chaos of Thought and Passion all confus 'd , Still by himself abus 'd , or disabus 'd ; Created half to rise , and half to fall , Great lord of all things , yet a prey to all ; Sole judge of Truth , in endless error hurl 'd ; The glory , jest and riddle of the world . " Haller , apostrophizing his kind as " unselig Mittel-Ding von Engeln and von Vieh , " exhibits man as the same cosmic paradox : Du pralst mit der Vernunft , and du gebrauchst sie nie . Was helfen dir zuletzt der Weisheit hohe Lehren ? Zu schwach sie zu verstehn , zu stolz sie zu entbehren . Dein schwindelnder Verstand , zum irren abgericht , Sieht oft die Wahrheit ein , and wahlt sie dennoch nicht .. . Du urteilst iiberall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and du sein Eigenthum.36 Yet the Swiss poet adds the two complementary and consoling reflections upon which we have already seen other writers of the century dwelling ; there are other globes than ours with happier inhabitants , and in any case the imperfection of man is indispensable to the fullness of the hierarchy of being :  | Perhaps this world of ours , which like a grain of sand Floats in the vast of heaven , is Evil 's fatherland ; While in the stars perhaps dwell spirits far more fair , Vice reigning ever here , Virtue triumphant there . And yet this point , this world , whose worth appears so small , Serves in its place to make complete the mighty All.37 There were in the thought of the eighteenth century , especially after the middle of it , other strains , not pertinent to our present subject , which worked against this fashion of racial self-disparagement and prepared the way for those disastrous illusions of man about himself which were to be so characteristic of the century that followed , and against which our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immense influence of the complex of ideas which was summed up in the cosmological conception of the Chain of Being tended chiefly , in the period with which we are now concerned , to make man not unbecomingly sensible of his littleness in the scheme of things , and to promote a not wholly unsalutary modesty and self-distrust . B. Some Ethical and Political Consequences . From this and from other aspects of the conception diverse practical morals could be , or , at all events , in the eighteenth century were , deduced . 1 . In the earlier part of the century , the most significant of these , and the most characteristic , may be described as a counsel of imperfection ? an ethics of prudent mediocrity . Since every place in the scale must be filled , and since each is what it is by virtue of the special limitations which differentiate it from any other , man 's duty was to keep his place , and not to seek to transcend it ? which , nevertheless , he was characteristically prone to do . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' seemed evident , must consist in conformity to its type , in the expression of just that Idea which defines its position , or that of its species , in the series . There must , then , be a specifically human excellence which it is man 's vocation to achieve ? an excellence as little to be confused with that of angels or of God as with that of the beasts ; and to covet the attributes or imitate the characteristic activities of beings above one in the cosmic order is as immoral as to sink to a lower level of it . The method  | of such an ethics would consist in taking stock of man 's actual constitution ? his distinguishing instincts , desires , and natural capacities ? and in formulating his good in terms of some balanced and practicable fulfilment of these . And since man 's place is not a very high one , since he is a mixture of the animal and the intellectual elements , and since the latter is present in him only in a meagre measure and in its lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom for him was to remember and to hold fast to his limitations . Of this ethics of the middle link Pope , again , was the chief , though not the first , apostle . The bliss of man ( could pride that blessing find ) Is not to act or think beyond mankind : No pow'rs of body or of soul to share , But what his nature and his state can bear.38 Rousseau in Emile echoes Pope 's preaching : 0 Man ! confine thine existence within thyself , and thou wilt no longer be miserable . Remain in the place which Nature has assigned to thee in the chain of beings , and nothing can compel thee to depart from it . . . . Man is strong when he contents himself with being what he is ; he is weak when he desires to raise himself above humanity . This moral temper oftenest expressed itself in that constant invective against " pride , " so characteristic of Pope and many another writer of the period.39 Pride is the sin " against the laws of Order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt " to counterwork the Universal Cause , " to disturb the very system of the universe . In pride , in reas'ning pride , our error lies ; All quit their sphere and rush into the skies . Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes , Men would be angels , angels would be gods . Man should , accordingly , eschew all the vaster enterprises of the mind ; he was not meant and is not equipped for them . " Trace Science then with modesty thy guide " ; and when all the vanities , errors , and excrescences of learning are expunged , Then see how little the remaining sum , Which serv 'd the past , and must the times to come !  | Here the conception of the Chain of Being ? and of man as its " middle link " ? resulted in a species of rationalistic antiintellectualism . But it also ? when made the basis of an ethics ? led to a disparagement of all the more pretentious and exacting moral ideals ? for example , of that of Stoicism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unqualified rejection of that otherworldliness which had always been characteristic of the Christian and the Platonic tradition . " Go , wondrous creature ! " writes Pope contemptuously , Go soar with Plato to the empyreal sphere , To the first good , first perfect , and first fair , Or tread the mazy round his follow'rs trod , And quitting sense call imitating God ; As Eastern priests in giddy circles run , And turn their heads to imitate the sun . Here the two strains in Platonism , which we distinguished at the outset of these lectures , have become completely sundered ; and one of them has overcome the other . The idea of the " way up , " of the ascensio mentis ad Deum per scalas creaturarum , has been abandoned . Yet the main philosophic reason , if not , perhaps , the most potent motive , for its abandonment lay in the principle of plenitude , which had always been equally characteristic of the Platonic tradition . And this deduction from the principle was , as I have already intimated , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible links in the chain must be perpetually represented in the universe , and if this consideration was to be turned from a cosmological generalization into a moral imperative , it naturally seemed to follow that the imitatio dei could be no business of man 's , and that any effort to ascend the scale must be an act of rebellion against the divine purpose ? a crime against Nature . The doubt which might well have occurred ? but apparently did not occur ? to those who reasoned in this manner was whether the cornpleteness of the world might not be presumed to be sufficiently assured by the Eternal Cause ? whether , if it is necessary in the nature of things that the world should be an unbroken chain of being , it was likely that any link in the chain could leave its place , and thereby  | in the full creation leave a void , Where , one step broken , the great scale 's destroyed . 2 . The assumption of the mediocrity of man 's position in the universe , when thus applied to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as containing , a further implication which some of the gloomier or more toughminded spirits of the age did not fail to see : that a creature so limited and so near to the other animals , in kind if not in kinship , must necessarily be incapable of attaining any very high level of political wisdom or virtue , and that consequently no great improvement in men 's political behavior or in the organization of society could be hoped for . There are , said Soame Jenyns , " numberless imperfections inherent in all human governments , " and these are " imputable only to the inferiority of man 's station in the universe , which necessarily exposes him to natural and moral evils , and must , for the same reason , to political and religious ; which are indeed but the consequences of the other . Superior beings may probably form to themselves , or receive from their Creator , government without tyranny and corruption ; . . . but man can not : God indeed may remove him into so exalted a Society , but whilst he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innumerable evils " ? such as " those grievous burdens of tyranny and oppression , of violence and corruption , of war and desolation , under which all nations have ever groaned on account of government ; . . . but which are so woven into the very essence of all human governments from the depravity of man , that without them none can be either established , maintained or administered , nor consequently can they be prevented without changing that depravity into perfection ; that is , without a complete alteration of human nature . " 40 Hence , Jenyns concludes , there never has been and never will be any good form of government . Some , doubtless , are less bad than others ; but those who bitterly indict the existing order and dream of radically transforming it forget this fundamental truth ? that " all these evils arise from the nature of things and the nature of man , and not from the weakness or wickedness of particular men , or their accidental ascendency in particular govern-  | ments : the degrees of them may indeed be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 41 An analogous inference from the conception of the Chain of Being , and of man 's place therein , was drawn by the same writer with respect to religion . Neither by the light of nature nor by revelation can man expect to attain much clarity or certainty in religious knowledge : God can not impart knowledge to creatures , of which he himself has made them incapable by their nature and formation : he can not instruct a mole in astronomy or an oyster in music , because he has not given them members or faculties necessary for the acquisition of those sciences : . . . a religion therefore from God can never be such as we might expect from infinite Power , Wisdom and Goodness , but must condescend to the ignorance and infirmities of man : was the wisest Legislator in the world to compose laws for a nursery they must be childish laws : so was God to reveal a religion to mankind , tho ' the Revealer was divine the Religion must be human , and therefore liable to numberless imperfections.42 The principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among their many uses , be made to serve the purposes of a species of pessimistic and backhanded apologetic both for the political status quo and for the accepted religion . They provided a damper for the zeal of the reformer . Since men are not and were not meant to be angels , let us cease to expect them to behave as if they were ; and let us avoid the error of imagining that by an alteration of the form or mechanism of government we shall put an end to those limitations of human nature which are essentially unalterable , because they are inherent in the scheme of the universe which required just such a creature , as well as all other kinds , to make it " complete . " One of Jenyns 's critics , however , without denying the premises , detected , as he thought , a non sequitur in the conclusion ; the argument , he declared , was " a mere quibble upon terms . " Doubtless man could not expect " a government or religion calculated for the first order of created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or religion must be imperfect . But there was no reason why man should not attain a relative perfection in these respects ? " such a government and religion as shall be most expedient for the purposes of that set of beings for whose use they were instituted . " 43  | The critic unwittingly put his finger here upon a significant tacit assumption in this and certain other applications of the principle . It is the peculiarity of man , these arguments implied , that while his powers and achievements are limited by the position which he occupies in the Scale of Being , he is capable of seeing beyond them and ? for better or worse ? of feeling dissatisfaction with them and therefore with himself . He is constitutionally discontented with his own nature and his place in the universal nature ; and of this the saint , the mystic , the Platonic or the Stoic moralist , and the reformer , in their several ways gave evidence . But here again the principle of plenitude was subtly at war with itself . This perpetual discontent of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the differentiae of his species , a characteristic appropriate to his place in the scale . If it were not required by that place , how could he have come to possess it ? But if it were required , it could not in consistency be condemned ; and its existence at just this point in the best of possible worlds might even be taken as an indication that man , at least , was not intended to occupy forever the same place , that the scale is literally a ladder to be ascended , not only by the imagination but in fact . We shall presently see the argument taking this turn . But the less cheerful interpreter of the principle of plenitude could , no doubt , have replied that the specific and defining defect of man consists precisely in his being the creature whose destiny it is to have visions of perfections which he can not possess and of virtues which he is nevertheless constitutionally incapable of attaining . For this too is one of the possible kinds of creature ; must not , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is not this , indeed , the natural and immutable consequence of just that middle place which was traditionally assigned him ? a being at once of flesh and spirit , an intermediate species between the purely animal and the rational kind ? 3 . There was more than one way , however , in which the principles embodied in the cosmological conception of the Chain of Being could be used as weapons against social discontent and especially against all equalitarian movements . The universe , it was assumed , is the best of systems ; any other system is good  | only in so far as it is constructed upon the same principles ; and the object of the Infinite Wisdom which had fashioned it was to attain the maximum of variety by means of inequality . Clearly , then , human society is well constituted only if , within its own limits , it tends to the realization of the same desiderata . This was , of course , the point of the famous dictum of Pope 's which has so often been misapplied for the annoyance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ; and this confest , Some are , and must be , greater than the rest , More rich , more wise . " This was no casual piece of Toryism on Pope 's part ; that " Order , " that is , hierarchic gradation , is everywhere required by the divine Reason , is a fundamental premise of the argument for optimism in the Essay on Man . The doctrine of the Chain of Being thus gave a metaphysical sanction to the injunction of the Anglican catechism : each should labor truly " to do his duty in that state of life " ? whether in the cosmical or the social scale " to which it shall please God to call him . " To seek to leave one 's place in society is also " to invert the laws of Order . " " Cease , then , nor Order imperfection name . " Any demand for equality , in short , is " contrary to nature . " Nor was Pope at all original in suggesting this politico-social moral . Leibniz had similarly pointed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possible societies : Inequality of conditions is not to be counted among evils ( desordres ) , and M. Jacquelot rightly asks those who would have all things equally perfect , why rocks are not crowned with leaves or why ants are not peacocks . If equality were everywhere requisite , the poor man would set up his claim to it against the rich man , the valet against his master.45 The argument could , it is true , be worked from either end ; to those who needed no persuasion to believe that there must be higher and lower ranks in society , this premise could be invoked to justify to man God 's plan in the creation . It was in this latter way that Edmund Law reasoned : ' T is impossible all should be rulers and none subjects . From this example we see how the relations which creatures have to one another may put a restraint even on infinite Power , so that it will be a contradiction for them ,  | while they keep the nature which they have at present , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor can all of the same order be gratified with the same conveniences.46 The analogy between the macrocosm and the social microcosm was put still more fully and naively by Soame Jenyns : The universe resembles a large and well-regulated family , in which all the officers and servants , and even the domestic animals , are subservient to each other in a proper subordination ; each enjoys the privileges and perquisites peculiar to his place , and at the same time contributes , by that just subordination , to the magnificence and happiness of the whole.47 While this analogy thus served to justify the complacency of those to whom the existing order of society was a very comfortable one , it was , doubtless , a relatively small factor in political thought in the eighteenth century . And it is to be remembered that there was another implication of the accepted scheme of the universe which qualified , though it did not contradict , this mode of conservative apologetics . Subordination , indeed , was essential ; but it was a subordination without subservience . No creature 's existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-being of those above it in the scale . Each had its own independent reason for being ; in the final account , none was more important than any other ; and each , therefore , had its own claim to respect and consideration from its superiors , its own right to live its own life and to possess all that might be needful to enable it to fulfill the functions and enjoy " the privileges and perquisites " of its station . This dual aspect of the conception ? which still , it must be confessed , remained more gratifying to the higher than consoling to the lower ranks  --  was duly set forth in verse of an appropriate quality : Wise Providence Does various parts for various minds dispense ; The meanest slaves or they who hedge and ditch , Are useful , by their sweat , to feed the rich ; The rich , in due return , impart their store , Which comfortably feeds the lab'ring poor . Nor let the rich the lowest slave disdain , He 's equally a link of nature 's chain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And both alike the will divine pursue.48  | THE common thesis of eighteenth-century optimists was , as is notorious , the proposition that this is the best of possible worlds ; and this fact , together with the connotation which the term " optimism " has come to assume in popular usage , has given rise to the belief that the adherents of this doctrine must have been exuberantly cheerful persons , fatuously blind to the realities of human experience and of human nature , or insensible to all the pain and frustration and conflict which are manifest through the entire range of sentient life . Yet there was in fact nothing in the optimist 's creed which logically required him either to blink or to belittle the facts which we ordinarily call evil . So far from asserting the unreality of evils , the philosophical optimist in the eighteenth century was chiefly occupied in demonstrating their necessity . To assert that this is the best of possible worlds implies nothing as to the absolute goodness of this world ; it implies only that any other world which is metaphysically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the optimist was directed less to showing how much of what men commonly reckon good there is in the world of reality than to showing how little of it there is in the world of possibility ? in that eternal logical order which contains the Ideas of all things possible and compossible , which the mind of God was conceived to have contemplated " before the creation , " and by the necessities of which , ineluctable even by Omnipotence , his creative power was restricted . At bottom , indeed , optimism had much in common with that Manichaean dualism , against Bayle 's defence of which so many of the theodicies were directed . Optimism too , as Leibniz acknowledged , had its two antagonistic " principles . " The role of the " evil principle " was simply assigned to the divine reason , which imposed singular impediments upon the benevo-  | lent intentions of the divine will . The very ills which Bayle had argued must be attributed to the interference of a species of extraneous Anti-God , for whose existence and hostility to the good no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to a necessity inhering in the nature of things ; and it was questionable whether this was not the less cheerful view of the two . For it was possible to hope that in the fullness of time the Devil might be put under foot , and believers in revealed religion were assured that he would be ; but logical necessities are eternal , and the evils which arise from them must therefore be perpetual . Thus eighteenth-century optimism not only had affinities with the dualism to which it was supposed to be antithetic , but the arguments of its advocates at times sounded strangely like those of the pessimist ? a type by no means unknown in the period . ' The moral was different , but the view of the concrete facts of experience was sometimes very much the same ; since it was the optimist 's contention that evil ? and a great deal of it ? is involved in the general constitution of things , he found it to his purpose to dilate , on occasion , upon the magnitude of the sum of evil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is thus , for example , that Soame Jenyns , in one of the typical theodicies of the middle of the century , seeks to persuade us of the admirable rationality of the cosmic plan : I am persuaded that there is something in the abstract nature of pain conducive to pleasure ; that the sufferings of individuals are absolutely necessary to universal happiness . . . . Scarce one instance , I believe , can be produced of the acquisition of pleasure or convenience by any creatures , which is not purchased by the previous or consequential sufferings of themselves or others . Over what mountains of slain is every mighty empire rolled up to the summit of prosperity and luxury , and what new scenes of desolation attend its fall ? To what infinite toil of men , and other animals , is every flourishing city indebted for all the conveniences and enjoyments of life , and what vice and misery do those very equipments introduce ? . . . The pleasures annexed to the preservation of ourselves are both preceded and followed by numberless sufferings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feast , and followed by as many diseases lying wait in every dish to pour forth vengeance on their destroyers . ' This gloomy rhetoric was perfectly consistent in principle with optimism , and it manifested at least one natural tendency of  | the champions of that doctrine ; for the more numerous and monstrous the evils to be explained , the greater was the triumph when the author of a theodicy explained them . The argument , indeed , in some of its more naive expressions tends to beget in the reader a certain pity for an embarrassed Creator , infinitely well-meaning , but tragically hampered by " necessities in the nature of things " in his efforts to make a good world . What could be more pathetic than the position in which ? as Soame Jenyns authoritatively informs us ? Omnipotence found itself when contemplating the creation of mankind ? Our difficulties arise from our forgetting how many difficulties Omnipotence has to contend with : in the present instance it is obliged either to afflict innocence or be the cause of wickedness ; it has plainly no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimists afforded abundant ground for Voltaire 's exclamation : Vous criez " Tout est Bien " d'une voix lamentable ! Voltaire 's chief complaint of these philosophers in the Poem on the Lisbon Disaster was not , as has often been supposed , that they were too indecently cheerful , that their view of the reality of evil was superficial ; his complaint was that they were too depressing , that they made the actual evils we experience appear yet worse by representing them as inevitable and inherent in the permanent structure of the universe . Non , ne presentez plus a mon Coeur agite Ces immuables lois de la necessite ! An evil unexplained seemed to Voltaire more endurable than the same evil explained , when the explanation consisted in showing that from all eternity the avoidance of just that evil had been , and through all eternity the avoidance of others like it would be , logically inconceivable . ' In this his own feeling , and his assumption about the psychology of the emotions in other men , were precisely opposite to Spinoza 's , who believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it never could have been otherwise : quatenus mens res omnes ut necessarias intelligit , eatenus minus ab affectibus patitur.5 Though most of the optimistic writers of the eighteenth cen-  | tury were less thorough-going or less frank in their cosmical determinism than Spinoza , such philosophic consolation as they offered was at bottom the same as his . It was an essentially intellectual consolation ; the mood that it was usually designed to produce was that of reasoned acquiescence in the inevitable , based upon a conviction that its inevitableness was absolute and due to no arbitrary caprice ; or , at a higher pitch , a devout willingness to be damned ? that is , to be as much damned as one was ? for the better demonstration of the reasonableness of the general scheme of things . Whether confronted with physical or with moral evils , wrote Pope , " to reason well is to submit " ; and again : Know thy own point ; this kind , this due degree , Of blindness , weakness , Heaven bestows on thee . Submit ! It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to show that good comes out of evil ; but what it was indispensable for them to establish was that it could come in no other way . It is true , also , that they were wont , when they reached the height of their argument , to discourse with eloquence on the perfection of the Universal System as a whole ; but that perfection in no way implied either the happiness or the excellence of the finite parts of the system . On the contrary , the fundamental and characteristic premise of the usual proof of optimism was the proposition that the perfection of the whole depends upon , indeed consists in , the existence of every possible degree of imperfection in the parts . Voltaire , once more , summarized the argument not altogether unjustly when he wrote : Vous composerez dans ce chaos fatal Des malheurs de chaque titre un bonheur general . The essence of the optimist 's enterprise was to find the evidence of the " goodness " of the universe not in the paucity but rather in the multiplicity of what to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best be shown by an analysis of the argument in its logical sequence , as it is set forth in the earliest and , perhaps ,  | when both its direct and indirect influence are considered , the most influential , of eighteenth-century theodicies ? the De origine mali ( 1702 ) of William King , then Bishop of Derry , afterwards Archbishop of Dublin . The original Latin work does not appear to have had wide currency ; but in 1731 an English version appeared , ' with copious additions , partly extracts from King 's posthumous papers , partly original notes " tending to vindicate the author 's principles against the objections of Bayle , Leibnitz , the author of a Philosophical Inquiry concerning Human Liberty , and others , " by the translator , Edmund Law , subsequently Bishop of Carlisle . The translation went through five editions during Law 's lifetime ; ' and it seems to have been much read and discussed . Law was a figure of importance in his day , being the spokesman of " the most latitudinarian position " in the Anglican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master of Peterhouse and Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge in the 1750 's and 6o 's doubtless increased the range of his influence . ' There can hardly be much doubt that it was largely from the original work of King that Pope derived , directly or through Bolingbroke , the conceptions which , rearranged with curious incoherency , served for his vindication of optimism in the First Epistle of the Essay on Man ; 9 for it is unlikely that Pope derived them from their fountain-head , the Enneads of Plotinus . It can by no means be said that King begins his reflection on the subject by putting on rose-tinted spectacles . He recognizes from the outset all the facts which seem most incompatible with an optimistic view : the " perpetual war between the elements , between animals , between men " ; " the errors , miseries and vices " which are " the constant companions of human life from its infancy " ; the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous . There are " troops of miseries marching through human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficiality of Milton 's theodicy ; while he , too , assumes the freedom of the will , he sees clearly that this assumption can touch only a fraction of the problem . Not all evils are " external , or acquired by our choice " ; many of them proceed from the constitution of Nature itself.10 The dualistic doctrine of  | Bayle , while it , too , has the advantage of " acquitting God of all manner of blame , " is philosophically an " absurd hypothesis . " King , in short , is to attribute evil , not ? at least not primarily nor chiefly ? either to the mysterious perversity of man 's will or to the machinations of the Devil ; he is to show its necessity from a consideration of the nature of deity itself . His undertaking is nothing less than that of facing all the evils of existence and showing them to be " not only consistent with infinite wisdom , goodness and power , but necessarily resulting from them . " u The traditional division of evils into three classes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moral evils ? provides the general scheme of the argument , which is , in brief , that there could not conceivably have been any creation at all without the first sort of evil ; and that all of the second sort , at least , follow with strict logical necessity from the first . Even Omnipotence could not create its own double ; if any beings other than God were to exist they must in the nature of the case be differentiated from him through the " evil of defect " ? and , as is assumed , be differentiated from one another by the diversity of their defects . Evil , in short , is primarily privation ; and privation is involved in the very concept of all beings except one . This Law puts in the terms of Aristotelian and Scholastic philosophy in his summary of King 's " scheme " : All creatures are necessarily imperfect , and at infinite distance from the perfection of the Deity , and if a negative principle were admitted , such as the Privation of the Peripatetics , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-existence ; for it is nothing in respect both of those perfections which it wants , and of those which others have . And this . . . mixture of non-entity in the constitution of created beings is the necessary principle of all natural evils , and of a possibility of moral ones.12 In other words , in King 's own phrase , " a creature is descended from God , a most perfect Father ; but from Nothing as its Mother , which is Imperfection . " And the virtually dualistic character of this conception is shown by the fact that the inferior parent , in spite of the purely negative role which appeared to be implied by her name , was conceived to be responsible for many seemingly highly positive peculiarities of  | the offspring . This , however , was felt to be an unobjectionable dualism , partly because the second or evil principle was called " Nothing , " and partly because its existence as a factor in the world , and the effects of it , could be regarded as logically necessary and not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie in this simple , almost tautological piece of reasoning . Doubtless , if the Absolute Being was not to remain forever in the solitude of his own perfection , the prime evil of limitation or imperfection must characterize whatever other beings he brought forth . But that evil was not thereby justified unless it were shown , or assumed , that the creation of such other , necessarily defective beings is itself a good . This crucial Plotinian assumption King unhesitatingly makes , as well as a further assumption which seems far from self-evident . Even if it were granted that it is good that some beings other than God , some finite and imperfect natures , should exist , would it not ( some might ask ) have been less irrational that only the highest grade of imperfection should be generated ? as had , indeed , been originally the case , according to an account of the creation supported by a considerable weight of authority in the theological tradition of Christianity , and comparatively recently revived by Milton ? 13 If God could be supposed to need company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heresy to admit ? should it not at least have been good company , a civitas dei composed wholly of pure spirits ? King saw no way of achieving a satisfactory theodicy unless this latter question were answered ( again with the support of many ancient and medieval writers ) in the negative . It was requisite to show that not only imperfection in general , but every one of the observable concrete imperfections of the actual world , ought to have been created ; and this could not be shown unless it were laid down as a premise that it is inherently and absolutely good that every kind of thing ( however far down in the scale of possibles ) should actually be , so far as its existence is logically conceivable , i. e. , involves no contradiction . This proposition then ? expressed in theological terminology ? was the essential thesis in the argument for optimism propounded by King and Law . There is inherent in the divine  | essence , as an element in God 's perfection , a special attribute of " goodness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essences down to the very lowest ? so far as they are severally and jointly possible ? shall have actual existence after their kind . God might , indeed , have refrained from creating , and continued alone , self-sufficient and perfect to all eternity ; but his infinite Goodness would by no means allow it ; this obliged him to produce external things ; which things , since they could not possibly be perfect , the Divine Goodness preferred imperfect ones to none at all . Imperfection , then , arose from the infinity of Divine Goodness . ' 4 And , thus committed by his own nature to the impartation of Actual being to some imperfect essences , God could not refuse the boon of existence to any : If you say , God might have omitted the more imperfect beings , I grant it , and if that had been best , he would undoubtedly have done it . But it is the part of infinite Goodness to choose the very best ; from thence it proceeds , therefore , that the more imperfect beings have existence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very least good that could be produced . Finite goodness might possibly have been exhausted in creating the greater beings , but infinite extends to all . . . . There must then be many , perhaps infinite , degrees of perfection in the divine works . . . . It was better not to give some so great a degree of happiness as their natures might receive , than that a whole species of being should be wanting to the world . ' 5 Not only must all possible species enjoy existence , but , adds King 's editor , " from the observation that there is no manner of chasm or void , no link deficient in this great Chain of Being , and the reason of it , it will appear extremely probable also that every distinct order , every class or species , is as full as the nature of it would permit , or Law devoutly but , upon his own principles , tautologically adds as God saw proper . " The foundation , then , of the usual eighteenth-century argument for optimism was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hundreds of writers before King , and had been the basis of both the Neoplatonic and the Scholastic theodicy , its utilization by later optimists is no evidence that they derived it from him . Nevertheless , for reasons already indicated , the probability remains that it was because of the reiteration and elaboration of the principle in the  | De origine mali that Pope gave the fundamental place , in his own argument for the thesis that whatever is is right , to the premise that , in the " best of systems possible , " All must full or not coherent be , And all that rises , rise in due degree . For the purposes of a theodicy , the principle of plenitude served most directly and obviously as an " explanation " of the " evil of defect . " The limitations of each species of creature , which define its place in the scale , are indispensable to that infinite differentiation of things in which the " fullness " of the universe consists , and are therefore necessary to the realization of the greatest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he lacks many endowments and means of enjoyment which might conceivably have been granted him . In Law 's words : From the supposition of a Scale of Beings , gradually descending from perfection to nonentity , and complete in every intermediate rank and degree , we shall soon see the absurdity of such questions as these , Why was not man made more perfect ? Why are not his faculties equal to those of angels ? Since this is only asking why he was not placed in a different class of beings , when at the same time all other classes are supposed to be full . " It was , in short , " necessary that the creature should fill the station wherein it was , or none at all . " If he were anywhere else , he would not be the same entity ; and if he did not exist at all , there would be a gap in the series , and the perfection of the creation would thereby be destroyed . Undeniably these distinguishing deficiencies " bring many inconveniences on the persons whose lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a creature of such an imperfect nature . " For example , a man has no wings , a perfection granted to birds . ' T is plain that in his present circumstances he can not have them , and that the use of them would be very mischievous to society ; and yet the want of them necessarily exposes us to many inconveniences . . . . A thousand instances may be given where the evil of imperfection necessarily subjects us to disappointment of appetite , and several other natural evils , which yet are all necessary for the common good . " To this particular form of purely logical consolation Pope recurs repeatedly , with fairly evident dependence upon King .  | In a " full " system " there must be , somewhere , such a rank as Man " ; and the occupant of that rank can not rationally desire the distinctive attributes of those below or those above him in the scale.18 Why has not man a microscopic eye ? For this plain reason , man is not a fly . And ( to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press , inferior might on ours ; Or in the full creation leave a void , Where , one step broken , the great scale 's destroyed.19 But if the principle of plenitude had been applicable only for the explanation of the " metaphysical " evil of limitation or particularity , it would not have carried the optimist far towards his goal . Most of the things we call evil hardly appear to be adequately describable as mere deficiencies . Even a Platonistic philosopher with a toothache will probably find it difficult to persuade himself that his pain is a wholly negative thing , a metaphysical vacuum consisting merely in the absence of some conceivable positive good . King was therefore forced to use some ingenuity ? or rather , to utilize the ingenuity of his many precursors ? in order to exhibit the numerous train of " natural " evils as equally necessary implications of the same fundamental principle . He seeks to do this , in the first place , on the ground that in a really " full " universe there must be opposition . Creatures necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , one another . This necessity appears in its primary form in the motion of matter . It was theoretically possible for God to have so disposed matter that it would move " uniformly and all together , either in a direct line or in a circle , and the contrariety of motions by that means be prevented . " But a material system so simple and harmonious must also , we are assured , have been barren and useless . Such a motion therefore was to be excited in it as would separate it into parts , make it fluid , and render it an habitation for animals . But that could not be without contrariety of motion , as any one that thinks of it at all will perceive . And if this be once admitted in matter , there necessarily follows  | a division and disparity of parts , clashing and opposition , comminution , concretion and repulsion , and all those evils which we behold in generation and corruption . . . . The mutual clashing of these concretions could therefore not be avoided , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts and a separation from each other would be necessarily produced , . . . i. e. corruption . " And since man 's place in the Scale of Being is that of a creature partly material , partly spiritual , he is necessarily involved in , and unhappily affected by , these collisions of matter . The preoccupation of the optimists with the notion of the " fullness " of the organic world sometimes led them ( by a natural confusion of ideas ) to draw an almost Darwinian or Malthusian picture of a Nature overcrowded with aspirants for life and consequently given over to a ubiquitous struggle for existence . King assures us that there is something like a housing problem even in Heaven . If you ask why God does not immediately transplant men into heaven , since ' t is plain they are capable of that happier state ; or why he confines them so long . . . on the earth as in a darksome prison , . . . I answer , Because the Heavens are already furnished with inhabitants , and can not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present possessors depart to a better state , or make room some other way for these to change their condition . " Into the further naive reasonings by which King seeks to deduce the genesis of " pain , uneasiness and dread of death , " and indirectly of the other emotions by which man is tormented , we need not enter . It suffices to quote the concise genealogy of woes in which he sums up his reasons for holding this to be the best of possible worlds : Behold how evils spring from and multiply upon each other , while infinite Goodness still urges the Deity to do the very best . This moved him to give existence to creatures , which can not exist without imperfections and inequality . This excited him to create matter , and to put it in motion , which is necessarily attended with separation and dissolution , generation and corruption . This persuaded him to couple souls with bodies , and to give them mutual affections , whence proceeded pain and sorrow , hatred and fear , with the rest of the passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Such an argument for optimism closely resembles , and might easily be substituted for , some of the formulas in which primitive Buddhism summed up the creed of pessimism .  | The author of the most popular English theodicy of the midnineteenth century found , as everyone remembers , peculiar difficulty in the spectacle of " Nature red in tooth and claw with ravin " ? in the universal conflict , the daily and hourly cruelties and little , dumb tragedies which are hidden behind the surface beauty of every field and wood . But to the typical eighteenth-century writer of a theodicy , even these aspects of Nature gave little trouble . He was no more blind to them than Tennyson ; but his universal solvent , the principle of plenitude , served him here as elsewhere . Doubtless , King granted , God could have made a world free from these horrors , simply by refraining from creating carnivorous and predacious animals . But this , again , would have meant a world less full of life . A being that has life is ( caeteris paribus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , animated that machine which furnishes out provision for the more perfect animals ; which was both graciously and providently done : for by this means he gained so much life to the world as there is in those animals which are food for others ; for by this means they themselves enjoy some kind of life , and are of service also to the rest . . . . Matter which is fit for the nourishment of man , is also capable of life ; if therefore God had denied it life , he had omitted a degree of good which might have been produced without any impediment to his principal design , which does not seem very agreeable to infinite goodness . ' T is better , therefore , that it should be endowed with life for a time , though ' t is to be devoured afterwards , than to continue totally stupid and unactive . . . . Let us not be surprised , then , at the universal war as it were among animals , or that the stronger devour the weaker.23 The application of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter , which furnished Pope with the theme for some characteristic and detestable lines , was also made by King . Man Feasts the animal he dooms his feast , And , till he ends the being , makes it blest . Undeniably the carnivora were among the antecedently possible kinds of creatures ; and if the excellence of Nature or its Author consists quite simply in having as many kinds as possible , nothing more need be said in justification of the existence of such animals ; in the words of another contemporary divine , quoted with admiration by Law , " it is evident that by this means there is room for more whole species of creatures  | than there otherwise would be , and that the variety of the creation is thereby very much enlarged and the goodness of its Author displayed . " 24 The tendency of the theodicies to promote belief in the blessedness of sheer multitude , the all-importance of having an abundance of " different natures " in the world , at whatever cost , could hardly be better illustrated . But even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consist , not solely in the diversity of creatures , but in the quantity of the joie de vivre it contains , the creation of beasts of prey could still , according to a further argument of King 's , be justified . " Animals are of such a nature as to delight in action , or in the exercise of their faculties , nor can we have any other notion of happiness even in God himself . " But among the pleasurable activities conceivable before the creation were those which might attach to the procuring of food by predatory creatures . Why , then , should these intense and positive pleasures be lacking , merely that feebler kinds might be spared the transitory pains of being pursued and eaten ? Clearly , since " the infinite Power of God was able to produce animals of such capacities , " his " infinite Goodness " may " be conceived to have almost compelled him not to refuse or envy ( them ) the benefit of life . " " If you insist , " says the archbishop genially to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made without teeth or claws , a viper without venom ; I grant it , as a knife without an edge ; but then they would have been of quite another species i. e. , there would have been a missing link in the Chain of Being , and have had neither the nature , nor use , nor genius , which they now enjoy . " As for the lion 's victim , if it were a rational animal it doubtless would , or at all events should , rejoice as does its Maker in the thought of the agreeable exercise which it is affording the " genius " of the lion . If the victim be not endowed with reason , or be too mean-spirited to take a large philosophical view of the matter , the consoling insight into the higher meaning of its sufferings is still , through the happy ordering of things , left to be enjoyed vicariously by optimistic archbishops . 25 Plainly this amiable and devout ecclesiastic had , in the course of his endeavor to justify God 's ways to men , been  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a conception of ultimate values which came somewhat strangely from a Christian teacher . Though King would , of course , have said that his God was a God of love , the term must necessarily have had for him an unusual sense . The God of the De origine mall loved abundance and variety of life more than he loved peace and concord among his creatures and more than he desired their exemption from pain . He loved lions , in short , as well as lambs ; and loving lions , he wished them to behave in accordance with the " nature , " or Platonic Idea , of a lion , which implies devouring lambs and not lying down with them . And in these preferences the " goodness " of God was assumed to be most clearly manifested ? " goodness " thus meaning chiefly a delight in fullness and diversity of finite being , rather than in harmony and happiness . King and his editor seem only occasionally and confusedly aware how deeply their argument has involved them in such a radical transvaluation of values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " divine goodness , " and for the most part touch but lightly upon the more paradoxical implications of their premises . Yet they at times betray some uneasy feeling of the incongruity between these premises and certain traditional elements of Christian belief . It was , for example , a part of that belief that in the earthly paradise before the Fall , and also in the celestial paradise which awaits the elect , most of the evils which these theologians were zealously proving to be " necessary , " because required by the " divine goodness , " were in fact absent . It seemed , therefore , difficult to avoid the awkward dilemma that either the paradisaical state is not good , or else a good " system " does not , after all , require quite so much evil and so many degrees of imperfection as the authors of the theodicies conceived . King meets this difficulty but lamely ; he is , in fact , driven to suggest that the felicity of our first parents in Eden has probably been somewhat exaggerated : " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain or passinn , " but rather " that he was only secured from such pains as might cause his death , and that for a time , till removed to a better place . " 26 The outcome of King 's reasoning ( so far as it was consist-  | ently carried through ) is not , of course , surprising . He who attempts a theodicy without first shutting his eyes to a large range of the facts of experience , must necessarily take for the object of his piety the God of Things as They Are ; and since things as they are include the whole countless troop of natural ills , it became necessary so to transform the conception of good as to make it possible to argue that these ills are ? not , indeed , goods , considered by themselves , but implicates of some supreme good , in the realization of which the essential nature of deity is most truly manifested . The principle of plenitude , taken as a species of value-theory , was a natural , if not the necessary , result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly that which the author of Nature as it is chiefly values could not , on empirical grounds , be supposed to be identical with those things which men have commonly set their hearts upon and have pictured to themselves in their dreams of paradise . Stated in its most general terms , the paradox underlying all these singular implications of the optimist 's reasoning is the assumption which is of the essence of the principle of plenitude itself ? that the desirability of a thing 's existence bears no relation to its excellence . King 's further reflections upon the problem of evil do not concern us here , since the conception of the Chain of Being does not much figure in them . It might , indeed , and with more consistency , have done so . For the sort of evil not dealt with by King upon the principles already indicated , namely , moral evil , might naturally have been regarded as a special case of the " evil of defect . " A creature having the specific degree of blindness and weakness appropriate to man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to the passions which King had represented as necessarily inseparable from our psychophysical constitution , could hardly fail , it would seem , to make frequent " wrong elections . " So much , indeed , King is constrained to admit ; there are many errors of conduct which are due to our ignorance and necessary imperfection , and these are to be classed among the " natural evils " and explained in the same manner as others of that class . But there remains a residuum of " moral evil " not so explicable , but due to a " depraved will . " On this theme King for the most part  | repeats the familiar arguments . Bolingbroke did not follow the archbishop in this , but derived the necessity of moral evil directly from the principle of plenitude . If men had been so constituted as to follow always the ethical " law of nature , .. . the moral state of mankind would have been paradisaical , but it would not have been human . We should not have been the creatures we were designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of created intelligences. " 27 In this application of the principle , the antinomian implications of which are sufficiently obvious , Bolingbroke had been anticipated by so saintly a philosopher as Spinoza : To those who ask , Why has not God created all men such as to be directed solely by the guidance of reason , I reply only that it is because he had no lack of material wherewith to create all things , from the very highest to the very lowest grade of perfection , or , more properly speaking , because the laws of his nature were so ample as to suffice for the production of everything that can be conceived by an infinite intellect.28 This was carrying a step farther the argument which Pope was to versify : since the best of systems must be as " full " as pos-sible , Then in the scale of reasoning life , ' t is plain , There must be somewhere such a rank as ? not man only , but also , among men , the fool and the evil-doer . The theodicy of Leibniz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English precursor ; 29 and in summarizing with approval the main argument of the archbishop 's bel ouvrage , plein de savoir et d'elegance , Leibniz significantly accentuated the theological paradox contained in it : Why , someone asks , did not God refrain from creating things altogether ? The author well replies that the abundance of God 's goodness is the reason . He wished to communicate himself , even at the expense of that delicacy which our imaginations ascribe to him , when we assume that imperfections shock him . Thus he preferred that the imperfect should exist , rather than nothing . " In this emphasis upon the implication that the Creator of the actual world can not be supposed to be a " delicate " or squeamish God , caring only for perfection ? and that , in  | fact , he would , if more nicely selective in his act of creation , have thereby shown himself the less divine  --  the consequence latent from the first in the principle of plenitude is put with unusual vividness and candor ; and in general , the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in optimism , is franker , more ardent , and more cheerful than the Anglican theologian . Some analogies in human life to the standards of valuation which the optimists had applied in explaining the supposed purpose of the deity in the creation are not obscurely suggested by Leibniz . Wisdom requires variety ( la sagesse doit varier ) . To multiply exclusively the same thing , however noble it be , would be a superfluity ; it would be a kind of poverty . To have a thousand well-bound copies of Vergil in your library ; to sing only airs from the opera of Cadmus and Hermione ; to break all your porcelain in order to have only golden cups ; to have all your buttons made of diamonds ; to eat only partridges and to drink only the wine of Hungary or of Shiraz ? could any one call this reasonable ? 31 Something very similar to this had , in point of fact , been regarded as the essence of reasonableness both by neo-classical aesthetic theorists and by a multitude of influential moralists . It would scarcely have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of less value than one copy plus a copy of the worst epic ever written ? still less that a reading of the first followed by a reading of the second is preferable to two readings of Vergil . And the apparent object of the endeavor of most ethical teaching had been to produce a close approach to uniformity in human character and behavior , and in men 's political and social institutions . The desire for variety ? or for change , the temporal form of it ? had rather commonly been conceived to be a non-rational , indeed a pathological , idiosyncrasy of human creatures . But Leibniz not only gave it a sort of cosmic dignity by attributing it to God himself , but also represented it as the very summit of rationality . The ethically significant consequence which is most plainly drawn from this by Leibniz is that neither what is commonly called moral goodness , nor pleasure , is the most important thing in the world . Both hedonism , in short , and an abstract moralism ( such , for example , as Kant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the value-theory  | implicit in the principle of plenitude . Virtue and happiness both , of course , have their place in the scale of values ; but if it were the highest place , it is inconceivable that God would have made the kind of world he has made . The moral or physical good or evil of rational creatures does not infinitely transcend the good or evil which is purely metaphysical , that is to say , the good which consists in the perfection of the other creatures . . . . No substance is either absolutely precious or absolutely contemptible in the sight of God . It is certain that God attaches more importance to a man than to a lion , but I do not know that we can be sure that he prefers one man to the entire species of lions . " To this thesis Leibniz reverts again and again in the Theodicee : It is a false maxim that the happiness of rational creatures is the sole purpose of God . If that had been so , there would , perhaps , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God would have chosen a set of possibles from which all evils were excluded . But he would in that case have fallen short of what is due to the universe , that is , what is due to himself . . . . It is true that one can imagine possible worlds without sin and without suffering , just as one can invent romances about Utopias or about the Sevarambes ; but these worlds would be much inferior to ours . I can not show this in detail ; you must infer it , as I do , ab effectu , since this world , as it is , is the world God chose . . . . Virtue is the noblest quality of created things , but it is not the only good quality of creatures . There is an infinite variety of others that attract the inclination of God ; it is from all these inclinations taken together that the greatest possible sum of good results ; and there would be less good than there is if there were nothing but virtue , if only rational creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he possessed only gold . " Leibniz adds the trite aesthetic argument for the indispensability of contrasts in the production of beauty in a work of art , and , indeed , in the mere physical pleasure of the gustatory sense : Sweet things become insipid if we eat nothing else ; sharp , tart and even bitter things must be combined with them so as to stimulate the taste . He who has not tasted bitter things does not deserve sweet , and , indeed , will not appreciate them . Thus these subtle philosophers and grave divines , and the poets like Pope and Haller who popularized their reasonings ,  | rested their assertion of the goodness of the universe ultimately upon the same ground as Stevenson 's child in the nursery : The world is so full of a number of things . This did not , it is true , necessarily make them " as happy as kings . " That was a matter of individual temperament ; and in point of fact most of them had not the child 's robust delight in the sheer diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural taste or training would have inclined them rather to prefer a somewhat thin , simple , and exclusive universe . The philosophers of optimism were not , in short , as a rule of a Romantic disposition ; and what they were desirous of proving was that reality is rational through and through , that every fact of existence , however unpleasant , is grounded in some reason as clear and evident as an axiom of mathematics . But in the exigencies of their argument to this ambitious conclusion , they found themselves constrained to attribute to the Divine Reason a conception of the good extremely different from that which had been most current among men , and frequently among philosophers ; and they were thus led , often against their original temper and intention , to impress upon the minds of their generation a revolutionary and paradoxical theory of the criterion of all value , which may be summed up in the words of a highly Romantic and optimistic lover of paradox in our own day : One thing alone is needful : Everything . The rest is vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the closing decade of the century.34 Before we turn to them , we must note certain other new developments which had been taking place in the meantime in the history of our three principles .  | No HISTORY of the biological sciences in the eighteenth century can be adequate which fails to keep in view the fact that , for most men of science throughout that period , the theorems implicit in the conception of the Chain of Being continued to constitute essential presuppositions in the framing of scientific hypotheses . But in those sciences , as in other provinces of thought , certain implications which had always been latent in these ancient assumptions now came to be more clearly recognized and more rigorously applied . In the present lecture we shall briefly note three aspects of eighteenth-century biological theory in which it was either affected by the general acceptance of the principles of continuity and plenitude , or in its turn tended to bring about a new interpretation of those principles . A still more important connection between the two will come before us in the following lecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logic and the natural history of Aristotle , and therefore of the later Middle Ages , two opposite modes of thought . The first made for sharp divisions , clear-cut differentiations , among natural objects , and especially among living beings . To range animals and plants in well-defined species , presumably ( since the Platonic dualism of realms of being was also still influential ) corresponding to the distinctness of the Eternal Ideas , was the first business of the student of the organic world . The other tended to make the whole notion of species appear a convenient but artificial setting-up of divisions having no counterpart in nature . It was , on the whole , the former tendency that prevailed in early modern biology . In spite of the violent reaction of the astronomy , physics , and metaphysics of the Renaissance against the Aristotelian influence , in biology the doctrine of natural species continued to be potent ? largely , no doubt , because it  | seemed to be supported by observation . " It is principally from Aristotle , " observes Daudin , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give application , beginning with the Renaissance . . . . Thus it was that from the end of the sixteenth to the end of the eighteenth century , the project of distributing all living beings , animal or vegetable , into a hierarchy of collective units enclosed one within another , gained such a hold upon naturalists , that it finally seemed to them the formulation of their scientific task . " The first of the great modern systematists , Cesalpino , was a sixteenth-century enthusiast for the Peripatetic philosophy , and it seems to have been largely a fresh study of Aristotle 's logical and scientific writings that set him upon the undertaking which he executed in his De Plantis ( 1583 ) . It is true that most of the elaborate " systems " ( as they were called ) which were the most monumental products of biological science in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries , were avowedly , in great part , " artificial " classifications . But the assumption that there really are " natural species , established by the Author of Nature " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , fixed species . And even the artificial systems tended to give the notion of species a peculiar prominence in scientific thought , to encourage the habit of thinking of organisms , and of other natural objects , as falling into well-differentiated classes , rather than as members of a qualitative continuum . There were , nevertheless , at work in the thought of both these centuries two ideas which tended increasingly to discredit the whole notion of species . The first , which is less closely related to our general subject , was the semi-nominalistic strain in the philosophy of Locke . In the Sixth Chapter of Book III of the Essay concerning Human Understanding he had granted that there are " real essences " ? by which he chiefly meant " natures " or attributes of which the " ideas " imply the ideas of other attributes necessarily and a priori , so that one such " nature " is intrinsically incapable of separation from another . In so far as this is the case , there arise class-concepts of which the definitions are inherent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these real essences Locke believed  | that the Creator certainly must be , and the angels possibly may be , acquainted ; but to us mortals knowledge of them has ( with the exception of the essences of mathematical figures and perhaps of moral properties ) not been imparted ; and our conceptions of species are therefore merely " nominal essences , " combinations of ideas of attributes put together by the mind and corresponding to no fixed objective and inherent division between natural things . " Our distinguishing substances into species by names is not at all founded on their real essences ; nor can we pretend to range and determine them exactly into species , according to essential internal differences . " 3 " I do not deny , " says Locke , " but nature , in the constant production of particular beings , makes them not always new and various , but very much alike and of kin to one another ; but I think it nevertheless true that the boundaries of species , whereby men sort them , are made by men . " And thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations of convenience in the use of language . Locke is unable to see " why a shock a breed of shaggy dog and a hound are not as distinct species as a spaniel and an elephant , " ... " so uncertain are the boundaries of species of animals to us. " 4 Even the nominal essence " man " is a term of vague and fluctuating import , which can not be supposed to correspond to " precise and unmovable boundaries set by nature . " It is , in fact , " plain that there is no such thing made by nature , and established by her amongst men . " 5 It is , then , only by virtue of some arbitrary definition framed by us " that we can say : This is a man , this is a drill , " 6 e. , a baboon ; " and in this , I think , consists the whole business of genus and species . " But it is evident from much that has been already said that the principle of continuity tended equally directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potently because it had a still greater body of tradition behind it , and because both of the philosophers who exercised most influence in the early and middle eighteenth century , Leibniz and Locke , had made so much of it . The result was a rejection of the concept of species by some of the greatest naturalists of that age . Buffon in the opening discourse of the Histoire Naturelle ( 1749 ) attacked the entire enterprise of the systematists . There is , he declared ,  | " an error in metaphysics " underlying all attempts to find a " natural " definition of species and thereby to arrive at a " natural " system of classification . " The error consists in a failure to understand nature 's processes ( marche ) , which always take place by gradations ( nuances ) . . . . It is possible to descend by almost insensible degrees from the most perfect creature to the most formless matter . . . . These imperceptible shadings are the great work of nature ; they are to be found not only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the generations and the successions of every species . . . . Thus nature , proceeding by unknown gradations , can not wholly lend herself to these divisions into genera and species ... . There will be found a great number of intermediate species , and of objects belonging half in one class and half in another . Objects of this sort , to which it is impossible to assign a place , necessarily render vain the attempt at a universal system . " The notion of species , then , Buffon concludes , is an artificial and for the biologist a mischievous one : In general , the more one increases the number of one 's divisions , in the case of the products of nature , the nearer one comes to the truth ; since in reality individuals alone exist in nature . ' Buffon , it is true , soon abandoned this position . In the infertility of hybrids he imagined that he had found a proof that species are objective and fundamental realities ? are , indeed , " les seuls etres de la Nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while " an individual , of whatever species , is nothing in the universe . " A species is " a whole independent of number , independent of time ; a whole always living , always the same ; a whole which was counted as one among the works of the creation , and therefore constitutes a single unit in the creation . " 8 Though he subsequently wavered somewhat on this matter , his supposed discovery of a scientific test of difference of " real " species did much for a time to counteract the tendency to which he had at first given his powerful support . ' But Bonnet took up the strain which Buffon had abandoned . Repeating the customary phraseology about the continuity of the chain , Bonnet unequivocally draws the consequence that there are no such things as species :  | If there are no cleavages in nature , it is evident that our classifications are not hers . Those which we form are purely nominal , and we should regard them as means relative to our needs and to the limitations of our knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we place in the same species more varieties than we discover between two individuals of widely separate genera . Thus these intelligences see in the scale of our world as many steps as there are individuals . " Goldsmith , who , it will be remembered , was the author of a popular compendium of natural history , adopted and helped to diffuse this doctrine of the scientific inadmissibility of the concept of species : all " divisions " among the objects of nature " are perfectly arbitrary . The gradation from one order of beings to another , is so imperceptible , that it is impossible to lay the line that shall distinctly mark the boundaries of each . All such divisions as are made among the inhabitants of this globe , like the circles drawn by astronomers on its surface , are the work , not of nature , but of ourselves . " 11 Numerous other illustrations might be given , but it would be tedious to multiply them . Thus the general habit of thinking in terms of species , as well as the sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was beginning to break down in the eighteenth century . In an age in which , more than in any preceding period , the principle of continuity was reckoned among the first and fundamental truths , it could not have been otherwise . And the change was a pregnant one for science and for other provinces of thought . 2 . Even for those biologists who did not explicitly reject the belief in natural species , the principle of continuity was not barren of significant consequences . It set naturalists to looking for forms which would fill up the apparently " missing links " in the chain . Critics of the biological form of this assumption attacked it largely on the ground that many links which the hypothesis required were missing . But the more accepted view was that these gaps are only apparent ; they were due , as Leibniz had declared , only to the incompleteness of the knowledge of nature then attained , or to the minute size of many of the ? presumably lower ? members of the series . The metaphysical assumption thus furnished a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating to the work of the zoologist and the botanist , and especially to that of the microscopist , in the eighteenth century . Every discovery of a new form could be regarded , not as the disclosure of an additional unrelated fact in nature , but as a step towards the completion of a systematic structure of which the general plan was known in advance , an additional bit of empirical evidence of the truth of the generally accepted and cherished scheme of things . Thus the theory of the Chain of Being , purely speculative and traditional though it was , had upon natural history in this period an effect somewhat similar to that which the table of the elements and their atomic weights has had upon chemical research in the past half-century . The general program of the Royal Society , wrote its first historian ( 1667 ) , in an interesting passage in which Platonistic and Baconian motives are conjoined , was to discover unknown facts of nature in order to range them properly in their places in the Chain of Being , and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dependence amongst all the orders of creatures ; the animate , the sensitive , the rational , the natural , the artificial ; that the apprehension of one of them , is a good step towards the understanding of the rest . And this is the highest pitch of humane reason : to follow all the links of this chain , till all their secrets are open to our minds ; and their works advanc 'd or imitated by our hands . This is truly to command the world ; to rank all the varieties and degrees of things so orderly upon one another ; that standing on the top of them , we may perfectly behold all that are below , and make them all serviceable to the quiet and peace and plenty of Man 's life . And to this happiness there can be nothing else added : but that we make a second advantage of this rising ground , thereby to look the nearer into heaven . . . .12 The Encyclopedia in the middle of the eighteenth century also , though in a less devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement of knowledge : Since " everything in nature is linked together , " since " beings are connected with one another by a chain of which we perceive some parts as continuous , though in the greater number of points the continuity escapes us , " the " art of the philosopher consists in adding new links to the separated parts , in order to reduce the distance between them as much as possible . But we must not flatter ourselves that gaps will not still remain in many places . " 13 It  | was , in the eyes of the eighteenth century , a great moment in the history of science when Trembley in 1 739 rediscovered the fresh-water polyp Hydra ( it had already been observed by Leeuwenhoek ) , this creature being at once hailed as the longsought missing link between plants and animals ? for which Aristotle 's vague zoophytes were no longer considered quite sufficient . This and similar discoveries in turn served to strengthen the faith in plenitude and continuity as a priori rational laws of nature ; and the greater credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not having seen , yet had believed in these principles . The chief glory , said a German popularizer of science , a propos of Trembley 's work , is that " of the German Plato Leibniz , who did not live to know of the actual observation " of this organism , " yet through his just confidence in the fundamental principles which he had learned from nature herself , had predicted it before his death . " 14 The quest of organisms not yet actually observed which would fill these lacunae was prosecuted with especial zeal at two points in the scale : near the bottom of it , and in the interval between man and the higher apes . " Nature , " remarked Bonnet , " seems to make a great leap in passing from the vegetable to the fossil i. e. , rock ; there are no bonds , no links known to us , which unite the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms . But shall we judge of the chain of beings by our present knowledge ? Because we discover some interruptions , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these gaps are real ? .. . The gap that we find between the vegetable and the mineral will apparently some day be filled up . There was a similar gap between the animal and the vegetable ; the polyp has come to fill it and to demonstrate the admirable gradation there is between all beings . " But the program of discovering the hitherto unobserved links in the chain played a part of especial importance in the beginnings of the science of anthropology . The close similarity in skeletal structure between the apes and man had early been made familiar ; yet careful zoologists recognized apparent solutions of continuity , anatomical as well as psychological , in this region of the series . Leibniz and Locke had asserted a  | greater degree of continuity than could yet be actually exhibited at this important point . It therefore became the task of science at least to increase the rapprochement of man and ape . " In the first phase of this quest , " as a German historian of eighteenth-century anthropology has pointed out , " the missing link was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held to be not impossible that among the more remote peoples semi-human beings might be found such as had now and then been described in traveller 's narratives . Some voyagers testified to having seen with their own eyes men with tails ; others had encountered tribes incapable of speech . " 15 Linnaeus mentions a homo troglodytes concerning whom it was not established with certainty whether he was more nearly related to the pygmy or the orang-outang ; and a writing of his , not published until long after his death , is entitled The Cousins of Man and speaks of the apes as the " nearest relations of the human race . " 16 This preoccupation with the question of man 's relation to the anthropoids gave an especial " philosophical " interest to the rather numerous descriptions of the Hottentots by late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century voyagers . They were probably the " lowest " savage races thus far known ; and more than one writer of the period saw in them a connecting link between the anthropoids and homo sapiens . An English essayist of 1713 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising and delightful it is " to trace " the scale or gradual ascent from minerals to man , " adds : ' T is easy to distinguish these Kinds , till you come to the highest one , and the lowest of that next above it ; and then the Difference is so nice , that the Limits and Boundaries of their Species seem left unsettled by Nature to perplex the curious , and to humble the proud Philosopher . . . . The Ape or the Monkey that bears the greatest Similitude to Man , is the next Order of Animals below him . Nor is the Disagreement between the basest Individuals of our species and the Ape or Monkey so great , but that , were the latter endow 'd with the Faculty of Speech , they might perhaps as justly claim the Rank and Dignity of the human Race , as the savage Hotentot , or stupid native of Nova Zembla . . . . The most perfect of this Order of Beings , the Orang-Outang , as he is called by the natives of Angola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Woods , has the Honour of Bearing the greatest Resemblance to Human Nature . Tho ' all that Species have some Agreement with us in our Features , many instances being found of Men of Monkey Faces ; yet this has the greatest Likeness , not only in his Countenance , but  | in the Structure of his Body , his Ability to walk upright , as well as on all fours , his Organs of Speech , his ready Apprehension , and his gentle and tender Passions , which are not found in any of the Ape Kind , and in various other respects . 17 Later Rousseau ( 1753 ) and after him Lord Monboddo ( 177o ) took the further step of asserting that man and the higher apes ( the orang-outang or chimpanzee ) are of the same species , language being not originally " natural to man , " but an art which one variety of this species has gradually developed.18 Thus at this point , at least , the continuity of the series was already being construed genetically . Bonnet , too , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hesitate to intimate a doubt whether man and ape are distinct species . The wide interval which separates man from the true quadrupeds is filled by the apes and the animals which most nearly approximate them , of which the species are minutely graduated ( trds-nuancees ) . . . . We ascend as it were by so many steps to a superior or principal species which so closely resembles man that he has received the name of orang-outang , or savage man . It is here above all that it is impossible to fail to recognize the graduated progression of beings ; it is here above all that is verified the famous axiom of the German Plato , Nature makes no leaps . . . . The contemplator of Nature arrives with surprise at a being resembling man so nearly , that the characters which distinguish them seem less the characters of species than of mere varieties . For , as Bonnet goes on to observe , the orang-outang has the size , the members , the carriage , the upright posture of man ; he is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular face , " un vrai visage ; is intelligent enough to use sticks and stones as weapons ; is even " susceptible of education , to the point of acquitting himself creditably of the functions of a valet de chambre " ; and can acquire many other modes of behavior ? including even a sort of politeness ? which have been supposed to be peculiar to man . Whether , in short , we compare his mind or his body with ours , " we are astonished to see how slight and how few are the differences , and how manifold and how marked are the resemblances. " 19 By 176o the triumphs of the missing-link hunters were being celebrated in verse :  | Tous les corps sont lies dans la chaine de l'etre . La Nature partout se precede et se suit . . .

On the last point a piece of conclusive evidence may be cited . No one was ever a better judge of what the public wanted than that eminent practical psychologist , P. T. Barnum ; and it appears that one of the things that the public wanted in the early eighteen-forties ? that is , nearly two decades before the publication of The Origin of Species ? was missing links . For we are told that the great showman in 1842 advertised among the attractions of his Museum , in addition to the " preserved body of a Feejee Mermaid , " other scientific specimens , such as " the Ornithorhincus , or the connecting link between the seal and the duck ; two distinct species of flying fish , which undoubtedly connect the bird and the fish ; the Siren , or Mud Iguana , a connecting link between the reptiles and fish , . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Animated Nature . " 21 We may be pretty sure that if Aristotle had been permitted to return to the sublunary scene in the eighteen-forties , he would have made haste to visit Barnum 's Museum . 3 . We must now turn back to the beginning of that great advance in observational science which began with the invention of efficient microscopes . With the history of the development of this device we are not concerned ; for our purpose it suffices to recall that the microscope began to figure as an important instrument of biological discovery in the second half of the seventeenth century , above all through the work of Antony van Leeuwenhoek . The story of his achievements has often been told , 22 and its details need not be repeated here . What , however , we must not forget is that these disclosures of microbiology ? like the earlier discoveries of the non-biologi-  | cal microscopists ? seemed at once to give fresh empirical corroboration to the principles of plenitude and continuity , and in turn ? for minds with whom these still passed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of micro-organisms was after all nothing more than might have been expected , if those principles were valid ; it might have been deduced a priori even though it had never become sensibly observable . The existence of units of matter , both organic and inorganic , far more minute than the microscope had yet revealed had , in fact , been conjectured a priori before Leeuwenhoek . In a scientific treatise of 1664 the writer , Henry Power , observes : It hath often seem 'd to me beyond an ordinary probability , and something more than fancy , ( however paradoxical the conjecture may seem ) to think that the least bodies we are able to see with our naked eyes , are but middle proportionals ( as it were ) ' twixt the greatest and smallest bodies in nature , which two extremes lye equally beyond the reach of humane sensation : For as on the one side they are but narrow souls , and not worthy the name of Philosophers , that think any Body can be too great or too vast in its dimensions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same litter as the former , that on the other side think the particles of matter may be too little , and that nature is stinted at an Atom , and must have a nonultra of her subdivisions . Such , I am sure , our Modern Engine ( the Microscope ) will ocularly evince and unlearn them their opinions again : for herein you may see what a subtil divider of matter Nature is . Thus , " if the Dioptricks further prevail , " its past achievements will be vastly surpassed ; and though the author , in the sequel , deals chiefly with inanimate bodies , his inference seems clearly to imply a parallel extension of the world of organisms into the region of the infinitely small , in which the " incomparable Stenography of Providence " has produced " the Insectile Automata ( those Living-exiguities ) . " 23 The same logic required this extension of the realm of life downwards which required the hypotheses of the " infinity of worlds " and of inhabited globes within those worlds . The " two infinites " ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same premises . We have seen Fontenelle in the Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes arguing from already known facts of microbiology to the conclusion ?  | itself not susceptible of observational proof ? which he was seeking to establish . Every drop of water is crowded with " petits poissons ou petits serpents que Eon n'aurait jamais soupconnes d'y habiter " , etc . Since , then , " Nature has so liberally disseminated animals upon the earth , " is it to be believed that " after having pushed her fecundity here to excess , she has , in the other planets , been so sterile as to produce upon them no living things ? " 24 And to those who found edification in the common premises of both conclusions , any concrete evidence which tended to confirm either was a welcome verification of supposed metaphysical truths . Observational science , however , played a much greater part in making the general public sensible of this biological implication of the principle of plenitude than it did in persuading them of the truth of the new cosmography . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's imaginations and their feeling about the world they lived in . On the one hand , there was something highly sinister about it ; it presented the ghastly spectacle of a universal parasitism , of life everywhere preying upon life , and of the human body itself as infested with myriads of tiny predatory creatures which made of it their food and sometimes ? as soon began to be conjectured ? their eventual victim.25 On the other hand , it seemed to afford additional and very striking illustrations of the prodigious fecundity of Nature and at the same time of her admirable thrift . Life , it seemed , was ubiquitous . No bit of matter was so small that it could not afford lodging and nutriment for living beings still smaller ; and animate matter itself was everywhere turned to use to sustain yet more animate matter , and this in turn yet more , and so on without ascertainable limit . The microbiologist merely confirmed and illustrated Pope 's description of Nature 's most impressive characteristic : See , thro ' this air , this ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into birth . Above , how high , progressive life may go ! Around , how wide ! How deep extend below ! It was upon the unpleasant side of the picture that the gloomier minds preferred to dwell . It served well Pascal 's pur-  | pose of " lowering " and terrifying man , of making him vividly sensible of his small place in the cosmic scheme and the limitations of his powers of understanding . Swift 's lines on the supposed infinite regress of parasitism are too familiar to quote . This peculiarity of nature was to his mind , no doubt , an illustration of that general nastiness of things on which he was prone to dwell . It was , in the main , on the alarming aspect of the conception of " the two infinites " that Ecouchard-Le Brun poetically dilated : Entre deux infinis 1'Homme en naissant place , Se voit de tous les deux egalement presse . . . . Pour confondre ses yeux qu'effraya 1'Elephant , Le Ciron l'attendait aux confins du Neant.zs But the other imaginative reaction was apparently much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the microscopists , and the assumed existence of micro-organisms far smaller and more numerous than had actually been discovered , provided delightful new evidence of that insatiable generativeness in which the " goodness of God " had , in all the Platonistic philosophies , been held peculiarly to consist ; and there was thus furnished a new incitement to those types of cosmic emotion and piety which had always been associated with the principle of plenitude . The following , for example , which might be supposed to have been written by a late nineteenth- or a twentieth-century bacteriologist in a rhetorical moment , is in fact to be found in one of Addison 's Spectators ( No. 519 ) : Every part of Matter is peopled ; every green Leaf swarms with Inhabitants . There is scarce a single Humour in the Body of a Man , or of any other Animal , in which our Glasses do not discover Myriads of living Creatures . The Surface of Animals is also covered with other Animals , which are in the same manner the Basis of other animals that live upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bodies , as in Marble itself , innumerable Cells and Cavities that are crouded with such imperceptible inhabitants , as are too little for the naked eye to discover . And all of this , for Addison , was a part of that " wonderful and surprising contemplation " which is afforded by the spectacle of the Chain of Being , and a further evidence of " the exuberant and overflowing goodness of the Supream Being , whose  | Mercy extends to all his Works . " Addison even finds in the microbes an argument for the existence of angels or other beings above man in the scale , " since there is an infinitely greater Space and Room for different Degrees of Perfection between the Supreme Being and Man , than between Man and the most despicable Insect . " James Thomson 's emotions were more mixed . On the one hand ? referring as usual to " the mighty chain of beings " ? he is sure that micro-organisms have their necessary and " useful " place in the scheme of things , and he rhapsodizes over the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " full Nature swarms with life . " For him , too , this is a reason to praise that Power Whose wisdom shines as lovely on our minds , As on our smiling eyes his servant Sun . On the other hand , the poet can not but think it fortunate that most of the minuter animals , conceal 'd By the kind art of forming Heaven , escape The grosser eye of man ; for if the worlds On worlds enclosed should on his senses burst , From cates ambrosial , and the nectar 'd bowl , He would abhorrent turn ; and in dead night , When silence sleeps o'er all , be stunn 'd with noise.27 Thus , even in those who accepted the premise of the optimists that the rationality and excellence of nature consist in its " fullness , " there sometimes broke through a feeling that it would be pleasanter if it were not quite so full . Even at the end of the century the principle of plenitude and especially that of continuity are still recognized by Kant in the Kritik der @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sciences , though with the special and important qualifications which followed from the impossibility , implied by the Critical Philosophy , of the detailed completion by our understanding of any such comprehensive synthesis . The former principle is called " the law of specification . . . which requires manifoldness and diversity in things " and " might be expressed by entium varietates non temere esse  | minuendas " ; the latter is " the principle of the affinity of all concepts , which requires a continuous transition from every species to every other species by a gradual increase of diversity . " From it " springs its immediate consequence datur continuum formarum : that is , that the diversities of species touch each other and admit of no transition from one to another per salturn . " This , however , does not " rest upon empirical grounds , " and " no object corresponding to it can be pointed out in experience , " since such a continuum would be infinite , and since the principle does not tell us the " criterion of degrees of affinity " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek for them . " Kant 's conclusion , then , concerning " the famous law of the continuous scale of created beings , " which he ignorantly supposes to have been " brought into vogue by Leibniz , " is that , while " neither observation nor insight into the constitution of nature could ever establish it as an objective affirmation , " nevertheless " the method of looking for order in nature according to such a principle , and the maxim of admitting such order ( though it may be uncertain just where and how far ) as existing in nature , certainly constitute a legitimate and excellent regulative principle of reason . " It " points the way which leads towards a systematic unity of knowledge . " It follows , in short , from the Kantian analysis of the general conditions of the possibility of knowledge that the conception of the Chain of Being , in its fullness and strict continuity , is a controlling " ideal of the reason " which can never be actually satisfied , though science may hope , and should seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empirical evidence of its approximate truth . 28  | WHEN the principle of plenitude was construed either religiously , as an expression of the faith in the divine goodness , or philosophically , as an implicate of the principle of sufficient reason , it was , as usually understood , inconsistent with any belief in progress , or , indeed , in any sort of significant change in the universe as a whole . The Chain of Being , in so far as its continuity and completeness were affirmed on the customary grounds , was a perfect example of an absolutely rigid and static scheme of things . Rationality has nothing to do with dates . If the non-existence of one of the links in the chain would be proof of the arbitrariness of the constitution of the world today , it would have been so yesterday , and would be so tomorrow . As an early eighteenth-century English philosopher put the point : God always acts upon some ground or Reason , and from thence it follows that he had some Reason for Creation , otherwise he never would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reason , that Reason certainly was the same from all Eternity that it was at any particular time : For instance , suppose Goodness was the Ground of his Creation , it follows that if it was good at any particular time , it was equally so from all Eternity . ' This , a contemporary pointed out , if true , must be true not only of the creation in general , but of every kind of being : it implies that , " not only Angels and Men , but every other species of creatures , every Planet with all its Inhabitants , were eternal , " and , what is more , " that God can not hereafter create any new Species of Beings ; because , whatever it is good for him to create in time , it was equally good from all Eternity . " 2 The same implication of optimism was remarked by the poet Henry Brooke , in a prose note to The Universal Beauty ( 1735 ) : Either there is a present absolute fitness in things ; or a fitness in futuro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only relative here to what must be absolute hereafter . But if there were an absolute fitness in the present state  | of things , there could then be no change in anything ; since what is best can never change to better . To many eighteenth-century minds this conception of a world in which , from the beginning , no emergence of novelty had been or would hereafter be possible seems to have been wholly satisfying . The Abbe Pluche , for example , in a widely read popularization of the astronomical knowledge of the time , described the essential immutability of nature as one of the definitive conclusions of philosophy ; and he apparently regarded it as an eminently edifying conclusion . No doubt , he grants , the work of creation was in a sense progressive until man was produced . But with him the consummation to which all the earlier phases had been preparatory was reached . Nothing more , therefore , will be produced in all the ages to follow . All the philosophers have deliberated and come to agreement upon this point . Consult the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never vary , seeds and germs prepared in advance for the perpetuation of everything , . . . so that one can say , Nothing new under the sun , no new production , no species which has not been since the beginning . ' This assumption sometimes was used early in the century against the then incipient science of paleontology . The view that fossils are the remains of actual organisms now extinct was combated on the ground that , in a well-conducted universe , every species must be constantly represented ; so wrote the great English botanist John Ray in 1703 : It would follow , That many species of Shell-Fish are lost out of the World , which Philosophers hitherto have been unwilling to admit , esteeming the Destruction of any one Species a dismembring of the Universe , and rendring it imperfect ; whereas they think the Divine Providence is especially concerned to secure and preserve the Works of the Creation.4 This conclusion was both supported and extended by the reigning embryological theory of preformation or emboitement which declared that not only all species but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , ' unlike the species , seem to increase in numbers and to undergo change , but in reality this is a mere expansion or unfolding ' ( evolutio ) of structures and characters that were already pre-delineated , on a minute scale of magnitude , in the primeval germs which lay encased one within another like a  | nest of boxes . As Brooke poetically phrased it , the Creative Omnipotence could infinitude confine , And dwell Immense within the minim shrine : The eternal species in an instant mould And endless worlds in seeming atoms hold , Plant within plant , and seed enfolding seed.5 Thus an important group of the ruling ideas of the early eighteenth century ? the conception of the Chain of Being , the principles of plenitude and continuity on which it rested , the optimism which it served to justify , the generally accepted biology ? all were in accord with the supposedly Solomonic dictum , which many others besides Pluche were wont to cite as an inspired confirmation of the conclusions of philosophy and science . There not only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sun . The process of time brings no enrichment of the world 's diversity ; in a world which is the manifestation of eternal rationality , it could not conceivably do so . Yet it was in precisely the period when this implication of the old conceptions became most apparent that there began a reaction against it . For one of the principal happenings in eighteenth-century thought was the temporalizing of the Chain of Being . The plenum formarum came to be conceived by some , not as the inventory but as the program of nature , which is being carried out gradually and exceedingly slowly in the cosmic history . While all the possibles demand realization , they are not accorded it all at once . Some have attained it in the past and have apparently since lost it ; many are embodied in the kind of creatures which now exist ; doubtless infinitely many more are destined to receive the gift of actual existence in the ages that are to come . It is only of the universe in its entire temporal span that the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry ; and his goodness is sufficiently exhibited if , soon or late , every Idea finds its manifestation in the sensible order . The causes of this change were of several sorts ; but the one which is most pertinent to our subject lay in the difficulties to which the principle of plenitude itself , as it had traditionally  | been interpreted , gave rise , when its implications were fully drawn out and seriously considered . Those implications were , on the one hand , intolerable to the religious feelings of many minds ; and , on the other hand , it became increasingly apparent that they were hard to reconcile with the facts known about nature . The static and permanently complete Chain of Being broke down largely from its own weight . Let us note the religious and moral difficulties first . The fatal defect of optimism ? and of the principle of plenitude upon which its dialectic chiefly depended ? was that which we have seen Voltaire pointing out : it left no room for hope , at least for the world in general or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required by the universal good , and if the universe is and always has been perfectly good , we can not expect that any of the partial evils will disappear . Logically thorough-going optimism is equivalent to the doctrine of the Conservation of Evil , metaphysical , moral , and physical ; the sum of imperfection in the parts must remain constant , since it is in the realization of just that sum that the perfection of the whole consists . But to minds whose sense of the reality of the concrete evils of existence was too profound to be alleviated by a syllogism , this optimistic paradox was a grotesque mockery . It was better to admit the world to be not at present entirely rational , and retain some hope of its amendment , than to conceive of it as perfectly rational ? and utterly hopeless . For the individual , it is true , the principle of plenitude did not necessarily exclude a prospect of attaining a higher state of being in another life . Though the permanent structure of the world consisted of a fixed set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was not impossible for the inmate of one hole to transfer to a better one . But to this possibility there was attached ? according to the interpretation given the principle by some of its most approved expositors ? a strange condition . Those of " the inferior orders " in the universe , Edmund Law pointed out , " could not aspire to a higher station without detriment to the superior which possesses that station ; for he must quit his place before another an ascend to it . " Hence , though a man by the right exercise of his moral freedom might " become fit and qualified for a  | superior state , " he could not be promoted to it until a vacancy occurred through the " degradation " of one of those above him , as a consequence of wrong-doing . This was a strictly consistent deduction from the theory , if it was assumed that each degree of possible difference can have only one representative at a time ; and this assumption was required by the principle of the identity of indiscernibles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the same creature . But the consequence that no one can ever rise in the world except at the cost of another 's fall was , it is evident , a morally monstrous one . The optimist 's proof of the rationality of the general constitution of things turned out to be a proof of its essential immorality . A revolt against these two implications of the scheme , then , was inevitable , as soon as they became fully apparent . The Chain of Being must perforce be reinterpreted so as to admit of progress in general , and of a progress of the individual not counterbalanced by deterioration elsewhere . And on the other hand , the traditional conception , when so reinterpreted , suggested a new eschatology , or rather the revival of an old one . Since the scale was still assumed to be minutely graduated , since nature makes no leaps , the future life must be conceived to be ? at least for those who use their freedom rightly ? a gradual ascent , stage after stage , through all the levels above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these levels between man and the one Perfect Being must be infinite , that ascent can have no final term . The conception of the destiny of man as an unending progress thus emerges as a consequence of reflection upon the principles of plenitude and continuity . This revision of the traditional eschatology had been foreshadowed in the previous century by Henry More . Inasmuch as natura non facit saltus , the dead , he inferred , do not leap immediately from their terrestrial imperfection to celestial beatitude ; nor need the plenitude of being be supposed to be realized simultaneously . A Musician strikes not all strings at once ; neither is it to be expected that everything in Nature at every time should act ; but when it is its turn , then touched upon it will give the sound ; in the interim it lies silent.6  | Addison , whom we have already found descanting with a kind of poetic rapture upon the notion of the Chain of Being , was led by it to reject even more sharply than More the orthodox Protestant conception of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changeless misery . He wrote in the Spectator in 1711 : Among . . . other excellent arguments for the immortality of the soul , there is one drawn from the perpetual progress of the soul to its perfection , without a possibility of ever arriving at it ; which is a hint that I do not remember to have seen opened and improved by others who have written on this subject , though it seems to me to carry a great weight with it . ' We must believe , Addison declares , that the several generations of rational creatures , which rise up and disappear in such quick successions , are only to receive their first rudiments of existence here , and afterwards to be transplanted into a more friendly climate , where they may spread and flourish to all eternity . There is not , in my opinion , a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion than this of the perpetual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature , without ever arriving at a period in it . To look upon the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is to shine forever with new accessions of glory , and brighten to all eternity , that she will be still adding virtue to virtue and knowledge to knowledge ; carries with it something that is wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man . Nay , it must be a prospect pleasing to God himself , to see his Creation ever beautifying in hit eyes , and drawing nearer to him , by greater degrees of resemblance . This conception of an endless prospect of bettering one 's position in the universe , a prospect equally open to all rational beings , evidently attracted Addison partly because it rid the picture of the Scale of Being of that look of irremediable inequality which it had in its usual form . Methinks this single consideration , of the progress of a finite spirit to perfection , will be sufficient to extinguish all envy in inferior natures , and all contempt in superior . That Cherubim , which now appears as a God to a human soul , knows very well that the period will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as perfect as he himself now is ; nay , when she shall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as she now falls short of it . The Scale of Being thus becomes literally a ladder , with an infinite number of rungs , up which individual souls forever  | climb . In so far as all do so at an equal pace , the hierarchical order remains and the relative positions do not alter : It is true , the higher nature still advances , and by that means preserves his distance and superiority in the Scale of Being ; but he knows that how high soever the position is of which he stands possess 'd at present , the inferior nature will at length mount up to it and shine forth in the same degree of glory . Leibniz , a few years later , concludes his Principles of Nature and of Grace ( 1718 ) with the assurance that no man is destined ever fully to attain the beatific vision : Our happiness will never consist , and ought not to consist , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desire , and which would make our mind dull , but in a perpetual progress to new pleasures and new perfections.8 This reconstruction of the doctrine of immortality is manifest also in the same writing in which the melancholy consequences of the argument for optimism had been so frankly deduced . Edmund Law , a divine sufficiently orthodox to attain a bishopric in his own subsequent ascent of the Scale of Being , finds himself unable to accept the conclusion which Archbishop King 's logic and his own required . For he appends to the seemingly triumphant conclusion of the argument ? namely , that " the present state of the world is the very best that could be " ? a footnote , in which he raises the question " whether God may be supposed to have placed any order of beings in such a fixed , unalterable condition as not to admit of advancement ; to have made any creatures as perfect at first as the nature of a created being is capable of . " The answer , Law thinks , is not altogether " easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affirmative " argue from our notion of infinite or absolute goodness , which must excite the Deity always to communicate all manner of happiness in the very highest degree for the same reason that it prompts him to communicate it ever in any degree . But this , they say , he had not done , except he at first endowed some creatures with all the perfection a creature could possibly receive and gave to every subordinate class of beings the utmost happiness their several natures were capable of . " Law himself , however , in-  | clines to the contrary view : " though it may appear something like a paradox , " he thinks it " will perhaps upon further consideration , be judged not improbable . " For a creature . . . to meet with a perpetual accession of new , unknown pleasure , . . . and to be always approaching nearer and nearer to perfection ? this must certainly advance the sum of its happiness even above that of others whose condition is supposed to have begun and to have ended in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any end in either ) , and which never knew defect , variety , or increase . A finite being fixed in the same state , however excellent , must according to all our conceptions ( if we be allowed to judge from our present faculties , and we can judge from nothing else ) contract a kind of indolence or insensibility . . . which nothing but alteration and variety can cure . It does not , therefore , seem probable that God has actually fixed any created beings whatsoever in the very highest degree of perfection next to himself . Nay , it is impossible to conceive of such a highest degree , and the supposition is absurd , since that which adrnits of a continual addibility can have no highest . . . . God will , then , we believe never produce any beings in such a state as shall not have room enough for them to be still growing in felicity and forever acquiring new happiness , together with new perfection.9 This change in the form of the belief in a future life was closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological observation , a generalization about human nature , which was a favorite one with just those philosophers who loved most to dilate upon the principle of plenitude . Man , it was remarked , is capable of happiness only through perpetual alteration . At the opening of Bruno 's Spaccio delta bestia trionfante , which had been englished in 1713 and was much read and admired in the eighteenth century , " Wisdom " appears and utters these words : If there was no change in bodies , no variety in matter , and no vicissitude in beings , there would be nothing agreeable , nothing good , nothing pleasant . . . . Pleasure and satisfaction consists in nothing else but a certain passage , progress , or motion from one state to another . . . . We can have no delight in anything present till we have been first weary of what is past . . . . The change from one extreme to another , with all the intervals , moving from one contrary to another by all the intermediate spaces , is sure to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Leibniz ; e. g. , " This is the very law of enjoyment , that pleasure  | does not have an even tenor , for this begets loathing , and makes us dull , not happy . " 11 The principal historical significance of all this lies in the fact that it exhibits the emergence and diffusion of a way of thinking about the nature of the good which was to unite with that which we have already seen resulting from the logic of optimism . The new eschatology was the manifestation of a second new conception of value . The Platonic identification of the consummate good with airapKeta and cessation of desire ? " he who possesses it has always the most perfect sufficiency and is never in need of anything else " ? was giving place to its opposite : no finality , no ultimate perfection , no arrest of the outreach of the will . Such passages as those which I have quoted from Leibniz and Addison and Law were plainly foreshadowings of the Faust-ideal . Man is by nature insatiable , and it is the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no moment of his experience can he , if true to his nature and his vocation , ever say : " Verweile doch , du bist so schon ! " The tendency to substitute the ideal of a Streben nach dem Unendlichen , an interminable pursuit of an unattainable goal , for that of a final rest of the soul in the contemplation of Perfection , an assimilation to " the peace which makes quiet the centre " of heaven in Dante 's vision of the Celestial Paradise ? this tendency has usually been post-dated by historians . It was no invention of Goethe , nor of the German Romanticists , nor even of Lessing , but had been expressed repeatedly throughout the century , both by eminent philosophers and universally read men of letters ; and it was closely associated in their minds with the accepted idea of the Scale of Being , which had long been more vaguely described by theologians of unimpeachable orthodoxy as the course of the mind 's ascent to God . In Lenz 's essay on the First Principles of Morals ( 1772 ) may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Romantic strain , then soon to burst forth in full volume . He has been defining the nature of the " urge towards completeness " ( Volkommenheit ) , which he declares to be one of the fundamental impulses in human nature . This completeness consists in the full development of all " the powers and capacities which Nature has implanted in us . " But two qualifications , both of  | them connected in Lenz 's mind with the principles of plenitude and continuity , are attached to this ethical ideal of self-realization. ( 1 ) " We have learned in our Age of Enlightenment that among our faculties some are superior  --  those of the mind ? and that to these so-called higher faculties of the soul the others should be subordinated . In this proportionality , therefore , should we seek to cultivate and develop them . But since all of them stand in an inseparable , infinitely minute connection with one another , 12 the others i. e. , the lower ' are no more to be neglected than the higher ? and this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) But for both the race and the individual the same principle demands a perpetual rejection of the status quo , an endless ascent of the Scale of Being . Take heed that I am speaking here of a human perfection . I hope that the reproach will not here be brought against me that , since God created the first men good , they must , on my view , have required no morality , i. e. , conscious moral effort . Good , ' in the case of the earliest men , meant perfectible , not perfect , for otherwise there would have been no fall . All creatures from the worm to the seraph must be capable of perfecting themselves , else they would cease to be finite creatures , and would lose themselves , in accordance with the Platonic conception , in the infinite and perfect Being.13 This is one of the numerous eighteenth-century anticipations of Emerson 's familiar couplet : Striving to be man , the worm Mounts through all the spires of form . While , in an age in which many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious and ethical application of the conception tended , of itself , to promote a kindred change in scientific ideas , the latter was enforced also by reasons of a less speculative kind . One of these was the difficulty , not to say the impossibility , of seeing in extant organic types the degree of continuity which the theory required . Nature as now observable did not appear to present even a segment of the chain which was complete and unbroken . This objection was made much of by those few writers who were bold enough to attack the whole assumption of the plenitude of the creation . In the
