A tall , spindling girl with bare legs and a Buster Brown haircut bowed her way on to Manhattan 's Town Hall stage one night last week , tucked a violin under her chin and with rare self-possession proceeded to establish herself as one of the promising prodigies of the 1935-36 season . She was Marjorie Edwards , 13 , of San Jose , Calif. , who traveled East for the first time last summer to play at the Berkshire Festival . This time she was back to face the test of a more formal dbut . <P> Most experienced critics have little patience with the rank &; file of young musicians who want to play in public . Marjorie Edwards was well above the average . She exhibited a real flair for the violin , fast-flying fingers that found the notes surely , an earnest sensitive approach to the music she played . Even so , finicky critics refused to pronounce her ripe for a concert career . The quality of her tone was often small and immature , best suited to the soft feathery Cuckoo which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it twice . <P> Unlike many a prodigy , young Marjorie Edwards is a natural , unthwarted person who rides a bicycle , collects stamps , wishes she could tap dance better than she does , reveres Yehudi Menuhin . Her father is an automobile salesman in San Jose , her mother a piano teacher who has given lessons to the grocer 's child and taken food for pay . Young Marjorie drummed out piano scales long before she was given her first violin . But the fiddle revealed her talent . At 9 she had progressed so far that she was taken the 60 miles to San Francisco several times a week to study with Kathleen Parlow , who suggested the first trip East . Indomitable Mrs. Edwards was easy to convince . Money was scarce but there was the 10-year-old , seven-passenger Marmon and Son Carl , 16 , to drive it . The Edwards motored East to the Berkshire Festival , motored back again as far as Lovelock , Nev. , where the Marmon caught fire . Of the baggage nothing was saved except Marjorie 's violin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been Hilda Margot Betty Ros , a 10-year-old , olive-skinned Cuban , chosen by Conductor Leopold Stokowski to play the Mozart E Flat Concerto at his first Children 's Concert . The Mozart concerto demands a sensitive hairline delicacy , particularly suited to young Margot 's style of playing . With the praise she received , the Cuban prodigy could have gone on to make flashy headlines . Instead , she stuck to her studies at the Curtis Institute of Music , lives in one room with her mother , father , two sisters . A subsidy from the Cuban Government barely gives them enough to eat . <P> In Los Angeles the pick of the prodigy crop seemed to be Felix Abcede , 9 , a chubby , black-haired Filipino who played last December in the Philharmonic auditorium , created such a furor that he was perched on a chair to receive autograph hounds . Young Felix was scheduled to play in San Francisco soon afterwards . That concert never came off because his parents were at odds and his teacher raised a fracas . Victim was the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy . Often he has been told that he is greater than Heifetz or Kreisler.
