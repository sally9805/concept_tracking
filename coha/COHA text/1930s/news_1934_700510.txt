txt To preserve the five-cent fare and to safeguard the position of the City of New York in the negotiations for the subway unification , a bill will be introduced in the Senate and Assembly tomorrow amending the Public Service Law . The bill would permit the cityoperated subway to be run at a loss Until Sept. 10 , 1937 . For the same period the city would be permitted to meet all debt service charges on lines already completed out of the tax budget instead of being compelled to issue securities . The new legislation , it was pointed out today by Corporation Counsel Paul Windels , was made necessary by the decision of the Court of Appeals prohibiting the city from using tax funds for debt service on lines already under operation and requiring the lines to be put on a self-sustaining basis by September , 1935 . Would Aid Unification . Not only would the law as interp .. eted by the courts if remaining unamended seriously add to the financial embarrassment of the city , according to Mr. Windels , but it would seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Samuel Seabury . Under the terms of the court decision , it was said , the city would almost certainly be compelled to raise the fare on the Eighth Avenue subway , and to protect itself against inequitable competition would be compelled to endorse an increase of the fare on the privately operated : in es . In one quarter It was suggested that the law limiting the initial trial period on city-owned and operated subways to three years , back in 1924 , was a " trap " to make a higher fare compulsory . Mr. Win-1 dels would not comment on this suggestion beyond saying that itJ did not represent the official attitude of the city administration . Windels Explains City 's Plight . In discussing the situation , Mr. Windels , after consulting Mayor LaGuardia and Mr. Seabury , made public the following statement : " If the law as interpreted by the courts is permitted to stand , the city will be seriously handicapped in its effort to work out a unification plan on a reasonable basis and the five-cent fare on all subway lines will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1935 , is obliged by law to increase the fare on the Eighth Avenue subway ( a portion of an uncompleted system ) , to a point necessary to make the project self-liquidating and self-sustaining , undoubtedly the privately owned subway companies believe that the city would be forced to consent to a corresponding increase in fare on their lines . " The private companies figure that otherwise an increase in fare on one line alone would result in a corresponding loss in business with no increase in gross revenue and that they stand to win either way : either by an increase in business resulting from a differential in fare , or else by an increase in fare to themselves to avoid a redistribution in traffic , which would follow from an increase in fare on the Eighth Avenue line alone . " The mere possibility of this would definitely handicap the city in the pending unification negotia-1 tions . The city is determined not to be placed in a position of trying to I carry on the negotiations with a gun at our heads . ' The implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appellate Division made its decision which ordered the city to ex- ' elude from its budget the deficit from the Eighth Avenue subway . The correction of this situation by legislation was then discussed by Mayor-elect LaGuardia and his advisers , and it was decided to postpone that ( : fort until the Court of Appeals had an opportunity to review the decision of the Appellate Division . " The 1924 legislation provided that a municipally operated subway could be operated at a five-cent fare for three years from the date of beginning operation . After that period the rate must be readjusted so as to render it adequate to meet the following requirements : Operating expenses , exclusive of maintenance ; expenses of maintenance and repairs of structures and equipment , exclusive of depreciation ; contributions to a depreciation fund for replacement or renewal of worn-out , obsolete or inadequate units of structure or equipment ; the amount of interest actually payable on the debt incurred or obligations issued on account of the line ; contributions to a sinking fund for amortization and retirement of the debt . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines " not more " than 5 cents instead of ' ' 5 cents " as provided under the statute now in force . This , it was held , might permit the city to reduce its fare below that figure to compete more effectively with the privately operated lines . This , it was contended , would make the private companies more likely to accept unification terms favorable to the city . It was said that there was no prospect that the city would engage in what might be termed " unfair " competition with the Interborough and the B. M. T. subway lines . LaGuardia Calls Conference . The details of the legislative and financial steps to be taken to relieve the city of burdens imposed by the recent decision of the Court of Appeals will be discussed at a conference at City Hall this morning , to be attended by Mayor LaGuardia and his financial and transit advisers . Mayor LaGuardia conferred briefly yesterday with City Chamberlain A. A. Berle Jr . and John H. Delaney , chairman of the Board of Transportation , regarding the decision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be put forward at the conference , it is understood , will be to seek legislation which will permit the city to operate its new subway lines on a fivecent fare basis , with no limiting trial period , and with permission to meet all debt service charges out of tax funds , if necessary . Some of Mayor LaGuardia 's advisers , however , believe that such a bill would meet with too strenuous an opposition , and therefore favor merely a two-year extension of the trial period , but with the city having power to pay debt service on subway bonds out of tax funds during that time . Mayor LaGuardia made no secret of his belief that the decision , unless offset by legislation , has placed the city in " a very disadvantageous position " in its efforts to bring about speedy unification of rapid transit lines . It represented , he said , a " net gain " for the traction companies and fortified their trading position in unification parleys . Controller W. Arthur Cunningham has been instructed to work out , pending the enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service under the court 's decision . Mayor LaGuardia indicated that the city may have to buy such securities as may be issued , because of the lack of an open market for them . No ranking city official , however , cared to enter into detailed discussion of the matter , either from the standpoint of the effect on the city budget or on the transit unity question . Harold Riegelman , counsel for the Citizens Budget Commission , who argued the case before the Court of Appeals on behalf of the suing taxpayers , declared that there was no sound reason for the consternation which the ruling apparently has created in official circles . " The decision does not necessarily mean a higher fare , " he said . " It does not unbalance the budget . It does not complicate the city 's transit problems . " The decision , he declared , means that the taxpayers will save some $33,000,000 this year and next because $7,500,000 expended in the 1933 budget must be restored to the general fund , $11,000,000 stricken ' from the 1934 budget and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums , representing debt service on subway bonds , must be raised by the sale of temporary certificates of indebtedness , under the State law .
