txt With the price of soft coal today so low that a ton at pit mouth is worth not much more than a box of chocolates , with mine wages at new low levels , and a majority of mine operators admittedly losing money , the group of bituminous coal men who conferred yesterday with Mr. Robert P. Lamont , secretary of Commerce and Mr. William N. Doak , Secretary of Labor on the troubles of the industry nevertheless concluded that little could be done at present to case conditions by a general conference . While no formal decision was taken to this effect , individual operators made it clear that they oppose a national coal parley proposed by Mr. John L. Lewis , head of the United Mine Workers of America . With virtual refusal of operators to attend such a conference , President Hoover Is not expected to summon it , following in this respect the precedent set in a similar case by President Coolidge , who declined to call a national meeting some years back because operators refused to attend . The feeling ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that 70 per cent of coal mining cost represents labor expenses and any national conference would inevitably bring up the question of higher wages , which oWners fee ) they could not grant at the present time . In the meantime one-third of the nation 's mines are said to have been closed . and an army of more than 200.000 miners forced out of jobs , to the accompaniment of violent strikes now going on In various states . A brief statement was issued by Mr. Lamont at the conclusion of his conference with 14 representatives of operators in which he declared 1,13 effort had been made to roach a final decision on any ' question brought up ..

" It was evident from Mr. Borich 's statement that he had been misled as to its purpose by earlier reports carried by press associations to the effect that the conference was intended to bring operators and heads of the workers together . Actually , the conference was simply between the operators and the Government . The Emrich statement was a general aliround denunciation of the operators , the Adiministration and the mine workers , which is affiliated with the A. F. of L. The Borich statement said the National Miners ' Union wanted to " protest against this conference as a conspiracy of the Hoover-Mellon government , the operators and the United Mine Workers of America to break the present strikes of the miners in Pennsylvania , Ohio , West Virginia , Kentucky and Illinois .

Bitter warfare has been launched between the National Miners ' Union , on the one hand , and the conservative Lewis organization on the other . For example , a recent strike of workers of the Pittsburgh Terminal Coal Company , started by the national union , was seized by the united as an opportunity to take the strikers into its own camp , and it has signed an agreement with the company under which the men go back to work , under union conditions . ? Higher wages and return of the miners ' check welghman are the obj  --  etives of the rival unions . Mr. Borich in his statement painted a dark picture of conditions In the isolated coal valleys . Impartial and independent sources substantiate Mr. Borich 's statement in so far as it appears that human suffering is actually aiding in the spread of Communism in those areas .
