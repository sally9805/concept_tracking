txt Faced with a relief crisis fully as acute as that of two months ago , the Fusion administration staved off yesterday the necessity of stopping relief payments for a week by obtaining a $1,000,000 loan from the banks . By the time the $1,000,000 is spent , or within ten days , it is believed that a new tax program , one that will insure the raising of adequate revenues to carry on the program for the next ten months , will have been decided on by the administration and the Democratic leaders of the Board of Aldermen . If such an agreement is reached , it is understood , the banks- will lend more money in. anticipation of collection of the new taxes . Controller Joseph D. , who negotiated the last-minute loan , Mayor LaGuardia and other administration leaders were confident yesterday that a satisfactory tax program would be worked out with the Aldermen now that the election is over . The banks , it is said , do not wish to dictate to the city as to what the new tax or taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Taxes Under Consideration . In view of the need of raising upward of $40,000,000 by the new tax program , it was said , only taxes with a sufficiently broad base will be considered . There are only four such taxes under consideration , it was learned , a city-wide sales tax , a payroll tax , a transit tax and a materially increased gross business tax . Two months ago when the city faced a similar crisis the bankers clearly indicated they felt the sales tax and/or the payroll tax to be the best way of raising the money . They held the business tax plan to be inadequate and the transit tax to be of doubtful legality . Since then , however , it is believed sentiment for a transit tax has increased among the bankers , doubt . of the legality of the plan having diminished . At the time of the September crisis , after weeks of wrangling the Municipal Assembly finally adopted a one-tenth of 1 per cent business tax and a tax of 15 per cent of the Federal income taxes paid in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan secured 1by the business tax reI ceipts , a loan which he increased by $1,000,000 yesterday . The banks have always questioned the validity of the income tax and have refused to lend money in anticipation of its collection . It costs the city , inciI dentally , about $1,000,000 a week for its share of the relief program . So serious is the situation in which the city now finds itself that the Controller was forced yesterday to cancel plans for a brief vacation in Bermuda . He will stay in the city until the question of imposing new taxes is threshed out . He had booked passage for yesterday . LaGuardia Is Optimistic . Mayor LaGuardia was optimistic as to the outcome of the present crisis . He expressed confidence that an adequate tax program would be agreed to and promptly passed . He and his supporters are expected to confer with the Aldermanic leaders on Tuesday and they hope , it was learned , that the Board of Aldermen will pass the tax bills decided upon by the end of the week . " There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is the same situation which came into being when the Board of Aldermen failed to pass the Mayor 's tax program ( a one-half of 1 per cent gross business tax ) . " Additional funds must be  --  found , and that was known by the Board of Aldermen then . I have been in conference with Aldermanic leaders and they fully understand the situation . " As far as the Controller was concerned , he made no attempt to disguise the seriousness of the crisis , at the same time expressing confidence that the situation would right itself . " The city had come practically to the end of its relief resources today , " he said in announcing the new loan . " The $1,000,000 which the banks have agreed to loan will carry us for a week and enable us within that time to consult with the Aldermanic leaders with a view to obtaining adequate legislation to support relief for the balance of this year and through next year . " The Aldermen are in agreement as to the need of a tax program adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over I am confident that the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen can come to an agreement on such a tax program . The need for such a program was made clear to them throughout the Summer and particularly at the time of the passage of the business excise and income taxes . The attitude of the banks was stated in the letter which they addressed to the city on Sept. 25 , and their position is reaffirmed in the letter sent to me by Mr. Aldrich after this morning 's conference . " I informed the Mayor this afternoon of my success in obtaining the additional loan and he and I will take this matter up with the Aldermanic leaders on Tuesday . " MR . ALDRICH 'S LETTER . The Controller made public a letter received by him yesterday afternoon from the banking group with which he had negotiated the loan a few hours before . The letter , signed by Winthrop W. Aldrich , chairman of the board of the Chase National Bank , expressed confidence that the banks would meet the city 's relief needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : New York City , November 10 , 1934 . Hon. Joseph D. , Controller of the City of New York , Municipal Building , New York City . Dear Mr. Controller : At the conference which we had ? =ith you this morning you laid before us the fact that the City of New York will require additional funds for the purpose of meeting the expenses of unemployment relief within the next few days . On September 25 , 1934 , we addressed a letter to the Mayor , a copy of which is attached , in which we reviewed the various proposals which were then being considered by the Joint Committee of the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen to meet the unemployment relief needs of the city . Since that date the Municipal , Assembly has passed certain tax bills which you realize are entirely inadequate to meet the situation and as a consequence another crisis has arisen with respect to emergency relief funds . We are confident that the banking community will be prepared to advance funds against taxes which are adequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the meantime , in order to be helpful . we are prepared to advance $1,000,000 additional against the business tax so as to give time for the passage of a tax bill which will be adequate . The following gentlemen have authorized me to sign this letter to you on behalf of all of us : Mr. George Whitney , J. P. Morgan &; Co. ; Mr. B. A. Tompkins , Bankers Trust Company ; Mr. Samuel A. Welldon . First National Bank ; Mr. William C. Potter , Guaranty Trust Company ; Mr. Gordon S. Rentschler , National City Bank . Yours very truly , WINTHROP W. ALDRICH , Chairman of the Board of Directors Chase National Bank of the City of New York . In their letter of Sept. 25 the bankers expressed full agreement with the Fusion administration 's stand that relief funds should be obtained from current revenues and not by long-term borrowing . They pointed out that the $50,000,000 the city estimated at the time that it needed should be raised by means of taxes which would insure enough money and which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six proposals were under consideration  --  the city lottery , since vetoed by the Mayor ; the tax of 15 per cent upon Federal income tax payments , now law ; an increased business tax , also now law ; a payroll tax , a city-wide sales tax and a transit tax . In the September letter the bankers frowned on the lottery , terming its legality doubtful . The city income tax plan they considered " totally inadequate . " The business tax increase , too , ? they held to be inadequate . As to the remaining three , the bankers at the time expressed the belief that , there was serious question as to the legality of the transit tax proposal and that in any event it faced prompt attack in the courts . Before such a tax is adopted , the bankers said then , all doubts of its legality should be removed . " As to the two Remaining methods of taxation as referred to above , " the letter said , " namely , the payroll tax and the sales tax , the best information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to produce the amount required without attempting to rely I upon other sources doubtful as to legality or as to yield . " It is estimated that-adoption of a tax program along these lines can be made to produce the $50,000,000 required for relief during the next twelve months . The banks understand that collections can not keep pace week in and week out with relief disbursements and are prepared to finance these disbursements , making advances to the city as required with the yield of these new taxes providing . the necessary means for repayment . " The policy adopted by you that the entire relief program should be financed on the pay-as-you-go basis is , in our opinion , eminently sound . Our attitude with regard to the necessity for adequate taxes is governed by the desire to insure the continuity of relief . We , therefore , believe it highly important that the I Board of Estimate add the Board . of Aldermen reconsider their tax program in order to develop one which is demonstrably adequate to provide for the full amount necessary for this purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no comment on their position . It was indicated , however , that the city has been fully apprised of their views and that conferences will be held with city officials this week . It was said that the banking group is inclined to frown on any attempt to raise all the relief money needed by an increased gross business tax . How this will fit in with the Mayor 's views could not be learned . In September the Mayor fought for a one-half of 1 per cent business tax , a proposal that met with the bitter opposition of business groups , which pointed out that it might easily add to unemployment by imposing an unfair burden on business concerns that were in the red or that were barely making a profit . Some suggestion has been made that the needed money be raised by the passage of an omnibus tax bill made up of a number of minor taxes , such as bridge tolls . There is little likelihood , however , that such a plan will be adopted , if for no other reason that there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes that would make up such a bill . Opposition to New Taxes . There will be opposition to any tax program . City officials take that for granted . They were inclined to feel , it was learned , that it would be far better to bring forward only one tax plan , probably a payroll or sales tax , on the theory that there would be only half as much opposition to one tax as to two , ? even if the two divided the load . Aldermanic President Bernard S. Deutsch , like the Mayor and the Controller , was confident that the situation would be worked out . " By the middle , of December the city will have a definite tax program , " he predicted . " There has been a general discussion by city officials on various methods of raising additional revenues , but I am not in a position to make these proposed plans public at this time . " According to Mr. Deutsch the city needs $5,000,000 to carry on its relief program until Dec. 15 . There is now $13,000,000 due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , the delay in State payments being caused , he assumed , by slowness of tax payments . Inquiry Hears Hodson . ? The Aldermanic Committee which is investigating administration of city relief resumed its inquiry yesterday at City Hall while the loan negotiations were in progress . Welfare Commissioner William Hodson , the only witness , continued his recital of the set-up of his relief administration . It has been charged on the floor of the Board of Aldermen that relief administration has been inefficient and wasteful and that the whole organization is /honeycombed with higlvsalaried executives . Mr. Deutsch , the committee chairman , presided at the hearing . Present , but taking no part , were representatives of Governor Lehman 's relief investigating committee and two members of the relief inquiry group recently named by the Mayor . I The Mayor has not yet named the full personnel of his committee but he has designated George Z. Medalie , Charles Johnson and Mrs. Justin Wise Tulin , an assistant corporation counsel , to sit in at the aldermanic hearings . The representatives of the Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the two-and-a-half hour session , Mr. Deutsch outlined briefly what had occured . " Mr. Hodson explained the operation of both the home and work relief departments , " he said , " as well as the methods of determining the amounts to be appropriated by the city for each month , based on the estimates of the TERA and the FERA . The methods used in the distribution of food , clothing and fuel were explained . We were just delving into the medical and nursing division when an adjournment was taken . " The . Welfare Commissioner was questioned as to probable wastage in the distribution of food and clothing and the probable loss through the sale of food tickets by dishonest recipients , Mr. Deutsch added . The next hearing will be held Tuesday morning .
