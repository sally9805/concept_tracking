 |p493  AFTER 20 years of absence , I went back to visit a valley in Norway where my father had practiced medicine when I was a boy . Nobody would know me , I thought . To my surprise the bus driver refused my fare , the innkeeper politely returned my money , and for a week I had to accept free board , room , and fishing privilege . Your father treated the poor people here for nothing , " explained the local councilman , " and no man in this valley will accept your money . " That is the spirit of rural Norway . Hordes of visitors swarm each year to see the fjords and glaciers , and the cities in which life differs little from that in other cities of northern Europe ; but it is the back country , with its farm , forest , and village life , that reveals the real Norway . NORTHERNMOST CIVILIZED COUNTRY Mountainous Norway , stretching for 1.100 miles between 58 and 71 degrees of north latitude , is the northernmost civilized country . But for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , it would be an arctic waste ( map , page 496 ) . In such a mountainous land it is hard to see how agriculture can be the main occupation , and yet about one-third , of the population of 2,907,000 people live on farms . The farmers have toiled for generations , clearing the forests , pulling stumps , removing millions of tons of stone , draining swamps , and utilizing every square inch of ground suitable for pasture or cultivation . Today , despite the natural handicaps under which they labor , about 94 per cent of them own their land. * The thrifty , stubborn character of the country people has been formed by this means . Through centuries Norwegians have worked to create stable living conditions and gain economic security , a fair distribution of wealth , and respect for law and order . They cling to their soil with a tenacity at times almost fanatical , many a farm having remained in the same family for several hundred years . An old friend of mine , born 75 years ago not far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer . At an early age he had to shift for himself . He married a capable girl from another valley , and the two broke new land far up on the mountainside where few could have made farming pay . After 50 years of toil he is the richest man in his neighborhood . He has brought up a family of eight children , sent them to school , and given every one a technical education . The old farmstead is still his home , but for each son and daughter he has purchased a farm in the valley . His success lies in his thrift and the strong family tie which made every member of the household co-operate , as in the Swiss Family Robinson . Most self-sufficient group I have ever met , they produce on the farm all their food , with the exception of coffee , sugar , and salt . The fishing rights they own in a lake bring in annually a thousand dollars or more , and a few head of cattle provide butter , milk , and cheese . In winter , boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , as are clothing , shoes , and farm implements . One son is an expert carpenter , one an electrician , and another a blacksmith . Together these boys installed a complete hydroelectric power plant for the community . The mother and daughters weave in their spare moments ; the boys add to their income by hunting and trapping . A POOR MAN 'S KINGDOM In the statement , " Norway has houses and cottages , but no castles , " lies the key to the social and economic structure of the country . The average size of the farms is only nine and a half acres , and all Norway has barely a score that exceed 250 acres . There are few rich people and everybody shares the tax burden . 493  |p494  I observed that inheritance laws have a direct bearing on the division of farms , according the same treatment to men and women . Usually the eldest son inherits the farm , though he must " pay off " his brothers and sisters . A farmer and his wife who feel that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in doing so be assured of being taken care of as long as they live . MANY DOORS ARE NEVER LOCKED Honesty is a characteristic of the people everywhere . Though the country has its quota of thieves and crooks , " their names , " as the police records say , " are known . " The traveler in Norway finds hundreds of farmers who never lock their doors at night . Willingness to accept a stranger 's word is a common trait . In one valley , I , a total stranger , was given the key to an old church . A beautiful 14th-century church door key was hanging on a nail inside . " But it might be stolen , " I said to the warden 's daughter . " People in this valley never steal , " was the reply . In several out-of-the-way places when I asked the gasoline attendant to fill up my tank , I received the surprising advice , " No. do n't do that . We charge you 33 cents a gallon because of transportation costs . Down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stranger must not be exploited " seems a slogan in most Norwegian communities . In a small country district I had to leave the inn at 7 a. m . The proprietor , who was in bed , asked me , through the maid , to make out my own bill . It was returned to me with a deduction of 50 cents because the breakfast at that early hour did not include the customary fish course ! LAWSUITS A FAVORITE SPORT Notwithstanding general honesty and fairness , stubbornness and a quarrelsome attitude are common traits among the farm-  |p495  ers , and a man 's reputation grows with the number of lawsuits he is able to support . They litigate about anything , from boundary lines to hunting grounds . Many disputes are referred to a municipal board made up of well-known men or women of common sense whose duty is to call both parties before them and to hear their stories . A JUDGMENT WORTHY OF SOLOMON I know a case where one farmer 's dog had torn a hole in another farmer 's trousers . The judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay five dollars to farmer B for hole in trousers ; farmer B must pay five dollars to farmer A for trespassing . The litigants swapped bills , shook hands , and left contented . If to the casual observer Norwegians seem melancholy and pessimistic , their environment should be considered . Months with only a few hours of daily sunshine or no sun at all naturally have their influence on human moods . Here men lack the carefree outlook on life enjoyed by people of sunny southern climes ; they take life seriously . A Dane once told me how a Norwegian farmer visiting Denmark was inclined to boast . Shown the fertile plains of the country and its prosperous cities , he always belittled what he saw in comparison with things in Norway . Finally the Dane in exasperation showed his guest the Round Tower in Copenhagen , the pride of Denmark . " You certainly do not have that in Norway , " he said . " That may be , " was the answer , " but if we did have it , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Norway are made of wood , men here know the art of girdling the trees in a way to cause heavy bleeding of resin . They make wood tar from fat stumps and paint their houses with this preservative . Adorning doors  |p496  and eaves of some of the century-old houses are elaborate wood carvings . Shingles are made by means of a horsedrawn wooden frame in which a big knife is set like the blade in a hand plane . With the driver perched atop it , the contraption is pulled over a row of logs placed end to end on the ground , and shingles are " plowed " off by the knife . An old superstition has it that gnomes make their homes under the roots of farmyard trees . To quench the thirst of these gnomes , farmers pour beer about the trees at Christmas time . A plant called " the family peace , " grown in some houses , is carefully nursed because of a belief that if it dies the peace of the home will come to an end . Much furniture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suitable length and two or three feet in diameter . The upper half is hollowed out to form seat and back , and the chair is then painted and decorated . Wooden beds , tables , and cupboards are elaborately carved and painted . Unfortunately , many farm homes have been modernized in recent years , and old interiors have been spoiled . Colored glass and verandas copied from central Europe have been added , so that many fine old farm buildings have lost their character . In this northern clime farming can be carried on only from April to the end of October . Summers are warm , and the many hours of sunlight accelerate the growth of vegetation . In spite of hilly land , Norway uses much farm machinery , a large percentage of which comes from America . Silos , I noticed , are being introduced by returning Norwegian-Americans . Visitors are astonished to find how many  |p499  different crops grow here , so far north . Wheat , barley , rye , and oats are all produced in considerable quantities , though Norway must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , hay is most important . Potatoes and turnips grow widely , but early frosts often damage the crops . During the last 25 years the growing of fruits and vegetables has much increased . Citrus fruits are imported ; so are vegetables in the off season . On the southern shores , peaches and apricots will ripen in some sheltered places , and in the central fiord districts of western Norway some tobacco is grown . Wild blueberries , strawberries , lingonberries , and raspberries , gathered in the summer and fall , give some farmers a good income . Yet , because the potential farm land of Norway is limited , the country will probably always import much of its food . SUMMER FARMS IN THE MOUNTAINS Virtually all Norwegian farms of any size have seters , or " summer farms " up in the mountains , where cows are taken in June and kept till fall ( page 511 ) . These farms are operated by women skilled in the making of butter and cheese . To most mountain farms belong certain hunting and fishing rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woodcock , and willow grouse are among the birds to be found . Nowadays few bears are left , though in the past they often endangered the lives of both cattle and people . I saw the doors of some old mountain farmhouses still studded with sharp-pointed nails put there 500 THE NATIONAL GE &;  |p500  to ward off bears . Hunters may still find the elk , hare , fox , marten , otter , and other animals ; and lakes , of course , abound in fish such as salmon , trout , and pike . No other animal of the country interests Norwegians so much as does the little fjord horse , or Norwegian dun ( Plate VIII and page 528 ) . Nobody knows from whence it came . Whether it was brought in on early Viking ships or came overland from the east is still a matter of guesswork . Small in height and usually beige-colored , it has a black stripe through the mane and down the back . Its front legs are also striped like those of the primitive horse of Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unlike the Arab horse , which it somewhat resembles . Some years ago a farmer in the western part of the United States imported some of these animals , but he came to grief ? not because the horses became homesick or would not work , but because every one of them was promptly stolen by Indians who took a fancy to the stripes . Raising silver foxes , on special fur farms , is a brisk business here ; and goats and sheep are scattered all over the kingdom . Sheep are largely of imported stock , while goats are of native breed . Most wool is spun and woven on farms . " HOT GOATS " INSTEAD OF " HOT DOGS " From goat 's milk the famous Norwegian brown goat cheese is made . Only a hardy Viking can digest pure goat cheese ; therefore much of the cheese exported is mixed with cream , which has a tendency to modify the strong taste of goat . One village in western Norway I heard called " Goat Hell , " because there whole flocks are taken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mixed with wool , goats ' hair is used as material for heavy socks because it makes them almost impervious to water and very warm . As a boy I much admired the Norwegian elkhound , which is as old as the Norwegian race itself . This dog has a powerful body and thick , dark-gray fur . It carries its bush tail coiled . An intelligent , hardy animal , it is a fighter that I have often seen chase every other dog off the farm . It is fearless and a keen hunter , at its best in chasing bear and elk , the latter the " moose " of northern Europe . Norwegian farmers are more prosperous than the size of their farms would indicate . Since many do not have enough land to support their families by farm operations alone , they have other occupations . Thousands along the coast are fishermen , and those near timber districts are also woodsmen , having log cabins in the forests . Many farmers also own their own wood lots of saw timber , pulpwood , and firewood . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the farmer through till next harvest . It is astonishing how many farm tools , implements , harnesses , and shoes are homemade . The farmers build their own houses and boats . Jacks-of-all-trades they must be , to make ends meet . In some valleys the silversmith 's art has been handed down for centuries from father to son , and the designs and patterns have their origin back in the dim ages . I saw in the valley of Telemark exquisite filigree work which , to my mind , has no equal among farm-home crafts elsewhere in Europe . In other valleys farmers are skilled coppersmiths and work during winter months making excellent copper kettles , coffeepots , flower stands , etc . These products are sold all over the country . Wood carving is likewise a highly developed art based on centuries of tradition . One need only consider the artistically carved dragons and other ornaments of old Viking ships , the elaborate decorations of the thousand-year-old " stave " churches still in existence ( page 527 ) , to realize that wood carving is an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of such carvings , often based on their own ideas of design . Then there is wrought-iron work . Beautifully designed and executed chandeliers . hinges , and fireside implements are made by country blacksmiths . They find an excellent market throughout Norway . NEEDLECRAFT A FINE ART Women and girls gather moss , bark , nuts . and plants , and extract from them dyes of rare beauty . That these vegetable dyes are sunfast is proved by the century-old vegetable-dyed tapestries seen in Norway . In embroidery the Hardanger pattern is particularly well known . There is always a good market in Norway for hand-knitted sweaters , caps , scarfs , socks , and similar sport togs , all produced in characteristic patterns of the region where they are made . One small farm community makes only  |p509  mittens , and some of them are exported to America . In olden days a bride had to prove her skill by making and embroidering her future husband 's wedding shirt . Nearly every region has its peculiar and picturesque costume , still in use , but now seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely mountain valley I saw a doormat made from old rubber tires , cut into strips and held together with iron rods ! Clever toys , fishing tackle , and novel household appliances all find a market . The extensive electrification of the country has played an important part in the development of these small industries . Such industries help keep people off the charity rolls ; that is why the State takes such keen interest in their development . WOMEN ACTIVE IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS Though the man still " wears the trousers " or , as the Norwegians say , " decides where the cupboard is to be placed , " women have gained a strong voice in public affairs . Norway , in fact , was among the first countries in Europe to enfranchise women , and the political position of Norwegian women and men today is equal . Women are found in all positions except in the Army and Navy . There are women in the Parliament and in executive government positions , women owning and operating large farm properties , and women leaders in the business world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday afternoon the whole family is drafted for kitchen police . All floors are scrubbed with sand and soap , and freshly cut juniper twigs are spread over the floor . In the fireplace birch branches are placed . This imparts an agreeable odor ? one can " smell Sunday coming . " On Saturday night young folk attend dances or meetings of their own societies . They may also go to the nearest community to see a picture show . Each valley has its peculiar dances and its own music . It seemed to me that on the plains the music is more cheerful and the dances are more sedate than in the mountain valleys ( Color Plate III ) . Old dances that I saw as a boy have given way in some places to more modern ones , but up in the mountains people cling to their own music . There is no doubt about the originality of these compositions ; they are as typical history . E IN NORWAY 509 of Norway as are the mountains and fjords . When Norwegian farmers dance , they dance ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to the rafters. * From long ago is handed down a story of a mountain dance at which a new tune was played , so wild and weird that it created bad blood among the men and ended in a fight . After several of the dancers had been killed , survivors saw that the devil himself was the fiddler . This tune , called the " Devil 's Dance , " is still played . The folk at Roldal claim descent from French fugitives who , tradition says , discovered the valley . They have a legend that the crucifix of their old " stave " church was caught in a net by a fisherman , who , unable to lift it from the water , began calling out the names of all the churches in Norway . When he named Roldal 's church , the crucifix became so light that he lifted it into his boat . Soon it was reported that the sweat on the face of the Christ had healing power , and for centuries people came to this church from all over the country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woodwork of the walls bear witness to the many pilgrims . Often visitors are puzzled to note that the altar shows only eleven Apostles . The omission of one is explained as due to the action of the forefathers who built the church ; they did not want anything to do with Judas ! In front of these old churches one often finds an " armory , " a place where the farmers in early days were required to leave their axes and other weapons before entering the house of worship . Tricksters tried to evade this rule by making walking sticks with ax heads as handles . On some old farms such canes may still be seen . CHRISTMAS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE Of the few holidays observed in Norway , the principal one is Christmas . Preparations for the celebration begin weeks in advance with baking of cakes and cookies and brewing of Christmas beer . Farmers , however , are moderate in their use of alcohol : they do their drinking on special occasions , such as Christmas , weddings , and funerals , but are not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akkevit , a special kind of schnapps made from potatoes , is used . Formerly this was made on the farm , but now it is a factory product . Most countryfolk bake their own bread , usually of rye . Throughout Norway the so-called " flatbread " ? rye dough rolled into almost paper-thin sheets about two feet in diameter and baked to appetizing crispness ? is the favorite . It is delicious and will keep for months . During heathen times the horse was a sacred animal and horseflesh was eaten at religious festivals . Since Christianity was introduced 900 years ago , however , the country people have had an aversion to eating horseflesh . There are numerous kinds of cheese , ranging from a skimmed-milk product flavored with caraway seeds and cloves to rich cream cheese . Fish of all kinds are also in use . The famous lute Fisk is cod treated for three weeks with lye and water . Smoked , dried , and spiced fish delicacies complete the menu . Outdoor sports are popular on farms . Norway is a real ski country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the chief means of transportation . Some of the best runners can cover 30 miles in hilly country in three and a half hours . Every year ski sportsmen gather at the national ski-jumping and ski-running contests at Oslo . The toboggan has never been popular in Norway : in its place is a sleigh steered by a 15-foot pole which trails behind . Soccer , an importation from England , is  |p511  played all over Norway . There is also a game called " long ball " which reminds one somewhat of baseball . For pleasure trips the bicycle and the motorcycle take the place of automobiles , the motorcycle being frequently fitted with ski runners which permit its use in winter . Automobiles , trucks , and buses are nearly all of American make , and there are about 79,800 cars in the country , or one for each 36 persons . The larger farms usually have cars , but for the small farmers a car is a luxury . On many Norway farms old auto engines are used to supply power . A HIPPITY-HOP CONVEYANCE Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This odd conveyance is like a kitchen chair mounted on two long steel runners , curved in front . The operator stands behind the chair , one foot on the runner , and holds on to the handle bars . With his free foot he propels it at unexpected speed . This rig , which may carry one passenger and light freight , is much in use in the country districts . I have seen something like it in ' North China from whence the idea may have come ( page 497 ) . Probably nowhere else in the world do people hike more than they do here . On all highways and mountain paths one sees boys and girls , old and young , walking for days and even weeks , loaded down with their rucksacks . Wild mountain scenery , glaciers , roaring waterfalls , fjords , and lakes have all exercised a strong influence on the Norwegian farmer . Even today there is much superstition among the farming population . I have a vivid memory of weird tales 516 THE NATIONAL OEOI  |p516  told in my childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sea , who could be seen rowing in half a boat during a storm on the ocean . He had no face : in its place was a bunch of seaweed . Seeing him and hearing his shriek warned people of death by drowning . If he got into a fisherman 's boat , only a dash of cemetery soil would drive him away , for he was the spirit of dead seafarers looking for a Christian resting place . These bits of folklore are still alive ; I heard them again on my recent visit . MODERN NOISES BANISH SPRITES In southern Norway there still exists a century-old embroidered tablecloth supposed to have been left on Christmas Eve in a barn when the sirens had their feast . Whistles of trains and honking of automobile horns , however , have driven them and the draug away . Only the tiny manikin called nisse still makes his home in the barns throughout Norway . He is a harmless creature , dressed in red blouse and pantaloons and wearing a red cap . A mischievous fellow loving horseplay , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other troubles on the farm unless he is well fed . Consequently , the farmer must share his Christmas Eve dinner with this manikin , placing cream porridge out in the barn . The next morning the bowl is empty proof of the presence of these manikins unless one should happen to quiz the cat or dog ! I shall never forget my fright as a small boy when the fishermen in the Arctic told me that it was very dangerous to wave a white cloth when the northern lights were in the sky during the dark winter months . Persons disregarding this warning would one day disappear without leaving any trace . Were there not thousands of people , young and old , who had disappeared in those regions during the winter storms ? The present Norwegian public school system was founded when book learning in most European countries was reserved for the wealthy or privileged classes . At that time the State first aided young people to prepare for the church " confirmation test . " All schools now are under State control , and there is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The percentage of illiterates is almost zero . The State and municipalities spend twice as much on education as is spent for national defense . In secondary schools tuition is paid only by those able to do so . SCHOOLS PROVIDE POVERTY INSURANCE The University at Oslo , the technical college at Trondheim , and the agricultural college at As are State institutions where tuition is free . Many school children in Norway learn a trade , so that no matter what happens to them later in life they will always have something to fall back upon . This is indeed a " poverty insurance " of the most practical kind . Getting about in winter is often difficult . and at times boys and girls must ski many miles to school . I remember many a dark winter morning in my early youth when the " chain gang " picked me up in the snowdrift at the gate . Two big boys , one ahead and one in the rear , held the ends of a rope . and we smaller children were placed between them . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for their smaller wards , keeping them from dropping out to sit down for a moment on a snow pile to sleep a little when the intense cold made them drowsy . There were frozen ears . noses , and cheeks to watch , and it was often necessary to rub the white skin with snow until the blood circulated again . Lunches are free in many schools , and in some districts children receive free dental service . For these reasons taxes are high . In some ways education has raised new problems . Thousands of young men and women who have received a superior education are now unable to find the work they have been trained to do . Lately there has been a strong movement back to the farm by youngsters of this class , a movement that has played a large part in the growing rural interest in magazines and newspapers . A NATION OF READERS Every farmhouse , no matter how small . has a bookshelf , and the farmers are inveterate readers . In all communities of any size there can be found one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educate the people of Norway . Broadcasting is controlled by the State , and the educational features of radio programs are stressed . Last summer I visited a small farm in the  |p525  interior , 50 miles from the main highway and 75 miles from the nearest railway . T was struck by the ability of the farmer and his wife to discuss the leading questions of the day . They had formed their own opinion in regard to world affairs : they knew from day to day the price of butter in the English market ? all as a result of reading the newspapers and magazines and receiving daily radio reports . I found an ingenious system of " learn while you eat " on one farm in an interior valley . The farmer had carved the letters of the alphabet on a piece of wood which was applied to the piece of butter placed before the children at the table ! Norway , like some other countries , controls its doctors , apothecaries , dentists , and midwives . The country is divided into medical districts , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public health in their districts and acting as chairmen of the local boards of health , these doctors care for the poor without charge . The system works because they also have their private practice . HOSPITAL CARE AVAILABLE TO ALL Both State and local governments maintain hospitals and nursery homes . About 90 per cent of all tubercular patients , for instance , are treated in public hospitals . For those who could afford to pay , the charges in Norwegian hospitals , other than private institutions , at the time of my visit , ranged from 50 cents to $1.25 per day . Thirty years , ago state health insurance was established . This covers workers in certain wage classes , about one-third of the population . The insured pays six tenths , the employer one tenth , the State two tenths , and the municipality one tenth of the premium . As a result of these activities , the average length of life in Norway is high , and this in spite of climatic conditions which induce pulmonary diseases that annually take a toll of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for low infant mortality and it surpasses all other countries in the lowness of its maternal mortality rate . Closely allied with questions of public health is public welfare . A system of oldage pensions has been inaugurated . All civil-service employees and other public servants receive a pension , and this system is also followed by many private enterprises . Naturally , all these public expenditures mean heavy taxes , but the taxpayers receive much for their money . The Government has given its citizens economic security perhaps unparalleled elsewhere . Under certain circumstances , as much as 60 per cent inheritance tax is levied on fortunes in excess of $75,000 . There are , therefore , very few large fortunes in Norway , and there are only about 600 persons who have annual incomes in excess of $12,500 . A MONARCHY BY POPULAR VOTE One may think it odd that such a democratic country should be a monarchy . In 1905 , when the union with Sweden was peaceably dissolved , the people voted for this form of government . King Hakon VII , through his intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace during the 34 years he has lived in Norway . He takes keen interest in the agricultural problems of the country . In summer he lives on a farm outside of Oslo . The Crown Prince has another farm in the vicinity , considered a model establishment . The Norwegian language has undergone many changes . In reality , the country has two official languages ? the riksmal , which is a further development of Dano-Norwegian , and the landsmdl , which may be considered as a common denominator of all Norwegian dialects , and is largely based on old Norse . Both are recognized as official and are taught in the schools . An educated Norwegian understands both Swedish and Danish , but some of the Norwegian dialects are so different from the riksmal that a city dweller may have difficulty making himself understood by a farmer from certain parts of the country . It is difficult for most Norwegians to understand the dialect in Setesdal , in southern Norway , for this interesting and picturesque valley has been out of touch with other communities . In centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies on the Continent . SOLDIERS INTRODUCED ENGLISH WORDS A number of English words in the present dialect , such as " rod , " " knife , " etc. , probably came into use through these returning soldiers of fortune . Virtually always there are persons in  |p527  each community able to speak English . Most of these have lived in the United States or have sailed on American or English ships . AMERICA HAS ALMOST AS MANY NORWEGIANS AS NORWAY Leif Ericson , son of the Norwegian , Eric the Red , came to North America in about the year 1000 . A Norwegian expedition visited Hudson Bay in 1619 , and during the 1630 's Norwegians began to trickle into New York State . But 800 years elapsed since this first visit by the Norsemen until emigration started on a large scale . Because of close contact with foreign countries , through commerce and shipping , Norwegians are found in all four corners of the earth , but the great bulk of those who have emigrated have gone to the United States . During late decades many thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found in South America , South Africa , Australia , and the Far East . In 1825 a small sailing vessel landed at New York with the first group of fifty-odd Norwegian Quaker emigrants , and , curiously enough , a small cargo of iron . During the last hundred years about three-@#  |p528  quarters of a million Norwegians have emigrated to America , and the population of Norwegians of the first and second generations in America is almost as large as that of the mother country . With the exception of Ireland , no other country in Europe has contributed a larger percentage of its population to America . Most Norwegians in America at present live in Minnesota , the Dakotas , Illinois , Iowa , Wisconsin , and Pacific Coast States . Although large numbers live in such metropolitan centers as Minneapolis and New York City , the great majority are essentially agriculturists . Up until the time of the depression the Norwegians in America figured among the larger percentages of landowners of all nationalities of foreign birth . Land hunger is characteristic of Norwegians , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of America . They have always preferred the rough pioneering work , breaking new land and clearing the forests because they are accustomed to hard work and privation . They have taken a leading part in developing the excellent school systems characteristic of practically every Norwegian community in America . They have also established a number of Norwegian colleges in this country , and have always looked after the sick , aged , and poor in their communities . They have made good citizens because they are law-abiding , industrious , and thrifty . During late years the emigration from Norway has dwindled , and in some years more Norwegians have left America than have entered this country . All over Norway I found farmers who have lived in America . Naturally , these returning Norwegian-Americans have brought with them much knowledge of American farming methods . There is hardly a community in Norway where someone does not have near relatives in America .
