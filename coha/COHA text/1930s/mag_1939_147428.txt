When the French retreated to the Marne in 1914 , their strategy proved shrewd and salutary . For the Polish armies to fall back from the Corridor and East Prussia to a primary defense line from Lorun south through Ldz and Kielce to Cracow , and after that to the angle between the Bug and Vistula Rivers in the north and the Industrial Triangle ( Cracow to Lublin to Lwow ) in the south , was the strategy approved for Marshal Smigly-Rydz by his Allied military advisers ( see map , p. 16 ) . He need endanger only 15 Polish divisions by this plan , holding 45 in reserve to smite the Germans after their supply lines and communications were extended . His own defense line would be less than 500 miles long instead of more than 1,000 miles . Even the Germans estimated it would take them one month to crush Poland in such a campaign . <P> This week , after only eleven days of fighting , it was a grave question whether Poland was not already crushed . Perhaps Marshal Smigly-Rydz was to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed and power of the German advance surpassed even German calculations ; perhaps the weather made the difference , staying dry and leaving the roads passable for motorized advance ; perhaps the German air-power exceeded all expectations , breaking Poland 's wings before they left the ground , smashing defensive positions before they could be organized . Certainly all these factors combined to make half Poland a shambles and her stand at Warsaw a desperate siege , as ghastly as Madrid . <P> Germany 's armies from East Prussia , with the shortest distance to go , were the slowest to blast their way to Warsaw 's outer defenses . Impeded at the Narew River after taking Plonsk and Pultusk , they were halted last week at the Bug . At the junction of the Narew and the Vistula , the fort city of Modlin had yet to fall at week 's end . But artillery diverted for this defense weakened the Poles on the southwest . Smashing into Cracow , Germany 's armies of the south swept on into the Industrial Triangle to take Sandomierz , Poland 's munitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following in trucks , seized Kielce , Radom , Ldz ( the textile centre ) . The entry of one motorized unit , traveling far ahead of its support , into the heart of Warsaw , led to premature announcement of the capital 's invasion on Friday . Snipers at windows , machine gunners on roofs , drove the invaders back to Warsaw 's southwestern suburbs , but there the main German forces soon arrived , too , and Warsaw was hemmed in on at least two sides . To its defense from the west came Polish divisions retreating in good order out of the big pocket formed around Poznan , where the Nazi attack had been light for fear of harming the thick German population . With other reinforcements from the east , Warsaw 's defenders dug in on the Vistula 's right bank , lobbing their shells over the city at the gathering Germans . <P> While the battle for Warsaw took form , in the south the German columns smashed on westward toward Lublin and toward Przemysl on the San River , gateway through the hills toward Lwow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border mountains to threaten Lwow , for through that city ran Poland 's one remaining lifeline ; the road and railroad to Rumania .
