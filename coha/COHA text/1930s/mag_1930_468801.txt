OT long ago I met an acquaintance aglow with the triumph of just having obtained a very satisfactory divorce . " Of course , " she declared , " I would not have considered applying for it if I had n't been assured that I should get the children . Now they arc mine ? to manage as I please , without having to consult that man who was my husband . " Although this acquaintance does not know it , I , too , have faced the possibility of seeking a divorce and legal control of my children . I can not lightly put aside the conviction that the poor woman may be deluded , that over filial affection and parental influence courts have no jurisdiction , that not a judge 's decree but the attitude of her children themselves toward their mother and father and the divorce suit will determine whether or not she will keep them in such complete subjection as she imagines . My acquaintance and I are not alone in asking , " Is it worth while to go on living legally bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to love ? " Every year more people than we shall ever know confront this problem , and more than we shall know answer that divorce is not always the wisest way of attempting to get out of unhappy domestic situations . Because of rather general interest in whether divorce is a practical escape from difficulties in homes where there are children , T set out ? somewhat reluctantly ? to give my conclusions from experience . Briefly , my situation ? which 1 believe is fairly typical ? is this . Years ago that powerful but very fleeting attraction which we lightly call love vanished between my husband and me . We found that our interests and ideals are different . We respect each other , but both of us know that each one would be happier not continuously irritated by the other 's presence . Neither of us is very " bad " judged by the world 's standards , so neither has what is considered a serious claim for divorce . However , evidence of the " mental cruelty , " for which some States make provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when two people who " get on each other 's nerves " have been living together for years . My husband would not apply for a divorce from me because this is a deadly sin according to his religions beliefs ; but I do have grounds for a divorce from him and in the settlement should probably " get the children . " Desire for independence and for absolute control of my children makes me long to " go to law , " demanding my " rights . " Living with a person who hugs his inherited notions concerning woman 's subservience in the social order , I frequently feel the " urge " to seek a divorce as a demonstration that traditional shackles no longer bind . Although Charles would not admit his belief in words , he shows clearly by his behavior that , according to his scheme of thinking , everything a wife does is of concern to her husband . Take just the trivial matter of smoking ? he disapproves of smoking by women and assumes that he has an undeniable right to command me not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stir up a family quarrel over what is not a necessity of life , but a silly habit . Nevertheless , the more I reason the more I feel my personal liberty violated and want to exhibit my power to do as I wish ? to smoke incessantly if I want to . If Charles had ever asked me as a favor not to do this or that , in a manner indicating that he thought I had a part in making the final decision , probably I should not feel so abused ; but his words concerning my acts of folly have always been dictatorial in tone , consequently , have caused my inward revolt against compliance with his wishes . When infringement of my freedom involves more vital matters than smoking reasons for submission are hard to discover . Among all individual rights I can conceive of none much more fundamental than the right to read what one chooses . Many of us rebel against the censorship that restricts the range , at least , of everybody 's liberty in this respect ; but when a husband sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his privilege and duty to determine what is good and bad mental pabulum for his wife , the censorship becomes especially repugnant . If I lived in sensational novels all night long when I ought to be gaining strength and poise for the next day 's duties , or neglected my household and children in eagerness for the sordid details of the latest murder and divorce cases , I might see that Charles had a right to demur ? if , with such reading tastes , it were possible to retain the power of reason . But I like perfectly respectable literature ? HARPER 's M.4aAZTNF , for example , which , as far as I can judge , is not so overstimulating emotionally that people , because of its perusal , forget they have lives of their own to live . To me , James Truslow Adams and Walter Lippinanntaken at random from a number of well-known writers about whom Charles and I differ violently ? seem sane stimulators of one 's thought , safely conservative even when voicing mildly iconoclastic ideas . But Charles does n't consider these gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do notconsistently follow timeworn paths of thought ; therefore , they should be shunned by all faithful wives of husbands who disagree with them . I am pretty much in the position of a youthful seeker after knowledge in the medical book ? hiding A Preface to MoraLl under my pillow or in any nook where it is not likely to be discovered , taking it out surreptitiously but eagerly to snatch a few lines when the paternal eyes of my husband are not upon me and there is no danger of raising a fiery argument as to whether I possess the right to read even Ernest Hemingway and H. L. Mencken if I wish . These little annoyances , to which I must submit if I am to remain married to Charles in a semblance of peace , are beside the point , except in proof that " individual liberty " is to roe far from a vague , abstract term . I know what it is to have my freedom and " self-expression " very definitely and unpleasantly restricted by marriage , and know the overwhelming yearning one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great act of rebellion . If I believed " the law " could give me what I want I might seek its aid , although this would he unfair to my husband , who is no worse or no more cruel than I am . He simply lives by a different system of thinking or of " complexes , " or whatever we want to call our mental processes , and is very kind as long as my life seems to conform to his code . Personal freedom I might secure . Present-day people ? women especially ? find the urge to demand independence very alluring . We fall into the scramble for liberty in itself with all the zest that is natural when a formerly forbidden path is suddenly opened . Because our right to it has been so recently granted , self-expression seems the great goal that every human being must achieve if life is to be worth living . Now when the cries of the individualist are forever in the air , we may lose our sense of direction and follow the shouting mob without realizing whither we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above everything else ? Are there deeper , more enduring desires than to do as one pleases ? Are there any human relationships that may mean more to us than freedom from shackles could ever mean ? I believe there are . To be sure , revolt against being tied by the old rotten strings of marital bondage may make us feel that the greatest pleasure on earth would be to break them ; hut , after they were once torn and the first exhilaration of triumph over , we might experience no such bliss in freedom as we had anticipated . The only thing we can do to make sure we are not following a will-o ' - the- wisp is to sit down calmly and decide what we want above all else . Sometimes , I admit with a sense of shame bequeathed by a Puritan upbringing ? though I am not unique in entertaining such desires ? I feel that what I need is another , different kind of a husband , one who would give me at the same time his devotion and my own full liberty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in moments of hope , it seems that he must be somewhere waiting . That another love affair might prove disappointing I can not make myself really fear . Why not throw off the yoke of an unhappy marriage , thus announcing my freedom to attach myself to my real " affinity " if I should ever stumble upon him ? In the midst of such dreams ? whether they are the indulgence of a sunshiny day or of a moonlit nightcomes the imperative question , " How would a second husband feel toward my children ? " Being a dream man , my hero enfolds my son and my daughter in his arms , while I merely stand by , forgetful that those arms are my place , experiencing no thrills but the purely maternal ones of satisfaction that at last my children have the kind of father I covet for them . Though I 'm not a Freudian , I believe that our dreams ? day-dreams included ? index pretty accurately our greatest desires . If one has ever been a mother she will never know perfect happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She can not imagine life that is satisfying without their sharing it . Maternal affection is a deeper ? though a calmer , less exciting ? emotion than is sexual love . That the ecstasy is lacking in mother-love is only an evidence that it is more enduring and vital ; for ecstasies never last . To be sure , a woman may be unconscious of this maternal want : she may go about seeking gratification in ecstatic experiences , but , in the end , she is always a Madame Bovary who never knows satisfaction . If I can not speak for all women , I can for myself and the majority of others . In men , too , the paternal need is great , although perhaps more frequently suppressed or concealed . When marital love departs , the longing for a satisfying parent-child relationship becomes more powerful . Between mates who themselves have grown antagonistic there is almost inevitably a struggle for control of their child as well as for his sympathy and love .. Our case is just a typical illustration . As my husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more and more devoted to our children ? each more anxious to become the governing force in their lives . No more pleasurable experience will ever come to me than when my little son , toddling along the street at my side , used to grasp two of my fingers whenever we came to a crossing . Apparently he felt secure holding those fingers to lead him through the maze of traffic . If I were a poet I should sing a song of parental exultation over this childish , trustful act and of hope that my son would always thus grasp for my guiding hand in moments of need all his life . Not being a poet , but only a person trying in plain words to explain some of the motives that actuate common people , I sound sentimental when these desires are expressed . Not only do I sound so ; I am sentimental . But what father or mother is not ? My husband , one of the most practical and matter-of-fact of men , has experienced , I know , the same emotions that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers as a symbol of safety . We both long to keep throughout life , not this dependence of our son , but this confiding certainty on his part that we can help him steer his course wisely . Desire to be the one great influence in our children 's lives becomes a mania and a source of conflict ? conscious and unconscious . There 's no more misleading myth than " Children draw parents together . " Instead of being a unifying bond ? between people already separate in spirit ? the children are a bone of contention . To face this fact is disheartening . Fighting over a bone does n't injure the dogs as much as it does the bone . Children in such domestic situations usually have a hard time of it ? not materially , because every wish is probably granted by one or the other parent anxious to win filial favor , but spiritually . They are tossed back and forth between two people who , they can not help knowing , are at odds ? used as an emotional football , when , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop naturally without so much excitement and nervous strain , without being forced to " take sides " in a conflict . With the wish for parental control , there is , normally , desire to do what is best for one 's child . The danger is that by rationalization one may try to reconcile what one wants oneself and what is best for his child . " Why not remove my son and my daughter from this conflict ? get a divorce , take them myself ? Even if my influence upon them is not all that could be desired , they will be better off not living in the midst of a battle where every blow strikes them . " Thus I have often rationalized , because this is the course I should like to take . The question is whether ? when the struggle between husband and wife for control of children has once begun ? it an be stopped by mere court decreethat they go bodily to live with this or with that parent . How early in a child 's life emotional attachment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize . Even in a person 's infancy connections to a parent develop ; after infancy they are frequently too strong to break . With many psychologists , I believe that what we call filial affection is not instinctive , that it is built up by a process of pure " conditioning . " If some other woman , with a personality similar to mine , had taken my son on the day of his birth and treated him throughout the years exactly as I have treated him , this other woman ? not his natural mother ? would be loved by him as I am now loved . But does the behaviorist 's explanation of filial dependence change matters ? Although the child loves no one person instinctively , he will , instinctively , grow emotional roots that bind him to somebody . Emotional capacities ? in fact , emotional necessities ? are a part of every human being 's make-up . In our social structure , natural parents are the ones to whom a child normally adheres . Whatever the cause , to me and also to their father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward each of us . We have both been good to them . These normal attachments can never be severed by direct means stupidly recommended . Among some farmers there is a belief that certain plants need to be partially pulled up by the roots and the tiny fibers broken to induce the plant to develop a more efficient root system . Whether or not this tendency of some roots to grow stronger after being torn is a scientific fact , it may serve as a figure to clarify our conception of what takes place when we try to break the tendrils by which a child clings to a parent . Instead of weakening the hold , the process of trying to kill filial affection merely strengthens the ties With such intensifying of attachment on one side goes a corresponding weakening of connection on the other . There is a negative as well as a positive reaction . Against the person who has tried to break unbreakable bonds , there develops on the part of the child an antagonism ? . a natural recoil as from a poisonous or irritating substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me , and follow my instructions would probably lead them to shrink from me and to hold more tenaciously to him . Once in the conflict , a child can not be removed from it . The wisest plan , in many eases , is not to disturb normal attachments , not to force a child to " take sides , " to try to keep him from realizing how bitter is the hostility between his parents , to allow him the companionship of both father and mother without constant reminder that the two are enemies . This way , I am convinced , will not only , under present conditions , be better for the children , fairer to their father , but also , finally , more satisfying to me . I will not allow myself to be placed in a disadvantageous position in the showcase from which parents are viewed , nor will I allow my children 's father to assume a halo in their eyes . Halos adorn the heads of martyrs only . If I should " go to law " pleading a case against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts , must distort the truth somewhat , my children could not help feeling that their father had suffered injustice . We live in a world where public opinion and the judge are against you if you do n't produce " charges . " In most States one must tell ? if not lies ? at least misleading truths to obtain a divorce . These charges may not make much difference when there is no child involved , because both husband and wife know they are mere legal tools used to gain a desirable end . But to a child , who in his " reason " is governed not by his parents ' emotions but by his own , the whole legal process seems unjust . " Why , " he asks , " should anybody say such dreadful things about someone I love ? And why should I be separated from a person I like because my mother and fatherdo n't care for each other ? " The fact that children know that the parent from whom they are torn returns their affection intensifies their rebellion and makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . How the persecutor fares is illustrated again and again . He is cast aside . Although he remains a powerful influence in his children 's lives , he is not a positive but a negative force . " I wo n't be led by him . I 'll do just what he does n't want me to do " are natural , though perhaps unconscious , decisions of children in such situations . Among my acquaintances are two fathers who have been divorced from their wives for a number of years . Each man clings desperately to his children . One man receives their sympathy and love ; the other does not . The first helped his wife secure trumped-up evidence against him , accepted all the blame for an unhappy domestic situation , and allowed the court to give " the children to his wife . As a matter of fact , he " has " them ? loyal , anxious to visit him and " play around " with him whenever there is opportunity , ready to listen to his counsel on everything from clothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action against his wife , fought for control of their children , which he received ? as far as the court could give it to him . Now from college they mail him their bills , but in other ways they ignore him or defy him in what he considers his rightful authority . To their mother they send their affectionate letters and make their eager visits , and of her they solicit advice . These two cases ? so similar except in each man 's treatment of an uncongenial wife ? show how a child will cling by emotional roots to the parent who has seemed to suffer injustice , and how the one who has appeared the persecutor is repulsed . Above all , a thinking parent wishes to be a positive factor in his children 's wholesome development . Not so much does he want to be a physical or a material asset ? to nurse a child through a sickness or to pay his bills ? as to be a spiritual force , helping him to a philosophy of life and habits of action that will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our offspring with the " behavior pattern " that we admire , although frequently this is unfair to the children . In many instances husband and wife do not differ so fundamentally in their conception of a satisfactory pattern of life as do my husband and I. Nevertheless , our case is just an extreme example of the difference in ideals that exists nearly always when husband and wife disagree vehemently . Charles , very sincerely , thinks it best for the children to grow up under the influence of a church where a definite path is authoritatively laid down for everybody to follow . I do n't believe that God tells people what is right and wrong through the ministers of any church . I want my children to utilize their reason ? not an authority 's command ? in determining their behavior in every situation of life . Of course , I may be wrong . In spite of this , is it fair to my child , by my unreasoning action , to make my point of view seem unworthy of notice ? If somehow I can maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as not to oppose his religious beliefs openly and allow him and his church to present their side fully to my children , I believe that they will attain an open-mindedness they never would if I tried to keep them , by my authority , from consideration of ecclesiastical claims . After all , my views should not be imposed on young minds any more than their father 's should be . If my children learn to think , rather than to uphold what they wish to accept by rationalization , I shall be satisfied . When both sides , or several sides , of a question are allowed a hearing ? without emotional appeal on any side ? there is encouragement of the rare art of thinking . What good would it do , for instance , for me to storm against my daughter 's learning the catechism ? If I calmly let her learn the words ? which probably do n't mean much to her at present , anyway ? I show her that I do n't fear words , and now and then I do get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether these words are to be taken as the final expression of truth . With both my son Paul and my daughter Esther I have had such opportunities , when we have been alone and in the mood for exchanging confidences , to lead them to a questioning , thinking attitude , simply because I have never objected to rote learning of the catechism , but , instead , have heard the lessons time after time . When a teaching especially offensive to me has come lip , I have said , " Father believes this , and so do many other people . You should respect their opinion , because we shall never discover what is true without hearing , with a kind of reverence , what others believe . But mother does n't agree with this . " After explaining why I reject the doctrine , I can easily make the only request I shall ever make of my child in this respect , " Please think the matter over and sometime you may decide for yourself whether you agree with your father , with me , or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation is unjust to Charles , because it is more adroit and more likely to make the children differ from his opinions than would my bitter opposition . I feel like a traitor when I consider how I am using what would seem to him ? if he knew it ? underhanded means to gain my ends . Never could I do it if I did not feel that this is the only fair way to treat the children . The influence upon them of words ? in the catechism or anywhere else ? I do not fear ; but I do fear the influence of strong emotional appeal to accept these words as truth . My applying for a divorce , commanding my children to separate themselves from their father and all that he stands for , would be a blow which would make them recoil from me and give them an emotional incentive to lay hold not only of him as an individual but also of the things he wants them to believe and do . He would have a distinct advantage ; while now , not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaining my purpose , I have the advantage . It would be fairer all round if parents in such situations could agree that each one should have full liberty to influence their children by suggestion rather than by command ? at least in matters where the standards of the parents conflict ; but seldom will such a happy solution of difficulties be found , because seldom will both adults agree to the terms . Charles , for example , would never consent to having my views exposed in our household . I am forced to he secretive , almost deceptive , if I want to keep my children out of an open warfare . This , I realize , is setting a bad example . I do n't like it . But what else could I do in justice to the young personalities under my care ? Although this is irrelevant to my main point , I want to explain that I have tried never to give the impression that I am ashamed of my views and have never asked the children not to mention what I have said to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never deny any statement I have made . The point is , in this discussion , that apparently they never think of bearing tales about me or my belief . As I have analyzed their attitude , they respect my views , though they have never taken sides with either parent in these matters so vital to us both . By refraining from discussion of their mother 's confidences , the children show that they hold these confidences sacred . Since Paul is only fifteen and Esther only thirteen , it is impossible to prophesy what the outcome will be . Personally , they are devoted to their father and , without a word of protest , attend church with him . Sometimes I am sure they realize , as young as they are , what a blow one gives a person who loves one by differing with his cherished opinions . Of course , I want the children to realize this ? in fact , I have discussed it with them . Once , after I had been reading how Theodore Dreiser , for love of his father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been distressed to know that his son had cast aside the religion of childhood , the children and I talked the question over together to try to decide whether Drciser was justified in his deception . Paul thought that evading an answer to a direct question was cowardly , but that if one could avoid discussion of the topics on which there was disagreement everybody would be happier . Esther was for a little evasion if it could be managed without telling an out-and-out lie . I did n't give any opinion , because I 'm uncertain . Puritan traditions , with which I was branded in childhood , give me an uneasy feeling even now when I wonder whether we owe " the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth " to our legal mates . However , I am certain that I owe truth as I see it to my children . Whether I am doing right or wrong is not the question in this paper . The detailed account of the means I have used to make my children respect me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point is that I have gained my goal as I probably should not have gained it if , with help of " the law " I had tried to break my children 's attachment to their father and force them to my side . In detail , the dissension between other antagonistic parents may not resemble that between my husband and me ; but the method that will " work " in getting real hold of our offspring is the same in nearly all instances . The negative influence legal decrees exert in determining human behavior we see in the " noble experiment " being carried on in America to-day . The same tendency to defy law is exhibited whenever we resort to the courts to help us solve domestic difficulties . People who think they can control their children 's affections and behavior by authority are as blind to the " negativism " of the human being as is the rabid prohibitionist ? or , by the way , as is my husband Charles in his attempt to control my reading and thought and action . My thinking has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern literature " because Charles has objected so fervently to my giving it consideration . After all , my children ? and everybody else 's ? are very like me in this " negativism , " not at all unique . By trying to force a child one way , one often drives him in the opposite direction . Every person who is daring enough to attempt to control his son 's or his daughter 's attachments at the mating period discovers how futile is such an effort and how opposition to a " love match " seems to do nothing but add fuel to the fire the objector wishes to quench . Among my friends is a man who early in life married , to find himself bitterly disappointed . " As I look back , " he says , " I see clearly that my mother 's antagonism to Alice was the thing that made me select her as a wife . When I first knew her she appeared no more desirable than three or four other girls ? all of whom I liked . As my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl became more and more fervid , Alice grew more and more resplendent in my eyes . I decided that , of all the attractive girls I knew , she was the one I wanted to marry . " The effect of such parental attempt at control is generally recognized , because the fire of sexual " love " burns so vividly that it can not fail to be seen . However , where the calmer , less heated emotions are involved , the results of opposition are no less real . IV After deciding that what I want most is genuine respect and love from my children , I could do nothing else but remain in our family as they want it ? undisturbed by withdrawal of anybody . Although this has seemed a big price to pay for gaining my heart 's desire , I am now convinced that the reward is worth the cost . As the years pass by day-dreams become less and less vivid ; I see more clearly that there never would be for me a satisfying love affair ; that , for many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent-child relationship , and that , if one is blessed with this , it is full compensation for loss of the personal liberty for which we all are at times so eager . Perhaps this , too , is irrelevant ? but I find that as time passes the differences between my husband and me seem less and less glaring in my eyes . I am less annoyed by the molehills that used to appear mountains . Now , without resentment toward Charles , I can laugh at myself as I pull my " doctor 's book " from its hiding place . Through the effort ? for the sake of retaining my children 's respect ? to be just to their father , to give him and his creed a fair hearing , to keep them out of family strife , is developing a genuine tolerance to replace that which was once feigned . Personally , I enjoy more peaceful moments than I once thought it would be possible for me to know . Perhaps such calm is natural when one feels in his heart that he has already won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fighting . After all , I am perhaps freer , in realms where liberty is a necessity , than I should be if I had asserted my right to light a cigarette at table or to mention James Truslow Adams 's latest article . If the future should show that by giving up the privilege of living my own life unhampered I have helped to make my children 's lives worth while , I shall feel that I have had an opportunity for the kind of " creative effort " that is enduring in its satisfactions . At least I entertain the bright hope that my children may prove to be my masterpieces in " self-expression . " Even now I experience a purely selfish joy when I see evidences that my children appreciate the little sacrifices I have made to preserve peace in our home . At table a few weeks ago , Esther inadvertently made a harmless remark indicating that she knows more than her father thinks she should know about sex relations . " Keep children innocent , " is one of his maxims , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , " Keep children ignorant . " First Charles upbraided Esther for her immodesty in speech . Then he turned to me with reproof , " If your mother kept better track of your reading and were n't so lax in her ideas herself we might not get into some of these ' modern ' troubles . " Paul thought it time to take up the cudgels for me . " Well , mother does n't believe in telling us anything that we ought not to know . I 'm mighty glad I 've learned about things I 'd know about anyway from her instead of the fellows who do n't see things straight but are always trying to talk about things they think are bad . " In his defense of me Paul had just about Jet the cat out of the bag ? but I suppose real live cats ca n't be kept in bags forever . I was so overjoyed at my son 's taking my side that the first tears I have shed for years came to my eyes . Naturally , Paul thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to my room to tell me not to worry . In his boyish way he explained , " Father is all right . He does n't mean anything by what he says . He just does n't understand things the way you do ; but Esther and I side with you even if we do n't want to hurt father by showing it too much . " To think that the day has come when the children begin to understand my point of view ! The day may come , too , when I can tell them that the sacrifices that seem too trivial to mention now were all made , when they seemed great , not only for my son and my daughter but also to keep my son and my daughter . In this account of my individual experience I do not pretend to settle the divorce problem for all parents who face it . All I wish to do is to point out the futility and stupidity of relying on a court 's answer to the question , " Who gets the children ? "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
