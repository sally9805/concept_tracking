txt Sponging on the League . It is all very well for Mr. Untermyer to rave against the League of Nations for not boycotting Germany . If he will give a moment 's intelligent thought to the situation , he can easily see that , in case the League embarked on such a program , the only result would be that the United States would gobble up all the trade of England and France with Germany . One gets rather tired of Americans who scoff and sneer at the League when it is obvious that certain acts can be undertaken only if there is complete cooperation among the big powers . So far the United States smugly consents to " cooperate with the League " when it Is to its interest . Some people would define this as sponging on the League whenever it needs to use it . HELEN S. EATON . New York , May 1 , 1935.
