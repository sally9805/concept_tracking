Torrents of rain poured down last week over the steep green mountainsides of St. Lucia , largest of the British-owned Windward Islands in the Caribbean . Old La Soufrire , 4,000 feet high , once an active volcano , now rich in sulfur and hot springs and not to be confused with nearby St. Vincent 's La Soufrire , was shrouded in heavy mist . At a time when the island 's June-to-October rainy season was past , St. Lucia was drenched , soaked , deluged . <P> The shallow rivers of Britain 's twelve-by-42-mile Caribbean paradise swelled over their banks , and many of St. Lucia 's native blacks hastily abandoned their plantation huts , moved their wives &; children up the sides of the valleys to what they thought was safety . No sooner had they escaped the floods than worse disaster loomed . In the hills the soaked ground gave way here &; there , slipped with a roar into the valleys . Panic-stricken natives now hunted for slopes that would not slide . The alarmed British administration at Castries , the island 's seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep communications open , evacuate the people to the coast . The rains fell harder . As though the soil were determined to wash back into the sea , avalanches of St. Lucia 's black clay poured off the high ground . They blotted out roads , pushed telephone poles over , disrupted all travel and communication . One night an entire acre of ground and a building housing 50 rescue workers gave way , swiftly slipped into a raging river . <P> Next day , as the rains continued , the worst thing of all happened . One of St. Lucia 's mountains simply cracked open , sent a high wall of rich , loose loam rushing down neighboring valleys with a terrifying roar . <P> Uprooting all vegetation , burying all life in its wake , the avalanche ploughed through rich plantations , removed whole hamlets from the face of the island . Few in the wall 's path had time to escape . Injured victims of previous smaller slides were caught , their legs and arms torn from their bodies by the onrush of debris . A corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving down a valley , were themselves buried alive . Mothers tried to herd their young to safety as the slithering ground under their feet swept whole families to death . One seven-acre area was covered by a 20-ft. layer of clay . <P> As death and destruction moved with terrifying suddenness over the lovely island , temporary roadside morgues were set up . Many of St. Lucia 's 67,000 inhabitants wailed throughout the night as they waited in long lines to identify members of their families . Others insisted upon going into the deep slime , hoping to rescue imbedded relatives . With hundreds of acres of land destroyed , thousands made homeless , St. Lucia next day counted its casualties : at least 250 dead , many more missing . The British Windward Islands administration , with headquarters at St. George 's Grenada , faced its greatest relief problem .
