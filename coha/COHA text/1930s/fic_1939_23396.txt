MR . HATA PULLS THE STRINGS A STORY BY CHARLES CORBEAU E VEN when I had money I did n't like Burma . I got to Rangoon with a pocket full of small coins and some hundred-rupee notes to fall back on when they were spent , and started looking for the country Kipling wrote about . Took off my shoes and socks and walked up the Shwe Pagon pagoda with my bare feet feeling slimy in the melted candle grease . Heard the temple bells and saw the hcathcn knocking their heads on the ground . Burmese girls too selling flowers and incense to offer to the Lord Buddha . A religious circus with plenty of side shows , but all playing the same act . Soon fed up with it . Stopped at the Strand Hotel until my rupees began to run low , then moved to a cheaper place and drank beer in Maxim q , where you can get a quart of Asahi for ten annas , fairly cold too , which is unusual for Burma . Met a dark fellow there who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty Burma girls . They looked nice enough in their white bodices and with flowers in their hair , but I did n't take to them . I 'd hate to have one wait for me because she 'd just have to keep on waiting . I 'd never remember her address and they do n't have any telephone numbers . I was ready to start back to Seattle then and bought a ticket to Hong Kong . Like a fool I switched from beer to gin , got drunk and missed the boat , and did n't have enough money to buy another ticket . The only chance I had toget away was to work my passage , and there was n't much chance for that with the British boats all manned by Lascars and other black fellows who work for less than enough to keep a white man in beer . But some American ships were coming in now , bringing motor trucks to be shipped over the new road to China , and I thought I might have a chance on one of them . I went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes for the same reason . There is a shady little park between the Strand Hotel and the river where the black nurses bring the white children to play and the beachcombers loaf . After my money ran out I sat there and listened to the carrion crows quarrel with the sea gulls over the garbage . It was better than tramping round the hot streets . I had been waiting for an American ship for about a week when one day a little fat Chinaman came and sat down on the bench beside me . He did n't say anything , did n't even look at me , just sat there with his eyes closed half the time . He wore a clean white Chinese gown and a felt hat , the only one I had ever seen in Burma . Of course I thought of a laundryman , but then I noticed his hands , which were white and slender . " That fellow never washed a dirty shirt , " I thought to myself . He sat there for a long time and then reached into his gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tore the end off the package as gingerly as an Englishman shelling a soft-boded egg , and held out the package to me . I took one . It was the first cigarette I had had in more than a week except one of those English " gaspers " I had cadged from the dark Englishman . He put the package back in his pocket and I said , " Do n't you smoke ? " " No , " he said , " I have decided to stop . I bought this package only to prove my will power . It seems to have stood the strain , so I do n't need them any more . Please take them . " I thanked him and then he seemed to go to sleep again . Finally he opened his eyes and took off his felt hat and wiped his head with a red bandanna handkerchief . His heavy black hair was as close cropped as a barber could get it . " Very hot here , " he remarked . " I was never in a hotter place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here . " " Then you should go , " he remarked mildly . " No one should imprison himself in a place he dislikes . When you do that you become your own jailer , which is neither natural nor humane . Other men may imprison your body  --  but only you can imprison your soul . " " Strange talk from a Chinaman , " I thought . " Give me a chance , and I 'll get out in a hurry , " I said . He did n't answer me , did n't appear to have heard me and closed his eyes again . I would have left him but I had no place to go , and a sudden hunch came to me that if I stuck around and walked away with him when he left , he would buy me a bottle of beer . I do n't know why I thought that , but the more I thought about it the more convinced I became that the hunch was right . I was about to give up and go away when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive a truck ? " " Can I drive a truck ? " I repeated , rather dumbly I suppose , for I was still thinking about a bottle of beer . " Say , I was practically born on a truck . My old man was a truck gardener . " The wisecrack did n't sound any better than it did the first time I heard it , but he paid no attention and began talking , half to himself . " A fine new American truck , probably the finest in Burma .. Just as the advertisement said it would be  --  four wheel drive  --  ten tons " Suddenly I came to life . Maybe there was a chance here to earn my own bottle of beer . " Look here , " I said , and pointed to a scar on my forehead . " I got that driving a truck for strikebreakers in Seattle . If you have the best truck in Burma , I 'm your man because I 'm the best truck driver . When do we start and where do we go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked , " but I think that will be easy . My truck is idle now , eating its carburetor off with garage charges . would like to put it to its proper uses and truck some freight . It is a fine truck for a long haul  --  such as to the border of China . " " Oh , " I said , " hauling ammunition to China . " Suddenly I thought I saw what his game was . " No , " he said sadly , " that is not it . The Chinese government has its own fleet of trucks and will give no hauling to outsiders . But I know of a merchant here who has a cargo he wants to send to the Northern Shan States . I have an idle truck . You are an idle driver . He has employment for both . The circle of perfection is complete . " He leaned forward and a wallet fell to the ground  --  a plump wallet from which I could see the edges of hundred-rupee notes . He extracted one daintily and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " or an advance payment for services yet to be rendered . There is an excellent barber shop on Dalhousie Street near the pagoda , and nearby a British clothing shop almost as good as the Chinese shops of Shanghai . By this time to-morrow you should be ready to go to work . Invest your money wisely . Beer is always a better buy than gin , and I would n't spend more money on beer than on the barber . " Then he jumped up and walked away and was out of sight before I remembered that he had not told me his name nor Said where and when I was to see him . I had a little money left over , and the following noon I was sitting in Maxims , smoking cigarettes and wondering whether or not I should have a bottle of beer before lunch , when my Chinese friend appeared and solved the problem for me . He sat down at the table with me and ordered two bottles . I was surprised to notice that he specified Japanese beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want everyone to help them win the war by boycotting Japanese goods and then they buy Japanese products if they can save a few annas . If we were at war with Japan I 'd never drink their beer . Instead of fiddling about as he had done the day before and talking at cross purposes , he settled down to business at once . " The gentleman , Mr. Hata , who is going to use our trucking service , " he said , " is , I am sorry to say , a Japanese . His country and my country are at war and it is very embarrassing for me to do any business with him . If it were found out , my relatives and friends would all think that I was a traitor and the blue shirt society of terrorists might decide that it was an act of virtue on their part to lodge a few bullets in my skull . They would be even more annoyed than the union truck drivers were with you in Seattle . So in order to keep my conscience clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hata . For the time being , the truck is yours and when the present transaction is completed we can settle the matter of permanent ownership and division of profits . " Then he handed me a bill of sale to the truck , made out in my name and endorsed by the American bank in Rangoon to show that the truck had been paid for in full . I never could imaginehow he got it , but he also handed me a driver 's license also made out in my name and an order on the Burma Oil Company for a thousand gallons of petrol , which was much more than enough to take me to China and back . Then he gave me a thin bunch of neatly printed business cards from which I noted that I was the " Managing Proprietor of the Burma American Transportation Company . " On top of all that he gave me a thousand rupees for working capital . I did n't think very straight or fast  --  was all confused and excited and blurted out , " Is this all honest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I meant to say was that this was all so much like a fairy tale or a story out of the Arabian Nights that I wanted to know whether or not it was genuine . He did n't give me a chance to apologize but said , " There is no such thing as absolute honesty . There were only two completely honest men in the world  --  Christ and Confucius , To all others honesty is merely a relative virtue . Money honesty is the cheapest of all , and many a man who has not had a sincere thought in his entire life thinks he is honest because he has paid his debts . So far as this transaction goes , and including its possible ramifications of the future , it is honest enough to satisfy any reasonable man . " Then he turned on urie'and said , " After all , I am the one who should be worried about the academic aspects of honesty . You might start for the Shan States with this truck and wind up in Siam . But your horoscope shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire so much because it is profitable to themselves . However , when you get back , we will see how the balance sheet stands . You make your own deal with Hata-san . " As a bit of final advice , he told me that he thought the Japanese would be willing to pay almost any price to get his cargo transported , but suggested that I be reasonable and collect half in advance payment . " Remember , " he said , " that a half in hand is a half in hand , and if it is big enough you do n't have to worry about the other half . " That was the sum and total of all the instructions I received , if they can be called instructions . What a funny way of doing business ! When I drove that truck in Seattle I had to punch a time clock and account for every gallon of gas all the time I was dodging the beer bottles the strikers threw at me . And here this Chinaman turned his truck over to me and just gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind that he was what the other Chinese in Rangoon would call a " traitor " and was using me to pull off a profitable deal with a Japanese so as to protect his own skin , but I did n't care . He had played the game with me and I was going to play it with him and make just as much money as possible for him . Funny too , that I thought of him as an old man , but he was n't . It was just his way of talking , I suppose , that made him sound like a very wise old father and made me feel like a youngster . Just as he was going away I said , " / do n't even know your name . " " Just call me John , " he said . " John for John Smith or John Chinaman , It does n't matter . " I went down and had a look at my truck and then drove it out on the main road toward Mandalay just to get the feel of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run even smoother after the first few hundred miles . I longed to load her up and try some good steep hills . I checked the oil and put her back in the garage and then went to call on Mr. Hata . He had a little hole-in-the-wall office in the Indian quarter with a new painted sign giving his name and his occupation as that of a " commissioning agent . " A Japanese clerk took my card , turned it over to see if there was anything printed on the back , and went away , leaving me standing at the railing . Two other Japanese sauntered out and looked atme suspiciously and then disappeared through a door . I could hear the faint mutters of a conversation behind the door and , after what seemed like a long wait , the first clerk came back and invited me into what I suppose was the private office . Mr. Hata was seated at a little desk and the two Japanese who had come in and looked at me were standing , one on each side of him . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sit down or anything . I had my speech all prepared . " Mr. Hata , " I said , " I have just started in the trucking business in Rangoon . I have only one truck , but it 's the best one in Burma and I drive it myself . So I can give you better service than you can possibly get from trucks driven by these careless Indian drivers . I hope you will keep me in mind and let me give you a quotation the next time you have any trucking to do . " Then I gave each of the three one of my cards and turned as if I was ready to go . I do n't know just why I did that , but it seemed to me that it was what John would have done . Then Mr. Hata spoke for the first time  --  spoke in Japanese . He sucked in his breath with a hissing sound and said very slowly , " Ah ! So des ke . " Then he talked to the others in their own language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial ? " " Can carry ten tons , " I said . " Just out of the factory and the best truck in Burma . " " You are prepared to travel to distant places ? " " Go all the way to Bangkok if you 're willing to pay for it , " I said . There was a longer conversation in Japanese and then they asked me to sit down . " I have , " said Mr. Hata , " cargo of fine Japanese calicoes I wish to ship to Northern Shan States . The destination is about fifty kilometers due west of Lashio , and the entire distance from Rangoon is exactly 931 kilometers . What will you charge for the entire occupation of your truck for that jour-ney ? " " Any cargo corning back ? " " Not for me . You may collect others if you like . " I asked a few more questions while I tried to figure out in my mind just how many miles there were in 931 kilometers . " That 's a long hard trip , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll burn up gas and oil . I think three thousand rupees will be about right . " Then we started to bargain . That is , they started to bargain and had a lot of conversations between themselves . I was prepared to shave the price , but as I listened to them I got the idea that they were going to accept my offer . Funny ? I could n't understand a word they said , but from the tones of their voices I felt that they were coming to an agreement . Mr. Hata turned to me and asked , " When can you start ? " " Day after to-morrow , " I said . " I have a load to take out to Pegu to-mor-row . " There was n't a word of truth in this , but I had n't the faintest idea where Lashio was and I wanted time to find out and also to get some provisions for the trip . Besides , I did n't want Mr. Hata to know that he was my first and only customer . Apparently this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then Mr. Hata asked , " And at what date will you arrive at the destination ? " I had to guess at it so I said that if I did n't have any bad luck , I would be there by Friday " Too late , " wailed Mr. Hata . " Could you not employ an assistant to yourself , a second in command , and by night and day driving get there by Wednesday ? " " Of course , " I said , " but that would be another thousand rupees . " " Just for another driver ? " " It 's not the other driver . It 's hard on the truck and hard on tires to drive without any rest . Hard on me too . I ca n't risk wearing out my tires and myself for less than that . " They agreed to that and also agreed to pay half cash in advance  --  that is , they would pay it when the truck was loaded and ready to start . I remembered what John Smith had said about getting enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . I had certainly done that , for the two thousand rupees was very liberal pay for the work . And there was no difficulty about getting the other driver . He was already in my employ , but I did n't know it . He was a tall Mohammedan with a big black beard I had seen around the garage , and now it developed that he had been employed by John Smith to look after the car and had taken it for granted that I had bought him with the truck . I could n't get his name so just called him Mahomet . He did n't seem to mind . He was a husky fellow and I thought we would load the truck ourselves , but when we got to Mr. Hata 's establishment we found that he had taken care of that for us . There were a half dozen Japanese there and they put the cases on the truck while Mr. Hata checked them off and gave careful directions as to how they should be loaded . It did n't look like a cargo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it was all loaded Mr. Hata gave me h very carefully drawn map showing the roads I should take out of Lashio , with directions and landmarks in English and Burmese , and also a sealed letter which I was to hand to a native who would meet me in the village for which we were bound . The native was to identify himself by saying , " Are you the gentleman sent by Mr. Hata ? " That was all , except that he gave me the two thousand rupees . We had barely started when I remembered that I had left in Mr. Hata 's office the supply of American cigarettes I had bought for the trip . I did n't like the idea of smoking the native cigarettes for several days so turned back to get them , a little ashamed of letting Mr. Hata know of my carelessness . We pulled up to the place but the sign was gone and the doors were locked . Well , anyway , had the first half of the payment . We drove all day over the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hours and then lay down on an air mattress on top of Mr. Hata 's cargo while Mahomet drove . Then I would take the wheel again while Mahomet slept . I had promised Mr. Hata we would get there by Tuesday , and aside from keeping my promise to him , I was anxious to get back and find out if he had really left town , doublecrossed me on the second half of the payment . Also I wanted to get back and tell John how well I had done in my bargaining for him . Somehow I could n't get him out of my mind and I kept thinking of him as the kind of a father I would have liked to have had . My old man had been pretty much of a washout . We only stopped once in a while to put some oil or gas or water in the car or to do a little eating . At night it was just the same except that we traveled faster since we did n't have any bullock carts to dodge . At first it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb the hills . The truck purred like a contented cat on the steep grades . It was a sweet machine to handle and I was proud to think that it belonged to me , if only for a few days . With every hour we got higher into the hills and soon I was surprised to find that we were in cold weather . It had been so hot in Rangoon that I could n't imagine it being cold any place in Burma , but the nights were chilly . The road got rougher too and in the hills zigzagged dizzily . Mahomet was driving and I was trying to sleep when I was awakened by a terrific bounce and saw one of the small packing cases slide off the end of the truck . I called to Mahomet to stop and we went back to pick it up . The case had hit a rock and one side was caved in . As we picked it up , I saw a couple of machine gun clips fall out . " Ah ha , " I said to myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Suddenly , the whole plot came to me as clear as crystal . The dark-skinned Englishman I had drunk beer with at Maxims had told me that Japanese secret agents were bribing the hill tribes on the Burma-Chinese frontier to attack the caravans carrying munitions for the Chinese government from Rangoon to Chungking . So Mr. Hata was one of these agents and John was profiting by the murder of his own countrymen and had made a fool out of me . That was the reason he had put the truck in my name . It was a crooked and murderous game all the way through , and I was the goat . I hated the two of them , but I hated John the most . In the meantime my immediate problem was what to do with this broken case . We could n't repair it and it would n't do to put it back in the truck and take the chance of its dropping a spoor of machine gun clips all along the route . The highway here was cut out of the side of a hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feet below us . Mahomet and I carried the case to a convenient spot and threw it as far as we could . It rolled part of the way down the hill , though not out of sight . But it would be difficult for anyone to climb down and find out what it contained . Then we gathered up the clips which had spilled out and threw them away . I thought for a moment of dumping all the cases and going back to Rangoon , but on second thought knew that would be just plain silly , for I should only be adding new crimes to my record . The only thing to do was to go on . Without any bad luck we should finish our trip in another day , and once I had turned the cargo over to Mr. Hata 's representative , I could wash my hands of the whole affair and go back to Rangoon to settle with him and with John . In a village just outside Lashio I stopped to try to find some warmer clothing , and when I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in Burmese clothing sitting in the truck . Mahomet was paying no attention to him . " Mr. Hata has sent me to guide you to your destination , " he said . Then he added , " There is one case missing . " This was n't according to program . Mr. Hata had said nothing to me about a guide and his crack about the case being lost made me mad . " You 're a cockeyed liar , " I said . " No case has been lost and I never heard of Mr. Hata . Get off the truck before I chuck you off . " " It 's all right , sahib , " said Mahomet . " Let him ride . He says a case has been lost , so let him take its place . Then the tally will be correct . " It was now about dusk and we would get to the rendezvous before daylight . I was in trouble enough without starting anything new , so I grumbled and took the wheel while Mahomet sat on the cases with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past time for him to relieve me when Mahomet came back and we changed places . There was no one in the back of the truck . " Where 's your friend ? " I asked Ma-hornet . " The Jap ? " he asked . " Oh , he decided to walk . It 's not far now . I can drive the rest of the way because I know the road . " I was so warm and comfortable in the blankets I had bought that I went to sleep and dozed and did n't wake completely until the truck stopped . It was almost pitch dark and we were surrounded by a group of people . One came to mc with a flashlight and asked , " Are you the gentleman sent by Mr. Hata ? " That was the correct password , but nothing else was according to schedule . We were not near a village , but in a forest , and the man who asked me the question had on a Chinese general 's uniform . Other flashlights were turned on and I saw there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the letter and the general with one glance at it shouted something in Chinese . Then , of all the persons in the world , John came through the crowd , buttoning his long Chinese gown . " I hope you did n't have a bad trip , " he said to me . " There 'll be some ham sandwiches and a pot of hot coffee for you in a moment . " Then he tore open the letter and translated it hurriedly to the general . In the meantime the Chinese soldiers were unloading the cases . " This is a very strange coincidence , " he said to mc . " Mr. Hata wanted to send some machine guns to the hill tribes so that they could more efficiently kill the drivers of Chinese trucks . By chance he employed you and by chance you fall into the hands of the Chinese army . That 's force majeure and you ca n't help it . The Chinese army has the machine guns . And Mr. Hata has paid for the truck because the letter he gave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complete circle of auspicious events , but not for the hill tribes . They are going to be annoyed when they get neither the machine guns nor the money . " You and Mahomet better take the truck and go to Bangkok . It would n't be wise for either of you to return to Rangoon . f am afraid Mr. Hata is going to be extremely annoyed . "
