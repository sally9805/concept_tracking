WHETHER or not Z1. fossil hunter subscribes to the Eighteenth Amendment is neither here nor is it there . The fact remains that he must have alcohol . Not for the good of his body but for the good of the fossils . Soft bones must he hardened with shellac before they can be removed . The shellac must be cut with alcohol . At Wolf Camp in Mongolia , the Central Asiatic Expedition was wurki lig in a great deposit of shovel-tusked mastodons . The bones were like chalk and they just drank shellac . After all , they had been dry for some millions of years . We had plenty of alcohol , or rather we did have until one night during the end of June . Then a storm came along that was a storm . About as near a typhoon as one ever gets in the Gobi Desert . Floods of rain and an eighty-mile wind . It was a miserable night . Tents went down on all sides . One moment we lay snug and warm in our fur bags , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fighting madly to get out . Paddling about , half naked in a freezing rain , in the middle of the night , is either tragic or funny . We chose to believe it was funny . Because everyone else was in the same mess , it was not so difficult to see thehumor . Granger and 1 shared the big tent . The edges had been weighted with whatever was handy  --  stones , boxes , saddles and bags  --  anything to keep it . down . Next morning , to our intense chagrin , we found that one of the cases we had seized in the darkness had contained our precious alcohol . It Was gone , every drop . Leaked out through a hole in the side of the tin . 400 Mites to Shop THAT situation did 1 not strike us as being at all funny . Work must stop unless we could get more alcohol . It meant going to Pekin . Fortunately , that was only four hundred miles . Had the loss occurred during any of the other expedi ti one , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have ruined us , Mae Young and I were obviously indicated to do the trip . We were not a bit keen about it , for we had not been away long enough to make the fleshpots of civilization desirable . Moreover , the work it camp was fascinating , and Pekin in July is like a blast furnace . Since it had to be , I decided to take two ears and load them with specimens . A full-sized war was going on not far from Pekin , and Mongolia might be cut off by retreating soldiers at any time . The more fossils that were safe in my house the happier we would feel . Driving away from camp just as the sun rose , we cut straight across the desert to the main Kalgan-Urga trail . The vast , Hat plains were glorious in the cool morning air . Hardly ever were we out of sight of gazelles feeding singly or in herds . Bustards and demoiselle cranes circled like airplanes beyond the cars . Always there was something interesting to one who could read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we kept a keen watch for bandits . They might take pot shots at us from behind the hills . But the road was free that trip , and we drove steadily mile after mile for fourteen hours . Two days later we were in Pekin . It was the Fourth of July , and we duly presented ourselves at the Pekin Club reception . Gossip buzzed . Why had we returned so suddenly ? When I told them that we came for alcohol , a roar went up : " We thought you were nondrinkers in the Gobi ! That 's too thin ! What is the real reason , now ? Just between friends ; you know that we 'll keep it quiet . " No one would believe the truth . Pekin is like that . It scents a mystery , a romance or a scandal in the simplest things . So we let it go . As a matter of fact , most of them decided that I had returned to play in the polo tournament that began that week . 1 gazed with satisfaction at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory . They had been piloted to Pekin by Young after passing out quantities of dollars in " squeeze . " There is almost nothing that money wo n't do in China . A week later we were on the back trail , driving hard for camp . At eleven o'clock in the morning we reached the Black Water , a treacherous swamp , the worst place on the road . Three times in a quarter of a mile our car broke through the thin dry crust and went down to the axles . Only by sinking a foundation in the seemingly bottomless mud and lifting it out with the jack , could the car he extricated . For seven mortal hours we worked feverishly . At this place there are a few scattered Chinese villages of dubious reputation . More than one car had been robbed when mired and helpless . At least fifty people were clustered about. , and we felt sure that if darkness found us there we would have a lively night . In daylight we were safe enough , for both of us wore heavy revolvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jack . Highways and Highwaymen B Y SIX O'CLOCK we had passed the swamp and were again on the hard trail . It began to rain , first in showers , then in a steady downpour . Darkness came at eight , when we were opposite Chap Ser , the most dangerous place in all Inner Mongolia . It is just a collection of Chinese mud huts and Mongol yurts at the extreme outer edge of cultivation . Bad characters , both Chinese and Mongol , gather there , and for years it has been a veritable bandit stronghold . Even though we faced a cold , wet night , there was no question of seeking shelter at that place . We drove past at full speed . while hard-faced natives stood in groups , glowering . Twenty-two miles beyond Chap her were the yurts belonging to our caravan Mongols . If we could find them in the darkness there would be a dry and safe shelter . Driving over a bad trail in the inky blackness of a. rainy night had its difficulties . It was half-past ten before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The yurts ought to be a half mile off the trail , if we were right . We turned abruptly eastward and bumped over the rough sagebrush hillocks into the open desert . Suddenly a dog barked ; then we saw a flicker of light . We had hit the village right in the middle , but what a panic ! Men and women ran out , half clothed , screaming in fear . They thought we were bandits . It was ten minutes before they could comprehend who we were . Then Bato 's wife cleared her baby and herself out of the best yurt , and brought tea and Mongol cheese . Mac and I slept like dead men while the rain poured outside . At five o'clock the next afternoon we ascended the escarpment to the vast peneplain that rolled in yellow , waterless walks for a hundred miles to the east . Two miles from camp a lone wolf trotted out of the west to his nightly hunting ground in the basin . He looked huge and gaunt in the slanting sunlight . Puzzled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . I took one shot and he went down , stone dead . That was number thirteen for Wolf Camp . The men were all out to meet us when our ears rolled up to the tents . " Did you bring the booze ? " asked Granger . " We have n't had a drop of alcohol for a week . " I was glad that the W. C. T. U. could n't hear him . They might have misunderstood . First , I had to hear what they had found in my absence ; then we told them the news of China , and produced letters and papers . It was July fourteenth , Bastille Day in France , and dinner that night was in honor of our colleague , Pare Tedhard de Chardin . The great . death trap of shovel-tusked mastodons was almost exhausted , I learned . A dozen jaws and skulls , about thirty tusks and more skeletal parts had been exposed . They were waiting only for shellac , to take them out . Paleontological Midwives ALREADY work had been resumed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deer , foxes and other small mammals had been entombed . The next morning Bill Thomson found both thigh bones of an adult female mastodon . She had died lying on her side , and within the pelvis was the skull and jaw of an unborn baby . A prize if ever there was one ! Bill performed the operation with Granger in attendance as consulting physician . The rest of us watched and offered gratuitous advice . Also we referred to them insultingly as " ' paleontological midwives " and " fossil obstetricians " who could only deliver a baby stillborn . Fetal specimens of any fossil animal are extremely rare and enormously interesting . Particularly important are they in the Proboscides. , because the teeth of mammoths , elephants and mastodons have a growth and succession quite unlike that of other mammals . The great molars grow upward and forward , pushing out the first teeth , so that only two are in use on either side of each jaw at any one time . Our unborn baby had a jaw about twelve inches long . in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two flat incisor tusks projected only an inch beyond the hone , in contrast to the ten-inch plates of a full-grown male . The collectors also found in the deposit the skull of a deer with remarkable antlers . They resemble a woman 's cupped hand cut off at the wrist , and are just about that size . The antler tines are like small spread fingers . Except for the pregnant female mastodon , all the other animals that had been trapped in this ancient bog were small types . Therefore , we conclude that it was of very soft , sticky mud , but fairly shallow , enabling the larger beasts to extricate themselves . Exploration to the north and east along the escarpment which marked the former lake shore revealed other bog deposits . One was exactly like the great quarry from which we had removed so many shovel-tusked mastodons . Two or three huge jaws were partly exposed . Doubtless , it would prove to be as rich as the other , if not more so . But we could not afford to spend more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . Two months were gone already and the season was half over . A request to the Chinese Committee for the Preservation of Cultural Objects , in Pekin , for permits to continue the expedition 's researches next year , had met with discouragement .. Such permission would be granted only on conditions which no museum could accept . After nine years of arduous exploration of the Gobi Desert , and the expenditure of more than a half million dollars , we have at last discovered the region where we might find primates . The bog deposits along the shores of this ancient lake may well be the tombs of primitive humans , or near-humans . Such deposits are almost the only ones in which we could have real hope of success . Primates may have been trapped with other mammals in those far , dim days when the great shovel-tusked mastodons splashed along the edges of the lake . But careful , systematic excavation of every deposit is the only possible way to succeed . Valuable specimens , each one of which reveals a new page in the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not primates are there . Last summer we made a beginning , but only a beginning . Seeeral years of work remain to he done . It was useless for us to undertake a proper systematic exploration , knowing that it could not be completed except under impossible restrictions . Several untouched localities awaited us in the west , and we must at least dip into them before the season ended . Therefore , most . reluctantly , it was decided to terminate the work at Wolf Camp . In the meantime Young and I made another trip to Pekin with two carloads of specimens . The war news indicated that the northern generals probably would get . the worst of the struggle and that we had best get our valuable collections to Pekin as rapidly as possible . On the second trip we brought back Lieut . Col. N. E. Margetts , military attachO of the American Legation , as a camp visitor . . R Gazelle up His Sleeve T HEgrassland gazelles had already begun to gather in great herds , and Colonel Margetts saw a spectacle which thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon and the low sun shot oblique golden paths between the rolling hills . In the shadows of a deep valley we saw a restless mass of yellow forms . Thousands upon thousands of antelope  --  does , bucks and skipping babies . Colonel Margetts could hardly believe his eyes . It even gave me a thrill , and I have seen fifty such herds . Probably nowhere else except in Africa can slowly up the slope of a low hill . Shafts of sunlight caught the leaders , like the spotlights of a theater , changing them to unreal shapes of living gold . They blanketed the hillside and stretched away into the dim mystery of the darkened valley . In camp we had a baby gazelle which gave us unceasing amusement . The Mongol caravan leader brought it to us one day in the sleeve of his coat . It was only a few hours old and seemed all wabbly legs and ears , but yet it could run faster than a man . Lieutenant Wyman , our topographer , took it under his care . He already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We called his tent the zoo . I sent the Mongol back to buy a mulch goat and ( Continued on Page 401 its kid . But the goat would have none of the antelope ; neither would the little fellow nurse from his foster mother . For days Wyman kept it alive by forcible feeding , injecting the milk with a rubber syringe . Every two hours , all through the night and day , he religiously did his job . Thensuddenly the littlefellow seemed to discover the possibilities of the goat . He nursed voraciously , but his legs were so long he had to kneel to get his dinner . Wyman placed two stones at proper intervals , grasped the goat by the horns and tail , and hoisted it to the pedestal . All went beautifully then , and the feeding job was delegated to Hato , one of the Mongols . When her kid was taken away from the goat she adopted the antelope without reservation . The strange pair were inseparable . They wandered over the desert together , but never strayed very far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cook tent . It was interesting to watch the gazelle when an unknown Mongol appeared . He would seem to sink into the ground . Only with difficulty could one discover him lying flat beside a sagebrush , head and neck straight out . His gray-yellow coat blended perfectly with the gravel desert .. When the expedition left Mongolia in October , Granger gave the goat and antelope to the missionaries at Batt-in-Sumu . There seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of wolves at Wolf Camp . Someone shot a wolf almost every day . One of the Chinese surprised a pair with two young some distance from their den . The mother seized one of the babies , about the size of a cat , in her mouth and made off down a ravine . Colonel Margetts and I shot two half-grown cubs at the same place . Gunning in the Gobi Of course , antelope meat was our chief food , but sand grouse furnished a welcome variety . They are strange birds , half pigeon , half partridge in appearance . Their three-toed feet are padded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on the sand . At night and in the morning they make long flights for water . We used to conceal ourselves near the well , where there was a small pool , and had magnificent shooting . Seventy-four birds in an hour and a half was our best hag . It could be duplicated almost any day . Lieutenant Wyman was kept busy mapping the little-known region to the east of camp . When he had finished and the baby pit in front of the tents yielded no more specimens , we shifted operations fifty miles due west . Driving past the Valley of the Jewels , we could still see the tracks of our motor ears made on the first expedition eight years ago . Then Mongolia was virtually a closed hook . We had the courage of our convictions , but not much else , to entice us into the dreaded desert . Like Columbus , who failed in his real mission , but discovered a new world , so had we failed to find our primitive ancestors . Yet we , too , had discovered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent . In 1928 , Granger , while on a trip of exploration , had seen a rough escarpment fronting a vast basin . He stopped an hour and found few fossils , but many snakes . The poisonous vipers wriggled out from crevices in the rocks , from behind bushes and from under stones . He came away with a very vivid recollection of the place as being most unhealthy . Still , it held possibilities of important fossil discoveries . So we pitched camp prepared to fight a battle for possession with the snakes . But for some strange reason the reptiles had virtually disappeared . Only five or six disturbed our peace . Granger discovered one curled up under his hat and narrowly missed stepping on another with his bare feet . But that was nothingcompared to 1925 , when , at Viper Camp , we killed forty-seven in the tents . Meet the Titano there Our new home , Camp Margetts , was much like the place we had just left . Behind us was a great plain of gravel and stunted sagebrush ; in front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern boundary became only a vague horizon blur of purple . It was like looking over a calm sea from the deck of a giant ship . That night in the silence of the desert twilight we watched gazelles feeding almost at our feet . A hundred or more picked their way daintily among the clumps of sagebrush , nibbling at the tufts of short , stiff grass . Now and then they stood motionless to gaze at the city of cloth which had so suddenly risen on the empty desert . We did not molest these gentle visitors , but shot our meat behind camp on the plain . It is always interesting to make the first reconnaissance of a new exposure . Usually some specimens are easily found . Each man selects a part of the escarpment and skims the fossil cream . Later , other hones , not so obvious , are discovered . Titanotheres occupied the center of the stage for the first few days . Extraordinary beasts they were , superficially like rhinoceros , but not related closely to any living animal . They came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of the Age of Mammals , some sixty million years ago . For a time they flourished mightily , only to disappear from the face of the earth  --  why , no man knows . During the Oligocene the height of their evolution was reached . Some of them were gigantic beasts with a stupendous platelike horn , divided at the top , projecting from the nasal region . During the twenty million years or so when they almost dominated Western America they ran all the changes of skull development . In Mongolia , on the first expedition , we found the only titanotheres , except for a few fragments , known outside of America and showed that the Asiatic plateau was their place of origin . They were merely immigrants to America . Discovery of a dozen species and genera , all of them grotesque creatures , made us think that we knew the worst Nature could produce . Yet almost immediately , at Camp Margetts , a beast with a saddle head was found . It was a new titanothere . The great Embolotherium , the battering-ram titanothere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle head , but this fellow was quite unlike his larger relative . In some parts of the escarpment there was a top layer of golden yellow sand , evidently a later formation . It was identified definitely by discovering in it the bones of a Baluchitherium , the largest mammal that ever lived upon the earth , We have found a good many parts of Baluch skeletons , including throe brokea skulls , but everything about the animal is interesting . It was suell a colossal beast that when I look at the bones I think of the scaffolding of a house . Those we found last summer were not the largest we have seen , but they are big enough . A single neck vertebra weighs more than fifty pounds . It is about the site of a barrel top . Entelodon , a giant pig that tried to imitate a flesh-eating animal , was another discovery . Its great canine teeth would fool almost anyone at the first glance . Also several new rhinoceroses , one of them with a long , slender muzzle like a. horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlike anything known to science . Probably the latter played havoc among the titauotheres that then roamed the Mongolian plains . Truly this Gobi Desert was a strange place in those ancient days ! The Case against Turtle Soup Among the most remarkable finds are fourteen soft-shell turtles , related to Trionvx . Fossil turtles rather bore me , as a rule . They show so little . Even back in that incredibly remote time of the Age of Reptiles , turtles were just turtles . They look almost like the turtles of today . They do not present any very interesting farts of evolution . But these turtles at Camp Margetts were rather special exhibits . Soft-shell turtles  --  or others , for that matter  --  that have any parts of the skeleton preserved are extremely rare . These turtles , found by Buckshot , one of our Chinese collectors , not only had the upper and lower shells but the skulls , vertebrae , limbs and feet almost as beautifully preserved as though the animals had died yesterday . Seven of them lay so close together that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge block . The others were taken out one by one . What could have caused so many to die in that single spot ? I suppose that they did not all actually die there , but were swept . by the current of a stream into some quiet hack water as a final resting place . One thing that interested me enormously was a quantity of charcoal close to the turtle deposit . They were pieces of twigs about the size of my finger , but many of them . One immediately thinks of human work where fire is discovered . I can hear someone suggest that primitive men had gathered turtles for soup and that the charcoal was the remains of their fire . What a spectacular , story it would make if we only had a few facts to support such a thesis . But I am afraid that it ca n't be done . Man may have existed as far back as the Oligocene as a creature already separate from the ape stem , Professor Osborn thinks so . But it is as certain as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had sufficient intelligence to utilize fire at that early period . The presence of charcoal near the turtles must be ascribed to fire from natural causes , probably lightning . Forest fires today often arise from trees being struck by lightning , and doubtless it happened just as frequently in the past , Quite certainly it was in that way that early humans first learned the use of fire . One morning , Colonel Margetts , Granger , Young and I drove to the southwest to follow the course of the escarpment upon the edge of which we were encamped . The great bluff extended for many miles , sometimes almost lost in gentle slopes , only to appear again as a precipitous wall , deep bitten by ravines and gullies . Everywhere there were evidences of fossils . Five miles out in the basin we could see a second exposure of red bad lands . Colonel Margetts shot a wolf and an antelope before we reached them . Wandering over the brick-red sediments , all of us eventually arrived at an isolated cone-shaped butte . From its low summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tiny , flat plains and miniature ravines . Almost every inch was covered with animal footprints . An intricate tracery of innumerable lines crossed and recrossed the smooth red surface . Just below us a herd of gazelle had wandered out from the mouth of a greater ravine . Their delicate , pointed tracks showed clear and distinct . An antelope had been chased by a wolf around the base of yonder hill . A skull and bleached bones showed where a gazelle had been devoured . Foxes , following hard upon the six-foot leaps of kangaroo rats , had left their story . The track of a hare , going slowly , led to the edge of a shallow ravine , but the little creature had left in sudden panic . I wondered why . Close under the bank , in soft sand , was a wolf bed . No wonder that the hare bad run for life . Feathers of a sand grouse were scattered at one spot , but no tracks showed . The attack had come from above . A falcon probably , had struck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For an hour I wandered over the bad lands reading the story of life and death in the desert . Sixty million years ago , when these red sediments were being deposited , the drama was the same , but with different actors . Theo rhinoceroses trod this ground ; the gigantic Andrewsarthus , greatest of all known flesh eaters , prowled at night , and hyenas fed upon the bodies of dying titanotheres . It was a world of nightmare creatures , but the vegetation was not so strange . Then the desert did not exist .. The high plateaus of Africa today , with their open plains and sparse forests , offer a convincing parallel to ancient Mongolia . Horses With Claws At one spot in the sediments I found bone fragments thickly scattered on the surface . Granger marked it for future investigation and it proved to be a veritable gold mine . Some unexplained natural cataclysm had overwhelmed a whole herd of Chalicotheres . They had all died in this spot or been carried there by water . Skulls and skeletons were packed in a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veritable paradox . The bead resembled that of a horse , but the hoofs were replaced by enormous claws . Paleontologists have puzzled for years about the meaning of those claws and hardly a reasonable suggestion has been forthcoming . Other Chalicotheres are known in America and Europe , but we had found only jaws in previous years . These skulls may give us a clew to the ancestry of the group . On August twenty-eighth Mac Young and I left for Kalgan on the fourth trip , with two carloads of fossils . I was to stay in Pekin to carry on diplomatic negotiations for the continuation of our explorations . Granger took charge of the fieldwork of the expedition and expected to remain in Mongolia for another month . The war had progressed so unfavorably for the northern generals that Yen Hsi-shan needed every man at the front . He withdrew the soldiers who had been patrolling the Kalgan-Urga , trail , and immediately bandits returned to their old hunting grounds . When we passed the Mongol village belonging to our caravan men , Bato 's brother ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night thirty brigands had killed two Chinese and robbed their cars only ten miles south on the road . They might still be there ; he did not know . Mac and I went on with our rifles and revolvers ready for action . We were not asking for trouble , but we did not intend to be driven off the road by thirty Chinese bandits . The cars had been held up near a mud house which had long been a brigand rendezvous . When we arrived , all was quiet and the place seemed deserted . Even the Mongols from several yurts had gone or kept indoors . We went by at full speed and passed Chap Ser in the same way , reaching-Kalga.n with no difficulty . Jill Noisy on the Eastern Front A week later Mac went back . He drove one ear and Liu Hsih-ku , one of our Chinese , the other . I had a presentiment that something would happen , and asked Mae to be particularly careful on the road . Two days of rain had made the trail like grease . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hard , dry terrain . On the second morning after passing Chap Ser , two Mongol children told him that bandits were robbing a caravan just ahead . It was at the familiar place of the mud house . The ground was so soft that Mac could not leave the road and circle over the hills . He decided to go on . The mud house appeared half obscured by a train of oxcarts . Several men stood about . Mac had nearly passed the house when from behind a low wall thirty yards away three Chinese opened up with Luger pistols . Bullets sang all about him , but he was not hit .. He slowed down , swung about in the seat and took a snap shot at one fellow who was doing the most persistent shooting . His bullet struck a small stone in the mud wall an inch from the man 's face . Either the steel jacket or fragments of rock hit the bandit 's face . He fell backward , but the other two kept . on firing . Mae dared not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skidding dangerously . Holding his rifle in one hand like a pistol , he fired three more shots . In the meantime a dozen other bandits standing near horses began shooting with rifles and pistols . Some had mounted and were riding after him when Mac slowed clown , took a good aim and killed a horse . That ended the matter . The bandits stopped and galloped away . When the expedition returned a month later , they learned that there had been eleven bandits in the mud house . They expected an easy time when the two ears approached , and got the surprise of their lives . Instead of finding sheeplike Chinese who would have stopped at the first shot , they had figuratively grabbed a viper by the tail which proceeded to sting them un-mercifully . Mac 's little battle pro-duced an exceedingly good moral ( Continued on Page 44 ) effect . The Merchants ' Association of Kalgan supports the road police . They sent up reOnforcements and for a few weeks the trail again became comparatively safe . Virtually all the road police are former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest citizens for a time . The general of the police is a brigand chief , It is rather a comic situation , because at any moment some particularly rich caravan may be too great a temptation and the entire force will again take up the life of robbery and murder . Mac and Liu reached camp at nine o'clock on the evening of the attack . Granger had expected to move to a new place , but the region they were in was too rich to leave . More Amblypods were discovered and they obtained some of the most valuable specimens of the entire expedition . It was not until the end of September that they broke camp . The camels were sent to Hatt-inSumu with the specimens . The men went by motor . Winter came with a rush , as it usually does in Mongolia . A blizzard raged all the afternoon and night of September thirtieth , burying the country iu snow . It was high time to be gone . Lucky it was that the expedition moved out when it did , for things began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandits had captured five Chinese merchants and held them for fifty thousand dollars ' ransom . In retaliation , the soldiers took the father and brother of the chief brigand . This started a real warfare , for isolated groups of bandits consolidated into a force of four or five hundred . The road police hastily retired from Chap Ser , leaving the robbers in possession . Our ears were the last to pass on the trail . Now the entire region almost to Kalgan is in the hands of the brigands . Mac Young remained at ChangpeiAsien , thirty-four miles from Kalgan , to receive the camels which were bringing our fossils . After a long delay , they arrived , and by means of the customary outlay of silver in " squeeze " , ho got them to Pekin . The fossils , spread out upon the laboratory floor , were an impressive sight . It was the largest and perhaps the most important collection ever taken out of Central Asia . The dinosaur eggs and some other specimens discovered in previous years were more spectacular and had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hardly surpass this collection . It gives us additional proof that the Central Asian plateau was one of the greatest centers of origin and distribution of animal life during the Age of Reptiles and the Age of Mammals . It shows that Mongolia was even more favorable for the development of many types of mammals than was Europe or America and continued to be so long after these groups had disappeared in other parts of the world . It gives much additional knowledge of the climate , vegetation and physical conditions of this great incubator of world life . True , we have not been successful in one objective of our search  --  the dawn man . It is a scientific tragedy that Chinese opposition to foreign investigation should end our work just when that goal might be attained . Still we have shown the way ; have broken the trail , as it were . Later , others will reap a rich harvest . We are more than ever convinced that Central Asia was the paleontological Garden of Eden .
