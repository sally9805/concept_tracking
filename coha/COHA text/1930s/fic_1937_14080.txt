IT IS the evening hour , and the audience is gathering in the amphitheatre for the play . As the twilight deepens and the vast vague shadow of night rolls in across the scene eastward from the sea , a great organ concealed among the trees begins to play a salutation of praise to Almighty God . As it continues , the light comes up on a sort of niche or alcove built into the bank at the immediate left front of the proscenium . Here as if seen through a transparent gauze is a group of twenty or twenty-five men and women who constitute the commenting and interpretative chorus throughout the play . They are dressed in gray smock-like vestments . There is a pause in the organ , then it begins again as the chorus rises and sings . CHORUS ( In swelling harmony above the organ . ) O God that madest earth and skyAnd hedged the restless seas around , Who that vast firmament on highWith golden banded stars hath bound  --  O thou whose mighty arm doth keepThe trembling world , the failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dark measures run  --  O God our Father , Lord above , O bright immortal , holy one , Secure within thy boundless loveWe walk this way of death alone .  --  Amen . ( As the music of the organ and the singing die away , the minister of the occasion rises and stands in front of the audience . His figure is illuminated in a circle of light . And now the light dies away from the chorus. ) p. 3 MINISTER O Lord , our heavenly Father , Almighty and everlasting God , In whom men have their life , Their motion and their certain hope , We ask the witness of thy graceUpon this sacred spot , This bit of humble earthWhich we have come to dedicate.For here once walked the men of dreams , The sons of hope and pain and wonder , Upon their foreheads truth 's bright diadem , The light of the sun in their countenance , And their lips singing a new song  --  A song for ages yet unborn , For us the children that came after them  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang , " O land majestic , free , unbounded ! " CHORUS ( Chanting softly from the darkness . ) This was the vision , this the fadeless dream  --  Tread softly , softly now these yellow stricken sands.This was the grail , the living light that leapt  --  Speak gently , gently on these muted tongueless shores . MINISTER Now down the trackless hollow yearsThat swallowed them but not their songWe send response  --  " O lusty singer , dreamer , pioneer , Lord of the wilderness , the unafraid , Tamer of darkness , fire and flood , Of the soaring spirit winged aloftOn the plumes of agony and death  --  Hear us , O hear ! The dream still lives , It lives , it livesAnd shall not die ! " ( The organ strikes out in a sudden bold announcement , and the unseen chorus chants " Domini est terra. " ) p. 4 CHORUS The earth is the Lord 's and all the therein is , The compass of the world and they that dwell therein , For he hath founded it upon the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father and to the Son And to the Holy Ghost  --  As it was in the beginning , Is now and ever shall be , World without end .  --  Amen . ( After the chant there is an instant of pause , then the speaker of the occasion rises and stands in front of the audience where the minister has stood . His figure likewise is illuminated in a circle of light . Among other things let him say : ) SPEAKER Friends , we are gathered here this evening to honor the spiritual birthplace of our nation and to memorialize those heroic men and women who made it so . Three hundred and fifty years ago in England was conceived the idea of building a new nation in a new world , and on this very site was laid the first foundation for it . Here these pioneers of a new order , of a new form of government lived and struggled , suffered and died . And in the symbol of their endurance and their sacrifice let us renew our courage and our hope , and by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not die in vain . For as we keep faith with them , so shall we keep faith with ourselves and with future generations who demand of us that a nation of liberty and free men shall continue on the earth . Now to the poet and historian we leave the story of their lives . ( The light dies out , the speaker retires , and then another light comes up on a sort of niche or alcove built into the bank at the immediate right front of the proscenium . Here as if seen through a transparent gauze and seated at a little table with a light and a great open book is the elderly historian and narrative leader who is also dressed like the chorus . He begins reading aloud. ) p. 5 HISTORIAN ( His amplified voice filling the theatre . ) In the time of Queen Elizabeth many English men and women , notably among them Sir Walter Raleigh , continued in their dream of founding an English speaking nation in the new world . In pursuance of that brave intent two explorers , Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fifteen hundred and eighty-four , to discover a fitting place for a first settlement . Such a place they found on and around Roanoke Island which they reached in July of the same year and which they described as the goodliest land under the cope of heaven . It was the time of the corn harvest when they arrived and the friendly Indians were celebrating . p. 6 Act 1 , Scene 2 : Pantomime Scene 2 . PANTOMIME THE light dies away from the historian , and a low staccato drum-beat begins in the organ . As it continues , the light gradually comes up on the center stage , which represents an Indian palisaded town on Roanoke Island . Set in front of the palisades at the back are several rough-framed Indian houses , half-covered with bark and skins . Squatted in a semi-circle near the front is a file of old and middle-aged Indian women , some ten or twelve , with their bare backs toward the audience . They are scantily dressed , their hair set with chaplets of leaves and tied behind like a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colors and animal figures . Each one carries a short green pine branch in her hand which she waves rhythmically in the air as she sways from side to side in time to the music . Set farther back in the center of the stage is the Indian corn god , fastened to a stake stuck in the ground . This outlandish figure somewhat resembles a modern scarecrow , is about eight feet high and decorated with strings of shells , beads , and a circlet of ears of corn looped successively on a cord and hanging down from around its neck almost to the ground . Its head and face are constructed of corn shucks and set with black walnuts for eyes and grains of corn for teeth . Around its base a bundle or shock of corn stalks is placed and on its outstretched arms is a large wooden bowl for receiving gifts from the worshipers . To the left and squatted on the ground are two old Indian men , one with a soundless gourd rattle which he shakes in the air and the other with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These two are naked except for a cloth about the waist and like the women are painted with colors and designs of plants and animals . To the right sits the Indian monarch . He is a grave , majestic figure of a man about sixty years old , decorated like the idol with shells , beads , copper trinkets and bone ear-rings , and in addition wears several feathers in his roached-up hair . His shoulders are draped in a rich doeskin . Behind him sit his several wives and a few men attendants , and behind them farther to the right stand a few young half-naked Indian warriors with bows , shields and spears . The chief and his attendants , men and women , are all smoking long cane-stemmed clay pipes as they watch the antics of a wild priest or medicine man spinning eerily around the idol . The medicine man is performing the ceremony of the corn harvest dance . A wizened spindly ancient he is , and naked save for a breechclout , his head fitted with two ears of corn shucks which stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red circle and around the other a white one . He carries a feathered gourd rattle and a blunt packing stick about two feet long . His body is bathed in the oil of sweat from his already great exertions . As the tempo of the organ music and the swaying and beating increase , he redoubles his exertions around the idol . With clamorous gesticulations he calls on all to witness that this is the great god that has blessed them in former times . He points to the sky , his gestures indicate the wide earth and the sea , the birds that fly through the air , all animals that creep and run  --  these with outstretched arms he offers as thankful gifts to the idol , all done in silent pantomime to the organ accompaniment . When the tempo has reached a climax , the medicine man fings up his hands with a wide soundless gasp , falls and lies still in front of his god . The organ returns to a slow tempo , the swaying and beating likewise . Now entering from the right by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maidens dancing . Each one holds aloft on the palm of her hand a little basket filled with ears of corn . The maidens are dressed in short skin kirtles , and wear chaplets of leaves about their flowing hair and flowers and vines around their necks and over their shoulders . Entering from the left to meet them come six or seven half-naked Indian youths dancing likewise and carrying in one hand a bow and in the other a rude field implement  --  a sharp pointed stick , a wooden mattock , or wooden spade . Twice the two groups interweave a circle about the idol , and then in increasing tempo place their baskets and bows and implements at its base and begin moving with swiftly pattering feet and high-held tremulous hands around and around . As the speed increases , all the spectators with the exception of the two rattle and drum men are pulled into the circle around the idol . The elderly women , the chief , his attendants , and the young warriors all crawl forward and bow up and down , touching their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and as he does so everyone , including the dancing youths and maidens , bows abjectly down . The medicine man goes around them moving his feathered scepter mystically over their bent forms . The organ suddenly stops playing , the two musicians cease their beating and the priest now picks up several ears of corn and offers them in apparent trepidation to the god . The augury is good as a single note from the organ declares , and the god accepts them . The priest is overjoyed , as he lays the ears in the bowl . Jubilation spreads through the scene . The worshipers sit eagerly up , the medicine man begins prancing back and forth , saying in his gestures that the season will be bountiful . The next crop of corn will be so high  --  he leaps to measure with his hand , ears so long , three to a hill . They all spring to their feet , including the Indian chief , and begin dancing wildly . Somewhere in the distance the long brazen note of an English horn is suddenly blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and packing stick fall from his hand . The other Indians remain a moment as they are , looking queryingly about them . Then as the horn sounds again , they fly over to the right of the stage and stand huddled in fear . An Indian runner comes scurrying in from the left . The organ now begins a stately English martial air . In sign language the Indian tells of strange creatures in boats winged like birds . A gun is fired off near at hand . And the Indians flee incontinently away at the right , the chief and his warriors in some dignity going last . But as they go they all scoop up their belongings  --  baskets , tools , and corn , and the priest with the two musicians carries off the god . The scene is deserted . The organ music dies , the light dims down on the center stage and rises on the figure of the historian as he bends above his book . HISTORIAN ( Reading . ) The simple Indians fearing the white men as strange hurtful gods fled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barlowe finally persuaded them with many signs and giving of presents that they were friends and meant them no harm . They assembled back at the Indian palisaded town and swore eternal friendship . The Indian chief provided a supply of fish , corn , game , melons and herbs for the ships , and Amadas and Barlowe took possession of the land . ( The historian closes his book as the light fades , to come up immediately on the center stage . On the right stands the chief with his people and warriors behind him , looking intently off at the left . As the organ plays the stately English march , Amadas and Barlowe enter from the left . Immediately behind them is a priest of the Church of England in vestments , and on one side of him a soldier bearing a cross about eight feet high , and on the other another soldier with the British flag . The cortege stops , and Amadas walks forward to meet the chief in the middle of the stage . They embrace each other , and the chief blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , and then across the breast of Amadas . After this they both kneel down and clasp hands and the English priest steps forward and meets the Indian medicine man directly behind the two kneeling figures . He opens his Bible over them , and the medicine man raises his feathered scepter . For a moment the priest reads silently from the Bible . Amadas and the chief rise , separate and step back from the center . At a gesture from the latter , a procession of Indian women begins passing across the rear of the scene from right to left laden with provisions  --  baskets of corn , fruits , bundles of sassafras wood , a few skins and pottery utensils . The chief bends down and with his wooden sword cuts out a piece of turf , sticks an arrow in it and gives it to Amadas . He receives in return a copper kettle which he gleefully sets on his head and then hangs by a string around his neck . At a second gesture from him , all the Indians bow down and acknowledge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priest bring the cross forward and set it up in the place where the Indian god had been before . The Indians still remain bowed . The second soldier brings forward the flag and sticks the staff into the ground beside the cross . The Englishmen present arms and a heavy ordnance is shot off in the distance . The Indians control their fright . Amadas holds up a great scroll in front of him . And so the two groups remain for a moment as the historian 's voice rises again and the organ stops. ) p. 7 HISTORIAN ( In the shadow . ) In the name of our most gracious sovereign Queen Elizabeth , by the grace of God , of England , France and Ireland , Queen and Defender of the Faith . To all people to whom these presents shall come , greeting . Know ye that of her special grace , certain science and mere motion , we do this day take possession of this Island of Roanoke , and the lands to the west , south , and the northward thereof , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess of the same and her heirs and assigns and successors and for her beloved and trusty servant Sir Walter Raleigh under her , his heirs and assigns and successors , forever  --  in the name of Almighty God  --  Amen . ( The organ sounds a flourish , the light dies out on the center stage and comes up more brightly on the historian as he continues . ) HISTORIAN And now with the English flag planted proudly over a vast domain of wilderness , the explorers made ready to return to England . Many a young Indian brave wished to travel with them across the ocean to a land of great cities where the Queen sat on a throne shining like the sun . Lots were drawn and Wanchese , a kinsman of King Wingina , and Manteo , a young chieftain , were chosen  --  with what future results to the colonists we shall see . The light-hearted Indian youths and maidens gathered in celebration of their going , and the old king sent presents to Queen Elizabeth , among them tobacco and potatoes . ( The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right revealing some six or seven flower-decked Indian girls standing in a semi-circle around the prideful Wanchese , singing and clapping their hands in soundless pantomime to the organ music which has now begun . Spread out on the ground in front of Wanchese is a skin on which several gifts are piled . As the maidens continue their singing and clapping , an Indian youth enters with a bundle of dried tobacco which he lays on the skin . Now enters Manteo with his arm around his weeping wife and followed by his little son . He carries a skin bundle over his shoulder . He gestures his wife behind him , and he and Wanchese greet each other shoulder to shoulder , hand to hand . And now enter several Indian youths . They clap and sing silently . A horn blows . Wanchese swings up his bundle . They begin to leave . The light dies out and comes up on the historian again as the organ stops. ) p. 8 HISTORIAN Back in England the explorers were received with great joy , bells were rung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new land . The two Indians , Manteo and Wanchese , were a marvel wherever they went , tobacco smoking set the people agog , and even beggars on the street talked about the wonders beyond the sea . p. 9 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene 3 THE light dies from the historian and comes up on the immediate fore-front of the stage . A hullabaloo is heard in the shadows at the extreme left front of the proscenium and a ragged figure of a man is propelled into the scene . He stands tottering in the light and holding a bear mug tremblingly in his hand  --  a poor specimen of a beggar with rotting shoes , ragged breeches , and tattered doublet . His hair is ill-kept and his elderly thin face marked with the ravages of penury and exposure . He is typical of the fool or masterless man . MASTERLESS MAN ( Staring about him and talking into the air . ) Lord-a-mercy , what 's England coming to when a poor harmless man can no longer beg a drink ? Get out , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests , lodgers  --  all true followers of the queen and Sir Walter Raleigh 's men  --  coming to view the new wonders !

Hah-hah  --  then I 'm no longer lonesome , for they 're all fools like me . And sure we must be merry , for in company there is merriment . ( He cuts a few steps in a caper and drinks . ) Yet they are greater fools than I. For  --  item  --  do they not all run around with pipes in their mouths now and smoke pouring from the two chimneys of their nose like their very liver were a roaring red-hot fire inside their bellies ? Item  --  do they not go in great crowds following after the two Indians like the twin sons of Noah had come back to rule the earth ? Hah-hah-hah  --  and they 're nothing but two niggers out of the darkness of Africa , I know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk in silver armor like the great Sir Walter . ( Calling into the night . ) Queen Elizabeth ! Queen Elizabeth ! Ahm , she is busy thinking of the Spaniards . ( Calling . ) Sir Walter Raleigh ! Sir Walter Raleigh ! Lord of Uppowoc and the new potato ! He too is busy dreaming of a new world . Well , look to your crowing , Sir Walter , or they 'll cut your comb someday like his worship the bishop . ( Draining the last of his ale and looking up at the sky . ) So after all I am a fool , for the fool is he who speaketh to shadows and getteth no answer . Then I tell it to God behind the shadows . Between him and me is great confidence . And God knows I be cold and hungry , and now I lie down in his mercy and sleep on the poor man 's bed  --  whereon and wherein , blessed be his name , we shall all sleep together at the last day , and then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a place to lie down . The organ begins softly playing the opening bars of a song . The beggar straightens up . A soldier with a halberd enters from the left , and likewise another from the right . They meet in the center of the scene behind the beggar and march up to the edge of the stage and take their stand , one on either side of the proscenium . The beggar begins singing . ) Hast thou heard what wise men say  --  Every dog will have his day , Come then , dogs , let 's quick away  --  ( There is a gap in the music while he whistles for the dogs . ) &nbsp; &nbsp; Hunting for our own.Starved and homeless here we die , Naked is the bed we lie , Wisdom giveth us who cry &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing but a bone .

It 's writ in the sign of great water . But I say no more . ( He lies down again . ) FIRST SOLDIER Well-said and well-hushed , old Abram man .

And no matter how it scratch and gall , I would not change it for a great madness on the raging sea , no , not if the Island of Roanoke gave me up a wad of gold big as Canterbury tower . p. 12 SECOND SOLDIER ( Straightening up . ) Hist , they begin . ( Two heralds enter at the right and left from behind the proscenium . They raise their trumpets and blow a long blast . As they continue blowing a series of calls , people begin coming over the platforms at the left and right front of the proscenium . These are the common people of England  --  small shopkeepers , farmers , laborers , pedlars , milkmaids , tapsters , innkeepers , cart drivers , tanners , sailors , sheep-shearers , ditchers , masons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a vagabond or two . Some of them carry the implements of their trade  --  a shepherd 's crook , a whip , a mallet , saw , trowel , spade , rake , pitchfork . And one or two water-carriers are fitted with yokes and buckets . Each group is led by a young shepherd with a crook , and they all are singing as they come , aided by the now unseen chorus and the organ ) PEOPLE We come from field and town , From byre and forest greenIn honor of the crown  --  Honor of the crown , That fits our gracious Queen .

He bows to the people and to the audience. ) p. 13 MASTER OF CEREMONIES Ladies and gentlemen , let it be known that I am the master of the Queen 's ceremonies , and in her majesty 's name I bid you heartily welcome to this our little garden party .

( The two heralds raise their trumpets and blow a flourish . Several flower girls trip in from the right and scatter flowers over the scene . Queen Elizabeth enters slowly from the right rear , dressed in great show and attended by her courtiers and maids-in-waiting . The people fall on their knees . She sits down in the great chair , two pages hold a canopy over her , and the attendants form a semi-circle behind . At a gesture from her , the people rise and crane forward to look at her , the men with their caps and hats in their hands .

The young man starts forward as the lights dim down a bit on the stage , but at this moment entering from the left come a group of young girls , some ten or twelve , dressed like milkmaids and carrying lighted sparklers in their hands . As the organ continues playing they dance around Raleigh a moment and then skip lightly away at the right rear .

The light dims from the scene and comes up on the historian . ) HISTORIAN And so through Raleigh 's aid Shakespeare did not go to Roanoke Island , but that his imagination traveled to that new land is shown in some of his plays of later years .

( The light dies out from the historian and rises once more on Raleigh who is now walking back and forth in the scene as before . Out of the shadow at the right front a young man comes striding along into the scene . He is a tall lithe young fellow about twenty-five or six years old and of frank open face , tanned brown by the wind and sun .

Sir Walter Raleigh . " The organ stops , the sounds die away , and the light comes up on the historian once more. ) p. 28 HISTORIAN In the spring of 1585 a colony of a hundred and eight men was sent out from England under the command of Ralph Lane . At the Queen 's order Raleigh remained behind . Lane took possession of the Indian village on the north end of Roanoke Island where we are gathered tonight . He re-fortified the place and named it " the Citie of Raleigh in Virginia . " He spent much time exploring the surrounding country , and on an expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlement of Jamestown . Much scientific knowledge of plants and animal life was gathered by the famous naturalist , Thomas Hariot , who was a member of this colony . And John White who also was a member continued his paintings of the people and their customs . Within a few months the settlement was firmly established , and would have survived no doubt but for the fact that Lane antagonized the Indians by enslaving them to labor in the cornfields and to provide the colonists with game . The Indians rebelled , and Lane , using the pretext of a stolen silver cup , decided to teach them a lesson in authority . One summer night when the medicine man was placating the spirits of the forest , he and his men surprised King Wingina , the kinsman of Wanchese , as he slept in his tent and murdered him . Because of this act Wanchese became the deadly enemy of the white man . p. 29 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene 4 THE light dies from the center stage , the organ begins playing a low mournful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center is illuminated . The rude bark house of King Wingina is revealed , with the side open towards the audience . The old King is seated cross-legged inside , with his feathered head sunk on his breast . Behind him in the shadow his outlandish household god watches over him . A few drowsy warriors are lying around on the ground outside , armed with stone hatchets , bows , shields , and spears . Before the house the half-naked medicine man is carrying on his hocus-pocus with the ghosts and devils of the air , weaving his head about , gesturing with his hands , falling on his knees , and lifting his face to the sky . Suddenly the warriors spring to their feet and look about them as if listening for an invisible and silent enemy . Wingina jerks his head up and grasps his hatchet . The priest shakes his head in disapproval saying that all is well . The warriors finally lie down again , the priest resumes his supplication into the night , throwing out his curved hands and pulling them towards him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wingina gradually lowers his head again on his breast . The priest now turns and begins to move around the scene , waving his rattle dreamfully over the warriors . They lay themselves back and stretch out on the ground , and King Wingina himself topples over and lies quiet on his mat . The priest runs into the little house , gets the god , and sticks it up in front of the tent to watch over them . Then he lies down on his face before it . Gradually the scene is enveloped in sleep . The organ plays mournfully and softly . And now creeping queerly in at the right and the left of the platform come the low moving branches of pine trees . They stop , then come a step nearer , converging towards the center , and behind them the low stooped forms of men carrying guns can be seen . With a wild shriek the medicine man springs to his feet , but it is too late . The soldiers fling down their branches , and fly upon the paralyzed Indians . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , one of the soldiers leaping after him with drawn sword . And now amid screams and yells of terror Lane and his men butcher the Indians . The god is overturned in the scramble . Lane himself can be seen inside the bark house as he murders Wingina . A moment later he reappears with the King 's head in his hand , and holds it up in triumph . And then like a wave of sound a dreadful ululation rolls out of the forest . The colonists hurry down from the platform and cross the scene at the right front into the fort . The light dims on the platform and comes up in a dull haze on the center stage where now Lane and his men can be vaguely seen fortifying themselves against attack , as the organ plays . Along the walkway that runs the length of the palisades at the back two armed sentinels stand outlined against the sky , and figures of several half-clad men hurry to and fro across the scene loading their guns as they go . The light dims down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medicine man comes stealthily out of the forest . Hopping over the still forms of the dead warriors , he falls down and embraces his fallen god with groans and piteous bleating cries . Then turning towards the forest he raises his cupped hands in a high piercing call . Three times he repeats it , and it is answered by the appearance of a group of Indian braves fully armed who enter out of the darkness around . The priest picks his god up and points towards the fort . Yells of hate and rage burst from the warriors . Led by the priest and the god , they begin a wild war dance . Then they hurry swiftly down the bank and spread across the scene and disappear around the proscenium at the right and left . The light dies out , and from the darkness of the fort the flash of firearms begins . The Indians are seen climbing the palisades only to be beaten back , and we hear the yells and loud roll of the drum , aided by the swirling chords of the organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night air is split by the roar of a cannon , jarring the earth . A second cannon roars , and the Indians flee across the scene , throwing their shields and bows away as they run . In an instant they are gone , the organ stops , and the light comes up on the historian . HISTORIAN Though beaten off , the Indians returned again and again . At last they began a campaign of starvation against the fort . They poisoned the wells by stealth , tore up the nets of the fishermen , spoiled the cornfields , and drove the game away . After nearly a year of hopeless struggle Lane decided to abandon the colony . When Sir Francis Drake came by in his ships , he embarked with all his men for England , and the city of Raleigh was left deserted . A few days later Sir Richard Grenville arrived with bountiful supplies , but too late . Grenville left fifteen brave men to hold the fort in the Queen 's name and sailed for England to report to Raleigh.But despite this failure Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young John Borden , likewise such down-and-out friends of Raleigh as Old Tom . Finally the colony was raised , and this time it was to be a permanent one , for it consisted of a hundred and fifty men , women and children who were to build homes in the new world . Three small ships were got together , mainly at Raleigh 's expense , and on May the eighth , 1587 , the last of the expedition assembled at Plymouth ready to sail upon the long voyage . But dissension broke out among some of the members and desertions brought the number down to a hundred and twenty-one . p. 30 p. 31 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene 5 THE light dies from the historian and comes up on a scene at the left front of the center stage , representing the open yard of a tavern in Plymouth . A table is in the foreground around which several sailors are sitting . They are being intermittently served with mugs of ale by a mopheaded apprentice who appears out of the shadow at the rear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings in his ears and a short mean-looking sword hanging from his belt , is standing on the table haranguing a crowd of people  --  men , women and children . These are members of the colony , assembled with their bundles and pitiful baggage to sail for Virginia . As Fernando carries on his harangue , other colonists come down the platform at the left , some of them continue on their way out at the right , but most of them stop to hear what is being said . Among the latter is Old Tom , who lifts off his blanket roll and sits down on it . FERNANDO ( Continuing and waving his beer mug . ) Three times I have been pilot on Her Majesty 's ships sailing foreign seas , and three times the merciful Father  --  ( Lifting his eyes an instant to heaven. )  --  has seen fit to allow me to return safe home again .

( The sailor lays his head over on the table and is silent . Fernando goes on more loudly . ) And now I am appointed to pilot this expedition  --  to Virginia .

( A baby begins to cry , and a mother is seen hushing it with her breast . ) Mayhap that baby already sees what lies ahead and weeps . Give over this undertaking , I tell you , give over before it is too late , before you set foot into them three pitiful little ships out there . ( He gestures off towards the right rear . ) If Ralph Lane and a hundred strong men failed on Roanoke Island , what do you think will happen to your women and children ? And what do you think has already happened to the fifteen men left in that wretched place by Sir Richard Grenville ? I wager I already know . They are dead . The wilderness has swallowed them as it will swallow you .

A horn blows a long brazen note from the distance , and some four or five of the younger men turn and hurry away in the direction George Howe has gone. ) p. 34 FERNANDO ( Calling out as if answering the horn . ) Blow , blow on , old horn of Jericho ! Let the walls of the world fall in , but they wo n't crush me . My luck holds . ( Angrily to those about him . ) I tell you , only death awaits you on this mad adventure .

Looking about him . ) I 'll tell you  --  one man and one alone , Sir Walter Raleigh . All for his honor and glory it is , all to spread his fame across the world . He has no care for you  --  he has no  --  BORDEN ( Calling out in a hard cold voice . ) That 's a lie , Simon Fernando .

( A few of the colonists who has begun to edge away now return as Borden goes on , but others whose hearts have already failed them continue out at the left to return to the safety of their homes . ) Friends , I am nothing but a poor farmer . I have no authority except my own voice . And that I 'll use for Mistress Dare and Sir Walter . We have set our faces towards that new world , towards a new life for us all . And are we to be stopped here dulled and dead in our tracks by an old woman 's tale of danger and hardship ? Then go home , go home now and the ships waiting out there  --  ( He gestures off to the right. )  --  may rot where they lie . Danger and hardship ! Aye , the better for it . So we may test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we be women worth the name . Who is this Simon Fernando that you should listen to him ? A Spaniard with a Spanish name . ( Fernando suddenly draws his sword , but two men with pikes spring forward and hold them pointed at his breast . He slowly puts up his blade . ) Like his master Philip he fears a colony in Virginia . He wishes us to fail . But there will be no failing , not if the sea and the wilderness and all Spain herself conspire against us . No , for blow against blow , we will give them back again . p. 36 VOICES Speak , lad ! Brave John Borden ! We 'll stand with you , John ! BORDEN We have made the cast . We turn our backs upon this little England  --  to go forth to struggle , to work , to conquer that unknown wilderness  --  to build a nation there  --  our nation . ( Lifting his eyes an instant to heaven . ) And with God 's help we 'll build it . ( Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bravo , John Borden . ( At Raleigh 's entrance everybody rises , even the drunken sailors , and Fernando steps quickly down from the table . Raleigh is accompanied by a group of people  --  the Reverend Martin , John White , Eleanor Dare , and her husband Ananias Dare , Manteo and Wanchese , and two or three members of the council . With them are two armed soldiers , a drummer and a flag-bearer . At their entrance Borden stands embarrassed a moment and then slips quietly down from the table and stands among the crowd . Raleigh , whose tall form towers above the assembly looks kindly about him . His face marked with emotion , he speaks in a gentle but firm voice . ) Friends , pioneers of a new nation soon to be , I come to you at this parting moment in all humility and pride  --  humility that to English men and women is granted the privilege of this high endeavor , and pride that you my old neighbors of Devon are to share in it . It is nowise strange that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can question what it means to take this step . Our good pilot Fernando here has unrolled his doleful story to your ears , I know . Aye , there are dangers , hardships , unaccountable chances of weal and woe that await you . But that such men and women as you and John Borden and Mistress Eleanor Dare will win over them I can not doubt . As for Fernando , his bark is worse than his bite . True , he prefers plundering on the seas to the dull business of colonizing , but as both the Queen and I know he is the best pilot that sails an English ship . He will be true to the trust reposed in him and land you safely in Virginia . ( He turns and offers his hand to Fernando who hesitates a moment , takes it , and then turns and hurries away at the right rear . ) And now to the authority of Governor White and his assistant , Master Ananias Dare , I beg your obedience . Would God that I might sail with them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars at home . My heart goes with you , my hopes , and my dreams . God bless you . ( He moves among them embracing them and shaking hands. ) p. 37 VOICES God bless you , Sir Walter ! WHITE ( Calling out . ) Lead on to the ships ! OLD TOM Aye , my hearties , let 's go ! ( The colonists pick up their bags and bundles , and start slowly across the scene towards the right rear , led by John White . Manteo and Wanchese touch hands with Raleigh and join the crowd . Raleigh embraces John Borden and sends him away with a smile . Old Tom now raises a song , and the crowd joins bravely in . Lastly goes Eleanor Dare leaning on the arm of her husband . Raleigh bends and kisses her on the forehead , and with tears in his eyes watches her go . Meanwhile the song has continued , the organ accompanying , the flag flying and the drum beating . ) CROWD ( As they march away . ) O farewell England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We leave to you our hearth and hall , To seek an unknown land  --  land  --  land , To seek an unknown land . CHORUS O the stormy winds may blow , And the raging seas may roar , But merrily we sail wayTo that fair land Virgini-ay-ay-ay , To that fair land Virgini-ay . ( The music and the singing die away in the distance . Raleigh remains in the scene alone . He lifts his face in silent prayer . And now a low humming chant sets up in the chorus , gradually coming out more strongly until the words are distinguishable. ) @x AFTER the intermission , the audience is summoned back to the amphitheatre by the sound of the organ . The lights die out , and the chorus begins singing from the darkness , " Deus noster refugium . " As the singing continues the tall masts of a ship moving on the sound are discerned above the palisaded fort at the back . They slide across the scene like something in a dream and slowly disappear at the left rear . CHORUS God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we not fear , though the earth be movedAnd though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea ; Though the waters thereof rage and swell , And though the mountains shake at the tempest of the same.Be still then and know that I am God.I will be exalted among the nations , And I will be exalted in the earth . ( The light now rises on the historian . ) HISTORIAN After a long and stormy voyage the colony arrived at Roanoke Island on July 23 , 1587 . Landing parties were at once sent out for the relief of the fifteen men who had been left behind the year before . But as Fernando had prophesied , they had all been killed by the Indians or drowned trying to escape . The party with John Borden and Captain Dare was the first to reach the fort . ( The light dies from the historian and comes up on the center stage , revealing the interior of the fort as Lane and others had rebuilt it . At the center back is a little chapel , topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the audience . To the left of that is a little cabin and to the right another little cabin . Jutting in from either side at the front are the roof edges of still other cabins . A few boxes , casks , and bales are scattered about , rude furniture overturned , and in general the scene shows signs of having been recently plundered . And now the sound of an English snare drum is heard coming in at the left . Ananias Dare , at the head of some eight or ten soldiers , enters  --  John Borden , Manteo and Wanchese being among them . At a gesture from Dare , the small cortege stop , ground arms and look curiously about , and the flag-bearer rests the butt of the flagstaff against the earth. ) p. 40 DARE ( Calling loudly . ) Hooah ! Hooah ! Show yourselves ! Heeoh  --  friends ! ( At another gesture from him the drummer drums a tattoo beat . Presently from the direction of the platform up on the right bank a voice is heard calling . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanchese looks up from the center stage , listens a moment , and then hurries over to the front of the scene and stops . Outlined against the darkness of the forest at the right the figure of Uppowoc , the medicine man , can be seen . The call is repeated . ) Yona-yona , Wankes ! ( Wanchese suddenly runs out from the center stage , and passing by the fringe of audience , leaps up the steps and onto the platform . Uppowoc cavorts towards him , bowing and scraping . He picks up a handful of dirt and pours it on his head , signifying obedience . Suddenly Wanchese grabs him by the arm . ) WANCHESE Mish-wi aga , Wingina ? MEDICINE MAN Ne bah na-tee-o , Wingina .

MANTEO ( Slowly and gravely . ) White men maybe dead  --  gone . ( He gestures up towards the sky . ) DARE Advance at guard .

RALEIGH Then count me brave and let them write me down brave fool in ages yet to be . GLANE Leave that to history to decide  --  between us two . Your request ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to purchase two small ships . GLANE And you would send them to your colony ? RALEIGH At once  --  with provisions . God knows how stands it with them there ! GLANE You know my orders of these several months ? RALEIGH I do  --  no ships will leave these shores . GLANE ( Trying to control her anger . ) Yes . RALEIGH But then I begged a fleet of ships before . And these are only two and small at that . They could be spared , with Master White . WHITE ( Coming forward and bowing down on his knees . ) Your Majesty , I beg you . My daughter  --  her baby  --  day and night they call to me . ( Brokenly . ) I can not endure it . Let me go to them . p. 68 GLANE ( Loudly . ) Rise , Master White .

GLANE Yet if Philip attacks us and we lose  --  ( Looking sternly at Raleigh. )  --  then for this tiny thread , these little ships that might have turned the tide , Sir Walter shall pay forfeit with his head . ( She rises quickly as a messenger enters . Falling on his knees , he presents a letter which Elizabeth takes and tears open . She reads it and then smiles strangely at Sir Walter . ) It seems that destiny doth make the choice . Between my England and your Virginia , it favors me . Would God it did not in such a tragic way as this . ( Loudly . ) In this hour no ship shall leave England , large or small . Gentlemen , the Spanish Armada is set to sail against us . And now to arms  --  God save us ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand , kisses it and strides away . The Queen and the others hurry out . Raleigh and White are left behind. ) p. 69 WHITE ( In a low agonized voice . ) This means the end of the colony . It will die . RALEIGH ( Staring before him . ) As many of us shall  --  that England may live . ( He goes slowly out at the rear , White following like a broken man . Far in the distance a high strident horn is blown . The scene fades out and the voice of the historian is heard in the shadow . ) HISTORIAN And so all resources of England were kept for defense against Spain . And there on Roanoke Island the colonists waited with sickened hearts for the help that never came . Day after day , night after night , month after month , they watched and waited , but never the white sail of a ship was seen , never the mariner 's cheer was heard to tell that help was nigh . Only the murmur of the vast and sheeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoot of a swamp owl broke upon their uneasy dreams . ( The organ begins to play a slow dead march , and a dim glow rises on the center stage and suffuses the scene . A funeral cortege is seen entering from the right led by Eleanor Dare with a book held before her . John Borden walks by her side . Four men carrying a small rude coffin follow behind , accompanied by Joyce Archard and several women and children who are weeping silently . The low harmonious hum of the unseen chorus rises with the organ chords in a funeral chant  --  as Eleanor reads from the service. ) p. 70 ELEANOR I know that my redeemer liveth , And that I shall rise out of the earth in the last day , And shall be covered again with my skin , And shall see God in my flesh , Yea , and I myself shall behold him , Not with other but with the same eyes.The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away , Even as it hath pleased the LordSo cometh things to pass.Blessed be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the Lord . ( The funeral procession passes on out at the left , the light fades from the center scene and comes up on the historian . ) HISTORIAN Through sickness and death they had another firm ally and protector in Manteo . With the aid of the colonists he surprised Wanchese and slew him as he had sworn , and dispersed the tribe , but at a great loss , for he himself was badly wounded . John Borden also was wounded , and several colonists were killed , among them being Captain Dare , Henry Johnson , Humphrey Newton , John Starte , Martin Sutton , Clement Taylor , and Ambrose Viccars . The government of the colony now devolved upon Eleanor Dare and John Borden . With unflagging spirits they strove to supply food , keep up the morale of the settlers , and take care of the ailing . And every day the whisper ran  --  " Food will come by Christmas , surely by Christmas Sir Walter will send his ships . " Christmas came and went . Spring again , then summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced them on their second Christmas . p. 71 Act 2 , Scene 5 Scene 5 A LIGHT comes up inside the cabin at the right of the chapel and reveals Eleanor Dare sitting by a cradle in which Virginia Dare is sleeping . She is singing a lullaby , and her fingers fly back and forth weaving a rush basket as she sings . In the center of the scene at the front is a large pot with a circle of dull red coals under it . On the walkway at the back the dim figure of the sentinel can be seen as he keeps his watch . It is early evening in winter . ELEANOR When Jesus came from heaven &nbsp; To be a little child , He chose a lowly maiden , &nbsp; His mother , Mary mild.To warm him were the oxen , &nbsp; His bed a manger bare , And for our need he suffered &nbsp; Great want and cold and care . ( Somewhere in the distance the muffled sobs of a woman are heard . Eleanor listens a moment with strained attention and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven &nbsp; Where thou art Lord of all , O send thy blessed angels &nbsp; To guard this baby small.For peace in dark and danger &nbsp; Thy loving kindness bringsO bend above , enfolding , &nbsp; The shadow of thy wings .  --  Amen . ( A low call is heard in the cabin at the left of the chapel . She rises , takes up a mug and comes out to the pot . She dips the mug in and goes to the cabin at the left . As she enters , the light comes up on the interior revealing the wasted form of the Reverend Martin as he lies propped in his rude bed against the wall . At the same time the light dies in the cabin at the right. ) p. 72 ELEANOR ( Putting the cup to his lips . ) Drink , Father Martin , you will feel better . ( He makes an effort to drink and then pushes the mug away and smiles at her . ) REVEREND MARTIN ( In a tired desolate voice which he tries to make cheery . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the bed making him as comfortable as possible . ) ELEANOR Now you sleep nice and warm . We 'll have some good potato soup in a little while . REVEREND MARTIN Any news from John Borden ? ELEANOR It 's a long way from Hatorask , but he will be here soon now  --  soon . REVEREND MARTIN Aye , that he will . ( The woman 's low sobs are heard again in the distance . ) And God grant that he bring you good news . ( Listening . ) Is that Sister Margery ? ELEANOR Yes . REVEREND MARTIN She loved her baby . ( After a moment . ) Eleanor . ELEANOR Yes , Father . REVEREND MARTIN I have had a strange dream . I saw a great swan  --  white and with wings like a ship  --  and it was flying south . ( Sighing and closing his eyes . ) Flying south it was , through the still blue sky , and I could feel the breath of air from its wings against my cheeks , and the air was warm  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodious words sweet as an angel in paradise and it was saying , " Follow me , follow me . " I wonder was it a sign ? p. 73 ELEANOR What sign , Father ? REVEREND MARTIN To leave this spot . ( As she stares at him . ) Evil has been wrought here , the spilling of blood , the murder of innocent ones . Shall we ever thrive here ? Mayhap that was a spirit sent from God to warn us to leave this place . ELEANOR No ! No ! ( Dropping down on a rough stool and gazing before her . ) But sometimes I think  --  ( Then shaking her head firmly . ) No , we must bide here . ( Rising in a sudden show of cheerfulness . ) This is the better place . The Indians no longer molest us . Sixty of us still remain alive and spring will soon be coming . We have our houses and in April we will plant crops . It was only a dream . REVEREND MARTIN It is ninety days till April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTIN And you will stay with John Borden . God 's blessings on you two and on us all , my child . ELEANOR Amen . REVEREND MARTIN And how does the little one ? ELEANOR ( Sitting down again . ) She is so pitiful and so thin . But in her sleep she smiles so  --  so  --  she does  --  ( She suddenly bows her head. ) p. 74 REVEREND MARTIN ( Lifting his hand to rest on her head . ) Grieve not , my child . Somehow we shall win . I have God 's promise  --  in my heart I have it . Remain or leave , we shall win . ( Pulling a little book from under his pillow . ) And this for the babe . His holy word will be a font of strength to her in days to come . I have written her name  --  " Virginia Dare , Roanoke Island in Virginia , Christmas , 1588 . This is my strength .

Eigh , I am the most fortunate of men . ( Eleanor Dare comes out of the cabin at the left , and the light dies behind her to come up more strongly on the front and center stage . ) How fares it with his reverence , Mistress Dare ? ELEANOR He is sleeping now . OLD TOM ( As the Indian woman bends down and begins to mend the fire . ) I have a bit of business with him when he mends . Brr  --  rr , but it 's cold .

Ahm  --  but the hook may be hidden under the bait . p. 75 ELEANOR Drink , Tom . The children have eaten . But save something for Master Borden . ( Old Tom takes a horn from his waist and dips it into the pot . He starts to raise it to his lips , then hands it to the Indian woman . She smiles , drinks , and hands it back to him . Eleanor pulls her shawl about her and goes into the little chapel . ) OLD TOM ( Calling out . ) I have four more berry candles for the altar . Agona made ' em . ( He goes up into the chapel .

OLD TOM ( Crooking a knee towards the altar . ) And may our hearts keep as warm as the fire it makes . ( He follows Eleanor down into the scene and over towards the left . Six young men come in pulling a log with ropes . The log is about eight feet long and a foot in diameter . Behind them come a procession of children , women , and men . Joyce Archard walks with the foremost child .

( He and Eleanor go into the shadow at the left rear . Borden stands by the pot , his head bowed in thought . Then looking about him , he spies the sentinel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire . He satisfies himself that it is loaded , lays it aside and begins holding first one foot to the coals and then the other , his shaggy stern face lighted by the dull glow from below . Eleanor comes quietly back and stands by the fire opposite him . He looks at her , smiles , and then brings a box forward for her to sit on . ) BORDEN He is very ill . ELEANOR Yes .

A few pitiful bushels of corn they had , no more . They could spare none , nor potatoes . On Croatoan there will be game .

ELEANOR ( Quietly . ) And how do you know it ? BORDEN Rowing the sounds and tramping those endless bogs and wilderness of salt sea grass , my mind worked in a turmoil of fever and fret . Why ? Why ? Why ? I kept asking myself  --  why has no sign , no word come from the Governor and Sir Walter ? What could keep them back ? Suddenly I saw the answer . How , I do not know , but the answer came . England is at war with Spain . p. 83 ELEANOR ( Springing up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . BORDEN And the Queen forbids any ships to leave England . ELEANOR And may for months to come . Now we must act . Thank God for that . We have supplies in the storehouse for two days at most . BORDEN And what would you do ? ELEANOR If there is game farther south , then we must find it . BORDEN And desert the fort ? ELEANOR ( Sitting quietly down again . ) My mind runs fast ahead . ( Looking up at him . ) Only if you wish it . BORDEN If I wish it  --  ( Smiling down at her , the hardness of his face softening away . ) Thus we agree  --  we two , standing here tonight upon the outpost of the world , the last survivors  --  keepers of a dream . ELEANOR ( Murmuring . ) A dream ! BORDEN And we 'll keep that dream  --  keep it to the end ! ELEANOR Yes  --  together we will . BORDEN Together  --  Aye that 's it  --  together  --  we two ! ( Eleanor bows her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And by that great spirit that guards this world and holds our little lives in the hollow of his hand , I swear we will fight on and on here until this wilderness is won . p. 84 ELEANOR ( Murmuring . ) And you will win . BORDEN Even if we die , we win . For  --  ( Vehemently . ) Ah , Eleanor , tonight I feel  --  somehow it was meant to be this way . Somehow a destiny , a purpose moving deeper than we know has brought us both together upon this lonely land  --  to prove our love , to test our strength  --  aye , to make us worthy of the heritage we hold for those that shall come after us . ( He bends and kisses her on the forehead and then stands up straight , his voice filling with a firmer strength and certainty . ) And if in the wisdom of God we should be forced to live out our days forgot and deserted of the world , I should have no regret  --  none . ELEANOR ( After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I. BORDEN ( Staring ahead of him , his voice running on as if in communion with some listener in the dark . ) Once Sir Walter said  --  The victory lieth in the struggle , not the city won .

BORDEN ( Fiercely . ) He must forget  --  Every blow I struck him was a blow against myself . Ah  --  but it 's life or death now . And I 'll hang any man that fails us . ( They are both silent a moment . Finally he speaks with forced jocularity . ) And now let me ask you  --  could you love an Indian king ? ELEANOR ( Half-rising from her seat in alarm . ) No , no , not you , John  --  do n't talk so . BORDEN ( Patting her head . ) Oh , it 's not the fever got me . Cross my heart . Manteo 's tribe want me as chief in his place . p. 86 ELEANOR With feathers and beads and earrings ? BORDEN ( Indulgently . ) Maybe .

OTHER VOICES Aye  --  and ring the bell.Like the murdering Indians were on us again.Yea , all hell screaming in our ears . BORDEN Because the time is urgent . And let us face this thing calmly . Friends , I have just learned a Spanish ship has anchored in the inlet . ( A pall of horror falls upon the assemblage , and they stare at one another with stark faces. ) p. 92 VOICES ( Whispering . ) The Spaniards ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our settlement . Tomorrow or the next day they will find it . Shall we stay and fight or go ? VOICES ( In a wild clamor . ) Go  --  go ! Let us leave this cursed place ! We shall all be slaughtered in cold blood ! Leave !  --  leave ! ( Signs of hysteria begin to show among them again  --  in moans , shudderings , and little bleating cries . ) BORDEN ( More loudly still . ) Silence ! Silence , men ! ( He seizes a gun and holds it threateningly above them . The clamor quiets down somewhat . ) Let us behave ourselves like soldiers  --  like men worthy of these brave women and children who are in our keeping . OLD TOM ( From the walkway . ) Aye , that we will , John Borden ! OTHER VOICES We 'll follow ye , Captain Borden.Command us . BORDEN Good . In two hours we must be ready to march to our boats and rafts at the creek , and by dawn we must be far down the sound towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return again . We do not give up this settlement . Now every man to his duty . p. 93 VOICES No , no , we do n't give up the fort ! ( The colonists scatter in all directions . The light blacks out on the center stage and rises on the historian . ) HISTORIAN And so the Lost Colony made ready to leave the fort , driving themselves on with their last gasp of energy and strength . As had been agreed with Governor White for just such an emergency , they carved the name of their new habitation " Croatoan " on a post at the right side of the entrance in fair capital letters . They left this sign behind even at the risk of making their new homes known to their enemies the Spaniards . In the cold hours before dawn the colonists began their march into the unknown wilderness . p. 94 Act 2 , Scene 6 Scene 6 THE light dies from the historian and comes up on the center stage as the organ begins playing a low muffled march . The colonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags and bundles , and a ragged fellow is beating a rolling call upon a drum before them . And now at a loud trumpet call in the organ , the procession starts slowly marching out from the fort . The flag-bearer goes before , and behind him come John Borden and Eleanor Dare hand in hand , and next to them Dame Colman with little Virginia Dare asleep in her arms . The rest of the colonists follow , Old Tom and Agona coming last in the line . One  --  two  --  three  --  four these last survivors go , plodding up the incline at the right . At first their heads are bowed , their shoulders bent , but as the organ plays more bravely on they gradually begin to straighten up . One by one their tight-lipped faces are raised , their forms energized by the loud and ever louder beat of the music . Straight ahead they stare as if looking down the long road which they must travel to the end . At the top of the rise Borden and Eleanor stop , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stand looking back at the deserted fort . Borden salutes the empty scene . Then putting his arm around Eleanor , as if to protect her from whatever lies ahead , he turns , and the two of them disappear over the crest of the hill . By this time the organ has built to a great crescendo , and now as the music holds its thundering reverberation , the voice of the historian booms above it through the scene . HISTORIAN And thus the Lost Colony disappeared into the vast unknown  --  out of our sight forever  --  some of them to be slaughtened by the Spaniards , others to die in the forest , and still a few others to live forgotten with the Indians . But from our memory they have not passed . Now down the trackless hollow yearsThat swallowed them but not their songWe send response  --  " O lusty singer , dreamer , pioneer , Lord of the wilderness , the unafraid , Tamer of darkness , fire and flood , Of the soaring spirit winged aloftOn the plumes of agony and death  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It lives , it livesAnd shall not die ! " ( The organ strikes out in a bold announcement . The light dies from the historian and comes gradually up on the chorus as it stands and sings. ) p. 95 CHORUS ( In a mighty sweeping harmony . ) O God that madest earth and skyAnd hedged the restless seas around , Who that vast firmament on highWith golden banded stars hath bound  --  O thou whose mighty arm doth keepThe trembling world , the failing sun , Whose shining presence fills the deepWhere lightless time 's dark measures run  --  O God our Father , Lord above , O bright immortal , holy one , Secure within thy boundless loveWe walk this way of death alone . ( With the soaring word " Amen " the lights come on in the amphitheatre )
