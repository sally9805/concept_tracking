To give his life for his country-such in a very real sense was the decision calmly made last week by Paul von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg , President . <P> Old Paul is 84 . By refusing to run again for President he would doubtless prolong a life which his big red country house and his rosy-cheeked , laughing grandchildren make pleasant . Most Germans , when they learned that Old Paul had consented to run again , felt a tug at their heartstrings . They assumed that if re-elected on March 13 President von Hindenburg will die in office . If he lived out his second term he would be 91 . <P> " After an earnest scrutiny I have decided , " wrote Old Paul wistfully , " to stand for reelection . . . . Should I not be elected , the reproach of having abandoned my post at a difficult time will be spared me . " <P> As the President said , the time in Germany is difficult . Six million unemployed . Four suicides a day in Berlin alone . Whole industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week than at any time since the Fatherland 's 1919 prostration . German foreign trade ( which had a " Baby Boom " last year ) down to a new low for the 20th Century . <P> Amid these difficulties , candidate-picking began . First in the field against Old Paul was Communist Ernst Thalmann , whom the late New York World used to call " Germany 's Red Napoleon . " His worst enemies , the German Fascists , conceded last week that leather-lunged Comrade Thalmann , once a Hamburg stevedore and later a sailor , would get at least 6,000,000 votes . Some 38,000,000 ballots will be cast . <P> If on March 13 no candidate obtains a clear majority , the German people must vote again April 10 . Such a system produces elaborate political jockeying . Many a candidate is entered for no other reason than to split some other candidate 's vote on the first or second round . <P> To the National Opposition which includes the Fascists and Dr. Alfred Hugenberg 's Nationalists , vote-splitting seemed the best strategy . They attempted in vain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their Steel Helmet faction then chose Colonel Theodore Dsterberg , Deputy Chairman of the Stahlhelm . <P> The Hitlerites did a risky thing . They nominated Adolf Hitler . Theoretically , handsome Adolf could gain citizenship , and eligibility for office , by accepting appointment to a public post in Brunswick . With four or more candidates in the field , Old Paul 's majority might be forestalled , and on the second round the Opposition votes thrown to Hitler . But suppose at the last minute the Reich declares Hitler no real citizen , strikes his name from the lists too late for the Nazis to introduce a new candidate ? In such case Old Paul could very well obtain a majority on the first vote . And last week observers thought he might anyway .
