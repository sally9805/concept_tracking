txt Excerpts From Letters on Many Subjects Fixing Prices . Professor Moley asks why Should n't it be the United States that fixes the price of gold ? The answer is , because the United States controls only about 40 per cent of the world 's gold while 60 per cent is in other countries . Then Professor Moley points out that for years the Bank of England has been fixing the price of gold and , he asks , why should there be objections to the President of the United States now fixing it ? The answer is , that the Bank of England has been fixing the price of gold as the New York Stock Exchange is fixing the price for United States Steel common every day , according to supply and demand . The price fixing which President Roosevelt is undertaking is of an arbitrary nature and the President is pursuing a certain policy ; the function of the Bank of England , like the function of the New York Stock Exchange , is more or less mechanical.  - -  RUDOLPH FLUEGGE , New York .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
