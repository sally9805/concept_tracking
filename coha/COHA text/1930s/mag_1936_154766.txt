In Havana last week there was such tension , such scurrying of Government leaders to U. S. Ambassador Jefferson Caffery , the arbiter of every Cuban crisis , as there has not been since the collapse of Provisional President Dr. Ramon Grau San Martin 's Government ( TIME , Jan. 22 , 19-34 ) . This pother seemed to be preparation for a showdown between Cuba 's military and Cuba 's politicians . Real Strong Man of the Army is ruthless Lieut . Colonel Inspector Jos Pedraza Calvera , but the military 's mouthpiece is Colonel Fulgencio Batista who likes to play at being a dictator and like most European dictators has the indispensable qualification of being a peasant . Last week Batista showed the peasantry in his blood as never before . <P> It was of no interest to him that President Miguel Moriano GOmez y Arias was pushing through the Cuban Senate yet another radical constitution . Batista 's concern was to harangue Cuba 's peasants , farmers , canefield workers , sugar growers and the like , about his own pet form of " dictatorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like all devotees of isms , " The Savior of Cuba " has at least one cranky plank in his platform . This is a scheme to put a 9-tax on every bag of sugar produced in Cuba and use the proceeds , estimated at $2,000,000 a year , to educate peasant children in rural schools run by Army officers . At least 100,000 peasants , to judge from their delirious enthusiasm , last week approved " The Savior 's " scheme , agreed with him that it was a " prime necessity . " <P> Much less enthusiastic about Batistism was President GOmez who said bluntly , " The bill is antidemocratic , invades the scope of the civil authority , and tends to militarize childhood . I shall veto it . " This made " The Savior " so angry that even when the National Sugar Mill Owners Association offered to pay the tax without any legislation , he waved their offer a.side , spluttered , " The bill must become law . " <P> Before the House of Representatives the bill duly came , was passed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Savior " strutted about Havana declaring : " We have a two-thirds majority . We can pass the bill over the President 's veto . " <P> He was still more cock-a-hoop when a petition to impeach the President was signed by 118 Congressmen and 75,000 peasants surged into Havana , cheering Batista wildly , jeering the President and warming up toward Revolution . <P> <P> * By Cuban law the bill had first to be passed as a whole , and then article by article .
