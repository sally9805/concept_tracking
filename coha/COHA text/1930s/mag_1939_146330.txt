C. I. O. 's United Automobile Workers of America last week showed its muscle by winning exclusive recognition ( but no closed shop ) from the Briggs Manufacturing Co. in Detroit , called off a strike which had tied up Chrysler and Lincoln plants as well , by depriving them of Briggs auto bodies ( TIME , June 12 ) . Having just taken his minority U. A. W. back into A. F. of L. , President Homer Martin thereupon displayed his muscle . He demanded that big General Motors recognize his union to the exclusion of C. I. O. , called a strike in three G. M. plants and threatened more . <P> Mr. Martin had some luck at one of the subsidiary Fisher Body Corp . ' s two plants in strike-worn Flint , Mich. , little luck elsewhere . " A complete failure , " chortled C. I. O. 's Auto-President Roland Jay Thomas . <P> That victory for either side in such an intra-Labor war is defeat for both sides , G. M. 's President William S. Knudsen promptly demonstrated . " The corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with duly authorized representatives of the employes , " said the big motor-maker who was the first to sign up with C. I. O. 's union in 1937 . " What it can not do is to decide quarrels as between contending factions . " In eleven plants , where both C. I. O. and Martin claim jurisdiction , G. M. will deal with neither . In 48 , whether one or the other has exclusive representation , the corporation will continue to deal with local union committees . Meantime , pending decision of the rival claims by the courts or the National Labor Relations Board , G. M. will not talk amendment ( or , in effect , renewal ) of its national contract with either union . G. M. was showing its muscle .
