Free on bail in Mexico City last week was the fieriest Mexican muralist of them all , David Alfaro Siqueiros . In 1922 , when he was a baby-faced revolutionist , Siqueiros organized and ran the famed Syndicate of masons and painters ( Charlot , Orozco , Merida , Montenegro , de la Cueva , Rivera ) who revived true fresco in America . Since the dispersal of that illustrious company , Sparkplug Siqueiros has led strikes in Mexico , preached socialist esthetics in Manhattan , fought in Spain as a colonel in the Loyalist Army . When he returned from the war last month he vowed to settle down and paint . Fortnight ago President Cardenas personally had him jugged for egging on an anti-Fascist crowd . <P> A brilliant if febrile artist , Siqueiros has the distinction of having discovered the modern paint gun as an artistic implement . In 1923 , when Pontiac , Mich , produced the first automobile ( an Oakland ) ever finished by being sprayed with quick-drying lacquer , the spray gun took its place among the garage man 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more than a toy , urged its use for murals . Neither Siqueiros himself nor other muralists have actually done much with it . But last week in Manhattan two trigger men appeared with demonstrations of what a spray gun can do . <P> &gt; At the Delphic Studios a 29-year-old Bolivian artist , Roberto Berdecio , friend and disciple of Artist Siqueiros , displayed a number of experimental paintings and two large murals which proved beyond any doubt that " the mechanical brush " is capable of a wide range of artistic effects . Artist Berdecio works with an air-compressing machine and a spray gun of the common industrial type ( same principle as an atomizer ) , using not ordinary Duco enamel but a similar nitrocellulose paint . It has taken him six years , since he first started work with Siqueiros in Mexico City , to train his trigger finger to its present control . Painted on pressed wood , his two mural Portraits of New York were full of refined detail , though somewhat lifeless in color and very stark in symbolism . Each embodied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which distortions are so anticipated and utilized as to make the mural a satisfactory , if somewhat different , picture to spectators from each side as well as in front . <P> &gt; At an Automotive Maintenance Show in the New York Port Authority Building , an oldtime garage man from Chicago , Ralph L. de Gayner , astonished dealers and jobbers by gunning out clean little landscapes in five minutes each . Gunner de Gayner never knew David Siqueiros , but he had the same inspiration about seven years ago , has been getting so good at his specialty ( pictures of clipper ships ) that several have been sold . " The artists still think it 's cheese , " said he , " but dealers sell it and that 's the big thing . I would n't be caught dead with a brush in my hand . "
