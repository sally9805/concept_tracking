Weary from his labors in behalf of anti-lynching legislation ( TIME , April 19 et seq . ) , Representative Arthur Wergs Mitchell , only Negro in the U. S. Congress , last month decided he needed a rest . A Chicagoan , big , grey-haired Arthur Mitchell chose to spend his holiday at Hot Springs , Ark. , favorite rest haven of Chicago politicians . Instead of going direct from Washington , he returned home first , bought a first-class round-trip railroad ticket and Pullman accommodations on the Illinois Central , set out from Chicago . <P> As his train rolled through Kentucky and Tennessee , taffy-colored Arthur Mitchell continued to ride with the white passengers , enjoy the comforts he had paid for , unconcerned that these two States , like other Southern States , still have laws that require the segregation of Negro passengers on railroad trains . At Memphis the train picked up several Rock Island cars and headed into Arkansas . <P> Near Forrest City , some 160 mi. from Hot Springs , there was a rude interruption . In the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , which provides fines for trainmen who neglect to separate Negroes from whites , Congressman Mitchell was just another Negro . The conductor ordered him to take his bags and get up to the Jim Crow car behind the baggage car . He protested , showed his ticket , pointed to a number of unoccupied sections . Vacancies or no vacancies , the conductor informed him , the only place he or any Negro could ride in Arkansas was second-class , in the Jim Crow car . When the conductor threatened to stop the train and have him arrested , he gave in , fumed in the Jim Crow car for four hours . When he reached his destination Congressman Mitchell said nothing of the incident and news of it did not leak out . Shortly after his arrival at Hot Springs he received a warm letter of welcome from Arkansas ' Governor Bailey and letters from Little Rock 's acting Mayor and Chamber of Commerce president , welcoming him to their city for a speech he was scheduled to make there after his stay at the spa . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in Congress and a New Dealer besides had all to do&gt; with these receptions . <P> Congressman Mitchell 's stay in Arkansas , darkened by this incident , ended in something of a personal triumph with his speech at Little Rock before a mixed audience to which he was introduced by U. S. District Attorney Fred A. Isgrig . But he was not ready to forget . On his return trip he rode the Jim Crow car of another railroad without being told . When he got back to Chicago , Congressman Mitchell , a lawyer himself , hired another lawyer to see what could be done about it . <P> Last week in Cook County 's Circuit Court Congressman Mitchell sued the Illinois Central , the Chicago , Rock Island &; Pacific and the Pullman Co. for $50,000 . Plaintiff Mitchell 's description of an Arkansas Jim Crow car : " . . . The car was divided by partitions and partly used for carrying baggage , . . . poorly ventilated , filthy , filled with stench and odors emitting from the toilet and other filth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Southern train conductor used on a member of the U. S. Congress : " . . . Too opprobrious and profane , vulgar and filthy to be spread upon the records of this court . "
