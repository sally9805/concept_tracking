Little Denmark has next to no army or navy . Yet in the last 13 years it has won more territory proportionately to its size than any other world nation . Last fortnight the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague clinched Denmark 's claim to all Greenland , 50 times as big as Denmark ( TIME , April 17 ) . Last week like a small dog that has just buried one bone . Denmark whirled bristling to protect another . <P> A much-gnawed bone is Schleswig-Holstein . In 1460 the Kings of Denmark became Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein , agreed never to join it to Denmark . They kept their word for almost 200 years , then lost it to Sweden , got it back in chunks . In 1806 Schleswig-Holstein was joined to Denmark . In 1848 Denmark allowed German-populated Holstein to join the German Confederation and during the next two years beat off Prussia 's ungrateful attempt to seize Schleswig too . But in 1864 Austria and Prussia ganged up on Denmark , bloodily took Schleswig away . For 50 years Schleswig and Holstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Holstein and German Southern Schleswig . By the Versailles Treaty plebiscites were held in northern and central Schleswig . The Danish northern zone plumped for Denmark . To Denmark 's rage &; grief the central zone voted to stay German . Since then , both Slesvig Danes and Schleswig Prussians have looked covetously across the new border . Lately a new glitter has come into Prussian Nazi eyes . Last week Danes heard that Nazis planned an Easter visit to Danish Slesvig in full Nazi uniform . <P> The Danish Parliament thought fast . They concluded that a Nazi in Denmark is only a German in a uniform . They then acted fast . They called an extraordinary session and passed a law providing for 100 extra police in Slesvig . They also passed a law forbidding the wearing of all political party uniforms and emblems . An airplane scudded to King Christian 's Easter residence at Skaw in Jutland , scudded back with his signatures on the new laws . On Easter Day Slesvig Danes saw a lot of strangers , no uniforms .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
