A familiar ghost stalked the corridors of the New York Stock Exchange last week-the question of corporate publicity . Though attacked for years for not showing more gumption in demanding full and frequent reports from listed corporations , the fact remains that , until the New Deal , the Stock Exchange was the only U. S. body , public or private , that consistently and effectively strove to raise the standards of stockholders ' statements . <P> In what it considered another forward step , the Stock Exchange last month suggested that listed companies issue interim earnings reports on a twelve-month basis instead of in the usual quarterly or half-year form . In the past this form of report has been widely used by utilities but rarely by industrials . Two conspicuous exceptions have been Continental Can and Owens Illinois Glass , both of which publish earnings every three months covering operations for the preceding twelve months . Chief advantage is that it automatically irons out any seasonal factors in a company 's business , each report taking in a full year of earnings . Analysts and accountants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an earnings trend than the piecemeal picture given by quarters . <P> Nevertheless , the average stockholder has several objections to the twelve-month plan . Since earnings at best are merely history , the stockholder wants to know his company 's latest history , which is generally the preceding quarter . To figure out quarterly earnings from a twelve-month report requires considerable arithmetic . <P> First company to comply with the Stock Exchange 's suggestion was the biggest company listed on the Hoard , American Telephone &; Telegraph . President Walter Sherman Gifford told the 350 A. T. &; T. stockholders who turned out for the annual meeting in Manhattan last week that their company 's profits for the twelve months through March 1936 were $130,000,000 compared to $118,000,000 for the same period through March 1935 . Those figures were not for the entire Bell System , earnings of which were reported only through February . But to find out what the parent company 's profits were for the March quarter , an A.T . &; T. stockholder had to 1 ) deduct earnings for the first three months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) then deduct the resulting figure ( profits for the last nine months of 1935 ) from the twelve-month earnings reported by Mr. Gifford last week . A similar mathematical bout would be necessary to figure out the Bell System 's earnings for January and February . <P> Having done this ciphering , the stock holder could not be sure that his figures were correct because year-end adjustments might have distorted them . In a company like A.T . &; T. the stockholder would undoubtedly have been informed of any important special charges against earnings . But an unscrupulous management could temporarily deceive its stockholders as to the profit trend . An official of another company using twelve-month reports , replying to a newshawk 's complaint that the plan made it impossible for a stockholder to learn what his company earned in any given quarter , blandly declared : " That 's the idea .
