In the British Who 's Who George Gordon Coulton cites as his hobby " vegetating . " By profession he is a distinguished Cambridge historian , and in the last 15 years the body of his scholarly works on medieval life has sprouted as quietly and as fast as the vegetable he emulates in spare time . Last month was published a great comprehensive cabbage of a book called Medieval Panorama ( Macmillan $4 ) , a hybrid of all his previous works . It is a wonderfully nourishing dish , but , like most well-boiled English cabbage , dull on the palate . <P> Dr. Coulton says that he writes , and other people read , history because it is fascinating to see how it repeats itself with a difference - how man 's never-changing nature reacts to his ever-changing environment . Some of the evidence for his theory : the description of how a fascist Church thumbscrewed and burned its subjects without even a semblance of justice ( there is no recorded case of not guilty under the Inquisition ) for refusing to swear undivided allegiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1290 , taking their houses , their money , some times ( accidentally ) their lives . For tile rest , Professor Coulton himself describes the book as a scaffolding by which young students may climb to chisel details on the monument of knowledge . The analogy is poor . No scaffolding was ever built so meticulously from such solid materials .
