HOW BEAUTIFUL WITH SHOES A STORY BY WILBUR DANIEL STEELE B Y THE time the milking was finished , the sow , which had farrowed the past week , was making such a row that the girl spilled a pint of the warm milk down the trough-lead to quiet the animal before taking the pail to the well-house . Then in the quiet she heard a sound of hoofs on the bridge , where the road crossed the creek a hundred yards below the house , and she set the pail down on the ground beside her bare , barn-soiled feet . She picked it up again . She set it down . It was as if she calculated its weight . That was what she was doing , as a matter of fact , setting off against its pull toward the well-house the pull of that wagon team in the road , with little more of personal will or wish in the matter than has a wooden weathervane between two currents in the wind . And as with the vane , so with the wooden girl  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough ; leaving the pail at the barn door , she set off in a deliberate , docile beeline through the cow-yard , over the fence , and down in a diagonal across the farm 's one tilled field toward the willow brake that walled the road at the dip . And once under way , though her mother came to the kitchen door and called in her high , flat voice , " Amarantha , where you goin ' , Amarantha ? " , the girl went on apparently unmoved , as though she had been asdeaf as the woman in the doorway ; indeed , if there was emotion in her it was the purely sensuous one of feeling the clods of the furrows breaking softly between her toes . It was springtime in the mountains . " Amarantha , why do n't you answer me , Amarantha ? " For moments after the girl had disappeared beyond the willows the widow continued to call , unaware through long habit of how absurd it sounded , the name which that strange man her husband had put upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been deaf so long she did not realize that nobody else ever thought of it for the broad-fleshed , slow-minded girl , but called her Mary or , even more simply , Mare . Ruby Herter had stopped his team this side of the bridge , the mules ' heads turned into the lane to his father 's farm beyond the road . A big-barreled , heavy-limbed fellow with a square , sallow , not unhandsome face , he took out youth in ponderous gestures of masterfulness ; it was like him to have cracked his whip above his animals ' ears the moment before he pulled them to a halt . When he saw the girl getting over the fence under the willows he tongued the wad of tobacco out of his mouth into his palm , threw it away beyond the road , and drew a sleeve of his jumper across his lips . " Do n't run yourself out o ' breath , Mare ; I got all night . " " I was comin ' . " It sounded sullen only because it was matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smack . " Hunched on the wagon seat , he remained motionless for some time after she had arrived at the hub , and when he stirred it was but to cut a fresh bit of tobacco , as if already he had forgotten why he threw the old one away . Having satisfied his humor , he unbent , climbed down , kissed her passive mouth , and hugged her up to him , roughly and loosely , his hands careless of contours . It was not out of the way ; they were used to handling animals both of them ; and it was spring . A slow warmth pervaded the girl , formless , nameless , almost impersonal . Her betrothed pulled her head back by the braid of her yellow hair . He studied her face , his brows gathered and his chin out . " Listen , Mare , you would n't leave nobody else hug and kiss you , dang you ! " She shook her head , without vehemence or anxiety . " Who 's that ? " She hearkened up the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a Ford came in sight around the bend above the house , driven at speed . " Geddap ! " she said to the mules herself . But the car came to a halt near them , and one of the five men crowded in it called , " Come on , Ruby , climb in . They 's a loony loose out o ' Dayville Asylum , and they got him trailed over somewheres on Split Ridge , and Judge North phoned up to Slosson 's store for ever'body come help circle him  --  come on , hop the runnin% board ! " Ruby hesitated , an eye on his team . " Scared , Ruby ? " The driver raced his engine . " They say this boy 's a killer . " " Mare , take the team in and tell pa . " The car was already moving when Ruby jumped it . A moment after it had sounded on the bridge it was out of sight . " Amarantha , Amarantha , why do n't you come , Amarantha ? " Returning from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted in the twilight . The sun had dipped behind the back ridge , and though the sky was still bright with day , the dusk began to smoke up out of the plowed field like a ground-fog . The girl had returned through it , got the milk , and started toward the well-house before the widow saw her . " Daughter , seems to me you might ! " she expostulated without change of key . " Here 's some young man friend o ' yourn stopped to say howdy , and I been niacin ' my lungs out after you . . . . Put that milk in the cool and come ! " Some young man friend ? But there was no good to be got from puzzling . Mare poured the milk in the pan in the dark of the low house over the well , and as she came out , stooping , she saw a figure waiting for her , black in silhouette against the yellowing sky . " Who are you ? " she asked , a native timidity making her sound sulky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's poetry . " And she knew then that she did not know him . She walked past , her arms straight down and her eyes front . Strangers always affected her with a kind of muscular terror simply by being strangers . So she gained the kitchen steps , aware by his tread that he followed . There , taking courage at sight of her mother in the doorway , she turned on him , her eyes down at the level of his knees . " Who are you and what d ' y ' want ? " He still mused . " Amarantha ! Amarantha in Carolina ! That makes me happy ! " Mare hazarded one upward look . She saw that he had red hair , brown eyes , and hollows under his cheekbones , and though the green sweater he wore on top of a gray overall was plainly not meant for him , sizes too large as far as girth went , yet be was built so long of limb that his wrists came inches out of the sleeves and made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you introduce us , daughter ? " The girl opened her mouth and closed it again . Her mother , unaware that no sound had come out of it , smiled and nodded , evidently taking to the tall , homely fellow and tickled by the way he could not seem to get his eyes off her daughter . But the daughter saw none of it , all her attention centered upon the stranger 's hands . Restless , hard-fleshed , and chap-bitten , they were like a countryman 's hands ; but the fingers were longer than the ordinary , and slightly spatulate at their ends , and these ends were slowly and continuously at play among themselves . The girl could not have explained how it came to her to be frightened and at the same time to be calm , for she was inept with words . It was simply that in an animal way she knew animals , knew them in health and ailing , and when they were ailing she knew by instinct , as her father had known , how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone in to light up ; from beside the lamp-shelf she called back , " If he 's aimin ' to stay to supper you should 've told me , Amarantha , though I guess there 's plenty of the side-meat to go ' round , if you 'll bring me in a few more turnips and potatoes , though it is late . " At the words the man 's cheeks moved in and out . " I 'm very hungry , " he said . Mare nodded deliberately . Deliberately , as if her mother could hear her , she said over her shoulder . " I 'll go get the potatoes and turnips , ma . " While she spoke she was moving , slowly , softly , at first , toward the right of the yard , where the fence gave over into the field . Unluckily her mother spied her through the window . " Amarantha , where are you goin ' ? " " I 'm goin ' to get the potatoes and turnips . " She neither raised her voice nor glanced back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt her , " she said to herself . " He wo n't hurt her ; it 's me , not her , " she kept repeating , while she got over the fence and down into the shadow that lay more than ever like a fog on the field . The desire to believe that it actually did hide her , the temptation to break from her rapid but orderly walk grew till she could no longer fight it . She saw the road willows only a dash ahead of her . She ran , her feet floundering among the furrows . She neither heard nor saw him , but when she realized he was with her she knew he had been with her all the while . She stopped , and he stopped , and so they stood , with the dark open of the field all around . Glancing sidewise presently , she saw he was no longer looking at her with those strangely importunate brown eyes of his , but had raised them to the crest of the wooded ridge behind her . By and by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . And when she made no move to see , " Turn around and look ! " be said , and though it was low and almost tender in its tone , she knew enough to turn . A ray of the sunset hidden in the west struck through the tops of the topmost trees , far and small up there , a thin , bright hem . " What does it make you think of , Amarantho , ? .. Answer ! " " Fire , " she made herself say . " Or blood . " " Or blood , yeh . That 's right , or blood . " She had heard a Ford going up the road beyond the willows , and her attention was not on what she said . The man soliloquized . " Fire and blood , both ; spare one or the other , and where is beauty , the way the world is ? It 's an awful thing to have to carry , but Christ had it . Christ came with a sword . I love beauty , Amarantha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Yeh , that 's right , I hear . " What she heard was the car stopping at the house . " Not prettiness . Prettiness 'll have to go with ugliness , because it 's only ugliness trigged up . But beauty ! " Now again he was looking at her . " Do you know how beautiful you are , Amarantha , Amarantha sweet and fair ' ? " Of a sudden , reaching behind her , he began to unravel the meshes of her hair-braid , the long , flat-tipped fingers at once impatient and infinitely gentle . " ' Braid no more that shining hair ! " ' Flat-faced Mare Doggett tried to see around those glowing eyes so near to hers , but wise in her instinct , did not try too hard . " Yeh , " she temporized . " I mean , no , I mean . " " Amarantha , I 've come a long , long way for you . Will you come away with me now ? " " Yeh  --  that is  --  in a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to , Amarantha ? Because you love me as I love you ? Answer ! " " Yeh  --  sure  --  uh . .. Ruby ! " The man tried to run , but there were six against him , coming up out of the dark that lay in the plowed ground . Mare stood where she was while they knocked him down and got a rope around him ; after that she walked back toward the house with Ruby and Older Haskins , her father 's cousin . Ruby wiped his brow and felt of his muscles . " Gees , you 're lucky we come , Mare . We 're no more'n past the town , when they come hollerin ' he 'd broke over this way . " When they came to the fence the girl sat on the rail for a moment and rebraided her hair before she went into the house , where they were making her mother smell ammonia . Lots of cars were coming . Judge North was coming , somebody said . When Mare heard this she went into her bedroom off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were brand new two-dollar shoes with cloth tops , and she had only begun to break them in last Sunday ; she wished afterwards she had put her stockings on too , for they would have eased the seams . Or else that she had put on the old button pair , even though the soles were worn through . Judge North arrived . He thought first of taking the loony straight through to Dayville that night , but then decided to keep him in the lock-up at the courthouse till morning and make the drive by day . Older Haskins stayed in , gentling Mrs. Doggett , while Ruby went out to help get the man into the Judge 's sedan . Now that she had them on , Mare did n't like to take the shoes off till Older went ; it might make him feel small , she thought . Older Haskins had a lot of facts about the loony . " His name 's Humble Jewett , " he told them . " They belong back in Breed County , all them Jewetts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not a mite unbalanced . He went to college though , worked his way , and he taught somethin ' ' rother in some academy-school a spell , till he went off his head all of a sudden and took after folks with an axe . I remember it in the paper at the time . They give out one while how the Principal was n't gain ' to live , and there was others  --  there was a girl he tried to strangle . That was four-five year back . " Ruby came in guffawing . " Know the only thing they can get ' im to say , Mare ? Only God thing he 'll say is , Atuarantha , she 's goin ' with me . ' . . . Mare ! " " Yeh , I know . " The cover of the kettle the girl was handling slid off on the stove with a clatter . A sudden sick wave passed over her . She went out to the hack , out into the air . It was not till now she knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Older Haskins stayed to supper with them , and helped Mare do the dishes afterward ; it was nearly nine when lie left . The mother was already in bed , and Mare was about to sit down to get those shoes off her wretched feet at last , when she heard the cow carrying on up at the barn , lowing and kicking , and next minute the sow was in it with a horning note . It might be a fox passing by to get at the henhouse , or a weasel . Mare forgot her feet , took a broom-handle they used in boiling clothes , opened the back door , and stepped out . Blinking the lamplight from her eyes , she peered up toward the outbuildings , and saw the gable end of the barn standing like a red arrow in the dark , and the top of a butternut tree beyond it drawn in skeleton traceries , and just then a cock crowed . She went to the right corner of the house and saw where the light came from , ruddy above the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent close to her mother 's ear and shouted , " Somethin 's a-fire down to the town , looks like , " then went out again and up to the barn . " Soh ! Soh ! " she called in to the animals . She climbed up and stood on the top rail of the cow-pen fence , only to find she could not locate the flame even there . Ten rods behind the buildings a mass of rock mounted higher than their ridgepoles , a chopped-off buttress of the back ridge , covered with oak scrub and wild grapes and blackberries , whose thorny ropes the girl beat away from her skirt with the broom-handle as she scrambled up in the wine-colored dark . Once at the top , and the brush held aside , she could see the tongue-tip of the conflagration half a mile away at the town . And she knew by the bearing of the two church steeples that it was the building where the lock-up was that was burning . There is a horror in knowing animals trapped in a fire , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Mare said . A car went down the road . Then there was a horse galloping . That would be Older Haskins probably . People were out at Ruby 's father 's farm ; she could hear their voices raised . There must have been another car up from the other way , for lights wheeled and shouts were exchanged in the neighborhood of the bridge . Next thing she knew , Ruby was at the house below , looking for her probably . He was telling her mother . Mrs. Doggett was not used to him , so he had to shout even louder than Mare had to . " What y ' reckon he done , the hellion ! he broke the door and killed Lew Fyke and set the courthouse afire ! . . . Where 's Mare ? " Her mother would not know . Mare called . " Here , up the rock here . " She had better go down . Ruby would likely break his bones if he tried to climb the rock in the dark , not knowing the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fearful element , more fearful than ever now , with the news . " Yes , I 'm comin ' , " she called sulkily , hearing feet in the brush . " You wait ; I 'm comin ' . " When she turned and saw it was Humble Jewett , right behind her among the branches , she opened her mouth to screech . She was not quick enough . Before a sound came out he got one hand over her face and the other arm around her body . Mare had always thought she was strong , and the loony looked gangling , yet she was so easy for him that he need not hurt her . He made no haste and little noise as he carried her deeper into the undergrowth . Where the hill began to mount it was harder though . Presently he set her on her feet . He let the hand that had been over her mouth slip down to her throat , where the broad-tipped fingers wound , tender as yearning , weightless as caress . " I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amarantha . But I did n't want to hurt your lips , dear heart , your lovely , quiet lips . " It was so dark under the trees she could hardly see him , but she felt his breath on her mouth , near to . But then , instead of kissing her , he said , " No ! No ! " took from her throat for an instant the hand that had held her mouth , kissed its palm , and put it back softly against her skin . " Now , my love , let 's go before they come . " She stood stock still . Her mother 's voice was to be heard in the distance , strident and meaningless . More cars were on the road . Nearer , around the rock , there were sounds of tramping and thrashing . Ruby fussed and cursed . He shouted , " Mare , dang you , where are you , Mare ? " , his yoke harsh with uneasy anger . Now , if she aimed to do anything , was the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her windpipe . It was as if those yearning fingers had paralyzed the muscles . " Come ! " The arm he put around her shivered against her shoulder blades . It was anger . " I hate killing . It 's a dirty , ugly thing . It makes me sick . " He gagged , judging by the sound . But then he ground his teeth . " Come away , my love ! " She found herself moving . Once when she broke a branch underfoot with an instinctive awkwardness he chided her . " Quiet , my heart , else they 'll hear ! " She made herself heavy . He thought she grew tired and bore more of her weight till he was breathing hard . Men came up the hill . There must have been a dozen spread out , by the angle of their voices as they kept touch . Always Humble Jewett kept caressing Mare 's throat with one hand ; all she could do was hang back . " You 're tired and you 're frightened , " he said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twigs in the dark , the overhang of a thicket of some sort . He thrust her in under this , and lay beside her on the bed of groundpine . The hand that was not in love with her throat reached across her ; she felt the weight of its forearm on her shoulder and its fingers among the strands of her hair , eagerly , but tenderly , busy . Not once did he stop speaking , no louder than breathing , his lips to her ear . " Amarantha sweet and fair  --  Ala , braid no more that shining hair .. . " ' Mare had never heard of Lovelace , the poet ; she thought the loony was just going on , hardly listened , got little sense . But the cadence of it added to the lethargy of all her flesh . " ' Like a clew of golden thread  --  Most excellently ravell &I; . . . ' " Voices loudened ; feet came tramping ; a pair went past not two rods away . Li . Do not then wind up the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The search went on up the woods , men shouting to one another and beating the brush . ? ? ? But shake your head and seat-ter day ! ' I 've never loved , Amaranths . They 've tried me with prettiness , but prettiness is too cheap , yes , it 's too cheap . " Mare was cold , and the coldness made her lazy . All she knew ? was that he talked on . " But dogwood blowing in the spring is n't cheap . The earth of a field is n't cheap . Lots of times I 've lain down and kissed the earth of a field , Amarantha . That 's beauty , and a kiss for beauty . " His breath moved up her cheek . He trembled violently . " No , no , not yet ! " He got to his knees and pulled her by an arm . " We can go now . " They went back down the slope , but at an angle , so that when they came to the level they passed two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road there . More and more her walking was like sleepwalking , the feet numb in their shoes . Even where he had to let go of her , crossing the creek on stones , she stepped where he stepped with an obtuse docility . The voices of the searchers on the back ridge were small in distance when they began to climb the face of Coward Hill , on the opposite side of the valley . There is an old farm on top of Coward Hill , big hayfields as fiat as tables . It had been half-past nine when Mare stood on the rock above the barn ; it was toward midnight when Humble Jewett put aside the last branches of the woods and led her out on the height , and half a moon had risen . And a wind blew there , tossing the withered tops of last year 's grasses , and mists ran with the wind , and ragged shadows with the mists , and mares ' - tails of clear moonlight among the shadows , so that now the boles of birches on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now cut alabaster . It struck so cold against the girl 's cold flesh , this wind , that another wind of shivers blew through her , and she put her hands over her face and eyes . But the madman stood with his eyes wide open and his mouth open , drinking the moonlight and the wet wind . His voice , when he spoke at last , was thick in his throat . " Get down on your knees . " He got down on his and pulled her after . " And pray ! " Once in England a poet sang four lines . Four hundred years have forgotten his name , but they have remembered his lines . The daft man knelt upright , his face raised to the wild scud , his long wrists hanging to the dead grass . He began simply : " O western wind , when wilt thou blow Thal the small rain down can rainP ' " The Adam's-apple was big in his bent throat . As simply he finished . " ' Christ , that my love were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mare got up and ran . She ran without aim or feeling in the power of the wind . She told herself again that the mists would hide her from him , as she had done at dusk . And again , seeing that he ran at her shoulder , she knew he had been there all the while , making a race of it , flailing the air with his long arms for joy of play in the cloud of spring , throwing his knees high , leaping the moon-blue waves of the brown grass , shaking his bright hair ; and her own hair was a weight behind her , lying level on the wind . Once a shape went bounding ahead of them for instants ; she did not realize it was a fox till it was gone . She never thought of stopping ; she never thought anything , except once , " Oh , my God , I wish I had my shoes off ! " And what would have been the good in stopping or in turning another way , when it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a snake-fence came at them he took the top rail in flight , like a college hurdler and , seeing the girl hesitate and half turn as if to flee , he would have releaped it without touching a hand . But then she got a loom of buildings , climbed over quickly , before he should jump , and ran along the lane that ran with the fence . Mare had never been up there , but she knew that the farm and the house belonged to a man named Wyker , a kind of cousin of Ruby Herter 's , a violent , bearded old fellow who lived by himself . She could not believe her luck . When she had run half the distance and Jewett had not grabbed her , doubt grabbed her instead . " Oh , my God , go careful ! " she told herself . " Go slow ! " she implored herself , and stopped running , to walk . Here was a misgiving the deeper in that it touched her special knowledge . She had never known an animal so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat will scent the trap sooner than a fed one . Yet , after one glance at the house they approached , Jewett paid it no further attention , but walked with his eyes to the right , where the cloud had blown away , and wooded ridges , like black waves rimed with silver , ran down away toward the Valley of Virginia . " I 've never lived ! " In his single cry there were two things , beatitude and pain . Between the bigness of the falling world and his eyes the flag of her hair blew . He reached out and let it whip between his fingers . Mare was afraid it would break the spell then , and he would stop looking away and look at the house again . So she did something almost incredible ; she spoke . " It 's a pretty  --  I mean  --  a beautiful view down that-a-way . " " God Almighty beautiful , to take your breath away . I knew I 'd never loved , Beloved ? " He caught a foot under the long end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down heavily on his hands and knees . It seemed to make no difference . " But I never knew I 'd never lived , " he finished in the same tone of strong rapture , quadruped in the grass , while Mare ran for the door and grabbed the latch . When the latch would not give , she lost what little sense she had . She pounded with her fists . She cried with all her might : " Oh  --  hey  --  in there  --  hey  --  in there ! " Then Jewett came and took her gently between his hands and drew her away , and then , though she was free , she stood in something like an awful embarrassment while he tried shouting . " Hey ! Friend ! whoever you are , wake up and let my love and me come in ! " " No ! " wailed the girl . He grew peremptory . " Hey , wake up ! " He tried the latch . He passed to full fury in a wink 's time ; he cursed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would break his hands . Withdrawing , he ran at it with his shoulder ; it burst at the latch , went slamming in , and left a black emptiness . His anger dissolved in a big laugh . Turning in time to catch her by a wrist , he cried joyously , " Come , my Sweet One ! " " No ! No ! Please  --  aw  --  listen . There ai n't nobody there . He ai n't to home . It would n't be right to go in anybody 's house if they was n't to home , you know that . " His laugh was blither than ever . He caught her high in his arms . " I 'd do the same by his love and him if ' t was my house , I would . " At the threshold he paused and thought , " That is , if she was the true love of his heart forever . " The room was the parlor . Moonlight slanted in at the door , and another shaft came through a window and fell across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places . The air was sour , but both of them were farm-bred . " Do n't , Amarantha ! " His words were pleading in her ear . " Do n't be so frightened . " He set her down on the sofa . As his hands let go of her they were shaking . " But look , I 'm frightened too . " He knelt on the floor before her , reached out his hands , withdrew them . " See , I 'm afraid to touch you . " He mused , his eyes rounded . " Of all the ugly things there are , fear is the ugliest . And yet , see , it can be the very beautifulest . That 's a strange queer thing . " The wind blew in and out of the room , bringing the thin , little bitter sweetness of new April at night . The moonlight that came across Mare 's shoulders fell full upon his face , but hers it left dark , ringed by the aureole of her disordered hair . " Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Because you 're an angel , is that why ? " The swift , untempercd logic of the mad led him to dismay . His hands came flying to hers , to make sure they were of earth ; and he touched her breast , her shoulders , and her hair . Peace returned to his eyes as his fingers twined among the strands . " ' Thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead . . . ' " He spoke like a man dreaming . " ' Thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate within thy locks . " Mare never knew that he could not see her for the moonlight . " Do you remember , Love ? " She dared not shake her head under his hand . " Yeh , I reckon , " she temporized . " You remember how I sat at your feet , long ago , like this , and made up a song ? And all the poets in all the world have never made one to touch it , have they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How beautiful are thy feet with shoes .. . ' Remember ? " " Oh , my God , what 's he sayin ' now ? " she wailed to herself . " ' Haw beautiful are thy feet with shoes , 0 prince 's daughter ! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a cunning workman . Thy navel is like a round goblet , which wanteth. not liquor ; thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies . Thy two breasts arc like two young roes that are twins . " ' Mare had not been to church since she was a little girl , when her mother 's black dress wore out . " No , no ! " she wailed under her breath . " You 're awful to say such awful things . " She might have shouted it nothing could have shaken the man now , rapt in the immortal , passionate periods of Solomon 's song . " . . . now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Hotness touched Mare 's face for the first time . " Aw , no , do n't talk so ! " " ' And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved . . causing the lips of them that are asleep to speak . " ' He had ended . His expression changed . Ecstasy gave place to anger , love to hate . And Mare felt the change in the weight of the fingers in her hair . " What do you mean , I must n't say it like that ? " But it was not to her his fury spoke , for he answered himself straightway . " Like poetry , Mr. Jewett ; I wo n't have blasphemy around my school . " " Poetry ! My Cod ! if that is n't poetry  --  if that is n't music ? " . . . " It 's Bible , Jewett . What you 're paid to teach here is literature . " " Doctor Ryeworth , you 're the blasphemer and you 're an ignorant man . " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have you going around reading sacred allegory like earthly love . " " Ryeworth , you 're an old man , a dull man , a dirty man , and you 'd be better dead . " Jewett 's hands had slid down from Mare 's head . " Then I went to put my fingers around his throat , so . But my stomach turned , and I did n't do it . I went to my room . I laughed all the way to my room . I sat in my room at my table and I laughed . I laughed all afternoon and long after dark came . And then , about ten , somebody came and stood beside me in my room . " " ' Wherefore dust thou laugh , son ? ' " Then I knew who He was , He was Christ . " ' I was laughing about that dirty , ignorant , crazy old fool , Lord . ' " ' Wherefore dost thou laugh ? ' " I did n't laugh any more . He did n't say any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Thy will be done ! Where is he , Lord ? ' ' Over at the girls ' dormitory , waiting for Blossom Sinckley . ' " Brassy Blossom , dirty Blossom . It had come so suddenly it was nearly too late . Mare tore at his hands with hers , tried with all her strength to pull her neck away . " Filthy Blossom ! and him an old filthy man , Blossom ! and you 'll find him in Hell when you reach there , Blossom . . " It was more the nearness of his face than the hurt of his hands that gave her power of fright to choke out three words . Light ran in crooked veins . Through the veins she saw his face bewildered . His hands loosened . One fell down and hung ; the other he lifted and put over his eyes , took it away again and looked at her . " Amarantha ! " His remorse was fearful to see . " What have I done ! " His hands returned to hover over the hurts , ravening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheeks . And with that , dammed desire broke its dam . " Amarantha , my love , my dove , my beautiful love ? " " And I ai n't Amarantha neither , I 'm Mary ! Mary , that 's ray name ! " She had no notion what she had done . He was like a crystal crucible that a chemist watches , changing hue in a wink with one adeptly added drop ; but hers was not the chemist 's eye . All she knew was that she felt light and free of him ; all she could see of his face as he stood away above the moonlight were the whites of his eyes . " Mary ! " he muttered . A slight paroxysm shook his frame . So in the transparent crucible desire changed its hue . He retreated farther , stood in the dark by some tall piece of furniture . And still she could see the whites of his eyes . " Mary ! Mary Adorable ! " A wonder was in him . " Mother of God ! " Mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too far . And already he came back to go on his knees before her , his shoulders so bowed and his face so lifted that it must have cracked his neck , she thought ; all she could see on the face was pain . " Mary Mother , I 'm sick to my death . I 'm so tired . " She had seen a dog like that , one she had loosed from a trap after it had been there three days , its caught leg half gnawed free . Something about the eyes . " Mary Mother , take me in your arms . . . " Once again her muscles tightened . But he made no move . ti . and give me sleep . " No , they were worse than the dog 's eyes . " Sleep , sleep ! why wo n't they let me sleep ? Have n't I done it all yet , Mother ? Have n't I washed them yet of all their sins ? I 've drunk the cup that was given me ; is there another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brow with thorns and my hands with nails , and I 've forgiven them , for they knew not what they did . Ca n't 1 go to sleep now , Mother ? " Mare could not have said why , but now she was more frightened than she had ever been . Her hands lay heavy on her knees , side by side , and she could not take them away when he bowed his head and rested his face upon them . After a moment he said one thing more . " Take me down gently when you take me from the Tree . " Gradually the weight of his body came against her shins , and he slept . The moon streak that entered by the eastern window crept north across the floor , thinner and thinner ; the one that fell through the southern doorway traveled east and grew fat . For a while Mare 's feet pained her terribly and her legs too . She dared not move them , though , and by and by they did not hurt so much . A dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she canvassed the shadows of the room for a weapon . Each time her eyes came back to a heavy earthenware pitcher on a stand some feet to the left of the sofa . It would have had flowers in it when Wyker 's wife was alive ; probably it had not been moved from its dust-ring since she died . It would he a long grab , perhaps too long ; still , it might be done if she had her hands . To get her hands from under the sleeper 's head was the task she set herself . She pulled first one , then the other , infinitesimally . She waited . Again she tugged a very , very little . The order of his breathing was not disturbed . But at the third trial he stirred . " Gently ! gently ! " His own muttering waked him more . With some drowsy instinct of possession he threw one hand across her wrists , pinning them together between thumb and fingers . She kept dead quiet , shut her eyes , lengthened her breathing , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretense grew a peril ; strange as it was , she had to fight to keep her eyes open . She never knew whether or not she really napped . But something changed in the air , and she was wide awake again . The moonlight was fading on the doorsill , and the light that runs before dawn waxed in the window behind her head . And then she heard a voice in the distance , lifted in maundering song . It was old man Wyker coming home after a night , and it was plain he had had some whiskey . Now a new terror laid hold of Mare . " Shut up , you fool you ! " she wanted to shout . " Come quiet , quiet ! " She might have chanced it now to throw the sleeper away from her and scramble and run , had his powers of strength and quickness not taken her simple imagination utterly in thrall . Happily the singing stopped . What had occurred was that the farmer had espied the open door and , even befuddled as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was so quiet that Mare began to fear he had gone away . He had the squirrel-hunter 's foot , and the first she knew of him was when she looked and saw his head in the doorway , his hard , soiled , whiskery face half up-side-down with craning . He had been to the town . Between drinks he had wandered in and out of the night 's excitement ; had even gone a short distance with one search party himself . Now he took in the situation in the room . He used his forefinger . First he held it to his lips . Next he pointed it with a jabbing motion at the sleeper . Then he tapped his own forehead and described wheels . Lastly , with his whole hand , he made pushing gestures , for Mare to wait . Then he vanished as silently as he had appeared . The minutes dragged . The light in the east strengthened and turned rosy . Once she thought she heard a board creaking in another part of the house , and looked down sharply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his face was a temple with freckles on it and the sharp ridge of a cheekbone , but even from so little she knew how deeply and peacefully be slept . The door darkened . Wyker was there again . In one hand he carried something heavy ; with the other he beckoned . " Come jumpin ' ! " he said out loud . Mare went jumping , but her cramped legs threw her down half way to the sill ; the rest of the distance she rolled and crawled . Just as she tumbled through the door it seemed as if the world had come to an end above her ; two barrels of a shotgun discharged into a room make a noise . Afterwards all she could hear in there was something twisting and bumping on the floor-boards . She got up and ran . Mare 's mother had gone to pieces ; neighbor women put her to bed when Mare came home . They wanted to put Mare to bed , but she would not let them . She sat on the edge of her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , her hair down all over her shoulders and her shoes on , andstared away from them , at a place in the wallpaper . " Yeh , I 'll go myself . Lea ' me be ! " The women exchanged quick glances , thinned their lips , and left her be . " God knows , " was all they would answer to the questionings of those that had not gone in , " but she 's gettin ' herself to bed . " When the doctor came though he found her sitting just as she had been , still dressed , her hair down on her shoulders and her shoes on . " What d ' y ' want ? " she muttered and stared at the place in the wallpaper . How could Doc Paradise say , when he did not know himself ? " I did n't know if you might be  --  might be feeling very smart , Mary . " " I 'm all right . Lea ' me he . " It was a heavy responsibility . Doc shouldered it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the men in the road . Ruby Herter stood a little apart , chewing sullenly and looking another way . Doc raised his voice to make certain it carried . " Nope , nothing . " Ruby 's cars got red , and he clamped his jaws . He knew he ought to go in and see Mare , but he was not going to do it while everybody hung around waiting to see if he would . A mule tied near him reached out and mouthed his sleeve in idle innocence ; he wheeled and hanged a fist against the side of the animal 's head . " Well , what d ' y ' aim to do ' bout it ? " he challenged its owner . He looked at the sun then . It was ten in the morning . " Hell , I got work ! " he flared , and set off down the road for home . Doc looked at Judge North , and the Judge started after Ruby . But Ruby shook his head angrily . " Lea ' me be ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It got to be eleven and then noon . People began to say , " Like enough she 'd be as thankful if the whole neigh-HOW BEAUTIFUL WITH SHOES - 353 borhood was n't camped here . " But none went away . As a matter of fact they were no bother to the girl . She never saw them . The only move she made was to bend her ankles over and rest her feet on edge ; her shoes hurt terribly and her feet knew it , though she did not . She sat all the while staring at that one figure in the wallpaper , and she never saw the figure . Strange as the night had been , this day was stranger . Fright and physical pain are perishable things once they are gone . But while pain merely dulls and telescopes in memory and remains diluted pain , terror looked back upon has nothing of terror left . A gambling chance taken , at no matter what odds , and won was a sure thing since the world 's beginning ; perils come through safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospect is this  --  it heightens each sensuous recollection , like a hard , clear lacquer laid on wood , bringing out the color and grain of it vividly . Last night Mare bad lain stupid with fear on groundpine beneath a bush , loud foot-falls and light whispers confused in her ear . Only now , in her room , did she smell the groundpine . Only now did the conscious part of her brain begin to make words of the whispering . " Amarantha , " she remembered , " Amarantha sweet and fair . " That was as far as she could go for the moment , except that the rhyme with " fair " was " h air . " But then a puzzle , held in abeyance , brought other words . She wondered what " ravel Ed " could mean . " Most excellently ravelled . " It was left to her mother to bring the end . They gave up trying to keep her mother out at last . The poor woman 's prostration took the form of fussiness . " Good gracious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half ruined ; ai n't your feet dead ? And look at your hair , all tangled like a wild one ! " She got a comb . " Be quiet , daughter ; what 's ailin ' you . Do n't shake your head ! " " But shake your head and scatter day . " ' " What you say , Amarantha ? " Mrs. Doggett held an ear down . " Go ' way ! Lea ' me be ! " IIer mother was hurt and left . And Mare ran , as she stared at the wallpaper . " Christ , that my love were in my arms . . . " Mare ran . She ran through a wind white with moonlight and wet with " the small rain . " And the wind she ran through , it ran through her , and made her shiver as she ran . And the man beside her leaped high over the waves of the dead grasses and gathered the wind in his arms , and her hair was heavy and his was tossing , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . And the world spread down around in waves of black and silver , more immense than she had ever known the world could be , and more beautiful . " God Almighty beautiful , to take your breath away ! " Mare wondered , and she was not used to wondering . " Is it only crazy folks ever run like that and talk that way ? " She no longer ran ; she walked ; for her breath was gone . And there was some other reason , some other reason . Oh , yes , it was because her feet were hurting her . So , at last , and roundabout , her shoes had made contact with her brain . Bending over the side of the bed , she loosened one of them mechanically . She pulled it half off . But then she looked down at it sharply , and she pulled it on again . " How beautiful . . . " Color overspread her face in a slow wave . " How beautiful are thy feet with shoes . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " 0 prince 's daughter ! " " Or call you that ? " By and by there was a knock at the door . It opened , and Ruby Herter came in . " Hello , Mare old girl ! " His face was red . He scowled and kicked at the floor . " I 'd ' a ' been over sooner , except we got a mule down sick . " He looked at his dumb betrothed . " Come on , cheer up , forget it He wo n't scare you no more , not that boy , not what 's left o ' him . What you lookin ' at , sourface ? Ai n't you glad to see me ? " Mare quit looking at the wallpaper and looked at the floor . " Yeh , " she said . " That 's more like it , babe . " He came and sat beside her ; reached down behind her and gave her a spank . " Come on , give us a kiss , babe ! " He wiped his mouth on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted with milking . He put his hands on her ; he was used to handling animals . " hey , you , warm up a little ; reckon I 'm goin ' to do all the lovin ' ? " " Ruby , lea ' me be ! " " What ! " She was up , twisting . He was up , purple . " What 's ailin ' of you , Mare ? What you bawlin ' about ? " " Nothin ' ? only go ' way ! " She pushed him to the door and through it with all her strength , and closed it in his face , and stood with her weight against it , crying , " Go ' way ! Go ' way ! Lea ' me be ! "
