IT WAS at the Conference of the International Suffrage Alliance held at the Sorbonne in Paris , some three years ago , that I caught my first glimpse of the German women as active and powerful political factors . It was then , too , that I was hound to contrast the magnitude of their accomplishment with the small part American women have played in our political life . Over a period of three years in which I have had occasion to learn more about them , I see them , under conditions and in circumstances demanding astute convictions and complete valor , as a direct indictment of our own women who , in pre-suffrage days , strewed the floor of their arena with flamboyant prophecies of the millennium that would come with their right to vote and to govern . They came , these German women , from a country pinched by hunger and defeat and revolution . They came as under a cloud into an enemy land , where prejudice , and even hatred , were likely to be their welcome . They came with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their purpose , their banners proclaiming to the women of twenty-six nations what women can do when they are put to the test . And from the moment of their entrance they furnished a comparison by which the tactics and the technic of our own women were to suffer . Whereas the American delegation of twelve actual representatives and twelve alternates was picked from the members of but one of our national women 's organizations , nearly all from the leisure class , the German delegation was made up of women from all political parties and from all walks of life . They were lawyers , physicians , social welfare workers , doctors of political economy , of letters and of science , teachers , members of the Reichstag , and women who , working with their hands , had come to know the problems of the poor and the oppressed . While the chief concern of our American women was the exclusion from the conference of a delegation from another of our national organizations , the common cause of the women of Germany was the bettering of conditions for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , and the exhortation to all women to pledge themselves to work for international understanding and accord . The American delegation had its way . And for but one reason . The women of the other countries felt they could not afford to antagonize a group to which they must look for the larger part of the money necessary to carry out the program of the Alliance . But they shook their heads , many of them , in derision or disdain , at the whispering campaign which had been an implement of the American victory . Our complete eclipse ? and I might also say our collapse ; for the bubble of our superiority was well-pricked ? occurred the last evening of the conference when women members of the various national parliaments were asked to speak . One by one they arose , and without interpreters , for they all had at least a fair knowledge of French . One by one they spoke with conviction and with a precise knowledge of their policies and of the work they had done and hoped to do in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baumer , Deputy in the Reichstag , came to her feet . The Amphitheater of the Sorbonne was packed from floor to roof with an audience for the greater part French . A few timid and scattered clappings of the hand were her only greeting . This little dark-eyed , sleek-haired woman , simply but tastefully gowned , looked about her , bowed gracefully , and in perfect and beautiful French began to speak . Before the end of her first paragraph the whole house was on its feet , shouting its applause . On and on she went unfolding her idea of woman 's purpose in polities , a purpose magnificent in its scope , penetrating in its vision , determined in its ideals . When she had finished , the audience was moved to an uncontrolled emotion . Frenchmen were kissing one another and calling out their commendation . Women were weeping . It was ten minutes before the voice of the Chairman could he heard calling the meeting to order . The French papers the next day published the speech in full , many of them commenting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sorbonne echo to words of " such sound logic , deep insight , sincere purpose , and inspiring ideals . " One editorial writer acclaimed her as a shepherd leading her flock by still waters . Frau Baumer 's speech was the great moment of the Conference . The next speaker was an American ? not a Representative in Congress , as we had but three women members at that time and none was present ? but a lone woman from a state legislature . As she arose to loud and prolonged applause , the audience moved forward in their seats , murmuring expectantly . She was pretty and well-groomed and gentle in appearance . As she made her bow silence reigned . In timid English she spoke ? this when , as I have said , all of the other women , even those from Iceland and from China , had spoken in French . She said nothing because she had nothing to say . She was there , she explained , in all humility , as she had accomplished so little , but she did want the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men legislators with whom she worked had been in their attitude towards her . That was all . As she sat down there was a slight and desultory clapping of hands . A wave of disappointment went through the hall . Behind me were two French women and a man . They snickered . At my side a group of Americans whispered noisily , " So that was all we could do ? we American women to whom the women of the entire world looked for example as well as counsel ! " It would be funny if it were not so indicative ? so chafing to our pride . If they had chosen a woman from the organization which they had excluded and which had a number of accomplished and articulate women the audience might have heard something . It was an anti-climax in no way to be laid at the speaker 's door , but one rather which set squarely up to all American women the many things which they have to learn before they can claim anything like an equal status with the politicallyminded women of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick leaders or spokesmen . It showed ineptness and unaccustomedness . It betrayed a definite weakness in our ranks which marked us as neophytes in a game where we had been flaunted as experts . This Conference II stood me in good stead . For later when I went to Germany I was not entirely unprepared for what I was to learn of the political achievement of its women . They have a power which is by no means second to that of men . They are fulfilling all the promises which the women of other countries made when they pleaded for the vote and have as yet failed to keep . They have made Germany a better world to live in . They are determined that she shall maintain peace and order within her borders as well as outside of them . They stand firmly together as women , a bulwark of unity , against all attempts at chicanery or charlatanism in government or politics . Their men acknowledge their power and dare not try to thwart it . What they have done is a story well worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries should be glad to hear . It is one which men may well heed . Before the War no woman was so completely under the domination of her man as the German woman . A kindly domination in some respects , it was none the less abortive of any independence , social or economic , to which women as individuals are entitled . With the exception of the lower classes , where women have always worked in the fields or factories or have gone out as domestics , it was rare for a German woman , unless she were a widow , to work outside of her own home . Kiiehe , Kinder and Kirche was the legend on her banner . Man was master in his household . Woman was his handmaid ? a condition she accepted as the natural order of things , placing herself at all times a subservient if loving worshipper at his feet . No sacrifice was too great for her to make for him . And this extended to the denial of whatever individual desires and aims she might possess which could in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few women who had , unconsciously perhaps , been preparing for a day when this old order would be changed . As intellectuals ? and in Germany the intellect is honored even if it happens to have been bestowed upon woman ? they were admitted to the universities and permitted thesame educational opportunities as men . Graduates from such universities as those of Heidelberg , of Leipsic , of Berlin , in economics , philosophy , political economy , and letters , their contacts had widened their horizons , affording them a sure knowledge of the intricate questions of history and politics . Except for a few who went in for social work , or who taught as subordinates under men , they had no chance to exercise their intellects . When the War came , like the women of all warring nations , they became an economic and industrial factor , taking the places of the men who had gone to the front . There was no end to the suffering and sacrifice they were willing to endure and did endure . When revolt took hold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting . When the end came with defeat , disorder , and revolution , a new woman had arisen in Germany ? one who demanded suffrage and equal rights with men . At the National Assembly at Weimar , when the republican constitution was framed , the Socialists were in power . The men , realizing that the women were tired of imperialism and of war , and thinking that they would naturally favor socialism , voluntarily and without much persuasion granted them an unequivocal equality . According to the clause which defined their status , they were to vote exactly on the same terms as men , and there would be neither political nor legal discrimination against them . It was then that the new order of German women came to the front . They were wise women . They did not organize themselves into groups attacking the methods of men , nor promising to change the world by some peculiar power which Providence had for some reason or other denied to men . Neither did they align themselves against the parties . They joined them , each woman according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to work , and they have kept on working , not for party first , according to old ideas , but for Germany and the general good first and party afterwards . This was a blow to the men of the Left Wing who had thought that women , over-tired , would grasp eagerly at new implements of persuasion . They did not realize that patterns repeat themselves and that one so deeply impressed as that of conservatism upon the German woman 's consciousness is not easily eradicated . When the first great upheaval was over and the German Republic began to act , the majority of women , no matter what their parties , leaned towards progressivism as opposed to radicalism . They did not wish their country to break up into small factions , each one warring against the other . They wanted peace and rest . Above all , they wanted an economic stability which would protect the home and not disintegrate it , and they have stood firmly against any movement or measure which threatened their desire . Upon joining the parties they automatically became by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing this , quite as automatically nominated them in considerable number for the Reichstag . To-day there are twentyseven sitting as deputies in its halls . Happily the women most interested in politics are those fitted by education , experience , and intellect for political careers , and they are elected because they have the character and ability to carry the vote . These women meet together to discuss all proposed legislation . They study all conditions thoroughly and , irrespective of party , they come to an agreement on the subject by which they stand together , even against their party leaders . To the woman deputy who betrays them they are ruthless . There was such a one who failed to stand by her part . Hers was the one dissenting feminine vote on a question involving the welfare of a large group of women workers . For the remainder of her term she was completely ostracized by the other women members . When election-time camethey worked as a unit and brought about her defeat . As the German constitution provides against all discriminations , women are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations . Because of their ability to carry a point , they have a real voice in German affairs . When I was told that it was the women of Germany who elected Von Hindenburg to the Presidency , it seemed a great deal to say . I was assured by every man with whom I talked ? Germans who were for and against Von Hindenburg , and Americans residing in Berlin ? that the statement was correct . The women were weary of the constant changes . They were worried about the growth and threat of Communism . They feared that Germany might go as Russia had gone . They knew that the people needed a strong and courageous man to guide them . A number of the women deputies met in council and pledged themselves to work and fight for Von Hindenburg , because they felt that he had accepted the overthrow of the monarchy with dignity and had worked quietly and persistently for the good of his people in the hard days that had followed . To them he represented authority ? the iron , dominant intellect which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these women . In many instances they defied and heckled the men of their own parties , holding up caucuses until they got their way . They wrote for newspapers , wrote and distributed brochures , spoke on street corners . When the vote was counted , although it showed that just as many men as women voted for Von Hindenburg , it also implied that thousands upon thousands of women belonging to parties opposed to him had voted for him . At a luncheon given for me by the Foreign Ministry I met several of the women who are doing such big things for Germany . Through several courses the conversation was confined to generalities . Suddenly , with the appearance of dessert , a little man who sat across from me , a confirmed royalist and still bristling at the unpleasant aftermath of the War , grew rancid in his mood , launching into a tirade against the Allied Nations , the occupation of border territory , reparations , and the return of Alsace to France . " In the next war Germany shall have her day , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . The women assaulted him in a chorus of vigorous German . One of them , a natural leader , brought a determined fist down upon the table . " We shall have no more war , Baron , " she declared , " the women of Germany will not permit it . Do you hear me ? We shall have no more war . " He heard her , and was completely subdued during the rest of the meal . Later , when I III came to know these women better , I learned that their ability to face an issue unflinchingly , without evasion or a weak persuasion , is one of the virtues of their success . There is Frau Mende , a graduate in history and French from the University of Berlin , and for many years a teacher in the schools of Germany and in those of the Balkan States . Before the War she had taken an active interest in politics , although women then had no voting power . After the revolution she aided Stresemann in founding the People 's Party . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the only woman on her party 's committee . There was in the Assembly a man who had held a high position under the monarchy and who was violently opposed to the admission of women . " I ca n't see , " he declared to Frau Mende , " what use women can be in a Constitutional Assembly . " Frau Mende smiled and gave a quick reply , " I ca n't see what use a minister of the old regime will be . Let us wait and see . " " He did see , " said Frau Mende to me . " When Franz Ebert was mentioned for the Presidency , the committee of the People 's Party met to consider a candidate , as both it and the Nationalists were opposed to him . We had under consideration a man of high standing . I knew he would poll only such votes as our own electors could give him . So I held out against his nomination , suggesting that , since we could not elect a man of our own , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be depended upon to hold his ' head . ' " The chairman grew very ironic because one woman was holding up the decision . Nevertheless , 1 managed to do so until the afternoon when two very important members of the party , who had not been with us in the morning , declared themselves of the same opinion as I. We carried the day . " Of course this got around and a few days later I met the man who was so much against women in polities . I said to him , Ah , Graf . You asked me what use women were in committees and in assemblies . I told you to wait and see . You have waited and now you see . " " Frau Mende is on the Foreign Relations Committee , the Housing Committee , and several of those committees which have to do with child welfare . She is also working to bring about a change in the divorce laws of Germany . " Our divorce laws are very difficult , " she explained to me . " It sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means great hardships to both men and women , particularly because of the War , when young people married under the stress of swift emotions , to find later that they were utterly incompatible . There are so many cases in which , because theycould not be divorced , couples have separated and have formed new relationships outside the law , which have done much to increase illegitimate children . Now we shall change the laws . " Naturally we have met with opposition , especially from the Centrum Party , so I went to see Herr Marx , who was Chancellor , explaining the situation to him . He refused his support , telling me that people should be taught selfcontrol . That is all very well in theory , ' I replied , ' but not in practice . You can not defeat human nature . If we do not change the laws we must learn to be tolerant of wild marriages . ' ( The German description of marriages without benefit of clergy . ) Despite the opposition of so powerful an influence , the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Reichstag and is recommended for passage at the next one . " We shall not be put off , " said Frau Mende . " We shall keep at it if it takes ten years . " I asked Frau Mende how far she thought women would go in politics . " We shall have more and more power , " she answered with emphasis . " Only we must remain reasonable . We must not work so much as women opposed to men , but as the right kind of women working with the right kind of men for the good of all . We must get real political knowledge . Our horizon must grow ever wider and wider . We must refuse on all occasions to consider self or party interests before the interests of the people and the nation as a whole . " Everywhere one goes in Germany one hears of Dr. Marie Elisabeth Lueders . " She has as much power as any man in Germany , " was the way in which a man in high political position described her to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dynamic intellect and personality , " was another important man 's estimate of her . There is something titanic about Frau Lueders . Tall , straight , strong-limbed , and without an ounce of superfluous flesh , she might be happily modeled to represent a woman triumphant . Her head is set high on her fine shoulders . Her profile is delicately and yet powerfully chiseled . Her blue eyes are as keen and as swift as lightning . Her mouth , mobile and yet firm , turns up with an indisputable sense of humor . Although she must be beyond forty , she isunlined except for two deep furrows across her broad white brow . From the University of Berlin she bears with high honors the title of Doctor of Political Economy . She has introduced more laws and seen them through to victory than many men in the Reichstag . It was she who Ied the fight for married women workers , when it was determined , because of the excessive unemployment in Germany , to pass a law excluding them from the civil service . She proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which especially provided that there should be neither political nor legal discrimination against women . " What is going to happen , " she asked , " to many of these married women who for years have been working in the government , who have no other means of livelihood , whose husbands are too enfeebled by war or too lacking in ability to care prdperly for their families ? Do you seek to pass a law barring men whose wives are earning money from government employment ? Why this unconstitutional discrimination ? " It looked for a while as if the women 's opposition would carry . No doubt it would have , had it not been for a reasonable compromise effected by them . " Very well , " they said , with Frau Lueders in the lead , " recognizing the unemployment crisis , we will give in , but we demand that the women turned out of work because of this law shall receive adequate indemnity . " A bill was introduced by Frau Lueders , which gave to the women either a pension until such time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump sum which would tide them over until they could find other occupations . This measure caused a storm among certain groups in the Reichstag . The Minister of Finance called upon Frau Lueders and asked her to withdraw it . When she refused he exclaimed , " If it is accepted I shall go out . " " That is too bad , " replied Frau Lueders , " but after all there are many men perfectly capable of taking your place . " The bill was accepted , became a law , and the Finance Minister did go out . " A better one came in , " Frau Lueders told me with a laugh . Another bill , introduced by Doctor Lueders , and worked for by most of the women deputies , was a modification of the birth-control laws condemning any doctor or person proven guilty of giving contraceptive advice or any such aid to a long term in prison and complete deprivation of citizenship rights . The penalty was applicable also to the women so aided . While it was impossible to revoke the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the penalty was left to the judge , who must now render a decree according to the economic and physical condition of the mothers and fathers . After the Armistice , because mothers could not nurse their infants or afford to buy milk for them , the infant mortality in Germany increased with alarming rapidity . The result of this is the Mothers ' Milk Law , introduced by Frau Lueders at the instance of the women deputies . It . provides the money for the required amount of milk for babies of poor mothers . Nursing mothers are given the allowance to buy milk for themselves so that their babies shall have adequate nourishment . " It has done much to decrease the mortality rate and to raise the standard of health among the babies of the poor , " Doctor Lueders told me . " In order to get the allowance the mothers must take their babies to a clinic twice a week where the babies are given the best of medical examinations , and the mothers advice . " A law under consideration which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act which provides that the proven father of the child born out of wedlock shall educate and support such a child . Margaretta Rehm was another forthright and exemplary member of the Reichstag . It was she who rallied to the support of the women who took in work at home and introduced and mothered a law which included them in the workers ' insurance act . Known as the Lex Behm ( the Behm Law ) , it was passed only after months of hard work to overcome bitter prejudices . And there is Frau Ulrika Scheidel . I write of her to indicate the enormous capacity of the German women for hard work . A graduate of the Lyceum in Berlin , she is the principal of a Girl 's High School there , one of the first to be given this position in Germany . " There are six of us now , " she laughed , " but , oh ! what emotion among the men teachers when we were appointed . " When the Reichstag is in session Frau Scheidel arises at six o'clock , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , answers her letters , confers with her subordinates , gives two lessons in higher mathematics , and is at the Reichstag by ten o'clock . At the noon recess she has a quick luncheon , gives another lesson in higher mathematics , and is in her seat when the Reichstag reassembles in the afternoon . It is no uncommon occurrence , because of the many problems vexing Germany at this time , for the parliament to remain in session until midnight or thereafter . Frau Scheidel is there so long as there is work to he done or a vote to be taken . I asked her how she was able to keep up . She replied , " I could not do it without my Anna . " ( Anna is her maid . ) " She takes charge of my entire life . She cooks , cleans , markets , plans my menus , sees that my clothes are in good order , makes the appointments for my dressmaker and sees that they are kept , caters and arranges for whatever entertaining I must do , keeps expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . " When I remarked that I did not see how she could get one maid to do all of this , she responded , " Ah ! But she 's doing it for Germany . She thinks I have a mission to perform and is proud to consecrate herself to what she considers a sacred trust . " It is not so much what these women are and what they have done that brings them credit , as the long odds against which they had to fight to be what they are and to do what they are doing . For the majority of men in Germany did not take kindly to the political equality of women . Many of them are fair enough to admit that the women have acquitted themselves admirably and that they are an established force for good . Ex-Chancellor Marx told me that he had " come to see that the women were of valuable aid in government "  - -  a subtle but tacit admission that he had not always thought so . Others are not so willing to set aside their antagonisms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that women could accomplish just as much if they stayed at home and influenced their men by personal persuasion . " Look how wise the Spanish women are , " he exclaimed . " They exercise more power over the policies of their country than any other women . And they do it by staying home and counseling their men . " I could not refrain from replying that if Spain , in so far as progress and prosperity and method of government are concerned , is the result of the Spanish woman 's wisdom , then Germany should thank her own women for their bit of folly . IV Now I do not maintain that our American women have been a complete failure . Women 's organizations , such as the National League of Women Voters , the General Federation of Women 's Clubs , and the National Woman 's Party , by skilled lobbying have been effective in establishing better property rights for women and more equitable and equable laws regarding the joint guardianship of children in several states . They have been instrumental in improving in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the age of consent . It was through their perseverance that the Infancy and Maternity Act known as the Sheppard-Towner law was passed in 192.1 . Through them it may he restored . The granting of equal citizenship rights and the choice of domicile is due to their efforts . The Child Labor Law , as it was passed in Congress , was their project , although they have as yet been unable to bring about its ratification by the states . But as a real power in the nation 's politics they arc a cipher . Those who have affiliated themselves with the parties have been content to sit in the back row , accepting those bones from the political table which the men throw them as a sop . They have had neither voice nor action in party platforms . They have followed the men leaders as sheep to the slaughter of pre-suffrage promises and ideals . Among those who have been nominated by their parties and elected to office are a number who were even opposed to suffrage . Of the seven women at present in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacancies left by their husbands . With one exception ? the Rogers bill which carried an appropriation for the care of disabled veterans , introduced and fostered by Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers ? they have done nothing which the most mediocre man might not have done . I have , on occasion , talked with several of these women , and I found them timid in expressing themselves . One whom I interviewed declared herself in favor of certain legislative measures but refused to go on record for them , explaining that in the event of her having to vote against them through party loyalty , she would then be criticized for changing her mind . Another , in outlining her opposition to prohibition , was stopped in the middle of the interview by a solicitous woman secretary . " I do n't think , " said the secretary , " that it is wise to say that . It will hurt you either with the public or with the drys in the party . " The Congresswoman listened to her , and obtained a promise from me not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the German woman in politics . She has valor ? a hard valor that has come from having to stand up against her men and against life . She has known national hardship which bred in her that fervent passion without which any cause is doomed to failure . We American women are soft . Since pioneer days we have not had to fight for our sustenance . Where our personal desires are concerned our men have been as marshmallows in our hands . When , therefore , we have to encounter outside the home men who have become hard through having to wrest their way from a hard world we have not the inner stamina to defy them . What we need are leaders ? women like Anna Howard Shaw , Susan B. Anthony , Carrie Chapman Catt , Mary Garrett Hay , Jane Addams , Mice Stone Blackwell , Alice Paul ? women who have taken a cause as their own , and have had the passion and the fortitude to fight for it unto victory . These qualities the German women possess in high degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman I saw one Sunday morning sixty miles or so north of Berlin . She came sailing toward me down the long , straight road which cut like a white and vivid river across the countryside . She was old ? a full seventy , I should say . Upright she sat upon her bicycle , her sea-blue skirts swirling in the wind . Only a lily in its first bloom could have rivaled the whiteness of her stiffly starched apron . Only a saintly Carmelite could have matched the austerity of her weather-beaten face , the skin of which was drawn like parchment over the wide cheekbones . Her eyes were like glowing coals . Her mouth was set in a fine , thin line . Her head was held high . From it floated the heavy black veil drawn over a comb which marks the costume of the women of Lubenau . Strapped to the handle of her bicycle , was a large black prayerbook . Behind her , in rhythm with the steady , measured tread of her pedals , rode in succession , like a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger sons , and a sequence of grandchildren . All were as erect , as intent in purpose , as clean and as stiffly starched as she , and with their prayer-books strapped as securely and as significantly to the handles of their bicycles . An epic figure she was , leading her fold to worship at a church ten miles distant . Riding along between the high , dark forest on one side and the gentle sweep of green , tilled fields on the other , she was a fair symbol of the woman triumphant ? the woman who rides undaunted along the relentless road of duty ? the German woman whose clear head is helping to carry her people above the adverse winds of national dilemma .
