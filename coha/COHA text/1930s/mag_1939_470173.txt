ABOUT the time when these words appear in print ? perhaps even before they appear ? the most litigated battle in the most litigated industry in the world will have reached its climax . The United States Supreme Court will have handed down a decision in the case of the Commonwealth and Southern Corporation versus the Tennessee Valley Authority . The time seems appropriate to analyze the many-sided problem thus brought to issue ; for the case offers , in microcosm , an incomparable economic and social history of the modern corporation in its relation to the American public . In New York City sits the registrar of a great university . Occasionally through the day his mind wanders from aptitude tests and freshmen to the 20 shares of preferred stock which he owns in Commonwealth and Southern . He paid $100 apiece for them nine years ago , and now they are down to about $50 . He wonders about the TVA and his investment . Down by Bear Creek , between Tuscumbia and Tupelo , in the corn and cotton belt of the South , Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditates upon his fortunes . Eight years ago he had 40 acres of eroded gullies and hard lands ? and little hope . To-day he grows triple superphosphate lespedeza on which he pastures cows , and by virtue of having electric lights and operating an electric brooder and using a number of other economically useful electric devices , he is known as an " electro-development farmer . " Cliff Jenkins wonders about his investment in TVA . Between these two very real men stand Main Street and Wall Street . Opinion in Wall Street is reasonably united : it holds that a government intent on socialistic adventure and on the harassing of privately-owned utilities has gone into destructive competition with these utilities ; and that , if not checked by the high court , it will embark on new power projects and in effect ruin investment values in the utilities wherever it may choose to compete with them . In Main Street the people are less certain . They recall vaguely that the Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River was built by the Government as a wartime measure ; that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a song , but that Norris , the old war horse , fulminated successfully ; that two Presidents told Congress that the Government could n't operate the Dam because this would n't be American ; but that then Roosevelt came and the Norris Bill was passed ; other dams were built and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority , while the neighboring private utilities made a great outcry and started lawsuit after lawsuit ; and that this Authority not only produces electricity from the dams and sells it at low rates , but is also engaged in many other activities which it claims will benefit the people of the Valley . But the issues in the conflict are puzzling to people to whom electricity from water is a mystery and valuations of utility properties are remote abstractions . Whom shall they believe , they wonder : the Government with its interest in TVA , or the Commonwealth and Southern with its great Southern properties ? II To begin with , it must be borne in mind that the TVA represents the third phase in the struggle to control the power industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation came through competition . Electric light and power companies had free rein to do as they pleased and charge as they pleased . Had they devoted themselves to supplying power as efficiently as possible at the cheapest rates there would have been little complaint and little pressure for regulation . Service was uneven , however , and rates were high . There was some competition between electric companies , but in each area this usually ended as competition ended in the oil industry in the early Rockefeller era : after a battle to the death , a victor emerged who was free to operate at whatever rates the traffic would hear . Thomas Edison counseled the industry to keep its investment " by keeping prices so low that there is no inducement to others to come in and ruin it " ; but the temptations of unrestricted monopoly were too great . When free competition failed to protect the consumer the electric industry was declared to be pervaded with a public interest and was thus officially recognized as a monopoly by State legislatures . State public utility commissions were set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1907 , to regulate these legal private monopolies . In scattered cities and towns , to be sure ? J. D. Ross 's Seattle , Los Angeles , and many smaller places ? public ownership was tried ; but these efforts were localized , limited to city or town limits , and of slight influence in the industry as a whole . The job which the State commissions confronted was difficult at best ; it was rendered far more difficult by judicial decisions . One of the paradoxes of the issue which has been before the Supreme Court this year has been the fact that thisissue would scarcely have arisen had it not been for the Court 's own previous rulings ? rulings which permitted appeals from commission decisions on the grounds of confiscation without due process , which allowed the introduction of new evidence in these appeals , which gave the Court itself legislative power to modify the commission decisions , and which thus effectively hobbled the commissions . And the Court did something else . By a series of confused and contradictory decisions , it established " reproduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in determining what rates could be charged . If we are to understand why the present Administration holds the regulation of utilities by State commissions to have failed we must go into this difficult and technical business of valuation . The theory on which the State commissions operated was that utility companies might charge for the services they sold enough money to give them a " fair return on the fair value " of their property , and no more . But what was the " fair value " of their property ? The amount of money which had actually been put into it ? Or the amount of money which would be needed to reproduce the property if it had to be built again from the ground up ? The Court specified that both must be taken into account : not only the original cost , but the probable cost of reproducing it at the time of the decision . Now reproduction cost is usually a matter of guesswork , as in the classical New York telephone case . Highly paid experts for both sides guessed at the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were so wide apart that the telephone company appealed from the commission 's decision . The court appointed a master who heard the evidence anew and rendered a decision different from the first two guesses . The court then rejected aII the valuations and submitted its own version . Up to this point the lowest guess was $367,000,000 and the highest was $615,000,000 ! The case went on to the Federal Courts ; by the time it was decided eleven years had elapsed and the cost of litigation to the company alone was over $5,000,000 . A maddening feature of reproduction cost is that one month after a valuation has been adjudicated it may no longer apply , since price-levels , wages , and other factors are subject to frequent fluctuations . If the case is taken to the courts one may be pretty sure that by the time it is decided the figures used in it will no longer be current . Furthermore , a State commission needs money and an adequate staff to be able to keep valuations up to date and to prosecute a vigorous rate-making policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent Southern engineer testified at the congressional hearings on the TVA bill of 1933 , " It is just a debating society between experts ; and on the one hand you have the consumers and on the other a preponderance of numbers , skill , and interest in support of the claims of the power companies which uphold the high rates . " In 1933 , then , this was the situation . The industry was a legal monopoly protected from competition from other private utilities by legislative enactment . State commissions were supposed to regulate it , but , if not crooked , were at least operating under grave handicaps . In the main , extravagant rate structures were retained and the courts tolerated them . Two new courses were open to consideration : first , the government could insist upon ownership of all properties ; or , second , it could , on a large enough scale to he effective , compete or threaten to compete with the industry in certain areas . This second method may be termed regulation by protective competition . When President Roosevelt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the Bull Moose split he was elected at the age of twenty-eight a State senator as a Democrat from Dutchess County , where " the chief industry had always been the raising of Republicans . " Immediately he was catapulted into a violent fight with the rising alliance of power companies , and from then on he wasaligned against it . Two months after he took office in his first national Administration the TVA was authorized by Congress . It represented the second of the two alternatives . Private utilities were protected from competition by other private utilities by franchise . This , the Roosevelt Administration contended , did not mean that the government could not compete with the utilities , or ? as has been truer of the Authority so far ? that the government could not operate side by side with them , potentially able to compete . The Authority thus is a public corporation planned and executed on a half-billion ? dollar scale . It is powerful enough to withstand the cut-throat competition of the private utilities which has strangled hundreds of small municipally-owned electric systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely by threat . III To grasp fully the history to which the Supreme Court is adding a decisive line , one must examine the impact of the Commonwealth and Southern upon the people of the South prior to 1953 . " Men of Alabama , let us arouse ourselves ! " the Sheffield Standard trumpeted in August , 1914 . " Let us have more James Mitchells , of London , bringing British gold for Alabama 's development . Let us have more J. W. Worthingtons and Frank S. Washburns . " These three names belonged to the Alabama Power Company ; and the quotation reminds us that in the early days that Company represented in large degree a British investment . However , the month of August , 1914 , belonged to Mars , and during the next few years it was the United States which sent " gold " to London . By 1922 the Alabama Power Company could report that less than two-fifths of its securities were held outside the country . The age of large-scale British investment in Southern public utilities was passing . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , and the American financiers were tinning to the electric industry . By the fall of 1926 the Alabama Power Company ? together with its sister companies , Mississippi Power , Gulf Power , and Georgia Power , to which group was later to be added Tennessee Electric Power ? had come under the spell of Southeastern Power and Light Company , a holding firm . And , big as it was , even Southeastern Power and Light was too small for the panoramic sweep of the great men of the 1920 's . Sidney Z. Mitchell 's Electric Bond and Share was spreading an empire from the Caribbean to the China Sea . Insull was buying power companies right and left . The elusive Hopson , with a little of his own money and a lot of the public 's money , was building the Associated Gas and Electric system . So persuasive was the new evangelism that it was open talk on the Street that Morgan and Company had set out to get control of everything in electricity east of the Mississippi . The stage was set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copulation ? in mid-spring of the fateful year 1929 ? the Commonwealth and Southern was born . At that time Southeastern Power and Light controlled its group of Southern utilities . Consumers Power Company controlled a closely knit system in the Michigan area . Penn-Ohio Edison Company controlled a constellation of Ohio and Pennsylvania units . It was to unite these three separate groups that Commonwealth and Southern was formed . In February , 1930 ? a few months after the crash ? it exchanged its new stock for stuck of these companies and the merger was completed . Among holding companies the Commonwealth and Southern has been managed with an unusual degree of respectability , although doubtless the fact that it was created as late as 1929-30 is partly responsible for its virtue . Several of its officials , notably President Wendell Willkie , have shown a degree of finesse in their relations with the public which is unusual in the industry . For example , the creation by Commonwealth and Southern in 1931 of a mutual servicing company whose stock is wholly owned by the operating companies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies were under general attack for " milking " operating companies by doing work for them at padded prices . When the National Power Policy Commission , a Federal agency , recently recommended that " all service , sales , and construction contracts should be performed by companies or associations on a strictly mutual basis to insure the performance of their work at cost , " the Commission was by implication paying tribute to the management of the Commonwealth and Southern , which had made such an arrangement in 1931 . This great system of power companies has a book worth of 1.2 billion dollars . Ultimately , who is master ? Obviously with a $359,000,000 interest the Commonwealth and Southern itself , the holding company , gives the answers for the remaining $715,000,000 owned by the public . But who controls the Commonwealth and Southern ? In January , 1934 , it had 195,484 stockholders ; and of these a mere 13 , under the suzerainty of Morgan , owned 31.5 per cent of the voting stock . This interest , mainly in common stock carried on the books at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as quoted at the current market price of about $2 , something like $22,000,000 . As to the 1.2 billion dollars of book capitalization , therefore , 4.8 per cent at book value or 1.9 per cent at market prices controls it entirely . This 1.2 billion of book capitalization , however , should be looked upon as an expensive euphemism . For it contains some write-ups ; and the write-up is one of the most interesting phenomena of public-utility financing . If you own Commonwealth and Southern stock , to see what lies behind it , at least in part , consider the affair of scarcely known Company " A , " wholly owned and controlled by Southeastern Power and Light in the 1920 's . " A " bought about 5 million dollars ' worth of securities and sold them to company " B , " created solely for this purpose , which then recorded them as being worth 32 million dollars . " B " was now quickly pulled back into the womb by Southeastern Power and Light ? which now , through this bit of jugglery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more OP its books than it had had before . Known write-ups on the books of the Southeastern , brought to light by the Federal Trade Commission , aggregate 42.6 million out of a total book capital of 200 million . The artfulness of such write-ups may be illustrated in terms of a city water system . Suppose that in 1908 the city of Okagee had invested , without waste , 10 million dollars in a water system . This amount would be known as the " prudent original investment . " Suppose now that in 1938 the city managers decided that if the system had to be reproduced under the higher prices of to-day , the cost would be , not 10 millions , but 16 . This would be the " Reproduction cost . " Since interest on the investment is the largest single item in water rates , it is obvious that if the system were to pay interest on 16 millions , instead of 10 , the water rates would have to be raised greatly . ( Hence the significance of the Supreme Court decisions referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should also be obvious that if the system were privately owned , and could substitute bonds and stock to the book value of 16 millions for bonds and stock to the book value of 10 millions , thus writing up its book value , it could pay a much larger return to its investors on its stock without a penny of new money having been invested , and still appear to be paying only a reasonable return on its " investment . " The prize write-up in the entire history of the public utility industry was made by the Commonwealth and Southern itself ? and subsequently very wisely expunged . Having acquired stock to which the subsidiary companies had assigned a book value of 341 million dollars , the Corporation blithely recorded them as being worth 872 million dollars . Had this write-up been fabricated in the 1920 's , portions of it might well have found their way to the public in the form of stock . By the time it was effected , however , the market was declining and write-ups were beginning to look less plausible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of Wendell Wilkie , " we saw that it did not have any place in the picture . " While the stands were being nailed together in Washington for the inauguration of a noted critic of the utilities , the minutes of a meeting of the Board of the Corporation on February 28 , 1933 , recorded that , the write-up having been expunged , " the stocks and bonds of the operating subsidiaries are now carried on the books of the Commonwealth and Southern Corporation at a cost which substantially represented their value at the time of acquisition . " There remain , however , previous write-ups . And the dilemma of Commonwealth and Southern is obvious . It may wish very much to sell its Southern operating companies to the Federal government or to local governments . Presumably it would sell at reproduction cost as estimated by the extremely generous practices of courts and commissions . Though its preferred stock is now selling for about $50 , originally it was issued for $100 . The $5 common is now selling at about $2 . The corporation would Iike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 and a large part of the common , not only in the subsidiary companies but also ? as a result ? in itself . The TVA has refused , however , to consider payments except upon prudent original cost as a starting point . When the TVA is charged with destroying " values " this is what is meant . These are values in the sense that they represent what many investors have paid for their stock ; but they are not values built into the darns and dynamos nor into technical excellence . They are values created in part by jugglery ? rabbits taken out of financial hats a thousand mites north of the Tennessee Valley , Here are a few samples of what the Alabama Power Company has already been paid by the TVA . For a substation and power lines given a book value of $1,700,000 the TVA paid $1,200,000 . The site for Joe Wheeler Dam , carried at $349,000 , brought just $49,000 . The distribution system of Florence , held at $569,000 , went for $221,000 . How are these large " book losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Commonwealth and Southern have been halved to stockholders , although earned entirely . Second , depreciation and retirement expenses have been increased a third ( 1937 over 1936 ) . This gives rise to a peculiarly paradoxical plea from Mr. Wilikie : " Business has been good in 1937 and we have had $12,000,000 increased revenues over 1936 , " he says in effect ; " but wait ! ? net income has fallen almost $2,000,000 . " Had the retirement reserve not been increased so sharply , however , net income would have risen over $2,000,000 . Disinterested observers can see how it comes about that Mr. Wilikie talks " good business , poor profit . " From the point of view of the general public , the business of an electric company is to produce the best service at the lowest rates consistent with the investment . By these criteria the role of the Commonwealth and Southern companies in the South presents one of the most amazing paradoxes in the history of the electric industry . The Tennessee Electric Power Company has been awarded the Charles A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry 's history . With Georgia Power and Alabama Power , it has the highest consumption per residential meter east of the Rockies , 1,000 kilowatt-hours a year . Yet it is a fact that TVA has come into the Valley charging the Commonwealth and Southern with excessive rates and lack of aggressiveness in promoting the use of electricity . How can the two square ? The explanation is that until recently the Southern units of the Commonwealthand Southern had been cultivating only the most prosperous strata in their area . There was plenty of room for increase . Alabama is a good example . Chiefly rural , its power supply is dominated by the Alabama Power Company . In 1933 this company submitted to the public utility industry a paper titled " Accomplishments in Rural Electrification " which won the Thomas W. Martin Rural Electrification Prize . What were the achievements ? In all the homes of rural Alabama served by the company in December , 1932 , there were run on electricity only 645 iceboxes , 85 sewing machines , 185 vacuum cleaners , 700 radios . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power Company the use of electric power in rural homes and farms was equivalent , the year before TVA , to no more than can be found in a good city block . These statistics applied to Christmas month of 1932 . Roosevelt had already been elected and within six months the TVA was a reality . The Southern units of the Commonwealth and Southern , " scared stiff , " were quickly galvanized into action . As an officer of the Georgia Power Company put it , All of this TVA business , PWA loans , all the agitation for government ownership in our area bade fair to ' play hell with our prospects ' if we did not do something about it . " Almost immediately Frank Newton , the rate man for Commonwealth and Southern , brought out his specialty known as the objective rate plan for the reduction of electric hills for those already buying power . The more fundamental problem of broadening the consumer base , however , did not " take " with the men in the System . For this they were caustically reproached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say to you is equally pertinent in Tennessee , Alabama , and Georgia , " Collier , the vicepresident of Georgia Power , plainly told utility executives at Chicago as late as the spring of 1936 . " Our problem in the South is not how many completely electrified homes we can put into service , but how nearly we can approach to some degree electrification of the homes among our great mass of customers . . . I said ( in 1934 ) . . . that the ability of our Southern companies to do a real sales job depended upon our ability to reach into that low-income group which , with you Mid-Western , New England , and Far Western companies , is probably a small per cent of your potential field , but which with us constitutes practically 100 per cent of our customers . " At the 1934 convention Mr. Collier had proposed a bold sales program to cut into this low-income field . " I was , upon finishing my talk , accused by some of being a capital liar , and those who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a little hit crazy , anywayl ' " But this man 's imagination in selling and his low rates worked , and he could report that " we have almost abolished a Complaint Bureau in the Atlanta Office . " When TVA introduced its low rates it took a chance ? minimized by careful consideration of experience in Ontario , Seattle , and similar public ownership demonstrations ? that consumption would increase sufficiently to make up revenues that otherwise would be lost . The private utilities have been quick to say that they did not have the resources of the Federal treasury behind them , that they could not afford to gamble the investor 's money , that it just could n't work , etc . But , Mr. Collier told the salesmen of the industry about his promotion plan that worked , " There is n't a commercial man in this room who , given the opportunity , could not set up a sales plan just as good or better . Remember one thing , however . The job ca n't be done in a day . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on that sort of a program it would break my company . We just ca n't afford it . ' " His conclusion epitomized the philosophy of TVA : " We must decide between the positive loss by inactivity and the possible risk by action . " Thus it is true that in recent years the Southern units of the Commonwealth and Southern have made real progress in this job of rural electrification which " ca n't be done in a day . " But it is also true that the incentive to this progress ? despite the denials of the Commonwealth and Southern itself ? has been largely the example offered by the TVA , along with fear of competition from the TVA . IV As for the Tennessee Valley Authority itself , its cornerstone was laid in 1917 . In that year of war the government began Wilson Dam at Muscle Shoals , primarily to extract nitrogen from the air for munitions . Unfortunately the nitrate plants turned out had guesses . Far more power could be generated , however , than could be used for nitrates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama Power Company had envisioned that this huge amount of power , 444,000 kilowatts ultimately , would as a matter of course be controlled by itself . As government operation and distribution were unthinkable at the time , the Alabama and Georgia and Tennessee companies would be the logical and only market for the powerl It turned out otherwise , however . What happened after the War was not a sale of Muscle Shoals either to Alabama Power or to Henry Ford , but a fourteenyear wrangle . Until November , 1932 , Senator Norris and Judson King of the National Popular Government League and the men who fought with them had only one simple demand in mind , that Wilson Dam power be operated and sold by the government . Had the private companies yielded in this there probably would be no TVA to-day . After Roosevelt 's election , however , the Commonwealth and Southern Corporation found itself opposing not only a government-operated Wilson Dam but a series of nine dams set on the Tennessee River along its 650 miles from Knoxville to the Ohio . The water system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assured of a 9-foot channel . Now a drop of water falling 100 feet down the dam race picks up a lot of momentum . Belt a bunch of them together , drop them into the blades of a turbine which then rotates huge coils of wire in a magnetic field , and electricity will be created . Outside the privately owned Hales Bar Dam , every foot of the Tennessee 's 500-foot drop will generate TVA power . A kilowatt-hour will more than light the average home for a day . TVA dams ultimately will create 660,000 kilowatts every hour of the year , capable of heating the kitchen toaster , milking the cows , running cotton gins and , by artificial winter daylight , tricking hens into increased egg production . This power the TVA sells at low rates . When Alcorn County farmers switched to TVA rates the month 's light bill for 25 kilowatt-hours was reduced from $2.13 to 75 cents . If you do n't get TVA power , why not look at the back of your electric bill and see what you would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TVA halved rates . To prove that TVA rates are subsidized , the Commonwealth and Southern has gone at great length into the technical detail of how the costs of dams have been allocated among power , navigation , and flood control . Oddly enough , the question of comparative generation costs is now academic . For Commonwealth and Southern has conceded that it can generate electricity for less than what TVA will sell it at wholesale . This narrows the cost question to local distribution , where seven-eighths of the consumer 's dollar may go . For some reason the Commonwealth and Southern has never been frank and open about its costs . Possibly inflated valuations of private utilities would make these unfavorable . Yet TVA co-operatives , selling power at TVA rates and allowing for substantially all the costs of private utilities , are making sufficient profits to amortize completely the actual cost of the properties within 10 years , free and clearl However , the " yardstick " idea ? the idea of the government owning and operating a public utility in order to judge the reasonableness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously for several reasons . The cost of building electric properties varies according to time and place . A dam on a rock foundation may cost a million more than the same dam on one better adapted to its purpose . The density and proportions of industrial , commercial , farm , and home customers affect distribution expenses materially . And obviously a controlling cost factor is the extent of capacity used . TVA generates power by falling water . The initial investment may be three times greater than the cost of a steam plant ; but coal and , in large measure , labor costs are eliminated . Hence the water-power plant is like a toll bridge : the total cost of power is virtually the same whether 1 or I00 per cent of capacity is used . It is evident that below a certain percentage of utilization steam-power is cheaper , and above that point water-power is cheaper . All comparisons made without specifying " load factor " are meaningless . Under these conditions what is a reasonable rate ? if the cost of a kilowatthour can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs will depend in large part on the philosophy of production adopted . If a utility keeps an eye on its existing production and sets its rates to cover that amount , obviously they will tend strongly to keep consumption at the existing level . If , however , it estimates that with double a given amount of production it can reduce costs by a third , and it then proceeds to reduce its price by a third , before long its production is likely to double . As an eminent valuation authority , Dr. James C. Bonbright , has concluded , " reasonable rates on fair value " as interpreted by the utilities in the past is a static concept , while TVA rates are promotional and dynamic . What the TVA has done , in short , is not to set up a rate-yardstick but to demonstrate that the dynamic policy will work , and to advertise the existence of a big potential market for low-cost electricity . V So far we have dealt only with the power part of the TVA program . Yet considering the TVA as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the program , in which the Supreme Court may not be interested , far outweigh the importance of power . Consider the hill people of the east valley of the Tennessee . Many a family to-day lives in a home worth as little as twenty dollars . There are few doctors : typhoid and dysentery , tuberculosis and hookworm are common . Of course the general level of physical efficiency is low and old age comes early . Where the valley folds about the Tennessee River as it meanders lazily across northern Alabama , the cotton lands and plantations no longer are glamorous . The planters have moved to the towns , the fields are worked largely by sharecroppers . In upland west Tennessee illiteracy is high , tax delinquency is common , electricity is a rarity . There are corn and cotton , hogs and mules . Yes , and malaria too . The Cumberland Plateau is sad with hopelessness , with children brought up to be coal miners where there will be no mining again for generations . The lush meadows , the salt licks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Basin only serve to make the rest seem poorer , like a bright lamp against a dull one . Of the 26 million acres of valley land in the TVA area , half are used for crops and pasture : of these , 2 million are gnilied , another million are near-gullied , and 7 million are noticeably eroded . Such impoverishment not only makes living off the /and difficult , but causes each rain to carry off new tons of top soil to dirty the streams , heighten floods , silt the reservoirs , and hasten a slow process of evolution from once beautiful land to barren desert . To meet this problem the TVA has added to its programs for flood control , power production , and navigation , a program of saving the soil . Take the friendly " shipmast " locust tree , plant it well-spaced and unretarded by woodland brush , and in eight years it may reach a height of 15 feet . Being leguminous , it enriches the soil with nitrogen . It makes good firewood and farm lumber and a tough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapest gully-stoppers known . Four thousand CCC boys have treated over 10 million square yards of eroded land and planted over 20 million locust and pine trees for the Valley people . Much of the Valley land is steep . Terrace it , at about $2 an acre , as European and Asian countries learned centuries ago , and instead of rushing down in little destructive torrents the rain will " walk " down . At Bethany erosion clinic in Missouri a four-year study showed that if you plowed your land and left it unplanted you would lose 105 tons of soil a year per acre by runoff . And if you planted your land to intertilled corn you would lose 67 tons . But put it to alfalfa and grass and you would lose but a fraction of a ton . If you effected an intelligent practical combination of corn , wheat , and clover in rotation , only 13 tons would be lost . In the South , between the autumn harvest and the spring sowing , land is usually left unplanted and the winter rains come and wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give humus and nitrogen to your soil and pasture to your cow . Or put your farm to a small grain or vetch , together with clover , and the matting roots will bind your soil tighter . When all is done the land needs phosphates . Plants starved for phosphorus can not grow strong root systems . Cattle eating them grow listless and torpid , fall easy victims to disease , give poor milk and meat . In the meat and bone of animals , in seed products , civilized agriculture removes the phosphorus from the soil , and man must replace it artificially . At Muscle Shoals the TVA has developed new processes for using low-grade ore which are revolutionizing costs . Triple superphosphate ( 45 per cent plant food , 55 per cent binder ) and metaphos ( 63 per cent food ) are fast becoming everyday talk on the tongue of the once " Elizabethan " valley farmer . " There can be no doubt , " the Authority reports , " that the value added to the national wealth by this process is many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete . " Now the principles of good farming and the urgent need of it in the Valley are well known to the Authority , to the agricultural experiment stations , and to the Department of Agriculture in Washington . But the farmer must know it too , and then practice it . Pamphlets ? He could have had tons of pamphlets , for years . What he needs is a demonstration . So a group of farmers in Boone County will meet with the county agricultural agent and perhaps representatives of the State land grant college , the United States Department of Agriculture , or the TVA . They will pick one of their group who will undertake to operate his farm to the best advantage . TVA will give him its metaphos ( or 3-superphosphate ) free , f.o.b. , and the county agent will help him along with guidance . Everybody , the skeptic and the sheep , is going to watch how his farm works out . If it is successful some will take over the new methods quickly , others more slowly . It is surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years . " An airplane trip from Chattanooga to Muscle Shoals will still show many fields marked by spreading gullies , but the curving lines of terraces are already so numerous that they appear to be the chief characteristic of all the unforested land . " Beyond the Valley , 26 States have watched the experiments and received TVA materials for laboratory tests and farm demonstrations . And in the Northwest , where Bonneville and Grand Coulee will shortly add a superabundance of power , the possibilities of using a good part of the supply for processing lowgrade phosphate ores look good . VI For the broader meaning of the TVA , however , one must look beyond the horizon . History may record the power aspect of TVA as a passing adjustment in the history of one vital industry , much as the dissolution of the Standard Oil Company represented a different if less successful type of adjustment in another important industry . It is rather as a new and so far successful technic not only for regulating the corporate leviathans of our economic life , but for complementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the authority type of public corporation must be examined . We have already considered the TVA as an agency for " regulation by protective competition . " But TVA finances touch the private capitalist in another vital spot , that of investment opportunities . In 1860 the wealth of the South exceeded that of the Northeast . Dating from the annihilative Gettysburgs and the torch marches of Sherman , however , the equity of the Southern people in their steel mills , their railroads , their mill villages , the A &; P 's , and the Standard Oil gas stations which serve them , and the mortgaged lands which feed them , has been virtually nil . What productive wealth there is has been collateral for Northern and alien investments . And today , figuratively , every cotton spinner and shirtmaker who moves his factory South to employ Southern " docile labor " leaves the deed to his property behind under a Yankee mattress or in a New York bank vault . The Southern people may not realize it yet , but the coming of the TVA marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South . The financial scheme by which TVA is effecting this economic revolution is fascinating to watch . The investment of TVA in high dams , power lines , etc. , by 1943 will come to 500 million dollars . The greater part of this money is borrowed by the Federal government from the northeastern section of the United States and receives a return of less than 3 per cent . In an analogous position the Electric Bond and Share or the Commonwealth and Southern would have earned on its actual investments returns of 10 , 15 , 20 per cent , and upward . Meanwhile let us see what happens in the South . In the fall of 1933 a number of farmers and small townspeople living in Alcorn County in Tennessee formed together an electric power association to buy and use TVA power . With money borrowed from the Rural Electrification Administration , the TVA built distribution lines and then arranged for their sale to these " little people " on credit . Against total plant and equipment costing $308,000 , there was a long-term debt in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the members of $66,000 ) . To offset this debt , furthermore , the association had a surplus of $107,000 and a depreciation reserve of $57,000 . For the year ending June 30 , 1937 , gross revenue came to $126,000 and after allowing for expenses , taxes , and interest there remained a net income of $41,000 . Out of these figures emerges a simple but compelling lesson : notwithstanding the low TVA rates charged to its members , these co-operatives are making enough " profits " to pay off their debt within ten years , leaving a structure owned free and clear of Northern capital by the farmers and townspeople of the South , themselves ) If TVA is not strangled by its enemies the historian of the South may come to count post-secession years as before- and after-TVA . The new South is potentially the boom area of the country . Its agricultural economy is giving way , industrialization is growing fast . In Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , and Tennessee two-thirds to five-sixths of the people in the 1930 census lived on farms or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South the largest city had but 260,000 people . Coming upon this changing scene at the initial stages of development , the TVA brings with it a new sort of planning and a new regionalism . If we are successful here , " Roosevelt has said , " we can march on , step by step , in a like development of other great national territorial units . " Already the Morgan-controlled Niagara Hudson Corporation foresees a possible unit by the shores of the St. Lawrence ; Electric Bond and Share wonders about the Mississippi Valley ; and in the West , Stone and Webster anticipates a Columbia River Authority . But these citadels of private enterprise see only electric power in the new regionalism . Their charters do not require them to understand that the TVA may take on its greatest significance as an effort in social adaptation , in organization for human dealings in a valley of 42,000 square miles and two and one-half million people . Their charters take no cognizance that people ? impoverished and lost in squalid living ? are remaking culture , learning a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and EPA are becoming familiar abbreviations in the Valley : the Meigs County Electric Membership Company , 521 members ; Pontotoc Electric Power Association , 1026 members ; and Alcorn County EPA , the largest of the co-operatives , with 2401 members . These are common people , they own these co-operatives , elect their own directors from among themselves , make profits , and themselves determine the disposition of the profits , whether to reduce the debt or to lower rates further . They own the business , they operate it , people you and I never heard of , people like the little candy-store man who sells your youngsters marshmallows and chewing gum , like the quiet farmer who owns forty acres over by the foot of the hill . TVA is only a beginning . But through co-operatively owned electric systems , electric iceboxes , strongly built concrete silos , and land-terracing machines , the farmers and townspeople of the Tennessee Valley are relearning the lessons of history , rewriting the social contract .               @ @ @ @ @ @
