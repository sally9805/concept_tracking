Arthur Krock , chief of the New York Times Washington bureau , last week thought he had a scoop . Saving it for an edition of the Times too late for other papers to copy , he broke the news that Franklin Roosevelt was " seriously considering , " if and when reelected , calling another world conference . Those to be invited : Britain 's Edward VIII , Russia 's Stalin , Italy 's Mussolini , Germany 's Hitler , France 's Lebrun , tiptop representatives Japan and China , " a few others . " Their object : to discuss Disarmament and Peace without any diplomatic folderol . <P> Next morning , newshawks of a hundred papers were clamoring at official doors for confirmation . Diplomats goggled , raised incredulous eyebrows , politely refused to let their caustic remarks be quoted . Secretary of State Hull , cornered in press conference , denied that he had ever even heard of such a thing . Aboard the President 's special train Secretary Wallace spoke for his chief : " The President authorized me to say there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort . " <P> Said Columnist Hugh S. Johnson : " Such a move would be in accord with the President 's high idealism but ... we could not possibly enter another of these colossal games of international strip poker without losing something . " Said Columnist Dorothy Thompson : " Some of the President 's weaknesses are again revealed : lack of realism and often faulty judgment ... a tendency to wishful thinking and a belief that saying something persuasively enough might make it so . " <P> Best guess of most observers was that Arthur Krock had not turned yellow journalist , that the President had indeed considered the idea , probably about once , perhaps in an expansive mood at a dinner party whence some little bird may have gone to whisper it in credulous Mr. Krock 's ear .
