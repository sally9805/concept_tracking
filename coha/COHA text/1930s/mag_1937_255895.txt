Angel Island ( by Bernie Angus ; produced by George Abbott ) lures a company of glinty-eyed weekenders to its shores with tales of buried treasure . Two murders are done , everybody suspects everybody else , while the audience keeps its eye on the shifty butler . Finally a character who might easily have been an innocent bystander is shot down as the culprit . A thriller with so pat a formula is usually expected to move posthaste off the Broadway boards , but with the guidance of respected Play-Picker George Francis Abbott , this one , blackouts , screams , rowdy humor and all , seems likely to remain for a time . <P> Play Wizard Abbott has had uncommon success in the last few years pulling rabbits out of shabby theatrical hats and then turning them into ermine . Angel Island is the first produced playwriting attempt of Mrs. Howard Angus , wife of a Manhattan advertising executive . She is a frequent writer of magazine thrillers , but her chief avocation is etching , which she studied under Joseph Pennell . Mrs. Angus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to write for magazines . She believed editors were more receptive to male manuscripts . Satisfied with Angel Island , pleased that Hollywood has bid $30,000 for it , Abbott is sending Mrs. Angus ' only other play , Brown Sugar ( formerly Home Sweet Harlem ) into rehearsal this week . <P> As proof that Producer Abbott 's sympathetic impulses are guided by a hard head or a hot hunch , Broadway wiseacres pointed to his phenomenal success with last season 's Room Service , which he sold to RKO Radio for $255,000 . Room Service was a washed-up play property when unknown Playwrights John Murray &; Allen Boretz brought it to Abbott . Sam Harris had tried it out in Philadelphia two years earlier with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer money . It was a $23,000 flop ; When the Harris option lapsed , Abbott looked at the script , felt warmly toward it because it was about Broadway , suggested a few changes . The authors condensed three scenes into one , picked a tag for it out of the second act , Abbott sent it on to wild acclaim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a play about youngsters written by youngsters ( John Monks Jr . &; Fred F. Finklehoffe , V. M. I. ' 32 ) . It had been returned by 31 other managements . The Abbott touch converted it into a Broadway hit , a $150,000 film property ( Warners ) . Producer Abbott prefers to pick his plays out of the grab bag , or help write them himself , as he did Broadway ( with Philip Dunning ) , Coquette ( with Ann Preston Bridgers ) , Three Men On A Horse ( with John Cecil Holm ) . He has produced plays by established authors , like the Bella &; Samuel Spewack Boy Meets Girl , but his experience with warranted materials has not always been pleasant . Last year he presented Sweet River , an adaptation of Uncle Tom 's Cabin . It flopped .
