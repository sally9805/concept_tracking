S there may be honor among thieves , there is possible a certain integrity among dictators . Mussolini has never hesitated to make his real objectives known to the world . We did not have to like them , but there they were to take or leave . The Soviet Government has never minced words , or spent sleepless nights worrying about the susceptibilities of others . It bluntly announces it will destroy religion , break the bourgeoisie , crush the kulaks , and then proceeds to do it . A new dictator has arisen who is not honest . I did not believe this until I visited Germany during the summer . Of course , I knew that Hitler was ruining the Jews and smashing liberalism , pacifism , and socialism , but I thought that within the framework of that program he was straightforward and sincere . Instead , I learned that he and his Nazi government are not honorable or trustworthy . I shall present here the evidence which led me to this conclusion . I found it first in Hitler 's instructions to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of " Mein Kampf , " he tells them quite plainly that in order to achieve power they are justified in deceiving the German people and employing every form of violence . They took him at his word and over a period of ten years let loose a stream of chicanery , intimidation , and political murder which has no parallel in modern history . This program , initiated and encouraged by the Nazi leaders , culminated in the burning of the Reichstag . The imprisonment of the accused Communists throws an interesting sidelight on Nazi ethics . For six months the government officially denied that Ernst Torgler and the other Communists were held in chains . Then on September 25 , in the crowded Leipzig courtroom , Torgler said , " For five months I have been chained night and day . " It is on the Jewish question that the Hitler Government has displayed its worst duplicity . It has repeatedly denied that Jews are beaten or killed and that Jewish business establishments are being boycotted or confiscated , and has at'empted to wash its hands of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the Nazi revolution . What are the facts ? The Nazi leaders are morally responsible for whatever violence their followers have committed against Jews . This is abundantly clear from such threats as these , which they publicly uttered in the periodimmediately preceding their seizure of the supreme power : Hitler : " If , at the beginning of and during the war , twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas , then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain . " ( " Mein Kampf . " ) " When we come into power , Jewish , Social Democrat , and Communist heads will roll in the dust . " ( Leipzig trial , September , 1930 . ) Rosenberg : " On every telegraph pole from Munich to Berlin , the head of a prominent Jew must be stuck . " ( " The Myth of the Twentieth Century . " ) Der 2Ingriff : " We need only act brutally enough . It will be necessary only for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When the first twenty are hanged , then the others of this great family will not want to see their brothers dangling . " ( November 16 , 1931 . ) Nazi Party Instruction : " The natural hostility of the peasant toward the Jews must be whipped into a frenzy . " ( Munich , March 15 , 1931 . ) If to these preelection promises be added Minister of Police Goring 's first official statement on the subject after the Nazis seized power , " I shall employ the police and without mercy wherever German people are hurt , but I refuse to turn the police into a guard for Jews , " can one wonder that an orgy of murder and pillage followed the Nazis ' rise to power ? After having given this incitement to violence as well as permission to carry it out , how thoroughly dishonorable is the government 's statement that it threw the Jews into concentration camps only to protect them from the wrath of the populace . I talked with hundreds of Jews during my visit to Germany last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single instance of spontaneous mass uprising against them . On each occasion the violence was committed by organized bands of Nazis , usually acting under orders . How much cleaner the Hitler Government would be if it said , " We promised to destroy the Jews , and we are doing it . " Instead , it issues denials , punishes Jews for spreading atrocity stories , expels honest correspondents , and continues to encourage the very violence and confiscation it is denying . Let me supply this evidence from my own observations in Germany during the month of August . I have deliberately selected these illustrations because , since they occurred in August , they are an effective answer to the official lie that such things were sporadic incidents in the early days of the revolution but have been completely eliminated since the government has the situation under control . The fact is that murder , beating , boycotting , confiscating go on as before . Only the technique is different . The Nazis have learned , apparently to their surprise , that the extermination of a minority is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . Therefore they have summoned all their trickery and effrontery to continue to crush the Jews and at the same time to pacify world opinion . The same things happen as before , but they are no longer evident on the surface . Jews are no longer murdered in their homes or beaten on the streets . Instead , some charge is trumped up against them , and they are carried off to concentration camps , where the Nazi storm troopers may not only punish them at will , but create the excuses for doing so . One of the saddest hours of my life was spent with an elderly Jewish mother in Munich . Just the week before I saw her , her son had been sent back from a concentration camp . He had been arrested for having been a Social Democrat , a pacifist , and a Jew . He was detained for several weeks , and then one day was returned  --  in a coffin . The official notice read , " Shot while attempting to escape . " The plain wooden box was carefully sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed for sanitary reasons , and if anyone opened it , he would be severely punished . The threat of Nazi punishment would be enough to deter any Jew in Germany , but not a frantic mother , to whom life was no longer worth living anyway . She did open the casket and found marks on her son 's throat showing that he had been choked to death . That was how he had been " shot while attempting to escape . " While I was in Berlin , a young friend of mine was released from prison . In the spring he had become attracted to a Christian girl , and she had fallen in love with him . Her father tried to break up the affair , but her devotion to my friend was so strong that she refused to listen . Then the father reported the matter to the storm troops . They arrested the Jewish youth , carried him off to a concentration camp , kept him there for six weeks under indescribable conditions , and then let him go , but not without administering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body a few days after . It was like raw , lacerated meat . He will probably never regain his health . And remember that his only crime was his attachment to a Christian girl . One night there was a children 's memorial meeting for Dr. Chaim Arlosorov , Zionist leader , who had been killed in Palestine . As the youngsters left the auditorium they were arrested by a large band of storm troopers . Then these boys and girls between the ages of ten and fifteen , who of course had committed no crime of any kind , were thrown in-to jail and kept over night in cells with common criminals . Such illustrations of actual violence could be multiplied by the hundred , perhaps by the thousand ; and still the gov-ernment denies that violence occurs . The only qualifying statement which a fair observer can make is that not all Jews have experienced violence . Perhaps 75 per cent of them have yet to be attacked by the Nazis . But the punish-ment of the other 25 per cent has been so terrible that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sadistic pleasure in inflicting pain , and that every German Jew must be uncertain when he goes to sleep at night whether he will awake unhurt in his own bed in the morning . The Hitler Government has repeatedly denied that it confiscates Jewish business establishments . It is probably true that there is no longer direct confiscation , but the equivalent of confiscation goes on every day . A Jew I have known for many years owned a small department store . Like most business men he owed money to the bank . The government , which now controls the banks , uses them as the instrument to force Jews out of business . It used this procedure in this case , and in return for the owner 's equity in the firm gave him a few marks , not even 1 per cent of its value . Sometimes confiscation takes other forms . The leading pharmaceutical supply house in Germany has been owned by a prominent Jewish family for almost a century . It was considered , I am told , the finest institution of its kind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Nazis came into power they ordered all the hospitals , clinics , and doctors to cease buying from this firm  --  with the inevitable result . During the summer these Jews were forced out of business without a penny . Another Jew owned two moving-picture houses in Berlin . The Nazi Government forbade him to import foreign films and also , because he was not an Aryan , refused to let him have any German films . He too was ruined . The German government has frequently reminded the foreign press that the boycott of April 1 has not been officially renewed . An effective boycott , however , is being carried on every day . In the small towns I have seen Nazi storm troopers standing at the entrance of Jewish shops , holding in their hands not guns but cameras . Any Gentile who dares to cross the threshold of those shops is photographed , and then his picture is displayed on the front page of the newspapers and on the motion-picture screens . Of course , no Gentile enters these shops . Until recently some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews , would find other ways of making purchases from them . One merchant told me that one of his loyal friends telephoned : " I have just passed your shop and I saw a tie in the window that I would like to buy , the blue one with white polka dots . Please put it in my post-office box and I will put the money in yours . " But even that became dangerous , and most persons have stopped purchasing from Jews altogether . In the large cities , where it ' is not so easy for the Nazis to control the population , a campaign against buying from Jews is constantly being waged in the radio , the press , and the cinema . Just to be sure that the public knows which shops are Jewish , the government , after careful examination , issues to non-Jewish firms large placards stating that theirs is a German business . Even Woolworth 's proudly displays such a sign . It is true that a few Jewish lawyers and doctors are permitted to continue to practice . But by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be represented in court by Jews . On the other hand , the Jew who must go to court knows that he has no chance whatever for justice if he is represented by one of his coreligionists , and is practically compelled to engage a Nazi lawyer . As to the doctors , I have before me the translation of a letter written by the A. E. G. ( the German General Electric Company ) to one of its employees who was ill . Although a Gentile , he , had continued to employ the same Jewish doctor who had successfully treated him in the past . The letter , which I saw in Berlin , read , " We expect you to employ an Aryan physician . Otherwise , we can not guarantee the payment of the benefits . " A young woman whom I engaged to do some secretarial work in Berlin showed me the letter she had received during the summer from the Jewish firm where she had been employed for many years . She was one of those secretaries with whom it is a joy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English dictation as swiftly and accurately as the most capable American stenographer . The letter she received read , " We are no longer able to employ you under the known circumstances . " The " known circumstances " were that a Nazi manager had been superimposed on the concern by the government . His first act was to order the dismissal of all Jews from its employ . The Jewish owner might have resisted the order , but he knew he was helpless . Besides , he hoped that if he complied with all official regulations he might be permitted to retain some interest in the business . But before I left Berlin in late August , he too had been forced out . The record of Nazi duplicity is not complete without reference to the Jewish denials of atrocities . In some cases I learned that these were prompted by Jewish self-interest . Many Jewish leaders felt it would be in the best interest of the Jewish community to minimize their own suffering and to avoid the impression of conspiring against Germany . In some other cases , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the atrocities which the lying Nazi newspapers reported as appearing in the foreign press , a horrible distortion which the Jews could honestly deny . The manner in which most of the denials were " volunteered " becomes quite clear from the experience of one of the finest Jews I know in Germany , the chief rabbi of a certain city . He was dragged from his bed in the early hours of the morning by an armed band of Nazis , who took him to the outskirts of the city and stood him against a wall . Then , with a dozen rifles pointed at his head , they handed him a prepared statement to sign . He read in it not only a denial of the atrocities but also an admission that he personally was responsible for spreading false reports of them . He is a brave man , this friend of mine , having served four years at the front , and he refused to sign these lies . There was a hurried consultation in which some cooler head probably pointed out the possible repercussion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , but not before giving him a terrible beating . I wondered , as I heard him tell his story , how many other Jews would have had courage and strength under similar circumstances to refuse to sign denials of atrocities which at that moment were being committed against them .
