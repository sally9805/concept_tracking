Assembled in Richmond , Va . last week for a five-day annual convention was the National Association of Credit Men , second biggest trade organization in the U. S. Its membership of 20,000 is exceeded only by that of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce . In unity of spirit , however , NACM has the edge on the Chamber because its members to a man are wrapped up in one subject : the payment of bills . " Pep and Song Periods " opened each general NACM session . Executive Manager Henry Herman Heimann , a tall , slender Michigander , keynoted broadly on " The Next 40 Years . " One day the credit men and their ladies went to nearby Williamsburg to view the wonders of Rockefeller restoration . There were special meetings for bankers , for credit women , for the fun-loving boosters of the " Royal Order of Zebras . " Politics played small part in the proceedings . Whether a Democrat or a Republican sits in the White House , bills must still be collected . <P> Only banks , wholesalers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide field unto itself . NACM facilitates the pooling of credit information . Every bank , every company that extends credit is constantly prying into the private affairs of its customers . They study balance sheets , earnings statements , profit &; loss accounts , weigh character , reputation , personal habits . But the final element in credit is " ledger experience , " the record of how bills were paid in the past . Local credit associations collect ledger experience from their members , pass it on to a national clearing house in the National Association . Between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 credit records are always on file for the use of members . <P> More spectacular , though less significant , than the routine of ledger experience is NACM 's fraud prevention bureau , which is entirely staffed with onetime G-men . Director Charles Joseph Scully headed the Department of Justice 's bomb squad in New York for years , helped bring about the deportation of Anarchist Emma Goldman . Director Scully is very proud of his rogue 's gallery of leading U. S. commercial racketeers . This type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seldom punished with jail sentences of more than three years . Typical commercial racketeers are the Brothers Minos and Pericles Ziongas , Greeks . Once they set themselves up in Newark . N. J. , as Euro-American Corp. , obtained credit with impressive but wholly fraudulent financial statements , proceeded to buy $100,000 worth of groceries . When the creditors finally went around to see why their bills were not paid , the only tangible asset they could find was a case of catchup . The rest of the goods had long since been sold , the proceeds pocketed by the Brothers Ziongas . Later it was learned that the Ziongas ring had similarly and simultaneously diverted another $75,000 worth of groceries through a dummy concern in Trenton N. J. <P> Sometimes commercial racketeers merely go into business under the name of a reputable company but using a slightly different address . If the manufacturer 's shipping department fails to note that difference , the racketeers get the goods , the reputable company the bills . This game can be played for only 30 days . Another racket is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nailed down .
