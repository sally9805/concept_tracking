In 14 minutes , without making a single amendment , the House last week passed a $499,857,936 supply bill for the War Department , including $50,000,000 for 565 of the planes called for in Franklin Roosevelt 's emergency rearmament program . <P> Mr. Roosevelt 's policy toward Europe was now definitely known to place the defensive frontier of democracy in France . Toward Asia , Mr. Roosevelt wanted to extend the U. S. defensive frontier to Guam , but the House had stopped him at Wake Island . Senators who disapprove of Mr. Roosevelt 's frontier extensions fell huffing &; puffing upon his air corps expansion as unjustifiable . <P> Idaho 's ursine Borah , still weak from flu , denounced the air bill as dictated by " bluff and jitterism . " His new junior colleague , pretty David Worth Clark , 36 , made a maiden speech telling the U. S. to mind its own business . Minnesota 's heavy Lundeen talked darkly of Presidential secrets which would " stun " and " shock " the country if revealed . California 's white-crowned Hiram Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chubby Bennett Clark all raised their voices in favor of what Massachusetts ' prosy Walsh called national " detachment . " <P> More embarrassing than Senate orations to Franklin Roosevelt was a proposal of twelve Senators with Wisconsin 's cherubic La Follette as their spokesman , who introduced a modification of 1937 's defeated war-referendum amendment to the Constitution which would effectively shackle the Administration with diplomatic handcuffs . <P> A year ago the Administration managed by only 21 votes in the House to beat the proposal by Indiana 's Louis Ludlow that the Constitution be altered to require , except in case the U. S. was invaded , a national referendum before Congress could declare war on a foreign power . As revised by the twelve Senators , the proposed amendment would take from Congress the power to declare war except in case of " attack by armed forces , actual or immediately threatened " upon U. S. territory or upon " any country in the Western Hemisphere " threatened by a non-American nation . <P> Said Spokesman La Follette : " Americans have not forgotten the steps that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks out in foreign lands . The Executive decides to help one side . The nation becomes involved in secret commitments and breaches of neutrality . Then there are ' episodes ' and excuses for taking sides further . . . . When it is too late to be neutral , Congress is asked to rubber stamp a declaration of war , and the people are lured by fancy slogans about fighting to end all war and save democracy . After the supreme sacrifice is made , democracy is destroyed and the peace settlement lays the groundwork for the next war . " <P> With a last puff the Senate passed the air bill , amended it to up total planes-5,500 to 6,000.
