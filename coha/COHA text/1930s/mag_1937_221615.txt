Ten years ago last week a slim unknown named Charles Augustus Lindbergh flew from New York to Paris and on into history . To publicize the Paris International Exposition this summer , French Air Minister Pierre Cot last year announced an air race for 3,000,000 francs ( $135,000 ) from New York to Paris on the tenth anniversary of Lindbergh 's flight no matter what the weather ( TIME , Sept. 7 ) . <P> Colonel Lindbergh had not been consulted . He was immediately distressed because he feared , along with many another , that the event might prove a parallel to the dismal Dole race across the Pacific from California to Hawaii ten years ago in which six planes were lost ( TIME , Aug. 22 , 1927 ) . Upon Lindbergh 's protest , Minister Cot limited the race to multi-motored planes with radios and extended the start to any time in August . But protests continued to fulminate in the U. S. , not only from such transatlantic experts as Dr. James Henry Kimball of the Weather Bureau , but from such authoritative groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Amy Johnson Mollison and Dick Merrill , entered the race . <P> Fortnight ago , when Merrill flew the Atlantic both ways ( TIME , May 17 &; 24 ) , Colonel John Monroe Johnson , Assistant Secretary of Commerce in charge of aeronautics , remarked that he disliked such " stunt flights . " Last week , three days before the anniversary of Lindbergh 's flight , Col. Johnson announced that the U. S. would not permit the anniversary race . Said he : " We are trying to encourage transatlantic flying , but we do n't want to jeopardize it . ... The Commerce Department is charged with the duty of safety in the air and this race is a highly hazardous undertaking . There will be no race . " <P> Amid the general chorus of approval there were several bitter notes . Snapped Amy Johnson Mollison , sailing from Manhattan where she had been training for the flight : " It is not a stunt flight , and I do n't agree with your Commerce Department ruling . They are very far behind the times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flying is not safe . " Minister Cot managed to remain gracious , denied that he would try to arrange a race to Paris from Buenos Aires or Canada . <P> Wrote Col. Lindbergh to his friend , Banker Thomas W. Lamont , who made the principal speech at a banquet in Manhattan on the anniversary : " I am embarrassed to think of you being asked to devote your time and energy to preparing a speech for the anniversary of my flight to Paris . I believe that the past should not be turned into an obligation for the future ; and ceremonies for celebrating past events almost invariably become an obligation for those taking part in them . <P> " I am in the strange , although not unique , position of being thoroughly opposed to the holding of a celebration which I feel is an exceptionally great honor . "
