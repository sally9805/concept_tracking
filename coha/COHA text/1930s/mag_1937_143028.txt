Q. ' ' Did you ever find out whether Fleishhacker murdered all that boatload of Chinamen ? " <P> A. " I was told he was interested in the business of bringing in Chinese which I was told was very profitable and that a man called Joey Harper . . . had been passing through Los Angeles and while he was there in one of the cheaper houses he had for a neighbor an oil man whom I had to contact . . . and he told the oil man . . . that he ... was smuggling in Chinese , that they had been caught up with ... by a U. S. cutter and had to sink the boat with the Chinese and that he afterward went to Mr. Fleishhacker and got a lot of money . ' ' <P> This extraordinary hearsay testimony was but one tidbit enlivening a civil suit which opened in San Francisco fortnight ago and which , because for their own reasons local newspapers did not care to mention it , was just coming to Californian ears last week . What interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant . <P> A big , heavy-jowled Jew of 64 , Herbert Fleishhacker made a small fortune in wood , paper and power mills , got into banking in 1907 by marrying the daughter of Sigmund Greenbaum , president of San Francisco 's London , Paris &; American Bank . Simon and Alexandre Lazard , Alsatian commission merchants who started Lazard Freres in San Francisco during the gold rush , in 1884 formed the London , Paris &; American Bank to handle their interests when the firm moved to New York and Paris . Young Fleishhacker rose speedily to the top , but not solely because he married the boss 's daughter . Banker Fleishhacker has a cold , keen brain perfectly adapted to his job . In 1932 , after various other mergers , the bank grew into the present Anglo California National Bank , fourth largest in California ( total assets : $239,500,000 ) , with Herbert Fleishhacker president , his quieter , older brother , Mortimer , chairman . Generally reputed to be heavy but highly successful investors , the Brothers Fleishhacker have interests in shipping , agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores , cement . <P> With a sense of humor befitting his heavy frame , Herbert Fleishhacker is today one of those unusual personalities who cause some travelers to describe San Francisco as the most cosmopolitan city in the U. S. His close cronies find amusement at his joy in a wager at golf , bridge , backgammon , dominoes , his even deeper desire to win at all of them . They have long since become accustomed to his practical jokes , are not surprised when he hands out explosive cigars , shaves during business conferences , becomes irrepressibly boisterous . And shrewd Mr. Fleishhacker now finds his name firmly imbedded in local projects . A supporter and campaign contributor of the late James ( " Sunny Jim " ) Rolph Jr . who became Governor of California , he was made head of San Francisco 's Park Commission , had named after him Fleishhacker Zoo , Fleishhacker Park , Fleishhacker Swimming Pool .
