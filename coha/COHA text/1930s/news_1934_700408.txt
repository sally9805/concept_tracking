txt The period of MARCO POLO , so delightfully recalled last week in the characters and costumes of the Beaux-Arts Ball , yields other incidents and customs of interest at the moment . One relates to the laying in of stocks of every kind of cereal in times of plenty against those of want  --  like the practice of JOSEPH in Egypt There was no burning of the harvests that were too plentiful . So it happened that when wheat in time of lack was sold for a certain amount for each measure , three measures were added . It was distributed by the Great Khan . It was done in this wise . The families in want presented to the relief authorities a paper stating how much they had received the previous year , as a basis for the estimate for the coming year . Cloth was woven for their need out of tithes on all wool , silk , hemp and other materials from which clothes are made , and all craftsmen were obliged to give the Great Kahn " a day 's work every week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one province through which MARCO POLO passed , much gold was found , but for the most part trade was carried on by using porcelain shells , which had a certain value based upon gold as a standard even in that remote time and region . In a certain other province " are born the precious stones called rubies " that are got in deep caves dug in the mountains . But there were rigorous restrictions as to digging , for if it were permitted indiscriminately " so many rubies would be extracted " that they would no longer be so costly " or valuable . " Yet it was not as if crops were plowed under , for the rubies still remained in the rocks . as did the sapphires and the " stone of which azure is made "  --  the finest and best in the world . In still another province was the Great Khan 's mint , so arranged that he may well be called " a perfect alchemist . " MARCO POLO straightway proved it in this fashion . Sheets are made from the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangular pieces of various sizes , each of which has the value of a certain coin , beginning with the least in size and value . They are then stamped and issued " with as much authority and " solemnity as if they were of pure gold or silver . " This money is made in such quantities that the Great Khan could pay with it " all the coin in the world . " When merchants come to trade in his province twelve wise men look at the things and appraise them " according to their consciences . " Furthermore , several times a year a proclamation is issued in the cities to the effect that whoever possesses precious stones , pearls , gold or silver is to bring them to the mint and " they are all paid in paper . " Thus , it is observed , the Great Khan has all the gold and silver and all the pearls and precious stones of all his lands . This will show you clearly , adds MARCO POLO , that the " Great Khan can do and spend much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this book . "
