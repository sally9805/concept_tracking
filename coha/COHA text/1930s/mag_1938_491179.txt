SO I WAITED outside the Custom House in New York while he went in to get the maps . So pretty soon I saw him coming down the steps . He had a bundle the size of a bale of hay . He looked at me and he grinned from ear to ear . ' No more road maps , ' he says . ' Charts ! ' " It was the wife of the Bezo speaking . The Bezo lay next to a thirty-eight-foot cabin boat , named the Tomboy , at the City Yacht Basin , in Miami , and we had just enraged the Tomboy for a cruise up the inland waterway to New York . The wife of the Bezo , a fishing-boat wife in sun tan and a huge straw hat and flowered pajamas , sympathized with us . She remembered how she and her husband bad brought their boat down by this route for the first time . She knew how it felt to have the existence of an inland waterway suddenly dawn upon one . Although we had just discovered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside passage of sorts along the coast . Spanish galleons used the sounds and rivers between the coastal islands of Georgia and St. Augustine ani  --  ealled this the Florida passage . In the 1840 's the earliest surveys were made to extend the passage into a continuous water route . It took forty years to start work . Other states , as well as private companies , dredged channels and opened vanals and cuts between inland streams . Recently the Government took over the whole hodgepodge , with the exceptiou of a hundred miles or so in New Jersey , sorted it , straightened it , re-marked it , redredged it , and here it is : The Intracoastal Waterway for light-draft vessels all the way from Boston to the Rio Grande , We did not own a light-draft vessel , we could not run one , and we certainly could not afford to charter a yacht for a cruise . But among the boats using the inland way , we learned , are the small cabin cruisers that hire out to sport fishermen in Florida during the winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these migrate regularly , heading north through March and April , turning south again from September on . In the beginning of the Stay-Thru-May Month in Miami we walked up the yacht pier to consult Dock-master Bauder about a possible boat that was northbound and might , in consequence , hire out to us at a price we could afford . Most of the boats had already left , but the Tomboy still wanted to go . She was the usual fishing boat . She had a cabin with an upper and lower bunk on each side , and a fixed table between . There was another hunk on deck for the skipper . She had a pulpit  --  the tiny harpoon deck from which sharks are speared  --  and she wore the outriggers to which sport fishermen attach their lines with clothespins , which we afterward used for the wash . Our skipper confided later that he had first to decide whether we were n't crazy . No one had ever thought of chartering a fishing boat fora cruise up the coastal way . Our blood began to run cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not do anything so plebeian as to hire a boat , no matter how low the price . We had to accept the fact that a boat might swill a gallon of gas to the mile and more , depending on the weather and its speed and if , or how often , it grounded . The skipper watched our faces as he showed us a sample of the charts we would have to buy  --  an enormous affair that all but covered the deck space . We collected bout . twenty of them before we were through and , just as Mrs. Bezo said , they made up into a package the size of a bale of hay . Seeing America Upside Down HOWEVER , next morning three toots of the boat rn horn meant " We 're going places , " two toots " We 're off . " So we were , Beth and I and Andy , the sheep dog , off in a little boat as the sun shone and a tropical shower fell simultaneously on Biscayne Bay . Off with a ham the skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring to pawn in case we went broke . Just like Columbus . We supposed we should travel through the same country that bounds roads and railroad tracks , and tie up every night near a tourist camp . We were never out of sight of land except for a minute or so in Chesapeake Bay . Every night but one we tied up to a pier . But we might have been seeing America upside down , for all it was any kind of land nne sees by car or train . The Lure of the Unfamiliar B ECAUSE settlements clung to waterways before ever there were roads , we entered a town at . the beginning of its history . Living in the boat off the wharves , we were absorbed in a water-front. life from which the towns had often moved miles away , closer to the more modern roads , a life that continued almost as isolated from the land routes as if it were on another map . Take Fort Pierce , Florida , where we stopped on the second night out . There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Our horizon was bounded by the refrigerating plant and the parking plant , through which we wandered at will because we were " off a bout , " and they gave us oranges ; by the dock where the Betty , from Baltimore , loaded oranges through the night ; by the coastguard cutter alongside ; and by the fishhouse far out on the pier , through which we had to go in order to get ashore . It sounds like a sordid environment in which to cook and eat and spend the night , until you try it and succumb to the rhythm of an unfamiliar and fascinating activity . Florida sun and air took care of the smell of fish . When we returned at dusk , the fishermen would be sitting among the nets that hung from the maze of pine bracing . They sat on piles of ash-colored net , or in front of long stretches of net , bare soles planted on the floor , huge toes sticking up , doing what looked like tatting . After dinner , floodlights played on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out to flash the lights on the water and beat it with their oars to drive the fish into the seines . Toward dawn , the day fishermen appeared . Sure we could come along , ma'am , and watch him catch our dinner , Late said  --  he was a little , dark , grinning Norwegian in the tornest pants I ever saw  --  and at three o'clock in the morning he thumped on the dock to wake us up . . That had become a not-impossible rising hour to us , an effect of the cruise we had n't bargained for . We began with an ultimatum to the skipper , on hearing that boatmen rise with the first streak of light , gobble breakfast at the wheel and set out . It was necessary , the skipper explained , in order to catch tides . We inquired blankly , what did we want to catch tides for ? What would we do with a tide if we caught one ? Put it in a zoo ? The skipper did not argue . He waited for time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cryptic note in my log : " Beth up at five this morning . To see the sunrise , she says . " We grew used to waking in the dark , to putting the coffee on as a returning fisherman slipped by the galley window , a shadow on black-glass water , or later on , in Georgia , to rocking gently in the swell of a returning shrimp boat while we left the bacon to burn and ran to watch the men shovel out her load , and the black foreman rouse the town , and the colored women , each carrying her pan of fried spuds in newspaper , swarm in to shuck ' ern . Sometimes they sang as we ate breakfast . Sometimes they had a rare old fight in the wire pens on the dock . We grew used to swallowing coffee boiling hot as the sky lightened and we left the still-sleeping land and the ever-living water front behind us . Moving at the rate of eight knots , each bit of shore clung to us for a long time until we had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida only a thin line of sand , white as snow , separated us from the sea . There would be miles of mangrove swamp , and then a whistle from the skipper , and a big hotel , a club , a great house would be washed into the landscape , its windows boarded with pastel-blue boards . Our own ch  --  teau coup try lies along the waterways from Florida through South Carolina  --  enormous hunting-preserve , island estates among century-old forts and the ruins of Colonial plantations  --  and we scarcely realize it .. In the Deserted Lap of Luxury QOUTHE RN Florida was spelll round because it . kj was out of season . The second day out we stopped at the Hobe Sound Yacht Club to hunt for a store . There were no stores . There was a collection of beautiful white buildings , velvet lawns , palms , hibiscus , yellow violets in the grass  --  and not a soul in sight . The water looked clean . We bathed off the pier in the lap of other people 's deserted luxury and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked that the skipper could let us spell him at the wheel . You had to keep the boat between the buoys , that was all . Their numbers , corresponding to the numbers on the charts , showed us , at any moment , exactly where we were , After the trance of Hobe Sound came the storybook Indian River that might have , and probably has , posed for all those pictures of blue water under coconut trees . The river runs through famous orange and grapefruit raising country . Along the drive where the old settlers built their houses , each with its fireplace of coquina rock , there are new estates and windbreaks for the groves and , beyond , the slick green leaves of citrus trees . Buck Sawyer , its ambassador extraordinary , assured us that there were five kinds of transportation available now . But the picturesque ramps extending far out in the water are reminders of the days when there was only one kind . Every house used to have its private dock , as every house now has its garage . Flat-bottomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river just as familiarly as the cars now whiz up and down the new roads . ; Continued on Parr 45 ) The skipper 's whistle meant " Look ! " Beth swung down from the root of the cabin , where she took her sun bath . I left off trolling for the weeds I always caught , or poring over the Inside Route Pilot. , the most fascinating book I have ever encountered , equally comprehensible to me when read backward , forward or upside down . " Old Fort Matanzas , " said the skipper , with a jerk of the chin . We saw a blind square of rock standing among the marshes to command the Matanzas , or river of blood . Here , in the sixteenth century , the founder of St. Augustine slaughtered Ribault 's army . A radio tower and a beacon soared from yesterday to today . A power boat came alongside . A wiry net was strung to dry between the rigging and a wooden crossbar , It towed a little white house . The dishpan and the broom hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the front door . " Shrimp boat , " said the skipper . It passed us , waving , the Ocean-blue . St. Augustine hugs the bay , as the old ports did . From our vantage point under the Bridge of Lions , which connects the city with the island beach , it was possible to imagine the town the Spaniards had built and ruled . We rose that Sunday to the sound of cathedral bells . The oldest parish in America began at our pier . We took Andy for walks along the sea wall , in the still streets of the old quarter , past the ancient house an St. Francis Street decorated with the four flags under which it has survived . To shop we crossed the sea wall and went by the slave market . The stores were not always so convenient . Our first question as we scrambled up on the dock was " Where 's the nearest grocery ? " Occasionally it would be a mile away . If we did not feel like walking we used the nearest telephone . We started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and carried one emergency meal in cans . We used that meal just once , too , when we had forgotten it would be Sunday . Sundays and holidays and landlubbing events in general are hard to keep track of on a boat . Somewhere in Georgia , we caught ourselves saying stupidly , " What coronation ? " and in Maryland , " Is this Decoration Day ? " The Service DeLuxe Route Meanwhile , the skipper checked the gas and ice and water . We heard that we would have to use sulphur water in Georgia and South Carolina , but it was n't so . At gas docks and at public docks and city basins we could get water free , or included in the half a dozen wharfage charges , ranging from a cent a foot to a dollar a , night , which were all we had to pay during the entire trip . " Who cooks ? " demanded the skipper before he would sign any agreement , for a cook is almost as important to a boat as charts . The beaten track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I did . He gave me a jaundiced look . " And what will you feed me ? " ho insisted . " Steaks , " I said valiantly . " Chops . Roasts . " That happened to be the right answer . There is something about a boat that brings out the primitive meat-eater in one . I could fry crisp bacon in my sleep . The Tomboy had a galley that made other boat cooks writhe with envy . Two persons could occupy it at the same time . There was not only a sink with running water via a hand pump  --  running water in the bathroom , too  --  but we had . bottled gas to cook with and an oven , instead of two-burner gasoline or kerosene contrivances . The real joy of housekeeping , however , fell to Beth as the washer-upper . You could throw the garbage out the port any old time ! Inhibited city gals that we were , who had never even thrown a banana peel out the window , though we had often wished to , we hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the swankier basins , where you steal out on deck under cover of night and set the paper bags afloat . This phase passed . The resulting habit of casting pea shells and strawberry hulls to the four winds will get us into trouble with the police yet . Florida is more hospitable to pleasure boats than any of the eight states through which we passed . So many of its towns maintain basins . The docks are newer and cleaner than elsewhere and some have floats . The St. Augustine basin was luxurious with floats and a dockmaster who would have fetched our mail for us if we had known enough to write ahead . The extent . and variety of the services at our disposal , public and private , kept us learning . The inland route itself was one vast , toll-free service supervised by the United States Engineers . We constantly met its dredges  --  those huge , red-leaded machine shops on the water  --  making the way smooth for us . Did we lose our way getting into a town ? The skipper hailed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front porch , his boat neatly tied up under the eaves , called back directions . Did we need a weather report ? We could call a weather bureau , or an airport , or stop at a Coast Guard station . General Delivery took care of our mail . Any store would bring food down to the boat and give us a lift back on the delivery truck into the bargain . Ice wagons took us to town . Hotels and Y. W. C. A. 's co-operated with us in a system we invented , known as taking a hot bath on a boat , by which we used to descend on them and hire tubs at fifty cents a head . Laundries washed and ironed our one best dress apiece while we waited . At the larger basins , in St. Augustine , in Charleston , in Elizabeth City , we watched the self-contained life of another kind of water front  --  threedecker yachts being groomed for the trip north ; luncheon parties on deck ; people in evening dress strolling home between the gangplanks and sleek fenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boats on the streets of water . In Elizabeth City there was a board at the end of each pier , with the names of the visiting boats neatly inserted . In Norfolk , at the new city basin , they tell us that there are actually showers . That would be the place where we stopped at the nearest coalyard ! Never had we so appreciated the fun and ease of being a tourist in our own country among a good-natured , unsuspicious and generous people . Nor do we intend to take any further backchat about the superb courtesy of the European villager . " You all hurry back , " they said in North Carolina and warmed the cockles of our heart . The market fishermen who took us along to wateh them seine , or shrimp , or tend the pound nets , invariably gave us a generous part of the best of the catch  --  pompano , shrimp , rockfish  --  for dinner , and cleaned it for us too . In Fleeton , on Chesapeake Bay , a man on the dock drove two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we grounded just short of the Wildwood , New Jersey , docks , they said , " We 'll get you in , lady , no charge , " and a. fisherman brought me to the pier in his dory and another brought me back in a life raft . The boat helped , of course . A boat has a hold on the imagination of most people . In small towns they used to run excursions to us . A boat . is responsible too . It has a name as distinctive and hard to change as that of a human being . It cannot. skip merrily over a state line , or lose itself for very long . The only drawback was the flattering assumption that anything with a cabin and a coat of paint must be a yacht and anyone who travels by yacht must have lots of money . The skipper warned us , " Wait till you get to Georgia and eleven-foot tides . " It is true that Georgia could n't duplicate the informality and the holiday air of Florida . Still , the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no sooner started down the road to town when a citizen hailed us , " Are you off the yacht ? " " Cabin cruiser , " we corrected promptly . " What 's there to see here ? " He gave us a lift . to town and told us . The islands off the Georgia coast from St. Marys to Savannah appear on sixteenth-century maps as the Guale  --  Wally  --  Islands , after an Indian tribal name . The ancient Florida passage runs between them and the mainland , and a good deal of early history and legend centers about them , but all except St. Simons are now private estates . On the ocean side of St. Simons , Sea . Island has a princely hotel development , paved streets and pretty suburban houses . A small resort town Lies on the Sound , We were tied up on the river side , however , in a solitude thick with the romantic ghosts of antebellum plantations and bygone lumber camps . The timbers for Old Ironsides were cut from St. Simons ' live oaks and shipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the red Frederica , we cruised past the last bit of Oglethorpe 's fort low on the water where he founded the town of Frederica , and John Wesley preached . Nothing is here now but a house or two , an orphanage , a church of the sweet-smelling native pine and its churchyard in which the great plantation families  --  Kings , of King 's Retreat , now the hotel golf course , Coopers , Buzzards , Wyilys , Hamiltons , Butlers  --  are buried . Where Simple Pleasures Rule The descendants of the slaves of the island families live in their own tiny settlements , in cabins with bright blue doors to keep out evil spirits . They use the slave burying grounds and sing the shouts and chanteys that the , slaves sang as they picked cotton , or loaded logs , or rowed their masters in dugouts to visit among the river plantations . Mrs. Maxfield Parrish , who came to live here twenty years ago , has built a pine cabin for them near her house . At intervals they stage a shout here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Five torches burned in front of the cabin for footlights and a fatwood fu-e smoked behind our bench . A new moon was out and many stars . Negro women in white aprons , salmon-pink handkerchiefs tied about their hair , sat on a bench against the cabin . A rope was tied to the great live oak tree , As each man came off the road , he grabbed the end of the rope and joined right in . Some wore jeans , some white shirts , one or two store suits , but all had red kerchiefs knotted about their necks and all wore hats or caps . It was a. lumbering song . " Six men hauled a log , " explained Ben , " and we all sing something to make it easy , to make it lively . " They began : " Ragged Lily , like a jailbird  --  shove , boys , shove that lumber , ho ! In the winter  --  hohard time  --  I can not support you . In the summer " ? it seemed to get better in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices , but , no ? " in the summer , I can not support you . " The wind sprang up . It was cold . " Now , " said Mrs. Parrish , " you 're going to see a shout .. " We went into the cabin . The walls were papered with old newsprint , so worn it looked like plaster by candlelight and torchlight . The colored people grouped themselves around a brick fireplace , men opposite women . The smell of candles and oleanders mingled fragrantly . We sat on benches in a square around the singers . A colored man in gray trousers , tan shoes , black coat , red kerchief , came ( Continued on Page 48 ) f Co n t1 n ts ad from Pore- 45 ) into the open . The others circled around , shuffling and strutting as they chose . A lithe black girl piped up , " Adam , where 's Eve ? " The women followed her , dancing opposite the men . She was in a black skirt and blouse and a white apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she circled . " Oh , Adam , where 's Eve ? " She stooped , lifting her apron and working her hand as if she were picking leaves , " Down in the garden , pinning leaves " ? she stooped lower , scooping up leaves and pinning them together with her hands . The slaves amused themselves in this way by acting out stories , or by imitating animals . In the Buzzard 's Lope , the woman pretends to be a buzzard , and the man a body to be eaten . In Down in the Mire , the singers sink " lowrer and lowrer , " then they rise , " highrer and highrer . " Mrs. Parrish asked an old man with a chew of tobacco in him for a song . He started a hymn . " No , I do n't want hymns . I want what Ben calls the ' ancients . ' " " That 's ancient , ma'am , " he argued . Finally he spat out . the window and broke into " Moonlight , starlight . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will spring on you , " marveled Mrs. Parrish . " I never heard that one before . " The leader ended very snappily , heading a procession . " Good-by , everybody . Pass bread and wine to the members . Good-by , everybody . " We returned to the Tomboy to find that the skipper meant what he said about eleven-foot tides . The boat lay so far below the level of the dock that we bad to peer over the edge to see her . Eventually we became expert at dropping a couple of miles at low tide to the cabin roof , inching along the side while we clutched the top rail and ending with a bump through the deck window , but I never did learn to climb backward down on . of those iron dock ladders without a whimper . Through the Quaint Land Before the Government . took over , the waterway through the Carolinas included one long outside stretch and a trip through une or more of the stormy North Carolina sounds . It is all inside now , with only a taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razorbacks rooting at the water 's edge and the cypress swamps screening abandoned rice fields , the wild , quaint country along the Waccamaw and beyond the high walls of the new cuts could have been lifted from a foreign landscape . Cabins on the muck land . Fish nets hung to dry . Lines of stakes for the pound nets . Barges loading shell from mounds by an oyster plant . At Buckeport , named after the Buck of Bucksport , Maine , who owned an immense acreage here and sent his schooners down the river to Georgetown and up the coast to his New England shipyards , a man wheeled his little granddaughter down to see the boat and told us about the deer and wild turkey " back yondah in the woods . " We had passed a spot where he went . down occasionally to feed the wild duck for the owner of the preserve . It took a thousand bushels of corn , and they were so thick one could fire a single shot into the flock at random and get a dozen head of duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bear it and got up in the stern and fished . We bought home-cured , hickory-smoked ham in the general store . No one had told us how salt it was , though , and that night we ate scrambled eggs and the eternal bacon . Some of the channels here had beers cut through very recently . There were few places to tie up and the Inside Route Pilot , guide to the waterway , had n't quite caught up with them . We used to plan what pier we would be able to reach before sunset . After dinner . which we ate together on the fixed table in the cabin  --  the skipper took his breakfast and lunch at the wheel  --  we got out the calipers and draped the charts over the bunks and measured and argued till bedtime . We argued over docks , On the charts they looked possible , but when you got to them they were improbable . Once , at sunset , we reached a place the road map called Sneads Ferry , saw a pier , saw small boats tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single human being . Whenever the skipper tried to get in to the dock he barely missed hitting a sand bar . At last we had to anchor in the middle of the channel , where we had no business to be , and with a dog who clamored to he let out and without a dinghy , Then the skipper gave us a lesson in resourcefulness . It got dark . Andy paced and panted , panted and paced . Suddenly we heard a voice in the night . It was the skipper on the cabin roof actually seeing a man about a dug . His ears had caught the faint splash of a dory . The fisherman agreed to take Andy two miles to shore for half a dollar and rowed away over the ghostly water pursued by our shrieks of inhuman glee . " A fine place , " said the skipper , turning on us indignantly , " a fine place you picked to bring a. dog ! " The long-suffering man now prepared to navigate Chesapeake Bay . It is one hundred and seventy nautical miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River at the head , ten miles wide and more , in places , and is considered the worst part of the passage . My selection would be the choppy waters and shoals of Delaware Bay , but , as the skipper pointed out , it 's shorter . He said darkly , " I took the worst beating of my life on Chesapeake . Four hours . Anchor ! I could n't even turn the bout around ! " He bought a barometer  --  which would n't budge from Fair and had to be returned . He bought a tide table  --  which disappeared and never showed up till the last day of the voyage . He bustled in , demanding , " Anything loose in the galley ? Those big ships make a terrible swell . It 'll be rough . " So it was , for about half an hour leaving Norfolk . Then Chesapeake Bay lay down like a good dog and stayed that way , while we felt very nautical because the skipper was steering by compass and for hours there would be no land on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was real traffic now : Freighters and oil tankers ; yachts beautiful as race horses ; a fleet of the flat-bottomed , shallow-draft two-masters called Chesapeake bugeyes cutting across our bow . Something new to watch out for was the fish-trap areas . They extend for miles offshore  --  a line of stakes leading to a circle of stakes with net pulled high on them , a bit of brush , a board with name and address , and a lantern that must be lit at night , marking each man 's possession . Hard.Luck Billyboy We began to meet fellow voyagers up from Florida . Our contacts had been limited mostly to waves in passing and secondhand accounts , via the skipper , of stranded ships and engine trouble . Getting stranded seems to be a commonplace along the waterway . Money tends to go fast on a boat , and sometimes the owner who has ordered it brought up tends to turn a deaf ear to frantic wires . In Nol-folk , in a basin behind a coal-yard , we made the acquaintance of the Cucaraeha . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a windstorm plus thunder and lightning . Peering thankfully out of the streaming deck windows of the Tomboy , we watched her struggle in , The man wore a pair of dripping shorts and a wide grin . A woman , also dripping and smiling , was hunched in the hatchway . " Have a bad time ? " we called sympathetically . Well , " she admitted , " it has n't been too pleasant . " Next day we hurtled through space between dock and boat to pay a , neighborly call on the Cucaracha , and in the evening the Cuearattha came to our first dinner party in the cabin , which would hold five easily , though the thinner the five , the better . The yawl had come from Fort Myers on fifty dollars ' worth of canned goods and eleven dollars ' worth of fuel oil . However , her fourteen-hundred-dollar engine had piled up a hundred and fifty dollars in repairs . She had been towed back to St. Augustine , and towed back to Charleston after lying at anchor a day and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they anchored in six feet of water on one side and eight on the other , only to be roused in the night by the merry crash of eggs and to find themselves , due to wind and tide , lying in eighteen feet of water on one side and none at all on the other , To cap the climax , teredo worms started to eat the bout . But the Cucaracha was living up to her name . She would n't say die . The last we saw of her he was ocean bound , to sail , night and day , to New York . The little cruiser , Bdlyboy , had an equally harrowing tale . It had passed us , calling blithely , in Carolina . As we entered the canal at Chesapeake City , there was the Billyboy in subdued mood . " We spent a week in dry dock , " explained the Billyboy sadly . It had picked up a calico dress and got it twisted tight around the propeller , its mate had had hot lead poured on his foot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its cooking gas had run out . Said Mrs. Billyboy : " Call me superstitious , if you like , but you should never give a boat a boy 's name . A woman 's name , or the name of an article , but never a boy 's name ! " Tied to the bulkhead in Delaware City , the Billyboy serenaded us and Main Street with guitar , violin and song , while we waited for the fog to lift . Everything in Delaware City was right across the road . It was but a step from boat . to beer . The grocer ambled across the road and dropped over the bulkhead strawberries the size of my palm and asparagus from his own truck farm . We had n't tasted such food since leaving Florida . At night soldiers from Fort du Pont leaned over the bulkhead and studied the two old tires among the luggage of the Billyboy . " What they carrying tires for ? " " That 's in case they have a flat . " All at once a whole crowd of boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami ? We 're just going there by the inland route . Is there anything we should watch out for ? " " Mosquitoes , " said the skipper . " Sand flies , " said the Billyboy . Their sailboat had come down from Philadelphia carrying , for power , an outboard motorin a dinghy . She skipped away the next morning , the little kicker alongside tugging her through the canal . We held a reunion at Cape May  --  the Tomboy and four other boats from Miami . None of them accompanied us , however . The attitude of most boats toward the New Jersey Inland Waterway is to skip it and save thirty miles by going outside . A vessel of over four-foot draft should n't attempt this route , anyhow ; even with the Tomboy 's three-and-ahalf-foot draft , the skipper could only keep his fingers crossed in spots , lest she draw button ' . Proud Home-Coming It was a new experience to have children playing about the boat like dolphins as we cruised through the entire ten-mile backdoor length of Atlantic City , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors and the ends of streets and clotheslines , through the very railroad yards and at last between miles of marsh on one side and on the other the hazy houses and skyscraper hotels of the beach . Then for forty miles and four hours , from Manasquan to Sheepshead Bay , nothing separated us from the Atlantic . Except for a few miles around Cape May , this is the only portion of the voyage whore a small boat must go outside . The Jersey coast faded to the smudge of Navesink Highlands and the pencil stroke of Sandy Hook . Our first big steamer sailed into Ambrose Channel while we rocked way below in her wash and craned our necks tip at her stern . She was no Queen Mary , but she felt like it to us . We passed the bright red lightship with the winking eye in the rigging and picked our way through a slough of driftwood that made us hold our breaths . Pollution of the harbors takes on special meaning when you have to pray that a piece of ( Continued on Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hit the propeller . " That 's nothing , " said the skipper . " I 've seen this bay when it looked like a logging camp and a feller had to get his boat through .... " There 's sky line , " called the skipper . It was a tank on Coney Island . The Tomboy slipped past the long breakwater at , Breezy Point and the rowboats stared admiringly at her mahogany side . From Miami , Florida , had come , some fourteen hundred miles away . A boat . like ours could have made the trip in two weeks if it had been in a hurry . We had taken five . Beth 's engagement ring was intact . We traded nine dollars ' worth of leftover gas with the skipper for a repair bill . We traded the charts for the laundry . And our accounts stood like this : $300 for the boat ; $200 gross for 1000 gallons of gas and a ease and a quarter of oil  --  including $15 due in gas-tax refunds ? $100 for food , ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 for sightseeing and everything else from charts to wharfage charges ; $150 for train fare and expenses in Miami . Our five weeks ' private cruise had cost us $425 apiece , or the price of a very modest trip to Europe . They danced once again after that before he took her home . The Hawaiians were playing something lovely . " Song of the Islands , " Harvey said it was . He had been to Honolulu a year or so before . Maybe some day , Cecelia thought , she 'd go there with him . She could see herself in a scanty white swimming suit , lying on the sand close to  --  very close to  --  a tall bronzed Harvey . They 'd both be bronzed . There 'd be palm trees waving overhead and a peacock-blue ocean inviting them in  --  together . " Your mind 's not on your work , my sweet , " said Harvey at that moment . She had missed a step . Cecelia said : " Sorry . It seems you 've been too much for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . She had been kissed before , of course . This was not , so far , very different . Against his will he was still thinking of Jenny . Cecelia could tell . She told herself with her own peculiar kind of courage : " He 'll forget . " XXIX ON THURSDAY , which was the day following Harvey 's visit , Stephen told the Old Man he 'd like to get away for a few days . The Old Man looked at him for a reflective and withdrawn moment , then said abruptly : " Gosh , I do n't blame you . " Without Dan , the office had required a certain amount of adjustment . The Old Man had considered promoting their chief clerk and decided against it . " I think you and mo can handle the whole works , Stephen . So far as I 'm concerned , Dan was n't indispensable . You are . " Dan 's going had left the Old Man unquestionably dependent upon Stephen . " Thank the Lord you 're here , " he said more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , Stephen , in just your plain horse sense . Your sense of values . " Stephen smiled dryly . He knew the Old Man was smart . But ho knew , too , that he meant what he was saying now , and more than he was saying . He was telling Stephen that he needed him badly . The Old Man knew everything , of course . Stephen was quite certain that Isabel had gone to her father at once . But where personal matters were concerned the Old Man respected Stephen 's silence , and Stephen was grateful for that . " Go along ; get yourself a little change , " said the Old Man . " Does anybody good once in u while . " When it came to telling Isabel , Stephen got it over with as briefly as possible . " I 'm going out of town for a day or so . " " New York ? " said Isabel . She had to say it . She could n't help herself . He could see that . " Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her struggling with herself not to ask further , to smile , to be casual . " Well , Stephen , if you 're going away , had n't we better decide , before you go , about the house ? My option expires very soon . " Stephen said : " That 's your own affair . " He left her standing , looking after him with despair in her eyes . Thursday night he went up to New York . He found Lissa in the midst of packing , suitcases open on the couch in the sitting room , elothes arriving from the cleaner 's , the telephone ringing incessantly . She looked tired and worried . " Stephen , my darling , I hate to have you see me looking like this , but I 've had the most hellish day . I worked until six . I had a chance at a syndicate article on what to do about girls who break up happily married women 's homes . Honestly . My tongue and cheek are both worn to the bone . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning . " I could use the money , " said Lissa . She went on putting pale-colored lacy underthings into one of the bags , folding dresses and skirts and sweaters into another . " Get yourself a drink , Stephen . You know where everything is . " " Ca n't I help you ? " said Stephen . " The drink can wait . " She sat down on the couch , pushed back her soft disheveled dark hair from her pale face and laughed at him . " You are so sweet . I have a feeling you ca n't even pack for yourself . " True , he could n't . Isabel always did it for him . Perhaps Lissa realized that as she spoke . Anyhow , Isabel might as well have been there in the room with them . USSR got up and went wearily back to her task . " I 'll be through presently , but I sha n't let you stay long . We ought to get a fairly early start tomorrow . I 'm really pretty well all in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I 'll go right now if you say so . " She came over to him and took his face between her smooth palms and kissed him . " No , Stephen , not yet . It rests me just to be in the same room with you . " " Why do you have to take all those clothes ? " Stephen asked her a little later . She was packing a couple of evening gowns . " How long are you going to stay down there anyhow ? "
