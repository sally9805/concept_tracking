Behind the Zebra House at the Washington , D. C. Zoo last week , laborers , dug a number of large holes . Then , sombrely , they carted into them , piece by piece , some 8,500 pounds of elephant flesh . Thus to her last resting place went Babe , described in the eulogistic Washington press as not only the oldest , but the most celebrated elephant on earth . <P> No elephant since Phineas Taylor Barnum 's Jumbo has had a legitimate claim to the distinction of being more famous than all others of the species . And no world-wide tabulation is kept of ages of elephants , which live to be about 120 . But Babe , aged more than 100 , may well have been the oldest in captivity . And as for fame , certain it is that she trouped with Jumbo , worked for and outlived Showman Barnum , the Ringlings , and generations of circusgoers . <P> Babe was captured in India at the age of ten or eleven . She was transported to the London Zoo where she remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors for $10,000 . With his circus , she performed all over the U. S. and Europe . In later years , when she went with Ringling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey Combined Shows , millions gawked at her and fed her peanuts . Always leader of the parade , Babe was the unquestioned monarch of the elephant picket line . But three years ago General Director William M. Mann of the National Zoological Park persuaded the Ringlings to retire Babe to his pachyderm house . Besides plain old age , she was afflicted with an ingrown toenail , bad teeth . Even so she became the prize exhibit of the Washington Zoo . Younger , stronger elephants soon discovered she had brought her ruling manner with her . Her stanchest admirers were the President 's grandchildren , Sistie and Buzzie Dall . <P> Gradually her strength was ebbing , and for nine years Babe had not been off her stiff old legs , because she realized that if she lay down , she would never rise again . Last week , ambling from her cage into the yard , Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise no more .
