txt Bruno Richard Hauptmann was ' indicted by the Bronx County Grand Jury yesterday on the charge of extorting $50,000 ransom money from Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh after the kidnapping and murder of the aviator 's infant son two and one-half years ago . Hauptmann will be arraigned this morning in the Bronx County Court , where he will plead not guilty to the indictment . The authorities plan to rush him to trial two weeks from Monday . The indictment followed the appearance of Colonel Lindbergh as a witness against Hauptmann before the grand jury . Colonel Lindbergh drove to New York from his home at Englewood , N. J. , with Colonel H. Norman Schwarzkopf , Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police . Protected against crowds by 200 mounted and foot police at the Bronx County Court House , Colonel Lindbergh testified to the kidnapping of his child on the night of March 1 , 1932 , from his home at Hopewell , N. J. , the payment of the ransom on the night of April 2 , 1932 , and the subsequent discovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After completing the State 's case against the prisoner , Colonel Lindbergh went about his private affairs . He did not confront the prisoner at any time . More Ransom Bills Found . Policemen searching Hauptmann 's apartment and garage at 1,279 East 222d Street , the Bronx , found $840 more of the Lindbergh ransom money in $10 gold certificates and a loaded .25-calibre German automatic pistol in five secret compartments in the garage wall . This made $14,590 of the ransom money recovered in the garage , as $13,750 was found there last Thursday morning , the day after Hautrnann ' s arrest . Hauptmann admitted to District Attorney Samuel J. Foley of the Bronx that he had hidden the money found yesterday , as well as that previously discovered . He gave the same explanation for the $840 as he had given for the $13,750 -- that it had been left with him by his friend , Isidor Fisch , the furrier who went to Germany last December and died of tuberculosis in Leipzig last March . Although he said that he now knows all the money was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hauptmann continued to maintain that he Vas innocent of any connection with the kidnapping , murder or extortion , and that he received the money in entire good faith , not even knowing until recently that the package left by Fisch contained money . Got Pistol From a " Friend . " Hauptmann explained that he got the pistol a long time ago from a " friend " whom he would not name , according to the authorities . He explained that he had hidden it because he had no permit . The secret compartment where the $840 and the pistol were found consisted of six small holes bored and chiseled in the edge of a rafter . This had been nailed into the wall of the garage , so that the holes were on the inside . Rolls of bills were tucked into five of the holes and the loaded pistol was fitted into the sixth . The weapon , a small and short automatic , can be held in the palm of the hand . It was recalled that Dr. John F. Condon ( Jafsie ) , who paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mysterious " John " to whom he gave the money kept one hand in his pocket as if it contained a pistol . In Trenton , N. J. , last night , Dr. Charles H. Mitchell , county physician of Mercer County , where the child 's body was found , said that a small bullet could have made the abnormal opening found behind the baby 's right ear , and could have caused the fracture of the skull disclosed by his autopsy . No bullet was ever found , and the head wounds have always been a mystery . The condition of the body when found Was such that it could not be determined whether there had been powder burns . Some have held the theory that the child 's skull was fractured In a fall from the kidnapper 's ladder , on which a rung was broken , New Jersey officials disclosed for the first time that they have three witnesses who have tentatively placed Hauptmann in Hopewell the day of the kidnapping . One of these witnesses is Mrs. Michael Szibla of Trenton. a former employe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus near the club grounds on the morning of March 1 , 1932 , she says , she saw a man in a checkered lumber jacket and gray breeches get out of a gray automobile and bury something in a field . According to the woman , the car carried some lumber , Site asserts that the man resembles a picture of Hauptmann In a hunting outfit . Another witness is a man who , the officials say , has tentatively identified a picture of Hauptmann as that of a man he saw in a lane near the Lindbergh estate the morning before the kidnapping . Still another man has said that he saw a man resembling Hauptmannl about the same time in Hopewell , near the kidnapping scene . Colonel Schwarzkopf disclosed that Hauptmann had been employed as a carpenter and handy man at the Majestic Apartments , formerly the Majestic Hotel , Seventy - second1 Street and Central Park West , un til April 2 , 1932 , the day of the ransom payment . Hauptmann left his work at noon and did not return after lunch , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Police also revealed that a chisel found near the Lindbergh home at Hopewell after the kidnapping was of the same make as tools found in Hauptmann 's garage . Writing Expert Testifies . Linking the kidnapping and the extortion cases , Charles Appel Jr. , handwriting expert of the Department of Justice , after testifying before the Bronx grand jury , told reporters that it was " inconceivable " that any other person than Hauptmann had written the kidnapping note left on the window sill of Colonel Lindbergh 's home the night the baby was stolen , and the thirteen subsequent notes during the ransom negotiations . " There is only one chance in 100,000,000,000,000 , " said Appel , " that any other person could have had the same seven peculiarities shown in Hauptmann 's writing and in the kidnap and ransom notes . " Completing their check on Hauptmann 's stock market operations , the authorities found that he had lost $7,000 since he started playing the market in 1929 . This contradicted Hauptmann 's explanation that he had been able to live without working since the kidnapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received ' he money left for him by Fisch when the latter went to Germany last December . The officials found that Hauptmann had two brokerage accounts with the Yorkville branch of Steiner , Rouse &; Co. , one in his wife 's name , and had had an account with the firm of Carleton , Mott &; Co. , now out of existence , at 170 Broadway . It was learned that the unemployed carpenter put large sums of cash , as much as $2,500 at a time , into his brokerage accounts after the kidnapping , but that none of the money was part of the Lind1bergh ransom . In one account he deposited $10,000 in cash all told . The authorities discovered that Hauptmann had $2,578 on deposit with the Central Savings Bank , Broadway and Seventy-second Street , and had assets totaling $15,481 in his name and his wife 's , including $7,000 mortgages on Brooklyn real property . One of these mortgages , it was understood , was purchased after the kidnapping . These assets do not include the Lindbergh ransom money found in the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview here said that there was no doubt that the authorities had the right man in Hauptmann , J. Edgar Hoover , head of the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice , hinted in Washington that additional arrests might be expected . Federal agents asserted that it was not probable that Hauptmann did the job alone , largely because the ladder used in'the kidnapping , was not strong enough for a man of the prisoner 's weight . They pointed out that Hauptmann 's friend Fisch was a much lighter man . In Asbury Park , Prosecutor Jonas Tumen of Monmouth County said that a " fake clergyman , " known as a narcotic addict , who formerly lived in Highlands , N. J. , was being sought as a possible accomplice of Hauptmann . He disclosed that this suspect was questioned but released soon after the kidnapping , on the basis of statements he had made which seemed to show knowl. ; edge of the ' crime before it was committed . All Bilts on List . District Attorney Foley said that all the money found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every bill had been found to be on the official list of Lindbergh ransom money . " Does Hauptmann admit that it is Lindbergh money ? " Mr. Foley was asked . " Hauptmann himself told us it was Lindbergh money , " he replied . " After her knew we had found it , he told us it would amount to $600 or $800 . " Hauptmann told us that there was no more money left in the garage , " Mr. Foley went on , " but he told us the same story last Thursday after we found the first money under the floor of the garage . " The prisoner told his questioners that the $840 was part of the money left with him by Fisch , and added that it was " part of the Lindbergh money . " " Then he shut up , " said Mr. Foley . Asked how Hauptmann reacted to the discovery of the new money , Mr. Foley said : " He was very calm , just as he has always been . " It was officially denied that Hauptmann broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night pacing the floor and weeping , as reported yesterday . On the contrary , it was said , the prisoner had shown no signs of breaking down , but retains his sullen , determined composure and stolidity , despite the fact that he has been under almost constant questioning since his arrest a week ago yesterday morning . He sleeps well , but eats very sparingly , according to the authorities . " I saw Hauptmann this morning and he looked all right , " said Mr. Foley . " I asked him how he had slept and he said he had slept very well . " Explains Writing in Closet . According to District Attorney Foley , Hauptmann said that it was in March , 1932 , before the ransom was paid , that he wrote on the inside of the closet in his apartment the serial numbers that were found on Tuesday . The prisoner has ( stuck to his explanation that these were $500 or $1,000 bills he obtained from Fisch in a business transaction . The serial numbers are not on the list of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it omitted 1 the numbers of bills which were passed before the list was published . The numbers will be checked against the numbers on ransom bills passed before the list was made up . There were no $500 or $1,000 bills in the ransom , which consisted of $5 , $10 and $20 notes . Assistant Chief Inspector John J. Sullivan said yesterday that he knew nothing about a report that the police were looking for a suspected accomplice of Hauptmann who had chartered a tug , showing a wallet stuffed with bills , with which to catch the liner Columbus of the North German Lloyd Line just after she had sailed lase4aturday noon for Cobh , Southampton and Bremen ' . This report was coupled with publication of a report that Inspector Sullivan had cabled Detective Arthur Johnson of the New York Police Department , now in Europe ' on another case , to proceed to a " designated " city in Germany to await developments in the Lindbergh case . Inspector Sullivan said that he had not sent any instructions to Johnson since last Thursday or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leipzig to check on Fisch and for Kamenz , Germany , to look into Hauptmann 's early life there . Johnson was in Paris yesterday on his way to Leipzig Consul Not to Help . ' At the German Consulate General here it was said that Mrs. Hauptmann and her attorney had not been there on Tuesday , as previously reported . Although Mrs. Hauptmann is a German subject , it was explained , the consulate could not and would not help her , since the case is purely an American matter , unless she could not speak sufficient English and needed the help of an interpreter . Hauptmann will be arraigned in the Bronx County Court this morning on a bench warrant based upon the extortion- indictment . It is expected that he will be held without bail for trial or in very high bail . James M. Fawcett , his attorney , announced last night that Hauptmann would plead not guilty . District Attorney Foley announced that he would push the case forward for early trial . He said that he would bring Hauptmann to trial two weeks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on extraditing him to face trial for murder or kidnapping in that State . The maximum penalty for extortion in this State is twenty years ' imprisonment . In New Jersey , if convicted , Hauptmann would be subject to life imprisonment for kidnapping or death in the electric ' chair for murder . . Attorney General David T. Wllentz of New Jersey - Innounced that that State would act slowly in extraditing Hauptmann , and would not take any action to that end this week . As New York has such a strong case of extortion against the prisoit.r , he said , New jersey can afford to take her time perfecting her case on the more serious charges . Prosecutor Anthony Hauck of Hunterdon County , in which Hopewell is situated , said that Hauptmann would be tried for murder in Flemington , county seat of Hunterdon , but he did ' not fix the time .
