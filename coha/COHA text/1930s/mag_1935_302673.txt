One dawn last week black-cowled Death came to a frail little man lying on a straw pallet in a hushed Kentucky monastery , oldest in the U. S. Soon black-cowled Trappist monks broke their habitual silence to chant the office of the dead for Rt . Rev. Edmond M. Obrecht , 83 , Abbot of the Trappist Monastery of Our Lady of Gethsemane , superior administrator of all Trappists in the U. S. and Canada . <P> Edmond Obrecht was born in France in 1852 , four years after 40 French Trappists began building their vast monastery in Kentucky , not far from Bardstown and its Cathedral . Professing his vows at La Grande Trappe where the Order ( Reformed Cistercians ) received its nickname , Father Obrecht early learned Trappist discipline-to sleep in his rough wool habit ; arise at 2 a. m. ; spend the day in devotions and hard work ; * dig his own grave ; speak during the day only to his superiors and during the " Great Silence " of the night , to no one at all .
