THE HOME PLACE-Dorothy Thomas - Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Youngs were plain Nebraska farmers . Old Grandpa Young had raised three healthy sons and always managed to keep a roof over his head and remember to say grace even at breakfast . Grandma Young had always regretted that she did not have a daughter to sew for . Even Great-Grandma Young remained on the scene , a little feebleminded , imagining visitors were long-dead members of her family . <P> Tom , the oldest boy , had married a hard working farm girl and was doing well with a place down the road . Ralph had two years of agricultural school , married a schoolteacher and was doing well with a big place out West . Harvey , the youngest , was doing well at a job in the city . <P> Then Tom lost his place , Ralph his , and the Young boys , with their wives and children , moved in with the old folks and tried to adjust themselves to the contention that went on all the time . <P> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Edna , Tom 's wife , hated her and always made her feel that she was in the way in the kitchen . Her two big overgrown sons picked on Phyllis ' little girl . Her husband felt bitter at Ralph for losing his place , and in an argument about whose place was lost first , the brothers got into a fight . Old Grandpa Young kept saying ineffectually that he was not going to have this contention in his house , never did have it and never would , at last wrote to Harvey for help . Just then Harvey appeared , out of work , with a blonde wife who sat around in her pajamas all day , fixing her nails and smoking cigarets . <P> The Home Place covers a hard year in the lives of the Youngs and their women folk , involving the birth of another grandchild , a separation , an accident , a marked improvement in the spiritual development of almost all members of the crowded household as well as a general bettering of their economic situations . Even Harvey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reminds gruff Tom of an old sweetheart , thus softens him a little without actually leading him into sin . Sometimes Author Thomas , despite her zest for writing about the homely details of farm life , comes perilously close to setting her characters in situations where a showdown would be inevitable-e.g. , when Tom 's wife recognizes the reasons for Tom 's increasing amiability . But by the time Edna has fractured her back and Phyllis and Ralph have a house of their own , all tension is removed and the story comes to a classic sentimental conclusion .
