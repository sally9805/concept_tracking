txt Signs multiply here that Adolf Hitler 's so-called peace offensive failed before it , even began . Important developments in this connection are Premier Edouard Daladier 's firm speech in the secret session of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday , the closing of the present session of the Chamber and an official statement that Premier Mussolini will assume no peace intiatliT at the present time . While , the commission session was secret , the fairly comprehensive communiqu ? indicated that M. Daladier closely followed Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's line in the House of Commons , stressing Hitler 's consistent record of aggression and bad fv , ith , defining the French war position approximately as follows : " France does not wish to live longer in the state of insecurity of the last years . It refuses to submit to violence and fait accompli . It wants not truce between two aggressions but durable peace . " Peace Talk a " Trap " German talk of peace , the Premie ? told the Commission , was a " trap " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete proposal has been made to-France , he asserted , ' but should one be made , the French Government remained in entire accord with Mr. Chamberlain , who made a declaration against a dictated peace . M. Daladier said France and Great Britain had tried in every way to solve their differences with Germany short of war , adding that Hitler " provoked the war and must shoulder the entire responsibility . " It was announced that M. Deladier also referred to the United States ' efforts to change the neutrality law , but what he said in this connection was not made public . Impressive Emphasis Participants in the session of the Commission declared the two most impressive features of M. Daladier's. address , which lasted about four hours including many answers to questions , were his emphasis on the reality of British aid , especially with naval and aviation forces , and the emotion with which Tobey wants bill sent back to committee to separate cash-carry and embargo sections By Richard L. Strout Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor WASHINGTON , Oct. 5 ? While ce atorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another day of packed galleries and close attention , the rival leaders lined up votes for the first actual test of strength . This will cane , it is expected , on the motion of Senator Charles W. Tobey ( R ) of New Hampshire to send the bill back to Committee for separation into two parts , with an immediate vote on the cash-and-carry and other provisions , and a later consideration of the chief bone of contention , proposed repeal of the arms embargo . Meanwhile , as a symbolic of the hands-off attitude of the White House , President Roosevelt prepared to leave Washington today for a long week end . He will return Monday when the vote on the Tobey motion is scheduled . Mr. Roosevelt called in a number of Senators at the start of the contest but has taken an observer 's position since ' then . He gave supporters a free hand in writing the revised neutrality bill which restricts his discretion at many points but which cw.inis through the main administrion objective of repealing the arms embargo . Tobey States Position Now Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat Senator Tobey 's motion and to pass the ultimate bill , and they welcome the preliminary test vote . They oppose splitting the measure , knowing that cash-and-carry provisions are sympathetically regarded by many senators and counting on them to reduce opposition . Senator Tobey on the other hand , who led off in today 's debate , argued that there will be a long discussion of embargo repeal , and declared it to be imperative to attend to the non-controversial shipping and naval regulations immediately , in order to prevent an " incident " that might cause war . The " sensible " thing , he said , is to split the bill and pass non-controversial feature immediately , leaving the aims embargo to the last . Other speakers today were Senator John J. Overton ( D ) of Louisiana , who argued against embargo repeal , Senator Lewis B. Schwellenbach ( D ) of Washington , who favored it , and Senator Gerald P. Nye ( R ) of North Dakota who is one of the original sponsors of the embargo . Meanwhile , the nightly barrage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Johnson ( D ) , of Colorado and Senator Robert M. La Follette ( Prog. ) of Wisconsin , for and against repeal last night , was continued . Assuming that nearly every one of the 96 Senators will feel impelled to go on record one way or the other before the historic debate is through , Senate leaders are looking with a kindly eye on the radio which is sluicing off a good deal of the surplus oratory , while playing a prominent part in educating the public on the issues at stake . Leaders Still Confident of Repeal The third day of debate saw Administration leaders confident of their strength , and still basing their principal argument for repeal on technical grounds , that it will " restore neutrality . " Senator Tom Connally ( D ) of Texas for example yesterday spurned the suggestion that the Administration is motivated at all by the desire to help France and Great Britain as against Naziism . Most Senators , it must be said , take a more realistic view of the situation , however , which Senator George W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy which he advocated would require from the country many sacrifices and much suffering . Meanwhile , the decision to send the Chamber " on a vacation " ends the immunity of Deputies of the now proscribed Communist Party . The French Parliament , which theoretically has been in extraordinary session since Sept. 2 but which actually has not met during the war , is being sent on vacation in an official decree to be published in the official journal . M. Daladier , the Associated press said , promised the Foreign Affairs Commission that the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate would be reconvened if developments required . It is considered quite probable that the closing of the Chamber of Deputies will be the prelude to legal action against the Communists and other dissidents . The official journal published notices of the suspension of 39 municipal councils in various departments in which Communist elements had held power , according to the M. Much indignation followed reorganization of the Communists as the " French Peasants ' and Workers " group . Nor has the letter of this new " party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else than a storm of protest in its plea to Edouard Herriot , President of the Chamber , to convene that body for consideration of German-Russian " peace " proposals . The entire French press , including the Socialist Populaire attacks this letter as grossly inconsistent with the Communist policy since Munich of agitating for war against Hitler , almost at any price , denouncing any suggestion of compromise as treason . Wladimir D'Ormesson in today 's Figaro publishes an extremely bitter article against the Communists whom he calls agents of Hilter besides Stalin , accuses them of consistently endeavoring to destroy France by trying unnecessarily to embroil it in conflicts with Italy and Spain , climaxing with " When we called the Communist Party foreigner we understated the truth . They were partly enemy . During the last war many people were shot for doing less than the Communists have done . These traitors must now be prevented from doing harm . " Protest also has resulted from such overt acts as the recent circulation of a pamphlet entitled , " Immediate Peace , " two of whose authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchist origin . Another reason for closing the Chamber is M. Daladier 's conviction that public sessions are apt to degenerate into stormy , unconstructive debates so that contact between the Government and the people is most effectively maintained through the regular reports of the ministers to Chamber commissions . The decision that Signor Mussolini will take no peace initiative is welcome here , both because it indicates the judgment that Hitler 's attempt to get peace on his own terms has no chance of success and because it may show some weakening of Axis ties between Berlin and Rome . It is bleieved in French political circles that German-Soviet co-operation threatens Italian interests in the Bankans . While there is no disposition here to under-estimate the formidable effect of the German-Soviet rapprochement , it is considered some compensation that the three countries which many observers , especially of Left Wing political tendencies , considered irreconcilably hostile to France and England , namely Italy , Japan , and Spain , thus far have remained outside the war , not the least of their reasons being that each of these three powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czech Army Approved PARIS , Oct. 5 ( ? P ) ? Premier Daladier disclosed he had signed an agreement with Stefan Osusky , still recognized as Czech Minister , for reconstitution of the Czech Army in France , bringing new manpower to the Allied cause . of Nebraska , as an Independent , has already put into words in a radio address . Senator Tobey told the Senate today that iclusal to consider " title-and-carry provisions " of the bill immediately blocks efforts to protect American shipping from submarine attacks . " Secretary Hull 's hands are now tied , " he declared . " He has gone as far as he can under the law to get our ships out of war zones , for there is no law which now loibids our vessels from traveling in them . He needs the legal power now to forbid such travel . Every Hour One of Danger " Every hour that our ships are in the war zones carrying goods to one belligerent or the other is an hour of danger to the determination of the American people not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to take another three-day recess by the House was blocked today on the objection of Representatives who demanded assurances that they would have adequate time to debate the motion . At the same time Senator Nye , in a brief speech aligned himself . with Senator Borah and Senator Vandenberg declaring " there is no good reason why we should not have both the arms embargo and the cash-and-carry provision " in opposing embargo repeal . " We will have both if the expressed purpose of the great majority in the Senate is pursued and a semblance of neutrality is to be preserved . In his speeches last night , Senator Johnson upheld his proposal that President Roosevelt be authorized to support any European peace move . He advocated arms embargo repeal . On the other hand Senator La Follette urged the embargo . " We should concentrate on making democracy work at home and thus maintain our civil liberties and preserve our way of life , " he said . " We have a great opportunity to build up an inter-continental economy in this Hemisphere . We can provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cost of our involvement in war abroad . We do not have to accept as the solution of our problems the employment resulting from trade produced by slaughter and destruction . " Charges Appeal to Fear Senator Schwellenbach charged In the Senate today that opponents were making their appeal to emotion and fear rather than to logic . " It has taken only a short month of the present European hostilities to completely demonstrate that the arms embargo contains definitely possible dangers of our involvement . " he declared . Decrying the " unneutrality of the present situation , " he listed some of the opponents ' argument and attacked them one by one . The same men who now argue that America should not change the rules of the game atter the game rs star ted were the one " who last July prevented us from changing the rules of the game and urged us to do nothing and see what happened , " he said . Another argument that it is immoral to sell arms he met by the declaration that it is " equally immoral for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand a gun to a man to use in self defense when being attacked without provocation by a ruthless and well prepay ed aggressor . " Nobody can contend he argued . " that the furnishing of the parts that go to make the completed armaments is any less moral than the furnishing of the armament itself . " Referring to Senator Vanden-berg 's phrase yesterday that " you ca n't become an arsenal for one side without becoming the target for another , " he called it " a most successful effort to confuse the issue . " For 200 years he declared neutral nations have insisted on the right to sell arms without becoming involved in the war . He likewise attacked the Vandenberg phrase " this is the first step towards war . " Can anyone believe that ? " he demanded . " If we did , would we have proposed this regulation whereby it is asked that our Government impose the strictest regulations ever conceived in an effort to prevent our going to wax .
