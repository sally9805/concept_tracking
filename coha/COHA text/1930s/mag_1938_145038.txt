In the quiet of his summer retreat at St. Josephs . N. Y .. death ( of coronary thrombosis ) came last week to Patrick Joseph Cardinal Hayes , 70 . Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York since 1919 , Prince of the Church since 1924 , benign and white-haired " Cardinal of Charities " to the 1,000,000 Catholics of the world 's richest archdiocese . Forty-six years a priest , but never pastor of a church . Cardinal Hayes was the first native-born shepherd ( which he liked to call himself ) of New York . His steady rise in the church he owed to scholarship , administrative ability and an association with his predecessor , John Cardinal Farley , to whom he was successively assistant , secretary , chancellor and auxiliary bishop . <P> Less liberal politically than his colleague and onetime schoolmate . Chicago 's George William Cardinal Mundelein , Cardinal Hayes was less conservative , less stern than the two other U. S. princes-Boston 's William Henry Cardinal O'Connell . Philadelphia 's Dennis Cardinal Dougherty . Six months will probably elapse before the Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. candidates , picks a new Archbishop of New York .
