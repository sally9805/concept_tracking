I REALIZE its not a matter of We and death , " writes a woman about her ailments , " but it 's so annoying that sometimes I wish it were . " Daniel Turner , the first English dermatologist , has a passage in the same strain : Speaking of baldness , " Although this disease is not much of Danger , yet it has much of Turpitude or Disgrace , insomuch that the Slaves among the Romans , labouring under this malady , were undervalued and sold at a much Viler Price . " I am the recipient of a good many letters from people about their illnesses and bodily troubles , and most of these troubles are of that minor kind . And the worst of it is that the medical profession does n't know very much , in most cases , about how to help these little , picayunish things . There is one kind of question that the medical man too often gets asked .

" Yes , but it 'll come back , " he is completely routed ; has no answer at all . Admitted , of course , that this is a casual question . It comes under the head of " free " or " curbstone " advice . But in his office , in consultation , and if he were being paid for it , be would n't come off any better .

This is especially true if he is a younger man in medicine . His time has been too much taken up tending to the big subjects  --  operations and queer complicated deviations from the smooth curve of the normal . As time goes on , he finds , too , that it 's the little things that count  --  more people have them , and they are more anxious to get rid of them . Not long ago , in conversation with one of the most distinguished surgeons of the United States , I asked what was the subject of his paper before the surgical congress , with delegates from all over the world . His answer was " Corns . " All of which forcibly reminds me of my first patient . Every doctor , I suppose , has a story about his first patient  --  we should get up a collection of them sometime . She came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a troubled countenance , and began with great volubility to explain exactly why she had chosen me for consultation . She had heard that I bad just completed a course of hospital residence in the East , and she felt certain that I must have the very latest ideas on medical science . What , I kept asking myself  --  what wild and exotic derangement of function could be going on inside that superficially very healthy-looking exterior ? I was fully prepared for something extremely choice , when finally I ventured to ask her what was her trouble , and she answered , " Sweating feet . " I must have looked abashed . I had never heard of a remedy for sweating feet , nor even that one had ever been suggested . If my patient had had some fancy and involved ailment , such as myelogenous leukemia , or stibphrenic abscess , I would have been perfectly capable of attending her with every display of that very latest lore for which she yearned .

" There seems , however , to have been a change in the attitude of the faculty minds in this respect lately . A few years ago the least thing that any research worker would stoop to consider as a research subject was the cause of cancer . Propaganda in the form of the formation of societies for the control and prevention of were formed for heart disease and cancer . We were treated to hair-raising discourses on Sunday evenings on the increasing mortality of heart disease . The lecturer , selected from the less-busy group in the local medical society , had , in most instances , apparently been spending a good part of his time in the deadhouse. and he brought an unctuous enthusiasm to the description of the situation , which caused many of his auditors to stagger out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate from heart disease is increasing  --  that was the burden of the song .

There is something heroic about heart disease . You die a martyr 's death , leaving pathetic little notes around , about what you want sung at your funeral . Or if you do n't die , you are the center of every solicitude , surrounded by handsome nurses day and night , assisted in every move , and visited by friends who blink to keep back the tears , thinking of what a loss you will be to the community .

In another way , of course , it is n't elusive at all : it is right here all the time . It is the most universal of all diseases . Every adult in our climate has three spells of it per annum , according to statistics . Its elusiveness becomes apparent when we try to go any further . Because that statement is about all we can say for certain about the condition , and oven tho statistical part might be challenged  --  maybe adults average only two colds a year . It is undoubtedly an infectious disease . It is caused by what bacteriologists have come to call a " filterable virus . " Whether it is contagious , as well as infectious , is a moot question .

" You should n't call wine a sauce . It 's more like an oil . You might call it the lubricant of luck . " Does one attack confer immunity , and if so , for how long ? Are people over forty-five years of age immune , and what proportion of them are immune ? Nobody knows . Yet it would seem that those things could be determined . When it comes to cures , there is a plethora of advice , but no agreement . Every time I publish any reference to the subject I am bombarded with letters from readers , each of which has a final , definite and certain cure , but nearly all different . The favorite preventive is to drink plenty of fruit juices ; proponents of this plan assert that since trying it they have n't had a cold for twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age , and there is a general opinion that people , after a lifelong battle with colds , finally develop immunity in middle age , so the interpretation of their preventive measures may be doubted . All our questionings , however , may soon be cleared up . The weapons of trained research have been turned on this humble disease , with the result that the cause has been identified . It is , as stated above , a filterable virus . The filterable viruses constitute a 89 92 THE SATI1121 ) 111 ( EVENING POST 045 Continuwd from Page 89 ) group of germs of a very peculiar nature . They are too small to be seen under any microscope and so small that they pass through a filter which will catch the ordinary germs with which we are familiar , small as they are . For instance , suppose the nasal secretion from a patient with a cold is collected and macerated in salt solution and passed through a porcelain filter , the material which passes through will produce a cold when sprayed into the nose of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so difficult to study the cold is that it is almost exclusively a human disease . Our cousins , the apes , furnish the only other experimental animals available . The technical difficulties of studying the filterable viruses have been very great , but so far as the common cold is concerned , the announcement recently made by Dr. A. R. Dochez , before the New York Academy of Medicine , indicates that they have been largely overcome . The causative virus of the cold has been grown on living tissue culture . With that accomplished , it is now possible to go ahead and determine the immunology of colds , and to attempt to produce that long-sought and elusive vaccine , the injection of which will prevent one from having colds for the winter . Immunology tests may work out in various ways . Once the cause of an infectious disease is discovered , the bacteriologist is then in a position to inject dead cultures of it into the blood stream of an animal and , by increasing the strength of the culture , produce a high degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture because , being dead , its action has an automatic stop action  --  living cultures would go on multiplying and possibly get entirely out of hand . With an immunized animal several tests can be tried to measure the degree of immunity . For instance , the blood of anyone who has had typhoid vaccine will , when added to a suspension of typhoid bacilli , clump them and stop their movements , just as much as if that blood came from a person who had actually had the disease . That is an agglutination test measurement of immunity . Again , if a child has never been immunized against diphtheria , its skin will react with a red inflammatory area , if a small amount of diphtheria toxin is scratched into the epidermis . There are flocculation reactions , and hemolytic tests , and so OD . One or the other , the immunologists hope , will work for the virus of the common cold . Comforting Thoughts on Colds If so , they will be in a position to settle those questions which we formulated above . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently does not last long , but with the test we will be able to determine just how long . What proportion of middle-aged people finally do gain protection after how many winters of assaults on its ravages ? That can be answered . Secondly , it is , of course , hoped that the dead virus can be used as a vaccine , for prevention , and that we can all line up about November first and get our " cold shot " for the winter . This phase of the matter was played up by the newspapers when Doctor Dochez made his announcement , but I learn from quite direct sources that no vaccine is available yet . It will be a great economic saving if it works , . no doubt , but I am not so sure that it will be such a tremendous disadvantage if it fails . Colds have never seemed the terror to me they have to so many public-minded health authorities . They have a moral value in the community . There ie a pleasantly delicious feeling about the malaise and the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so comfortable to rest those tired limbs in bed and know you have a perfectly good excuse not to go downtown and do a lot of more or less futile labor . Then , afterward , you have a chance to meditate  --  a rare experience these days  --  or to catch up on your reading . If you will just give in to a cold , you will have quite a happy time of it . Rbout the Breath But that is a hygienic heresy , and we must have no more of it . Science has stooped in another direction to deign to notice a humble trouble of mankind  --  bad breath . There have always been a number of theories to account for this pest . One is that it is due to fermentation in the stomach or bowel , with the formation of these noxious chemicals ; they are absorbed into the blood and carried to the salivary glands and excreted into the mouth cavity in their secretion . A similar theory is that the gaseous odoriferous substances are formed somewhere in the body and carried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . The most forthright idea is that bad breath is due to simple lack of cleanliness in the mouth or nose . So far as the last proposal is concerned , it is certainly true that bad breath is less common among the edentulous and the clean-shaven . Teeth have many nooks and harbors to catch food particles which decay there . And as for a. heard  --  heaven knows how many things a beard may be the graveyard for . But , as a matter of fact , the other theories have something to be said for them . Especially the first one , which blames the saliva . It is only since physicians have been using the method of introducing drugs into the body directly by way of a vein that it has been realized how rapidly the blood carries these substances to all parts of the body , and how much is excreted in the saliva . In the instance of arsenic and other metal solutions , the first drop has barely been injected before the patient begins to complain of the metallic taste in his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saliva contains so much of the toxic products of the disease that it has even been used as a test to determine the amount in the body . But all of these theoretical considerations gave way when biochemical science in the persons of Drs . H. W. Haggard and Leon A. Greenberg , of the Department of Applied Physiology of Yale , turned the full battery of retorts and test tubes on the subject . They selected the best-known breath contaminators  --  onion and garlic . It is possible to study these because the odor is due to an essential oil with a known chemical composition . The odor of onions is due , if you care to be erudite , to allyl-propyl disulphide , and in the households of advanced chemical education it is customary to gossip about the truck gardener by saying , " Tony reeked of allyl disulphide this morning . " Meaning garlic . ( Continued from Paso 92 ) The supposition that the odor on the breath is due to the entry of those oils in the blood and excretion by the lungs or saliva was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experimental subject who had just had a garlic meal ; no garlic odor could be detected . And when it is pointed out that the olfactory end organ is more sensitive than any chemical test , detecting certainly as little as 0.00002 mg. and going on beyond the bounds of measurable quantitative determination , it will be admitted that the test of smelling the blood is entirely accurate . The work of Lehman Was recalled . He worked on rabbit breath  --  these scientists will do anything to add to your happiness . He gave the rabbits garlicoildirectly into the blood stream  --  that is , by the vein . And he gave enormous amounts  --  equivalent to nearly a pound of garlic for a man of average weight . The breath gave traces of garlic after this giant dose for fifty minutes ; then no more appeared . " Obviously , " as the observers say , " an effect quite different from the persistent taint observed on the human breath after garlic . " As to the idea that the garlic or onion odors can arise in regurgitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stomach by means of a stomach tube , so that none touches the mouth cavity , and the amount of oil in the expired air is so slight as to be hardly detectable . Plainly , then , the locale of the onion , or garlic breath is in the mouth . Keeping the Mouth Clean So far as these studies apply to the unfortunate with idiopathic bad breath  --  not dependent on something he ate or drank  --  they seem very practical . True , a certain number have a musty odor to the saliva for some reasons of bodily chemistry still obscure , yet it must be true that these are in the minority , and the greatest number of cases are due to a dirty mouth or nose . This does not imply any lack of attention to cleanliness : The dirt is quite likely to be in places where it can not be removed by self-help  --  cheesy masses in the crypts of the tonsils , for instance , or in the sinuses of the nose . For anyone with this tendency , repeated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep it under control . Another minor pestilence is acne . It would n't be so bad , as one of the victims told me , if it were on the inside  --  it does n't hurt and it does n't destroy pep . But those crops of pimples on the face spoil the fairness of the world for a great many people . And the worst of it is that it is a disease of adolescence and youth . At that sensitive and self-conscious period when falling in love is as natural as breathing and one wants to look one 's most glorious . The tissue changes that occur in acne  --  its pathology  --  were worked out pretty finally a number of years ago by a dermatologist named Unna . When first promulgated , his ideas were not accorded much " room , " in the language of the street  --  as well as of the laboratory . More attention was paid to another dermatologist , named Sabourand , who found a germ in the discharge from the acne pustules . This acne bacillus was considered the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it was found that this acne bacillus is a normal and regular part of the film on the surface of the skin of the face , and does not of itself cause any inflammatory process . It grows a little more luxuriantly in the contents of the acne pustules , which form , as it were , a good culture medium for it . Vaccines from this organism which were , in old days , frequently used for treatment , were followed by good results in so few cases that their employment has largely been abandoned . An Affliction of Youth The phenomenon which the acne bacillus-infection theory could not explain was why some individuals were affected and not others . This brought dermatologists back to the quality of the acne patient 's skin , and eventually back to the observations of Unna . It is easy to see that the skin in these people is greasier , rougher , more subject to comedones , or blackheads . The blackheads mark the opening on the surface of the little oil  --  sebaceous  --  glands which lubricate the skin . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form an excessive secretion . It is the excessive secretion which makes the skin greasy . The obstruction dams back the secretion in the mouths of some glands , forming an elegant little sack of culture medium on which pus-forming germs and saprophytes can grow , In order to explain this obstruction , Unna cut out small pieces of skin from patients with acne and examined sections of them under the microscope . He found quite regularly an increase in the cells of the upper skin layer . These cells would pile up around the mouths of the sebaceous glands and form a little trap door , holding the secretions back . The treatments for acne have been almost more numerous than the patients . The consensus of opinion is that the best results have been obtained by a combination of diet  --  avoidance of sweets and starches , emphasis on vegetables and fruits  --  exposure to ultraviolet light and X ray , and local attention to the skin by washing away the grease and extracting the blackheads . Quite lately a new treatment has been recommended which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be mentioned with some diffidence because we have all been repeatedly disappointed by acne treatments . But with all proper reservations , it is at least worth a trial . The theoretical reasoning behind this procedure takes into account all the things which we have pointed out as fundamental in the picture of the acne patient . First , it occurs almost entirely in adolescents , and makes its appearance around the age of fourteen to seventeen . This is the period of beginning activity of the sex glands . The internal secretion of these glands makes many changes in bodily appearance , form and contour . Notably the skin is affected  --  striking proof of this is the additional hair growth  --  beard and mustache in boys , pubic Bair in both sexes . A smooth pink supple skin is a striking and attractive secondarysexual characteristic . It took physiologists a long time to find out that the stimulation of these glands lay not in themselves alone but in another gland of internal secretion , situated anatomically far away from them at the base of the brain . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the body  --  the anterior lobe of the gland particularly . Two particular parts of its secretion are definitely known  --  one is that 96 THE SRTURDAY chemical wind ' stimulates and regulates growth and which is called " Antuitrin-G , " the " G ' standing for growth . ' Pile other is the hormone which stimulates and regulates the activity of the sexual glands and is , therefore , called " A n t uit ri it-S . " Chem-lent research has succeeded in isolating these chemicals , so that they are quite definite entities with regular separate physiological actions . A Boston physician , within the last year , while working with Antuitrin-S in It group of young people who had disturbances of the sexual glands , observed quite incidentally that he was clearing up the acne these patients had . Other physicians have observed the same thing . The hypodermic injection of 2 c. c. of Antuitrin-S has succeeded in a great many cases . It may turn out to be the best treatment we have , and relieve the unfortunates of the coming generation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely yet , but the treatment at least is harmless . In making a catalogue of the petty maladies which are so burdensome , it is natural enough that most of them should be external . A wart or a white discoloration , being painless , would be of no concern if only it were on the inside of the body . Our discussion is , therefore , of a necessity superficial . Cromwell 's wart did not seem to bother him  --  at least , so we may gather , since be demanded that it be incorporated in his portrait . It was an aid  --  it frightened his enemies . But a wart is no great help to a debutante . The Battle of the Centuries This importance of warts , indeed , has been recognized since the dawn of time . Warts have been attacked by all the resources of science , surgery , fire and medicaments , as well as all the powers of prayer , darkness and the black arts . " For warts , " says Sir Thomas Browne , " we rub our hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touch of the dead . Old women were always famous for curing warts : they were so in Lucian 's time . " " To cure warts , " writes an old leech , " steal " Italics mine " a piece of beef from a butcher 's shop and rub your warts with it : then throw it down the necessary house or bury it : and as the beef rots , your warts will decay . " It would have been well if they had stuck to such harmless methods , but the accounts of what people went through in other days to rid themselves of warts makes one shudder . I excerpt an account from Daniel Turner 's old book 1717 on diseases of the skin : " A hardy young Wench being much pester 'd with Warts , had the same objected to by her Sweet-Heart as a Sign of Sluttishness : Upon which resolving to get rid of them she applies her self to a Barber , who covering them all around with clay , leaving out their tops , she lays Brimstone upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burning .

Since all these fungus infections , when they attack the skin , itch , it is easy to see how they gain access to the nails .

Perhaps the commonest of all our diseases , since our American climate has permitted us to become an outdoor nation , is that itchy blistery eruption of the feet which an inspired advertising slogan nicknamed " athlete 's foot .

Sodium thiosulphate is also used for this purpose , but is not recommended as a preliminary to entering a swimming pool , because it is a reducing agent which will reduce the chlorine used in the swimming pool as a purifier .

Snoring is caused by the vibration of the soft palate , which becomes relaxed when you go to sleep , So does the lower jaw , and you breathe through the mouth instead of through the nose , as during waking hours . As you get older , everything gets flabbier and more relaxed , so you snore louder . If you can get younger or remember not to relax your jaw when you go to sleep , you wo n't snore any more .
