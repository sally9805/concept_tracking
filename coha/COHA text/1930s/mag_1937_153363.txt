Never was a story more Dutch than that last week of " The Other Juliana . " It had been decided by Her Majesty 's Government that , as a mark of respect to Crown Princess Juliana , she and her bridegroom would be the only persons married in The Netherlands on their wedding day . The attention of Her Majesty 's Government was then drawn to that buxom coincidence , the Dutch female who was born on the same day and at approximately the same moment as H. R. H. Juliana , the honest wench Petronella van der Meer . <P> It appeared that this person was engaged to marry the honest vegetable peddler Martinus van Stijn and wished to do so on the day of the Crown Princess ' marriage . How far was it appropriate to go in this case ? The wench and her vegetable man were both of substantial folk in the village of Oegstgeest . They were not going to have a Third-Class wedding ( free ) at the Town Hall , nor a Second-Class wedding ( $2.75 ) , but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bridegroom in striped trousers and tails , the bride in modest everyday dress . In these becoming circumstances Her Majesty 's Government , with the benevolent concurrence of Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina , authorized the marriage of Petronella &; Martinus to be held as the only other marriage in The Netherlands on the wedding day of H. R. H. Juliana . <P> Petronella at once became " The Other Juliana " in newsprint . Her mighty Martinus , who towers so high above dumpy Petronella that the top of her head is just even with his breast pocket , heartily exclaimed , " Ja , we move right into a six-room house-small , but six rooms-for children , Ja ! " It was beneath the dignity of the Royal Family to send a wedding present to " The Other Juliana " and they rested upon their royal dignity amid general Dutch satisfaction . WThen Petronella &; Martinus went to the village Town Hall for their First-Class wedding the whole countryside had turned out to cheer them but the Vice-Burgomaster , who performed the ceremony , lectured them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lecturing Their Royal Highnesses . After completing the marriage with a stroke of his gavel , the Vice-Burgomaster concluded , " You two young people must not get the idea that you are of any importance just because all these people have come here while you are married . Your marriage would never have been noticed had it not been celebrated on the same day as that of our Crown Princess . You are not of the least importance . I offer my congratulations and good wishes . "
