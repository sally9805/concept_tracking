As sharp fighting raged between Japanese and Chinese last week in Tientsin worried U. S. citizens in this great Chinese city decided they would be safer if they showed the Stars &; Stripes , discovered that the only purchasable U. S. flags in town were all stamped " Made in Japan " and offered by genial dealers who had jacked up the price of a small flag from $1 to $3-about the weekly wage of a Tientsin coolie . <P> President Roosevelt meanwhile was taking no chances with U. S. warships in Chinese waters . The U. S. S. Augusta , flagship of the Asiatic Fleet , was ordered out of Tsingtao and steamed rapidly to Vladivostok on a " goodwill " voyage to Soviet Russia . Even more pointedly the U. S. S. Tulsa , which was steaming toward Tientsin to give her gobs the pleasure of shore leave amid its Chinese night spots , was ordered to turn tail and steam for Chefoo . <P> In Tokyo members of the Japanese Parliament , when they anxiously inquired whether President Roosevelt was going to decide that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neutrality Act against both belligerents , were told by Foreign Minister Koki Hirota that " apparently " such is not his intention . <P> Peace Preservation Corps . Japanese never tire in their efforts to find Chinese who will act as trustworthy puppets , and in the past two years they have equipped with Japanese rifles , Japanese cartridges and even Japanese machine guns several thousand Chinese known as the Peace Preservation Corps of " General " ' Yin Ju-keng ( TIME , Dec. 2 , 1935 et seq . ) . Toothy Mr. Yin , who looks most of the time like a startled rabbit , is a Chinese with a potent Japanese in-law who became a " general " overnight by so styling himself , and by the grace of Japanese bayonets . He was ruling uneventfully last week in his strategic bailiwick which lies close to Peiping on the north and east , when suddenly his Peace Preservation Corps , every man a Chinese , started using their Japanese weapons against the Japanese garrison at General Yin 's capital , Tungchow . <P> This " Chinese treachery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartly timed . About 3,000 Japanese troops recently made up the garrison , but 2,900 had just marched away to help suppress " rebellious Chinese " trying to strike a blow for their country at nearby Nanyuan . It was all in the day 's work for the Japanese garrison of 100 , although taken by surprise and outnumbered by 10-to-1 , to stand off the Chinese . These peppered the Japanese barracks with their machine guns , then entrenched themselves in nearby cornfields over which four Japanese planes circled around &; around , bombing the Chinese until Japanese re-enforcements rushed up to relieve the garrison . Meanwhile wounded Chinese had set off in rickshaws to receive treatment at Peiping , only a 14-mi. run for sturdy Chinese rickshaw coolies . Several of these wounded Peace Preservation Corps heroes were asked by correspondents . " But why did you turn against Yin ? Are n't you and he supposed to be pro-Japanese ? "
