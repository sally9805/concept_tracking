Most sentimental and ( next to the Open ) toughest U. S. golf tournament is the Masters ' , played on Bobby Jones 's " dream course " in Augusta , Ga . Most golfers hope that Bobby Jones , now 37 , paunchy and a 40-to-1 shot , may still win this tournament . As the sixth annual Masters ' began last week , favorites were Open Champion Ralph Guldahl , Hillbilly Sam Snead and lanky Henry Picard , last year 's winner . <P> Bobby Jones cracked his drives as lustily and hit his irons as crisply as ever . But when a golfer competes in only one tournament a year , as Jones does now , the shots that count are made on the putting green . Jones began to miss easy putts , finished with a 76 that put him out of the running . <P> The top money players stayed in the money . Finishing with a smoking 68 Sam Snead broke the tournament record by two strokes with 280 , seemed the winner . Ralph Guldahl started the last nine needing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got a birdie , two pars . Then he hit a weak , 22O-yd. drive on the 480-yd. 13th and his jig seemed to be up . His ball was in a downhill lie ; yawning in front of the green 260 yards away was a deep , water-filled ravine . Without hesitation Guldahl took a spoon instead of a safe iron , swung with all his 200 pounds , sent the ball whistling across the ravine to the green , six feet from the cup . When he sank the putt for an eagle , the tournament was his . His record 72-hole total : 279 , nine under par .
