For almost three months Jose Melgar , who fired a bullet into the midriff of President Luis Sanchez Cerro ( TIME , March 14 ) , has sat in his cell under sentence of death , fear gnawing at his heart . <P> Time &; again Peru 's Congress has hinted to the President that , since he was not killed , he ought to commute the death sentence . But President Sanchez Cerro is as mentally relentless as he is physically robust and tough . Congress , knowing this , has tried to wheedle him by the flattery of promoting him in military rank . President Sanchez Cerro was unmoved . Lounging at home in a $150 silk bathrobe he let Jose Melgar sit in jail . <P> But even to Sanchez Cerro , enough is enough . Last week he commuted the death sentence to imprisonment for 25 years . <P> Just now President Sanchez Cerro 's government is attempting to line up South American states in a defensive tariff union against the U. S. Strongly urging this policy , the daily El Comercio declared last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire conference at Ottawa . . . . We must again look to England and Europe for markets for our products . . . . The United States should never again speak to us about ' Pan-Americanism , ' as that word from now on is without soul and without force . We have seen what happened in Nicaragua and Haiti .
