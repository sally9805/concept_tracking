Some years before World War I , the Kaiser took Queen Wilhelmina-a plump , sweet-faced young matron-out to his Army maneuvers . Intending to impress his little neighbor with Germany 's military might , he pointed out to her a strapping unit of the Prussian Guard . <P> " They are all eight feet tall , Your Majesty , " ominously observed the Kaiser . <P> " The streets of Amsterdam can be flooded nine feet deep , Your Majesty , " observed the Queen . <P> Last week the heroine of this legend was once more thinking of the German Army and The Netherlands ' floodgates . Nowadays you can stop an army by flooding just over its hub caps , and Lieut . General Baron J. G. G. van Voorst tot Voorst , Commander in the Field of the Dutch Army , had already splashed around on his horse through some flood-test areas ( see cut ) . Lieut . General and Queen were ready to flood some more . Though it had rained heavily off &; on for three weeks , The Netherlands opened additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to get the soil of her primary defense areas ready to hold a flood . Water was kept within a few inches of the tops of canal banks . And martial law was declared throughout eight of The Netherlands ' eleven provinces . <P> All this was in reply to Germany 's continuing to concentrate troops along her Dutch border . Dutch soldiers , standing to their arms about 500,000 strong , removed all road signs in frontier districts , to confuse an invader . Bridges and key roads remained mined . At the same time , to release them for work at home , the Government demobilized the Class of 1924 . No one really expected a German push , especially if the Dutch canals and rivers do not freeze solid this winter ( as they did last ) . <P> &gt;Belgium 's defense was in final readiness , and correspondents were shown that country 's new defense against tanks : mobile , steel-girder " gates " on rollers , which can be pushed across country , two men to a gate , or dragged in long lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilient wall which impedes tanks butting it yet is not easily broken by shellfire . Tanks slowed down by the bending wall would make easy targets for defensive fire . Belgium was said to have enough such gates for a continuous wall all along her German frontier. * <P> &gt;Luxembourg barred nonresidents from a triangle between Remich , Modorf and Schengen in her southeast corner . She shut down her big radio station , lest she be blamed for propaganda broadcast by others on its wave length , and banned the playing of radios and phonographs in public . On All Saints ' Day , the Grand Ducal Army ( 1,000 men , plus 350 recruits and 200 gendarmes ) paraded in review in its new khaki uniforms , with helmets like the old Austrian Army . Said its commander : " This is quite a change from our old army in lollipop uniforms . " The pre-World War uniform was sky-blue , wasp-waisted , gold-buttoned , with gold band on a high-crowned pillbox hat . <P>               @ @ @ @ @ @
