Clifford Oral McCreedy of Aledo , Ill , is a careful country doctor . Last week he paid a call , lanced an abscess for a patient and , when he was through , took a proper precaution . He did not put the infected scalpel with the sterilized instruments in his bag . He wrapped it in a piece of paper and put it in his pocket . Then careful Dr. McCreedy went home and , opening his front door , looked down into the laughing face of his 19-month-old daughter , Nancy Irene . He swung her up and clasped her in his arms . That was a fatal move . The infected scalpel in his pocket pierced the child 's abdomen . In spite of immediate attention , two days later Dr. McCreedy 's daughter was dead .
