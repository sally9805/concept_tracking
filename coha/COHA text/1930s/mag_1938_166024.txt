If in 1914 heroic King Albert had faced the Germans alone , suddenly deserted by the Great Powers as was Czechoslovakia this week , even the redoubtable Belgian Sovereign might have shown less courage , resourcefulness and firmness than did President Eduard Benes last week . Astonished Prague learned on Wednesday evening from press wires that Neville Chamberlain would fly on Thursday morning to Berchtesgaden , bitterly observed that the violent Sudeten German riots which broke out on Monday night , directly after Hitler 's Nrnberg speech , had been quelled by police and gendarmes so effectively that at 7:30 p. m. on Tuesday orders went out from Henlein headquarters for Sudeten German fighting to cease and outlawed Nazi symbols to be withdrawn . <P> Enough Rope . Falkenau , a typical Sudeten German town , was a flaunting forest of swastika banners on the afternoon before this Henlein order went out . By next morning not a single swastika was flying in Falkenau , and on the streets Nazis no longer greeted each other with the Hitler salute , as all had done the day before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in motorcars , they verified that only in the western frontier sector of the Sudeten German area had there been bloodshed . The north , east and south were calm " with business as usual , " but in the west 46 had been killed by Wednesday night and savage acts were verified . Citizens of Habersberg gave eyewitness testimony that on Tuesday fully-armed Sudeten Nazis had besieged the local commandant and his gendarmes for three hours . When the commandant surrendered and emerged , they said , Nazis closed in around him , beat and kicked the commandant to death . <P> Since three gendarmes still remained besieged , the Nazis dragged the wife of one through the streets by a rope binding her wrists , ordered her to beg her hus band to come out , which she did . Few minutes later a bus load of gendarmes drove up , one was instantly killed in the bus by a Nazi 's shot , another was killed as he dismounted . The Nazis scattered as the gendarmes opened fire and after ward the commander of the relieving force said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this rope was lying on the ground . <P> She had been kicked , spat upon and otherwise insulted . Another woman had been shot in the stomach , made a prisoner , and taken to the inn , where we found her . " Correspondents found both women in a hospital at Falkenau . Dr. Stoehr , the Sudeten physician in charge , hustled them out while the women called from their beds , " Let us speak to the foreign correspondents ! " <P> Schwaderbach- On Thursday , while Mr. Chamberlain was in the air , Sudeten German violence burst out on a much larger scale . Storm Troops besieged , captured police headquarters in the border town of Schwaderbach , opened the frontier to Germany , and marshaled such a heavy show of armed force that fresh forces of gendarmes who arrived were ordered by Dr. Benes from Prague to hold their ground around the town but not attack , lest the scale of operations amount to " warfare .
