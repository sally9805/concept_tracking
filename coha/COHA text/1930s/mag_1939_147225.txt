Slickest bullying trick of Nazi spider-fly diplomacy is to invite victims to Berlin , turn their heads with official flattery , parades and feasts , then scare them out of their wits with a stunning display of German military might given , of course , in their honor . <P> In Berlin one day last week all workers were given a half holiday with pay . Factories , shops and offices hung out yards of gay Yugoslav flags distributed by Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels , while their employes marched in masses to allotted cheering stations along the troop-lined streets . Out of his special train stepped puzzled-looking , Oxford-bred Regent Prince Paul , whom Germans quickly nicknamed " Prince Charming . " In his most winning manner Herr Hitler greeted the Prince while Frau Gring handed Princess Olga , the Regent 's wife , a bouquet of roses , welcomed her to Naziland . <P> That night at a lavish State dinner , Fhrer Hitler and Regent Prince Paul exchanged toasts that would make Balkan , perhaps European , history . <P> Said Herr Hitler of German-Yugoslav friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become neighbors with common borders established for all time . . . . " <P> Said prudent Prince Paul : " I am very happy . . . that the great German Reich . . . intends to recognize her Yugoslavia 's freedom and independence as well as the same Austrian frontiers which have joined us as lasting neighbors since last year . " <P> Next day came the military display . While 265 planes zoomed overhead , Herr Hitler obligingly showed his princely guests how lucky it is to be Germany 's friend . He underlined his point with a two-and-one-half-hour military review , made princely eyes bug out with three new 25-ton tanks , mounting one 75-mm. gun , one 37-mm. gun , three machine guns . Carped critics : three-quarters of the parade was motorized but only 20% of the German Army is . Observers thought Prince Paul was less likely to quibble about percentages .
