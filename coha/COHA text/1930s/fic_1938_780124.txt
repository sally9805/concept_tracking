 | Chapter III THE claimant got up from his chair . Despite the fact that one wall of the library was built of windows , multitudinous panes set in a pattern of stone oblongs , the daylight was going ; and the trees threw heavy shadows . On the stoneflagged floor there was insufficient carpeting . The heavy bookshelves were built up like tiers in a crypt , scrolled along the top . Green-shadowed light through the windows drew across the floor a silhouette of a hundred panes , stretching almost to the man who rose to his feet beside the table . Molly has since confessed that her heart was in her mouth when the door opened , and that she wondered whether a living counterpart of her husband might not appear from behind it , as in a mirror . Yet there was no great resemblance between these two . The man in the library was no heavier than Farnleigh , yet less wiry . His dark , fine hair had no grey in it , but he was going a little thin on top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was comparatively unfurrowed . Any wrinkles in his forehead or round his eyes were those of amusement rather than doggedness . For the claimant 's whole expression was one of ease , irony , and amusement , with very dark grey eyes , and eyebrows wisped up a little at the  | outer corners . He was well dressed , in town clothes as opposed to Farnleigh 's old tweeds . " I beg your pardon , " he said . Even his voice was a baritone , in contrast to Farnleigh 's harsh and rasping tenor . His walk was not exactly limping , but a bit clumsy . " I beg your pardon , " he said with grave courtesy , but with a certain oblique look of amusement , " for seeming so insistent about returning to my old home . But you will , I hope , appreciate my motives . Er  --  let me present my legal representative , Mr. Welkyn . " A fat man with somewhat protuberant eyes had got up from a chair at the other side of the table . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying them with interest ; he was glancing round the room as though he were recognizing and drinking in every detail . " Let 's get down to business , " said Farnleigh abruptly . " I think you 've met Burrows . This is Mr. Page . This is my wife . " " I have met ? " said the claimant , hesitating and then looking full at Molly ? " your wife . Forgive me if I do not know quite how to address her . I ca n't call her Lady Farnleigh . And I ca n't call her Molly , as I used to do when she wore hairribbons . " Neither of the Farnleighs commented . Molly was calm but flushed , and there was a dry strain about her eyes . " Also , " went on the claimant , " I should like to thank you for taking this very awkward and unpleasant business in such good part ? " " I do n't , " snapped Farnleigh . " I take it in devilish damned bad part , and you might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't throw you out of the house is because my own solicitor seems to think we ought to be tactful . All right : speak up . What have you got to say ? " Mr. Welkyn moved out from the table , clearing his throat . " My client , Sir John Farnleigh ? " he began . " One moment , " interposed Burrows , with equal suavity . Page seemed to hear a faint hiss as legal axes began to grind ; as forensic sleeves were rolled up ; as the conversation was being geared to the pace these gentlemen would have it take . " May I request , for the sake of convenience , that we refer to your client by some other name ? He chose to give the name of Patrick Gore . ' " " I should prefer , " said Welkyn , " to refer to him simply as my client . ' Will that be satisfactory ? " " Perfectly . " " Thank you . I have here , " pursued Welkyn , opening his brief-case , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client wishes to be fair . While under the necessity of pointing out that the present holder has no claim to the title and estates , nevertheless my client remembers the circumstances under which the imposture was begun . He also recognizes the present holder 's able stewardship and the fact that nothing but credit has been reflected on the family name . " Therefore , if the present holder will at once withdraw without making it necessary to take the matter into the courts , there will be , of course , no question of prosecution . To the contrary , my client is willing to make some financial compensation to the present holder : let us say an annuity of one thousand pounds a year for life . My client has ascertained that the present holder 's wife  --  nee Miss Mary Bishop  --  has inherited a fortune in her own right ; and the question of  | straitened finances should not , therefore , arise . Of course , I confess that should the present holder 's wife care to question the validity of the marriage on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under Farnleigh 's eyes . " God ! " he said . " Of all the brazen , bare-faced Nathaniel Burrows made a noise which was too polite to be called shushing , but it restrained Farnleigh . " May I suggest , Mr. Welkyn , " Burrows replied , " that we are here at the moment to determine whether your client has a claim ? Until that is determined , any other considerations do not arise . " " As you please . My client , " said Welkyn , with a disdainful movement of his shoulders , " merely wished to avoid unpleasantness . Mr. Kennet Murray should be with us in a few minutes . After that I fear the result will be no longer in doubt . If the present holder persists in his attitude , then I am afraid the consequences will be ? " " Look here , " Farnleigh interposed again , " let 's cut the cackle and get down to the horses . " The claimant smiled , which seemed to turn his eyes inwards with some secret joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudo-gentility is so grafted on him that he can not bring himself to say ' osses . " " It does n't bring him to giving cheap insults , in any case , " said Molly ; and now it was the claimant who showed a slight flush . " I beg your pardon . I should not have said that . But you must remember , " said the claimant , his tone again changing a little , " that I have dwelt among wicked ways , and hardly by the springs of Dove . Have I leave to present my own case in my own way ? "  | " Yes , " said Farnleigh . " Shut up , " he added to both lawyers . " This is a personal matter now . " As though by common consent they all moved towards the table and took chairs . The claimant sat with his back to the great window . For a time he remained thoughtful , absently patting the slight thinning patch that showed in the crown of his dark hair . Then he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round his eyes . " I am John Farnleigh , " he began with great simplicity and apparent earnestness . " Kindly do not interrupt me with legal quibbles at this time ; I am presenting my case , and am entitled to call myself the Cham of Tartary if I feel so inclined . However , I really do happen to be John Farnleigh , and I will tell you what happened to me . " As a boy I may have been something of a young swine ; though even now I am not certain I did not have the right attitude . My late father , Dudley Farnleigh , would put up my hackles just as much if he were alive now . No , I can not say I was wrong , except that I should have learned more giveand-take . I quarreled with my elders for pointing out that I was young , I quarreled with my tutors because I despised every subject in which I was not interested . " To get down to business , you know why I left here . I sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , I spent as much time as I could with the steerage passengers . Not , you understand , because I felt any particular liking for the steerage passengers , but simply because I hated my own crowd in first-class . This is not a defence , you know : it is a psychological account which I think you will find convincing . " In the steerage I met a Rumanian-English boy , about my own age , who was going out alone to the States . He interested i  | me . His father  --  who could never afterwards be found  --  he said was an English gentleman . His mother was a Rumanian girl , a snake-dancer at a travelling circus in England during the times when she was not drinking . There came a time when real snakes would not mix with imaginary ones , and the woman was reduced to the position of part-time cook in the circus mess-tent . The boy became a nuisance . An old admirer of hers was doing well in a small way with a circus in America , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would be taught to ride a bicycle on the tight-rope , he would be taught  --  and how I envied him . Lord of saints and snakes , HOW I envied him ! Will any right-minded boy or man blame me ? " The claimant shifted a little in his chair . He seemed to be looking back cynically , yet with a certain satisfaction ; and none of the others moved . The suave Mr. Welkyn , who seemed about to interpose with a comment or suggestion , looked quickly round at the group of faces and remained silent . " The odd part of it , " continued the speaker , examining his fingernails , " was that this boy envied me . His name ( which was something unpronounceable ) he had changed to Patrick Gore ' because he liked the sound of it . He disliked circus life . He disliked the movement and the change and the din and the upset . He hated stakes driven in overnight to be pulled up in the morning , and elbows in your face at the soup-kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a reserved , cold-faced , well-mannered little bounder . The first time we met we flew at each other and fought until half the steerage had to drag us apart . I am afraid that I was so enraged I wanted to go at him afterwards with my clasp-knife . He sim-  | ply bowed to me and walked away ; I can see him yet. ? I am referring , my friend , to you . " He glanced up at Farnleigh . " This ca n't be real , " Farnleigh said suddenly , and passed his hand across his forehead , " I do n't believe it . It 's a nightmare . Are you seriously suggesting ? " " Yes , " agreed the other , with a decisive snap . " We discussed how pleasant it would be if we could swap identities . Only as a wild dream of let 's pretend , of course : at that moment . You said it would never work , though you looked as though you would like to murder me to get it . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing ; the interesting point is that you did mean it . I used to give you information about myself . I used to tell you , Now if you met my Aunt So-and-So or my Cousin This-and-that , this is what you must say to them , ' and lord it over you in a way that I do not like to remember : for this is no justification of my behaviour there . I thought you were a prig and I still think so . I also showed you my diary . I always kept a diary , for the simple reason that there was nobody on earth I could talk to . I still keep one . " Here the claimant glanced up almost whimsically . " Do you remember me , Patrick ? Do you remember the night the Titanic went down ? " There was a pause . On Farnleigh 's face there was no expression of anger : only of bewilderment . " I keep telling you , " he said , " that you 're mad . " " When we struck that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell you exactly what I was doing . I was down in the cabin I shared with poor old Murray , while he was in the smoking-room playing bridge . Murray kept a flask of brandy  | in one of his coats ; and I was sampling it because they would not serve me in the bar . " I scarcely felt it when we struck ; I question if anybody did . There was a very slight bump , hardly enough to spill a filled cocktail-glass on a table ; and then the stopping of the engines . I only went out into the alleyway because I wondered why the engines had stopped . The first I knew of it came from the noise of voices getting louder and closer ; and then a woman suddenly running past screaming with a blue quilt wrapped round her shoulders . " For the first time the claimant hesitated . " I am not going to bring back old tragedies by saying anything more about that part of it , " he said , opening and shutting his hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , even as a boy : I rather enjoyed it . I was not in the least frightened . I was exhilarated . It was something out of the common , something to take away the ordinary sameness of everyday life ; and I had always been looking for things like that . And I was so wild with excitement that I agreed to change identities with Patrick Gore . The determination seemed to come to me all at once , though I am wondering if he had thought about it for a long time . " I met Gore  --  I met you , " amplified the speaker , looking at his host steadily , " on B Deck . You had all your possessions in a little straw suitcase . You told me quite coolly that the ship was going down , and going down fast : if I really wanted to change identities , it might be managed in the confusion , or if either of us survived . I said , what about Murray ? You lied , saying that Murray was overboard and dead already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus-performer , so we  | changed : clothes , papers , rings , everything . You even got my diary . " Farnleigh said nothing . " Afterwards , " added the claimant , without altering the tone of his voice , " you were very neat . We were ready to run for the boats . You waited until my back was turned ; then you fished out the steward 's wooden mallet you had stolen , you caught me on the back of the skull with it , and you tried with three blows to finish the work . " Farnleigh still said nothing . Molly got up from her chair ; but , at a gesture from him , she sat down again . " Mind you , " insisted the claimant , with a movement as though he were flicking dust from the table , " I am not here to bring that up against you . Twenty-five years is a long time , and you were a boy then , though I am wondering into what sort of man you have grown . I was considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despised me and believed you had justification . You need not have been so thorough , because I should have assumed your identity in any case . Still  --  even if I was the black sheep of the family , I was never quite so black as that . " The rest of it will be clear to you . By what I must insist was a stroke of luck I was found , damaged but alive , and pushed into the last surviving boat . The casualty lists were at first uncertain , and America is a large country , and I was for some time in the world of shadows . Both the names of John Farnleigh and Patrick Gore appeared as missing . I thought you were dead , as you thought I was . When my possessions and papers identified me as Patrick Gore to Mr. Boris Yeldritch , the circus-proprietor  --  who had never seen you  --  I was entirely content .  | " If I did not like the life , I thought , I could always reveal myself . Perhaps I should have better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead . The prospect pleased me ; it was a dramatic card in reserve ; and , believe me , it gave me many comforting nights . " " And , " said Molly as though with elaborate interest , " did you become the trick bicycle-rider of the circus ? " The claimant turned his head sideways . His dark grey eye was kindled with such strong inner amusement that he resembled a crafty small boy . Again he lifted his hand and rubbed the thinning patch on the crown of his head . " No . No , although I had my first sensational success with the circus , I became something else . For the moment I should prefer not to tell you what it was . In addition to the fact that it is an excellent secret , I do not wish to bore you with details of my subsequent life . " Believe me , I had always intended one day to return to my old home and astonish them with the baaing of a black sheep from the grave . For I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt that this would make my brother Dudley writhe . But this dramatic plum I reserved . I even visited England without being too much tempted . For , mind you , I had no reason to suspect that John Farnleigh ' was alive . I thought he was supposed to be dead , instead of flourishing in Colorado . " You will therefore understand my surprise , some six months ago , when quite by chance I picked up an illustrated paper and saw the picture of Sir John and Lady Farnleigh . My brother Dudley , I noted , was dead of a surfeit of lampreys . His younger brother ' had inherited . At first I thought this  | must be the mistake of the paper for some distant connection . But a few inquiries uncovered the truth ; and after all , you know , I am the heir . Still a young man  --  still vigorous  --  but not revengeful . " Such things grow exceedingly dim . A generation has grown up ; there arc a thousand good memories between me and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaman 's mallet and who , I hear , has become a useful citizen since . All the trees look the same ; but my eyes have changed . I feel strange and raw in my own home . I am not sure that I shall make the best possible patron for the local cricket-club or the local Boy Scouts . But I have ( as you observe ) a strong weakness for making speeches , and I daresay I shall get on well enough . Now , Patrick Gore , you have heard my proposal . It is generous enough . If I take you to court , I warn you I will have your hide . In the meantime , gentlemen , I am open to answer questions from anyone who has ever known me . I have a few questions to put myself , and I will defy Gore to answer them . " For a time after he had spoken , it was quiet in the darkening room . He had an almost hypnotic voice . But they were looking at Farnleigh , who had risen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dark face there was quiet , and relief , and a certain curiosity as he examined his guest . He brushed a hand under his cropped moustache ; he almost smiled . Molly saw that smile , and drew a deep breath . " You have something to say , John ? " she prompted . " Yes . I do n't know why he 's come here with this story , or what he hopes to get out of it . But what this man says is absolutely false from beginning to end . "  | " You intend to fight ? " asked the claimant with interest . " Of course I mean to fight , you ass . Or , rather , I 'll let you do the fighting . " Mr. Welkyn seemed about to intervene , with a vast throatclearing , but the claimant stopped him . " No , no , " he said comfortably . " Please stay out of this , Welkyn . You brethren of the law are all very well to put in the whereases ' and the proceed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal skirmish like this . To tell the truth , I shall enjoy this . Well , let us apply a few tests . I wonder if you would mind calling your butler in here ? " Farnleigh frowned . " But look here : Knowles was n't ? " " Why not do as he asks , John ? " suggested Molly sweetly . Farnleigh caught her look ; and , if there is a paradox which can be called humourless humour , his sharp features showed it . He rang for Knowles , who entered in the same uncertain way . The claimant regarded him musingly . " I thought I recognized you when we came in here , " the claimant said . " You were here in my father 's time , were you not ? " " Sir ? " " You were here in my father 's , Sir Dudley Farnleigh 's , time . Were n't you ? " An expression of disgust went over Farnleigh 's face . " You will do your case no good by this , " interposed Nathaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time was Stenson , who has been dead ? " " Yes . I was aware of that , " said the claimant , turning his eyes sideways . Then he contemplated the butler , sitting back and crossing his legs with some effort . " Your name is Knowles .  | In my father 's time you were the butler at old Colonel Mardale 's place , over in Frettenden . You used to keep two rabbits that the colonel knew nothing about . You kept them in a corner of the coach-house nearest the orchard . One of the rabbits was named Billy . " He looked up . " Ask this gentleman the name of the other . " Knowles had gone slightly pink . " Ask him , will you ? " " Rot ! " snapped Farnleigh , and drew himself back into his dignity again . " Oh , " said the claimant . " You mean you can not answer ? " " I mean I do n't choose to answer . " Yet six pairs of eyes were fastened on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost stuttered . " Who can be expected to remember the name of a rabbit after twenty-five years ? All right , all right : stop a bit ! There was some nonsense about their names , I remember . Let me think . Billy and W  --  no , that 's not it . Billy and Silly , that 's it ? Or was it ? I 'm not sure . " " That is correct , sir , " Knowles told him with an air of relief . The claimant was not out of countenance . " Well , let us try again . Now , Knowles . One evening in summer  --  it was the year before I went away  --  you were going through that same orchard to take a message to a certain neighbour . You were surprised and rather shocked to find me making love to a certain young lady of twelve or thirteen . Ask your employer the name of that young lady . " Farnleigh was dark and heavy-looking . " I do n't remember any such incident . " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimant ,  | " that your natural chivalry restrains you ? No , my friend , that will not do . It was a long time ago and I give you my solemn word that nothing of a compromising nature passed . Knowles , you remember what went on in the apple-orchard , do n't you ? " " Sir , " said the bedevilled butler , " I " You do . But I thought this man would not remember it , because I do not think I entered the fact in my valuable diary . What was the name of the young lady ? " Farnleigh nodded . " All right , " he answered with an attempt at lightness . " It was Miss Dane , Madeline Dane . " " Madeline Dane ? " began Molly . For the first time the claimant seemed a little taken aback . His quick eyes moved round the group , and his quick intuition seemed to move too . " She must have written to you in America , " returned the claimant . " We shall have to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have committed no blunder ? I hope the young lady is not still living in the district at a more mature age , and that I have not touched on any inconvenient subject ? " " Damn you , " said Farnleigh suddenly , " I 've stood about enough of this . I ca n't keep my temper much longer . Will you kindly get out of here ? " " No , " said the other . " I mean to break down your bluff . For it is a bluff , my boy , and you know it . Besides , I think it was agreed that we should wait for Kennet Murray . " " Suppose we do wait for Murray ? " Farnleigh spoke with toiling lucidity . " Where will it get us ? What will it prove , beyond this fiddle-faddle of questions to which we both apparently know the answers ? And yet you do n't know the answers , because you 're the one who is bluffing . I could ask  | some myself , just as nonsensical as yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove a thing like this . How do you still think you can prove it ? " The claimant sat back , richly enjoying his position . " By the incontrovertible evidence of fingerprints , " he said . Chapter IV  | IT WAS as though the man had been keeping this in reserve , waiting for the proper moment to say it and savouring triumph in advance . He seemed a little disappointed that he had to produce the trump so early , and under circumstances less dramatic than he might have wished . But the others were not thinking of it in terms of drama . Brian Page heard Burrows breathe in with a shaky kind of noise . Burrows got to his feet . " I was not informed of this , " the solicitor said fiercely . " But you guessed it ? " smiled fat Mr. Welkyn . " It is not my business to guess at anything , " returned Burrows . " I repeat , sir , I have not been informed of this . I have heard nothing about fingerprints . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his own counsel . But , " inquired Welkyn , with rich suavity , " does the present holder need to be told ? If he is the real Sir John Farnleigh , surely he remembers that Mr. Murray took the fingerprints of the boy as long ago as the year nineteen ten or eleven . " " I repeat , sir ? " " Let me repeat , Mr. Burrows : did you need to be informed of it ? What does the present holder himself have to say ? " Farnleigh 's expression seemed to have retreated , to have  | become locked up . As usual when he was among mental brambles , he did two things . He began to walk round the room with short , quick steps ; and he took a key-ring out of his pocket and twirled it round his forefinger . " Sir John ! " " Eh ? " " Do you remember , " asked Burrows , " any such circumstanccs as Mr. Welkyn mentions ? Did Mr. Murray ever take your fingerprints ? " " Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no importance . " Yes , I remember it now . I 'd forgotten it . But it occurred to me when I was talking to you and my wife a while ago ? you know . I wondered if that could be it , and it made me a whole lot easier in my mind . Yes , old Murray got my fingerprints right enough . " The claimant turned round . He wore an expression not only of mild astonishment , but of sudden and wondering suspicion as well . " This will not do , you know , " the claimant said . " You do n't maintain that you will face the test of fingerprints ? " " Face it ? Face it ? " repeated Farnleigh , with grim pleasure . " Man , it 's the best thing that could have happened . You 're the impostor , and you know it . Murray 's old fingerprint test ? by George , now I come to think of it , I can remember every detail of that business ! ? will settle matters . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals looked at each other . For some time Brian Page had been trying to put weights into a scales which would not remain still . He had been trying , without friendship or prejudice , to see where the imposture  | lay . The issue was simple . If Patrick Gore ( to give him the name by which he had been announced ) were the impostor , he was one of the coolest and most smooth-faced crooks who ever walked into another man 's house . If the present John Farnleigh were the impostor , he was not only a slippery criminal behind that naive , straightforward mask : he was a would-be murderer as well . There was a pause . " You know , my friend , " observed the claimant , as though with refreshed interest , " I admire your cheek . One moment , please . I do not say that as a baiting jeer or to start a row . I state , as a matter of simple fact , that I admire an aes-triplex cheek which Casanova himself could not have equalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the fingerprints . They were taken at a time before I began to keep my diary . But to say you forgot them : to SAY you forgot them " Well , what 's wrong with that ? " " John Farnleigh would n't or could n't have forgotten a detail of that . I , being John Farnleigh , certainly did n't . That is why Kennet Murray was the only person in the world who had any influence with me . Murray on Footprints . Murray on Disguises . Murray on the Disposal of the Body . Wough ! And particularly Murray on Fingerprints , which were then the newest scientific craze . I am aware , " ? he interrupted himself , raising his voice and looking round the group , ? " that fingerprints were discovered by Sir William Herschel in the eighteen-fifties , and re-discovered by Dr. Faulds in the late seventies . But they were not admitted as legal evidence in an English court until nineteen-five , and even then the judge was dubious . It took years of argument to establish them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you say you never thought of fingerprints. "  | " You 're doing a hell of a lot of talking , " said Farnleigh , who again looked swollen and dangerous . " Naturally . Though you never once thought of fingerprints before , it all comes back to you now . Tell me this . When the prints were taken , how were they taken ? " " How ? " " In what form ? " Farnleigh pondered . " On a sheet of glass , " he said . " Nonsense . They were taken in a Thumbograph , ' a little book which was quite a popular game or toy at the time . A little grey book . Murray had a lot of others , my father 's and my mother 's and anybody else 's he could get . " " Stop a bit . Hold on . I believe there was a book  --  we sat over in that window ? " " So you profess to remember now . " " Look here , " said Farnleigh quietly , " who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fellow in the music-halls , the one you shoot questions at and he instantly tells you the number of clauses in the Magna Charta or what horse ran second in the Derby in 1882 ? That 's what you sound like . There 's a lot of rubbish that 's better forgotten . People change . They change , I tell you . " " But not their basic characters , as you profess to have changed . That is the point I am making . You can not turn your whole soul inside out , you know . " During this controversy Mr. Welkyn had been sitting back with a massive gravity but with a certain complacence which beamed forth from his protuberant blue eyes . Now he lifted his hand . " Gentlemen , gentlemen . Surely this wrangling is not  --  er ?  | seemly , if you will allow me to say so ? The matter , I am glad to say , can be settled within a very short time " I still insist , " snapped Nathaniel Burrows , " that , not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , in the interests of Sir John Farnleigh ? " " Mr. Burrows , " said the claimant calmly , " you must have guessed it , even if we did not choose to tell you . I suspect you guessed it from the first , and that is why you tolerated this claim . You are trying to save your face on both sides , whether your man should turn out to be a fraud or whether he should not . Well , you had better come over to our side soon . " Farnleigh stopped pacing . He tossed up the key-ring , caught it with a flat smack against his palm , and closed his long fingers round it . " Is that true ? " he asked Burrows . " If it were true , Sir John , I should have been compelled to take other steps . At the same time , it is my duty to investigate ? " " That 's all right , " said Farnleigh . " I only wanted to know where my friends stand . I 'm not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them have kept me awake at nights : I 'll keep to myself . Just bring on your fingerprints , and then we shall see . The point is , where is Murray ? Why is n't he here ? " The claimant wore a look of Mephistophelian pleasure , in which he contrived to suggest a sinister frown . " If events ran according to form , " he answered with relish , " Murray would already have been murdered and his body hidden in the pond in the garden . ( There is still a pond there , is n't there ? I thought so . ) As a matter of sober fact , I believe  | he is on his way here now . Besides , I do not wish to put ideas into anybody 's head . " " Ideas ? " said Farnleigh . " Yes . Like your old one . A quick cosh and an easy life . " The way he spoke seemed to put an unpleasant chill in the air . Farnleigh 's voice went high and rasping . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his old tweed coat , as though in a nervous gesture of controlling himself . With uncanny skill his opponent seemed to pick out exactly the sentences that would sting him . Farnleigh had rather a long neck , which was now much in evidence . " Does anybody believe that ? " he got out . " Molly  --  Page ? Burrows  --  do you believe that ? " " Nobody believes it , " answered Molly , with level eyes . " You 're being foolish to let him put you off balance , which is exactly what he 's trying to do . " The claimant turned an interested look on her . " You too , madam ? " " Me too , what ? " asked Molly , and then grew furiously annoyed with herself . " Sorry to sound like a musical scale , but you know what I mean . " " You believe your husband is John Farnleigh ? " " I know it . " " How ? " " I 'm afraid I must answer woman 's intuition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible by it : something that in its own way , and within its own limits , is always right . I knew it the moment I saw him again . Of course I am willing to listen to reasons , but they have got to be the right sort of reasons . " " Are you in love with him , may I ask ? "  | This time Molly flushed under her tan , but she treated the question in her usual way . " Well , let 's say that I am rather fond of him , if you like . " " Exactly . Ex-actly . You are fond ' of him ; you will always be fond ' of him , I think . You get on and you will get on very well together . But you are not in love with him and you did not fall in love with him . You fell in love with me . That is to say , you fell in love with an imaginary projection of me from your childhood , which surrounded the impostor when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Welkyn , like a master of ceremonies to a rowdy banquet . He seemed rather shocked . Brian Page entered the conversation : with broad amusement , to steady their host . " Now we 're being psychoanalytic , " Page said . " Look here , Burrows , what are we to do with this flower of something-or-other ? " " I only know that we are putting in an awkward half-hour , " returned Burrows coldly . " Also , we are straying from the point again . " " Not at all , " the claimant assured him . The claimant seemed genuinely anxious to please . " I hope I have n't said anything to offend anybody again ? You should live with a circus ; your skins would grow tougher . However . I appeal to you , sir , " he looked at Page . " Do n't I state a reasonable proposition with regard to this lady ? You may make an objection . You may say that , in order to fix her affections on me as a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , of Miss Madeline Dane ? Was that your objection ? " Molly laughed .  | " No , " said Page . " I was n't thinking of either a support or an objection . I was thinking of your mysterious profession . " " My profession ? " " The unspecified profession you mentioned , the one you first made a success of at the circus . I ca n't decide whether you are ( I ) a fortune-teller , ( 2 ) a psychoanalyst , ( 3 ) a memory-expert , ( 4 ) a conjuror , or even a combination of them . There are mannerisms of them all about you , and much more besides . You are a little too suggestive of Mephistopheles in Kent . You do n't belong here . You disturb things , somehow , and you give me a pain in the neck . " The claimant seemed pleased . " Do I ? You all need to be stirred up a bit , " he declared . " Regarding my profession , I am perhaps a little of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am : I am John Farnleigh . " Across the room the door opened , and Knowles entered . " Mr. Kennet Murray to see you , sir , " he said . There was a pause . By a trick of the fading light , a last fiery glow of sunset shifted in through the trees and the high window-panes . It kindled the heavy room ; then it subsided to a steady , warm light which was just bright enough to make faces and figures a little more than visible . Kennet Murray himself had been remembering many things in that mid-summer dusk . He was a tall , lean , rather shambling man , who , in spite of a first-rate intelligence , had never been cut out to be a particular success at anything . Though he was hardly fifty , his fair moustache and fair beard , so closely cropped that they looked like stubble , were greyish . He had aged , as Burrows had said ; he had grown leaner and more sour out of his former easy good-nature . But there was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as he ambled into the library . His eyes had the slightly squinted-up look of one who lives under hot suns . Then he stopped , frowning as though at a book , and drawing himself up . And , to one of the contestants for the estate , old days returned with old memories and fierce bitterness against dead people ; yet Murray himself did not look a day older . Murray stood studying the persons before him . He frowned , then he looked quizzical  --  the eternal tutor  --  and then grim . He fixed his eyes at a point midway between the holder and the claimant . " Well , young Johnny ? " he said .  | Chapter V FoR a second or two neither of the contestants moved or spoke . First it seemed that each was waiting to see what the other would do ; and then each went his separate way , Farnleigh moved his shoulder slightly , as though he would not enter this as a debate , but he consented to nod and gesture and even smile stiffly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimant , after a slight hesitation , showed no such views . He spoke with quiet affability . " Good evening , Murray , " he said ; and Brian Page , who knew the ways of students towards their former schoolmasters , suddenly felt the scale-pans dip towards Farnleigh . Murray looked round . " Someone  --  er  --  had better present me , " he said in a pleasant voice . It was Farnleigh , stung out of apathy , who did this . By tacit consent Murray was the " old man " of the group , though he was a good deal younger than Welkyn ; there was something of the " old man 's " manner about him : something brisk and assured , yet wandering . He sat down at the head of the table , with the light behind his back . Then he gravely fitted on a  | pair of owlish shell-rimmed reading glasses , and surveyed them . " I should never have recognized Miss Bishop or Mr. Burrows , " he went on . " Mr. Welkyn I know slightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my first real holiday in a long time . " Welkyn , evidently well satisfied , thought that the time had now come for him to take charge and get down to real business . " Exactly . Now , Mr. Murray , my client " Oh , tut , tut , tut ! " said Murray , rather testily . " Let me get my breath and talk a moment , as old Sir Dudley used to say . " It was as though he wanted to get his breath literally , for he breathed deeply several times , looked round the room , and then at the two opponents . " However , I must say you seem to have landed yourself in the middle of a very bad mess . The affair has not become public property , has it ? " " No , " said Burrows . " And you , of course , have not said anything about it ? " Murray frowned . " There I must plead guilty . I have mentioned it to one person . But , when you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will object . It was my old friend Dr. Gideon Fell , a former schoolmaster like myself , of whose connection with detective work you may have heard . I saw him as I was passing through London . And I  --  er  --  mention this to give you a word of warning . " Despite Murray 's benevolence , his squinted grey eyes became bright and hard and interested . " It is possible that Dr. Fell himself may soon be in this part of the world . You know that there is another man staying at the Bull and Butcher besides myself , a man of inquisitive habits ? "  | " The private detective ? " Farnleigh asked sharply , and to the ostensible surprise of the claimant . " So it took you in ? " said Murray . " He is an official detective from Scotland Yard . It was Dr. Fell 's idea . Dr. Fell maintained that the best way to conceal your identity as an official detective is to act like a private detective . " Though Murray seemed hugely delighted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice of the Chief Constable of Kent , seem to be curious about the death of Miss Victoria Daly here last summer . " Sensation . Nathaniel Burrows , who looked fussed , made a vague gesture . " Miss Daly was killed by a tramp , " Burrows said , " later killed himself in escaping the police . " " I hope so . However , I heard it in passing when I mentioned my own little problem in mixed identities to Dr. Fell . He was interested . " Again Murray 's voice became sharp ; and , if the word can be used , opaque . " Now , young Johnny Even the air of the room seemed to be waiting . The claimant nodded . The host also nodded , but Page thought that there was a faint glitter of sweat on his forehead . " Ca n't we get on with this ? " Farnleigh demanded . " It 's no good playing cat and mouse , Mr. ? it 's no good playing cat and mouse , Murray . It 's not decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got those fingerprints , trot ' em out and then we shall see . " Murray 's eyes opened , and then narrowed . He sounded annoyed . " So you know about that . I was reserving it . And may I  | ask , " his voice grew professionally poised and sarcastic , " which of you thought that the final test would be fingerprints ? " " I think I can establish that honour , " answered the claimant , looking round as though inquiringly . " My friend Patrick Gore here claims to have remembered it afterwards . But he seems to have been under the impression that you took fingerprints on a sheet of glass . " " And so I did , " said Murray . " That 's a lie , " said the claimant . It was an unexpected change of voice . Brian Page suddenly realized that , under his mild and Mephistophelian airs , the claimant concealed a violent temper . " Sir , " said Murray , looking him up and down , " I am not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days returned ; the claimant seemed involuntarily about to move back and beg Murray 's pardon . But he conquered this . His face smoothed itself out , and the usual mocking expression reappeared . " Let us say , then , that I have an alternative suggestion . You took my fingerprints in a Thumbograph . ' You had several such Thumbographs ; you bought them in Tunbridge Wells . And you took the fingerprints of myself and my brother Dudley on the same day . " " That , " agreed Murray , " is quite true . The Thumbograph with the fingerprints I have here . " He touched the inside breast pocket of his sports-coat . " I smell blood , " said the claimant . It was true that a different atmosphere seemed to surround the group at the table . " At the same time , " Murray went on , as though he had not heard this , " the first experiments I made with finger-  | prints were on small glass slides . " He grew even more inscrutable and sharp . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must tell me a few things . If you are Sir John Farnleigh , certain things are known to me which are known to nobody else . In those days you were an omnivorous reader . Sir Dudley , who you will admit was an enlightened man , made out a list of books which you were permitted to read . You never spoke your views on these books to anyone else : Sir Dudley once spoke a word of harmless ridicule to you about your notions , and tortures would not have opened your mouth afterwards . But you expressed yourself to me in no uncertain terms . Do you remember all that ? " " Very well indeed , " said the claimant . " Then kindly tell me which of those books you liked best , and which made the most impression on you . " " With pleasure , " answered the claimant , casting up his eyes . " All of Sherlock Holmes . All of Poe . The Cloister and the Hearth . The Count of Monte Cristo . Kidnapped . A Tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with pirates , murders , ruined castles , or ? " That will do , " said Murray noncommittally . " And the books you intensely disliked ? " " Every deadly line of Jane Austen and George Eliot . All snivelling school-stories about the honour of the school ' and so on . All useful ' books telling you how to make mechanical things or run them . All animal-stories . I may add that these , in general , are still my views . " Brian Page was beginning to like the claimant . " Let us take the younger children who were hereabouts , " Murray continued . " For instance , the present Lady Farnleigh ,  | whom I used to know as little Molly Bishop . If you are John Farnleigh , what was your private nickname for her ? " " The gipsy , ' " answered the claimant instantly . " Why ? " " Because she was always tanned , and was always playing with the children in the gipsy tribe that used to camp at the other side of the Chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . " And Mr. Burrows , there  --  what was your nickname for him ? " " Uncas . " " The reason for that ? " " At any I-Spy games , or things like that , he could slide through the shrubbery without making a sound . " " Thank you . And now for you , sir . " Murray turned to Farnleigh , and eyed him as though he were about to tell him to straighten his tie . " I do not wish to convey the impression that I am playing cat-and-mouse . So I have only one question for you before I proceed to take the fingerprints . On this question , actually , will depend my private judgment before I see the proof in the prints . The question is this . What is the Red Book of Appin ? " It was almost dark in the library . The heat was still strong , but a small breeze had begun to stir with sundown . It moved through the one or two opened panes of the windows ; and the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  smile moved across Farnleigh 's face . He nodded . Taking a notebook and a little gold pencil from his pocket , he tore out a sheet and wrote some words on it . This he folded up and pushed across to Murray .  | " It has never caught me , " Farnleigh said . And then : " Is that the right answer ? " " That is the right answer , " agreed Murray . He looked at the claimant . " You , sir : will you answer the same question ? " For the first time the claimant seemed uncertain . His gaze flashed from Farnleigh to Murray with an expression which Page could not read . Without a word he beckoned flatly for the notebook and pencil , which Farnleigh handed over . The claimant wrote only two or three words before he ripped out the sheet and gave it to Murray . " And now , gentlemen , " said Murray , rising . " I think we can take the fingerprints . Here I have the original Thumbograph : much aged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . are two white cards . If you will just  --  may I have some light , please ? " It was Molly who went across and touched the electric switch beside the door . In the library there was a chandelier in tiers of wrought iron which had once supported crowns of candles ; now there were small electric bulbs , not all of which worked , so that the light was not overly bright . But it pushed back the summer night ; a hundred little reflections of bulbs were thrown back from the window-panes ; and the hooks on the tall shelves looked more grimy still . On the table Murray had spread out his paraphernalia . The Thumbograph , at which they all looked first , was a rickety little book with grey paper covers grown thin from use : the title in red letters , and a large red print of a thumb underneath . " An old friend , " said Murray , patting it . " Now , gentlemen . Rolled ' prints arc better than flat ones ; but I did not bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want only your left thumbprint ; there is only one  | print to compare . Here is a handkerchief with an end doused in benzoline : it will take away the perspiration . Use it . Next ? " It was done . During that time Page 's heart was in his mouth ; he could not have said why . But they were all in unnatural states of agitation . For some reason Farnleigh insisted on rolling up his sleeve before making the print , as though he were going to have a blood-transfusion . The mouths of both solicitors , Page was glad to observe , were open . Even the claimant used the handkerchief briskly before he leaned against the table . But what impressed Page most was the confidence of both contestants . The wild thought occurred to Page : suppose those two thumb-prints turn out to be exactly alike ? The chances of this happening , he recalled , were just one in sixty-four thousand millions . All the same , nobody faltered or cried off before the test . Nobody ? Murray had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and markings at the foot of each white ( unglazed ) card . Then he blotted them carefully , while the contestants wiped their fingers . " Well ? " demanded Farnleigh . " Well ! Now if you will be good enough to give me a quarter of an hour to myself , I can get down to work . Forgive my unsociability ; but I realize the importance of this as much as you do . " Burrows blinked . " But ca n't you  --  that is , are n't you going to tell us ? ? " " My good sir , " said Murray , whose own nerves appeared to be feeling the strain , " are you under the impression that a glance at these prints will be enough to compare them ?  | Especially with the print of a boy done in faded ink twentyfive years ago ? They will require many points of agreement . It can be done , but a quarter of an hour is an unnaturally modest estimate . Double that : you will be nearer the truth . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low chuckle . " I expected that , " he said . " But I warn you , it is unwise . I smell blood . You will have to be murdered . No , do n't scowl ; twenty-five years ago you would have relished the position and revelled in your own importance . " " I see nothing funny in the matter . " " In point of fact , there is nothing funny in it . Here you sit in a lighted room , with a wall of windows giving on a dark garden and a screen of trees and the devil whispering behind every leaf . Be careful . " " Well , " returned Murray , with a faint smile creeping round his moustache and into his beard , " in that case I shall take all care . The more nervous of you can keep an eye on me through the window . Now you must excuse me . " They went out into the hall , and he closed the door on them . Then six persons stood and looked at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleasant hall ; Knowles stood at the door of the dining-room , in the " new " wing which had been built out at the back from the centre of the house , like the body of the letter T with its head as the front . Molly Farnleigh , though flushed and strained , tried to speak coolly . " Do n't you think we had better have something to eat ? " she said . " I 've ordered a cold buffet prepared . After all , there 's no reason why we should n't carry on as usual . " " Thank you , " said Welkyn , relieved ; " I should like a sandwich . "  | " Thank you , " said Burrows ; " I am not hungry . " " Thank you , " said the claimant , to swell the chorus . " Whether I accepted or refused , it would sound equally bad . I am going somewhere to smoke a long , strong , black cigar ; and then I am going to see that no harm comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him in the hall there was a door giving on that part of the garden overlooked by the library windows . He studied his guests with a long , careful scrutiny ; then he opened the glass door and went out into the garden . In the same way Page presently found himself deserted . The only person in sight was Welkyn , who stood in the dimly lighted dining-room and ate fish-paste sandwiches with great steadiness . Page 's watch said that it was twenty minutes past nine o'clock . He hesitated , and then followed Farnleigh out into the cool dimness of the garden . This side of the garden seemed shut off from the world , and formed an oblong some eighty feet long by forty feet broad . On one side it was closed in by the new wing ; on the other by a stretch of high yew hedge . Through the beech trees the library windows spread out a faint and broken wall of light from the narrow side of the oblong . In the new wing , too , the dining-room had glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the bedroom windows above . Inspired by King William the Third at Hampton Court , a seventeenth-century Farnleigh had laid out the garden in severe curves and angles of yew hedge , with broad sanded walks between . The hedges were built waist-high ; it was , in fact , very much like the foundation of a maze . Though you had no actual difficulty in finding your way about the garden ,  | it would be ( Page had always thought ) a rare place for hiding-games if you kept down below the line of the hedges . In the centre was a large round open space , buttressed with rose-trees ; and this space in turn enclosed an ornamental pool some ten feet in diameter , with a very low coping . In the uncertainty between the lights , with faint gleams from the house meeting a faint afterglow from the west , it was a secret and fragrant place . Yet for some reason Page had never liked the feel of that garden . With this thought came another , a more unpleasant one . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedges , shrubs , flowers , and soil , which could inspire disquiet . It may have been that the minds and thoughts of everyone here were concentrated so fiercely on the library , moving against that lighted box like moths on the glass . Of course , it was absurd to suppose that anything could happen to Murray . Things are not managed like that ; they are not so convenient ; it was only the claimant 's hynotic personality which had been able to worm in the suggestion . " However , " Page almost said aloud , " I think I might just stroll past the window and have a look . " He did so , and jerked back with muttered profanity , for someone else had been having a look as well . He did not see who the other person was , because the other person drew away from the screen of beeches against the library windows . But Page saw Kennet Murray inside , sitting at the library table with his back to the windows , and Murray seemed to be just opening a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked quickly out into the cool garden . He skirted the round pool , looking up at a single  | clear star ( Madeline Dane had a poetic name for it ) which you could see just above a cluster of chimneys in the new wing . Working his way through the low labyrinth , he reached the far end in labyrinthine thought . Well , was Farnleigh the impostor , or the other fellow ? Page did not know ; and he had changed his mind so many times in the past two hours that he did not like to guess . Then , too , there had been the persistent , accidental introduction at every turn of the name of Madeline Dane At the end of this side of the garden there was a laurel hedge which screened a stone bench from the house . He sat down and lighted a cigarette . Tracing his thoughts back as honestly as he could , he admitted to himself that a part of his grouse at the universe was the persistent recurrence of Madeline Dane 's name . Madeline Dane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her surname , was the person who mixed up the " Lives of the Chief Justices " and everything else in Page 's thoughts . He was thinking more about her than was good for him . For here he was , getting on towards being a crusty bachelor Then Brian Page jumped up from the stone bench , thinking neither of Madeline nor of marriage : only of the sounds he had heard from the garden behind . They were not loud sounds , but they came with terrifying clarity out of the dim , low hedges . The choking noise was the worst : then the shuffle and scrape of feet : then the splash and thrashings . For a moment he did not want to turn round . He did not really believe that anything had happened . He never believed that . But he dropped his cigarette on the grass , set his heel on it , and walked back towards the house at a pace that was almost a run . He was some distance away  | from the house ; and in the hide-and-seek paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place seemed deserted ; next he saw Burrows ' tall figure pounding towards him , and the beam of a flashlight flickered over the hedges into his face . When he came close enough to see Burrows ' face behind the light , the coolness and fragrance of the garden were lost . " Well , it 's happened , " said Burrows . What Page felt at that moment was a slight physical nausea . " I do n't know what you mean , " he lied , " except that it ca n't have happened . " " I 'm simply telling you , that 's all , " returned a white-faced Burrows , with patient insistence . " Come along quick and help me haul him out . I ca n't swear he 's dead , but he 's lying on his face in that pond and I 'm pretty sure he 's dead . " Page stared in the direction he indicated . He could not see the pool , which was hidden by the hedges ; but he now had a good view of the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room over the library , old Knowles the butler was leaning out ; and Molly Farnleigh was on the balcony outside her bedroom windows . " I tell you , " Page insisted , " nobody would dare have a go at Murray ! It 's impossible . It 's nonsensical to  --  and , anyway , what 's Murray doing at the pond ? " " Murray ? " said the other , staring at him . " Why Murray ? Who said anything about Murray ? It 's Farnleigh , man : John Farnleigh . It was all over before I could get there ; and I 'm afraid it 's too late now . "  | Chapter VI " Bur who the devil , " Page asked , " would want to kill Farn-leigh ? " He had to adjust his thoughts . Afterwards he has acknowledged that his original notion of murder had been mere suggestion . Yet , even when another suggestion replaced it , he remembered his first thought : if this were murder , it had been ingeniously conceived . As though by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated on Kennet Murray . No person in the house had a thought in his head for anybody but Murray . No one would know where anybody had been , anybody but Murray . A person who acted in that vacuum could attack unseen , so long as he did not attack Murray . " Kill Farnleigh ? " repeated Burrows in a queer voice . " Here , this wo n't do . Wake up . Stop . Steady . Come on . " Still talking like a man giving directions for backing a car , he led the way with his lanky stride . The beam from the flashlight was steady . But he switched it off before they reached the pond , either because there was still enough light from the sky or because he did not wish to see things too clearly just then . Round the pool there was a border of packed sand some  | five feet wide . Forms , even faces , were still dimly visible . Farnleigh lay prone in the pool , turned a little towards the right as you faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep enough so that his body rocked with the water , which still slopped and splashed over the low round edge of the coping , running across packed sand . They also saw a darker dye in the water , curling upwards and spreading round him ; but they did not see the full colour of this dye until it touched a patch of white water-lilies close to the body . The slopping agitation of the water began again when Page started to haul him out ; Farnleigh 's heel just touched the edge of the low coping . But , after one minute which Page never wished to remember afterwards , Page got up . " We ca n't do him any good , " Page said . " His throat 's been cut . " The shock had not worn off yet , and they both spoke calmly . " Yes . I was afraid of that . It 's ? " " It 's murder . Or , " said Page abruptly , " suicide . " They looked at each other in the dusk . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official-mannered and human at the same time , " we 've got to get him out of there . That rule about touching nothing and waiting for the police is all very well , but we ca n't let him lie there . It 's not decent . Besides , his position has been disturbed as it is . Shall we ? ? " " Yes . " The tweed suit , now black and bulging , seemed to have I ' accumulated a ton of water . With difficulty they rolled Farnleigh over the edge , sending a minor tidal wave across them-  | selves . The peaceful evening scent of the garden , especially the roses , had never seemed more theatrically romantic than in the midst of this reality . Page kept thinking : this is John Farnleigh , and he 's dead . This is impossible . And it was impossible , except for one thought which grew clearer every second . " You mean suicide , " said Burrows , wiping his hands . " We 've had a hallucination of murder put on us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what it means ? It means he was the impostor after all . He bluffed it out as long as he could , and hoped against hope that Murray might not have the fingerprints . When the test was over he could n't face the consequences . So he came out here , stood on the edge of the pool , and ? " Burrows put up a hand to his throat . It all fitted very well . " I 'm afraid so , " admitted Page . Afraid ? Afraid ? Yes : was n't that the worst charge you could make against a dead friend , pile the whole burden on him now that he could n't speak ? Resentment rose up in a dull ache , for John Farnleigh had been his friend . " But it 's the only thing we can think . For God 's sake what happened here ? Did you see him do it ? What did he do it with ? " " No . That is , I did n't exactly see him . I was just coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd got this torch , " ? Burrows snapped the button on and off , and then held it up , ? " out of the drawer of the table in the hall . You know how weak my eyes are when I go out in the dark . Just as I was opening the door , I saw Farnleigh standing out here  --  very dimly , you know  --  on the edge of the pool , with his back towards me . Then he seemed to be doing something , or moving about a bit : with my eyesight , it 's very difficult to tell . You  | must have heard the noises . After I heard that splash  --  and the thrashing round , you know , which was worse . There never ij was a balder , worse story . " " But there was n't anybody with him ? " , , " No , " said Burrows , spreading out his fingers against his forehead and pressing the tips of them there . " Or at least ? not exactly . These hedges are waist-high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly , " spoken by the meticulously careful Nathaniel Burrows , Page did not have time to inquire . Voices and footsteps were stirring from the direction of the house , and he spoke quickly . " You 're the one with authority . They 're all coming . Molly must n't see this . Ca n't you use your authority and head ' em off ? " Burrows cleared his throat two or three times , like a nervous orator about to begin , and his shoulders straightened . Switching on the flashlight , he walked towards the house with the light pointing in that direction . Its beam picked out Molly , with Kennet Murray following ; but it did not shine on their faces . " I am sorry , " began Burrows , in tones of high and unnatural sharpness . " But there has been an accident to Sir John , and you had better not go out there ? " " Do n't be a fool , " said Molly in a hard voice . With deliberate strength she pushed past him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not see the extent of what had been done . Though she tried to give the impression of calmness , Page heard her heel turn in the path . He put an arm round her shoulder to steady her ; she leaned against it , and he felt unsteady breathing . But what she said , flung out in a sob , seemed merely cryptic . Molly said :  | " D-damn him for being right ! " By something in the tone Page knew that she could not be referring to her husband . But for a moment it so startled him that he could not take it in . Then , hiding her face even from the dark , she started in a hurried walk for the house . " Let her go , " said Murray . " It will be better for her . " But Murray did not appear as capable as you might have thought , faced with a thing of this sort . He hesitated . Taking the flashlight from Burrow 's hand , he directed its beam on the body beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth showing between cropped moustache and beard . " Did you prove , " asked Page , " that Sir John Farnleigh was of Sir John Farnleigh ? " " Eh ? I beg your pardon ? " Page repeated his question . " I have proved , " said Murray with heavy gravity , " absolutely nothing . I mean that I had not completed my comparison of the prints ; I had barely begun it . " " It would appear , " ? Burrows spoke rather weakly , ? " that you would not need to finish . " And so it would . There could not be , in all truth and reason , much doubt of Farnleigh 's suicide . Page saw that Murray was nodding , in his sometimes vague manner : nodding as though he were not thinking of the matter at all : and stroking the cheek of his beard like a man who tries to place an old memory . It was not a physical wriggling , yet it gave that impression . " But you ca n't have much doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which one of them did you think was the fake ? " " I have already informed you ? " Murray snapped .  | " Yes , I know , but look here . I was only asking , which on of them did you think was the impostor ? You surely must have had some notion after you 'd talked to them . After all , it 's the only really important thing either about the imposture or about this ; and you ca n't have any doubt about it ? 11 Farnleigh is the impostor , he had good reason to kill himself and we can certainly agree that he did . But if by any inconceivable chance he were not the impostor " You are assuming ? " " No , no , only asking . If he were the real Sir John Farnleigh , there would be no reason for him to cut his throat . So he must be the impostor . Is n't he ? " " The tendency to leap to conclusions without even examining the data , " began Murray , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to which the unacademic mind is strongly  --  " " Right you are ; question withdrawn , " said Page . " No , no , you misunderstand . " Here Murray waved his hand like a hypnotist ; he seemed uncomfortable and flustered that the balance of argument had been disturbed . " You intimate that this might be murder on the grounds that , if the  --  erunfortunate gentleman before us were the real John Farnleigh , he would not kill himself . But , whether he is or is not the real Johnny , why should anyone kill him ? If he is a fraud , why murder him ? The law will attend to him . If he is real , why murder him ? He has done no harm to anyone . You see , I am only taking both sides of it . " Burrows spoke gloomily . " It 's all this talk , suddenly produced , about Scotland Yard and poor Victoria Daly . I 've always thought I was a sensible sort of fellow ; but it 's given  | e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my head . nd then I 've never liked the feel of this blasted garden . " " You felt that too ? " demanded Page . Murray was regarding them with a blaze of interest . " Stop , " he said . " About the garden : why do n't you like it , 1 r . Burrows ? Have you any memories connected with it ? " " Not exactly memories . " The other considered ; he seemed ncomfortable . " It was only that , when anyone used to tell a ghost-story , it was twice as effective here as anywhere else . remember one about  --  but that does n't matter . I used to think t would be very easy to raise the devil here ; and I do n't mean ut up a row , either . However , this is still beside the point . e 've got work to do . We ca n't stand here talking ? " Murray roused himself ; he grew almost excited . " Ah , yes . The police , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , the  --  er  --  practical world . You will , I think , allow me to take charge . Will you come with me , Mr. Burrows ? Mr. Page , will you oblige us by remaining with the  --  er  --  body until we return ? " " Why ? " asked the practical Page . " It is customary . Oh , yes . Indeed , it is absolutely necessary . Kindly give Mr. Page your flashlight , my friend . And now this way . There was no telephone at the Close when I lived here ; but I presume there is one now ? Good , good , good . We must also have a doctor . " He bustled off , shepherding Burrows , and Page was left beside the pool with what remained of John Farnleigh . With the shock wearing off , Page stood in the dark and reflected on the increasing uselessness and complexity of this tragedy . Yet the suicide of an impostor was simple enough . What disturbed him was the realization that he had got  | absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been simple enough for Murray to have said , " Yes , that is undoubtedly the impostor : I knew it from the beginning " ; and , in fact , Murray 's whole atmosphere had conveyed that this was what he thought . But he had said nothing . Was it , then , merely his own love of mystery ? " Farnleigh ! " Page said aloud . " Farnleigh ! " " Did you call me ? " asked a voice almost at his elbow . The effect of that voice in the dark was to make Page jump back so that he almost stumbled over the body . Forms and outlines were now completely lost in night . The stir of a footstep on a sanded path was followed by the rasping of a match . The flame of the match sprang up over its box , cupped in two hands ; and showed , in one opening of the yew hedge , the face of the claimant  --  Patrick Gore , John Farnleigh  --  looking into the space beside the pool . He came forward at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin black cigar , half-smoked and gone out . He put it into his mouth , lit it carefully , and then peered up . " Did you call me ? " he repeated . " I did n't , " Page said grimly . " But it 's a good thing you answered . Do you know what 's happened ? " " Yes . " " Where have you been ? " " Wandering . " The match went out ; but Page could hear him breathing faintly . That the man was shaken there could be little doubt . He came closer , his fists on his hips and the cigar glowing in a corner of his mouth . " Poor crook , " said the claimant , looking down . " And some-  | thing about him a good deal to be respected , too . I 'm rather sorry I did this . I 've no doubt he reverted to the Puritan faith of his fathers and spent a good many years repenting at the same time he kept fast hold on the estate . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better squire than I ever shall . But the wrong Farnleigh stuff was missing , and so he did this . " " Suicide . " " Without a doubt . " The claimant took the cigar out of his mouth and blew out a cloud of smoke , which curled in the darkness with the odd effect of a ghost taking form . " I suppose Murray has finished comparing the prints . You were present at that little inquisition by Murray . Tell me : did you notice the exact point at which our  --  late friend slipped and gave away the fact that he was not John Farnleigh ? " " No . " Then Page suddenly realized that the claimant 's shaken air was due as much to relief as to any other emotion . " Murray would not be Murray , " he said with a certain dryness , " if he had not included a catch question . That always was his nature . I was expecting it and even dreading it : in case it should not really be a catch question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly obvious catch when it came . You remember . What is the Red Book of Appin ? ' " " Yes . Both of you wrote down something ? " " Of course there is no such thing . I should be interested to see what gibberish my late rival wrote down in order to explain it . It was all the more intriguing when Murray , with a face as solemn as an owl , assured him he had written the correct answer ; but you observed that the very assurance almost finished my rival . Oh , curse it all , " he broke off , and made  | a gesture with the lighted end of his cigar which was curiously like a question-mark . " Well , let us see what the poor devil did to himself . May I have that electric torch ? " Page handed it over , and moved away while the other squatted down with the light . There was a long silence , with an occasional muttering . Then the claimant got up . Though he moved slowly , he snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My friend , " he said in a different voice , " this wo n't do . " " What wo n't do ? " " This . I hate what I am going to say . But I will take my oath this man did not kill himself . " ( Score one for suggestion , intuition , or the influence of a certain garden at twilight . ) " Why ? " said Page . " Have you looked at him closely ? Then come and do it now . Does a man cut his own throat with ' three separate slashes , all of which sever the jugular vein , and any one of which would have caused death ? Can he do it ? I do n't know , but I doubt it . Remember , I began my self-made career in a circus . I never saw anything like this since Barney Poole , the best animal-trainer west of the Mississippi , was killed by a leopard . " A night breeze moved in the labyrinth , and stirred the roses . " Where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . He played the beam of his torch over the misted water . " Probably in the pool here , but I do n't think we had better go after it . The police may be more necessary in this business than we think . This alters matters in a way that  --  that worries me , " said the claimant , as though making a concession . " Why kill an impostor ? "  | " Or a real heir , for that matter , " said Page . Then Page could sense that the other was eyeing him sharply . " You do not still believe ? ? " They were interrupted by footsteps coming rapidly if pontifically from the direction of the house . The claimant turned the beam of light on Welkyn , the solicitor , whom Page last remembered eating fish-paste sandwiches in the dining-room . Welkyn , now evidently a very scared man , gripped the edge f the white slip inside his waistcoat as though he were going make a speech . Then he changed his mind . " You 'd better get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Mr. Murray would like to see you . I hope , " he gave the word sinister emphasis , and looked hard at the claimant , " I hope either of you gentlemen has been in the house since this ing happened . " " Patrick Gore " whipped round . " Do n't tell me anything else as happened ? " " It has , " said Welkyn snappishly . " It appears that someone has taken advantage of this confusion . In Mr. Murray 's absence , someone went into the library and stole the Thumbograph containing our only evidence . "  | II Thursday , July 30th THE LIFE OF AN AUTOMATON Then all was silent , and presently Moxon reappeared and said , with a rather sorry smile : " Pardon me for leaving you so abruptly . I have a machine in there that lost its temper and cut up rough . " Fixing my eyes steadily upon his left cheek , which was traversed by four parallel excoriations showing blood , I said : " How would it do to trim its nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VII IN EARLY afternoon of the following day , while grey , warm rain darkened the countryside , Page sat again at the desk in his study ; but this time with very different thoughts . Up and down the room , in a way as monotonous as the sound of the rain itself , paced Detective-Inspector Elliot . And throned in the largest chair sat Dr. Gideon Fell . The doctor 's thunderous chuckles were today subdued . He had arrived in Mallingford that morning , and he did not seem to like the situation he found . Sitting back in the big chair , he wheezed gently . His eyes , behind the eyeglasses on the broad black ribbon , were fixed with singular concentration on a corner of the desk ; his bandit 's moustache bristled as though ready for argument , and his big mop of greystreaked hair had fallen over one ear . On a chair beside him lay his shovel-hat and his stick with the ivory crutch-handle . Though there was a pint tankard of beer at his elbow , he did not seem interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more red in the July heat , it hardly expressed his customary joviality . Page found him even larger , both in height and circumference , than he had been described ; when he first came into the cottage , wearing his box-pleated cape , he seemed to fill the place and crowd out even the furniture .  | Nor did anybody like the situation within the district of Mallingford and Soane . The district retreated within itself ; it was not even eloquently silent . Everybody now knew that the stranger known as a " folklore authority " at the Bull and Butcher was an inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department . But not a word was said of it . In the taproom of the Bull and Butcher , those who came in for their morning pint spoke in a little lower tone , and drifted away sooner ; that was all . Dr. Fell had been unable to get accommodations at the pub  --  inn by courtesy  --  since both guest rooms were occupied ; and Page had been only too glad to offer the hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andrew MacAndrew Elliot looked out of place neither as folklore authority nor as Scotland Yard man . He was youngish , raw-boned , sandyhaired , and serious-minded . He liked argument , and he liked subtleties in a way that would have displeased Superintendent Hadley . His education had been that thorough Scots one which deals with the minutest details of the minutest subject . Now , pacing the floor of Page 's study while the grey rain fell , he tried to make his position clear . " H'mf , yes , " grunted Dr. Fell . " But exactly what has been done so far ? " Elliot considered . " Captain Marchbanks , the Chief Constable , telephoned to the Yard this morning and washed his hands of the business , " he said . " Ordinarily , of course , they 'd have sent a chief inspector . But , since I happened to be on the spot and already investigating something that may be connected with this ? " ( The murder of Victoria Daly , thought Page . But how connected ? )  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Excellent . " " Yes , sir , I got my chance , " agreed Elliot , placing a freckled fist carefully on the table and bracing himself over it . " And I mean to make something of it , if I can . It 's opportunity . It 's  --  you know all that . " He expelled his breath . " But you know the difficulties I 'm going to find . People hereabouts have shut up tighter than windows . You try to see inside , but they wo n't let you inside . They 'll drink a glass of beer and talk just as usual ; but they fall away as soon as you say anything about it . With what we 'll call the gentry of the whole district " ? his tone showed a certain faint contempt for the word ? " it 's been even more difficult , even before this thing happened . " " About the other affair , you mean ? " inquired Dr. Fell , opening one eye . " About the other affair . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dane , Madeline Dane . There , " declared Inspector Elliot , with measured carefulness and emphasis , " is a real woman . It 's a pleasure to talk to her . Not one of your hard-boiled misses who blow smoke in your eye and ring up their lawyers as soon as you send in a card . No . A real woman ; reminds me of a girl I used to know at home . " Dr. Fell opened both eyes , while Inspector Elliot ( so to speak ) fidgeted under his freckles for having said this . But Brian Page understood and approved . He was even conscious of a twinge of nonsensical jealousy . " However , " the inspector resumed , " you 'll want to know about Farnleigh Close . I 've taken a statement from everybody who was there last night : exclusive of servants , as yet . A brief statement . I had to round some of them up . Mr. Burrows stayed at the Close last night , to be ready for us today . But  | the claimant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Welkyn ) both went back to Maidstone . " He looked round at Page . " I gather , sir , there was a bit of a row  --  or , well , say that things got pretty strained after this Thumbograph had been stolen ? " Page admitted it with some fervour . " Especially after the Thumbograph was stolen , " he replied . " The odd part of it was that to everybody except Molly Farnleigh it seemed more important that the evidence had been stolen than that Farnleigh had been murdered  --  if he was murdered . " A gleam of interest stirred in Dr. Fell 's eye . " By the way , what was the general attitude in the question of suicide v. murder ? " " Very cautious . A great lack of attitude , which is surprising . The only one who definitely said he 'd been murdered ( screamed it , in fact ) was Molly  --  Lady Farnleigh , I mean . Otherwise accusations of crookedness hurtled about in a way I hope wo n't be remembered today . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I suppose it was only natural . Beforehand we had all been so strainedly and unnaturally on our best behaviour that the reaction was a little too much . Even solicitors , it appears , are human . Murray tried to take charge , and was swept under . Our local police-sergeant was n't much better . " " I am endeavouring , " said Dr. Fell , making a hideous face of emphasis , " to clear the way to the problem . You say , inspector , you do n't have much doubt that it is murder ? " Elliot was firm . " No , sir , I have n't . There were three gashes across the throat , and no weapon I 've been able to find so far , either in the pool  | or anywhere at hand . Mind , " he said cautiously , " I have n't had the medical report . I do n't say it 's impossible for a man to inflict three such wounds on himself . But the absence of a weapon seems to decide it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the doubtful wheezing of Dr. Fell 's breath . " You do n't think , " suggested the doctor , " I only  --  harrumph ? put it forward as a suggestion : you do n't think he might have killed himself and , in the convulsion , flung the weapon away from him , so that you have n't found it ? That has happened before , I think . " " It 's remotely possible . But he ca n't have thrown it clear out of the garden ; and , if it 's there anywhere , Sergeant Burton will find it . " There was a curious look on Elliot 's hard face . " Look here , sir : do you think this is suicide ? " " No , no , no , " said Dr. Fell earnestly , as though this rather shocked him . " But , even believing that this is murder , I still want to know what our problem is . " " Our problem is who killed Sir John Farnleigh . " " Quite . You still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I am worried about this case , because all rules have been violated . All rules have been violated because the wrong man had been chosen for a victim . If only Murray had been murdered ! ( I speak academically , you understand . ) Hang it all , Murray should have been murdered ! In any wellconstituted plot he would have been murdered . His presence cries out for it . Here is a man possessing evidence which will decide a vital problem at the outset : here is a man who can probably solve the puzzle of identities even without that evidence : well , he is the certain candidate for the death-blow . Yet he remains untouched , and the problem of identities is merely  | made more inexplicable by the death of one of the claimants . You follow that ? " i " I do , " said Inspector Elliot grimly . " Let 's clear away some of the underbrush , " insisted Dr. Fell . " Is the whole thing , for instance , an error on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pres-1 ent name ) not intended to be the victim at all ? Did the mur derer kill him in mistake for somebody else ? " " It seems doubtful , " said Elliot , and looked at Page . " It 's impossible , " said Page . " I 'd thought of that too . Well , I repeat : it 's impossible . The light was too good . Farnleigh did n't look like anybody else , and was n't dressed like anybody else . Even from some distance away you could never have mistaken him , let alone at the close quarters of someone who cuts his throat . It was that queerish watery light where details are blurred but all outlines are clear . " " Then Farnleigh was the intended victim , " said Dr. Fell , clearing his throat with a long rumbling noise . " Very well . What other possible undergrowths or verbiage can we rake away ? For instance , is it possible that this murder has no connection whatever with the battle over the title and estates ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care whether he was John Farnleigh or Patrick Gore ? choose just this moment to slide through the screen and kill him for some outside motive we do n't know ? It is possible . It is possible if the Powers are being coy . But I for one am not going to worry about it . These things are cohesive ; they depend on each other . For , you notice , the Thumbographevidence was stolen at the same time Farnleigh was murdered . " Very well . Farnleigh was deliberately murdered , and murdered for some reason connected with the question of the  | ght heir to the estates . But we still have n't decided what our al problem is . The problem is still double-headed , not to iy double-faced . Thus . If the murdered man was an impostor , e might have been killed for any one of two or three reasons . ou can imagine them . But , if the murdered man was the al heir , he might have been killed for any one of two or Free totally different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sides , different eyes , different motives . herefore , which of those two is the impostor ? We have got know that before we have the remotest idea in which irection we 've got to look . Harrumph . " Inspector Elliot 's face hardened . " You mean that the key is this Mr. Murray ? " " I do . I mean my old , enigmatic acquaintance , Kennet MurY . " You think he knows which is which ? " " I 've got no doubt of it , " growled Dr. Fell . " Nor I , " said the inspector dryly . " Let 's see , now . " He got out his notebook and opened it . " Everyone seems to be agreed remarkable what a lot of agreement there is  --  that Mr. Murray was left alone in the study at about twenty minutes past nine o'clock . Correct , Mr. Page ? " " Correct . " " The murder ( we 'll call it that ) was committed at about half-past nine . Two persons give a definite time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now ten minutes may not be a long time . But the comparison of fingerprints , though you 've got to be careful about it , is n't the all-night job Murray gave you to understand . You ca n't tell me he did n't have some idea ? Do you think he 's a wrong ' un , sir ? " " No , " said Dr. Fell , frowning heavily at the tankard of  | ale . " I think he 's trying to do a spot of sensational detection . And in just a minute I 'll tell you what I think this case is . You say you got a statement from each of them as to what each was doing during that ten minutes ? " " Bald few lines from everybody , " said Elliot , suddenly angry . " No comments . They asked what comments they could make . Well , I mean to ask again , and comment too . Queerish crowd , if you ask me . I know things sound pretty shorn in a policeman 's report , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without anything between : and thankful to get what you do . But there 's black murder and plain hell in the midst of them , and this is what they say . Listen . " He opened his notebook . " Statement of Lady Farnleigh : When we left the library I was upset , so I went upstairs to my bedroom . My husband and I have adjoining bedrooms on the first floor of the new wing , over the dining-room . I washed my face and hands . I told my maid to lay out another frock , because I felt grubby . I lay down on the bed . There was only a very small light from the bedside lamp . The windows were open on the balcony of my room overlooking the garden . I heard noises like a fight and a scuffling and a kind of cry , and then a splash . I ran to the balcony and saw my husband . He seemed to be lying in the pool and fighting . He was alone then . I could see this clearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . I did not see or hear anything suspicious in the garden . " Next we have : " Statement of Kennet Murray : I remained in the library between nine-twenty and nine-thirty . No one entered the room , and I saw no one else . My back was to the window . I heard the sounds ( similarly described ) . I did not think anything serious had happened until I heard someone run downstairs in the hall . I heard Lady  | arnleigh 's voice calling out to the butler that she was afraid . mething had happened to Sir John . I looked at my watch ; it Was then just nine-thirty . I joined Lady Farnleigh in the hall , and we went out into the garden , where we found a man with is throat cut . I have no comment to make at this time on the ngerprints or my comparisons of them . " Fine and helpful , is n't it ? Then we have : " Statement of Patrick Gore , claimant : I wandered . I was out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered round the . uth side of the house to this garden . I did not hear any sounds cept a splash , and I heard that very faintly . I think I heard this hen I had just started round the side of the house . I did not ink anything was wrong . When I came into the garden I heard . ud voices talking . I did not want any company , so I kept to e side path along the high yew hedge bounding the garden . hen I heard what they were talking about . I listened . I did not o to the pool until all of them except a man named Page had ' tie back to the house . " Finally , we come to : " Statement of Harold Welkyn : I remained in the dining-room and did not leave it at any time . I ate five small sandwiches and drank a glass of port . I agree that the dining-room has glass doors opening out into the garden , and that one of these doors is not far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full on in the dining-room , and I could not see anything in the garden because of the contrasting lights ? " A witness dead on the scene . Ground floor : hedges only waist-high : not more than twenty feet from where Farnleigh must have been standing , " said Elliot , flicking his notebook with finger and thumb . " But he 's deaf and blind in his ' contrasting lights . ' He concludes :  | " At nine thirty-one by the grandfather clock in the dining-room I heard certain noises resembling a scuffle and a stopped cry . This was followed by a series of loud splashings . I also heard a kind of rustling noise in the hedges or shrubbery , and I thought I saw something looking at me through one of the glass panels of the door , one of the panels down nearest the ground . I was afraid that certain things might have happened which were no affair of mine . I sat down and waited until Mr. Burrows came in and told me the fraudulent Sir John Farnleigh had committed suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat another sandwich . " Dr. Fell , wheezing into a more upright position , reached out after the tankard of ale and took a deep pull . There was a steady , gleaming excitement behind his eyeglasses , a sort of astonished pleasure . " Oh , Bacchus ! " he said in a hollow voice . " Shorn ' statements , hey ? Is that your considered opinion ? There is something in our Mr. Welkyn 's statement which tends to give me a cauld grue . H'mf , ha , stop a bit . Welkyn ! Welkyn ! Have n't I heard that name somewhere before ? I 'm certain of it , because it cries aloud for bad puns , and therefore it would stick in my ? What is mind ? ' No matter : What is matter ? ' Never mind . ' I beg your pardon ; I was scatter-braining again . Have you got anything else ? " " Well , there were two other guests , Mr. Page here and Mr. Burrows . You 've heard Mr. Page 's statement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Never mind . Read it again , will you ? " Inspector Elliot frowned . " Statement of Nathaniel Burrows : I could have eaten something , but Welkyn was in the dining-room and I did not think it proper for me to talk to him then . I went to the drawing-room at the other side of the house and waited . Then I thought that my proper  | place was with Sir John Farnleigh , who had gone out into the south garden . I took an electric torch out of the table in the hall . I did this because my eyesight is not good . As I was starting to open the door to the garden I saw Sir John . He was standing on the edge of the pool . He seemed to be doing something , or moving about a little . From the door to the nearer edge of the pool is about thirty-five feet . I heard the scuffling sounds , and then the splash and the churnings in water . I ran down there and found him . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . I can not give an exact description of the movements he made . It was as though something had got hold of his feet . " And there we are , sir . You notice certain things . Except Mr. Burrows , nobody ever actually saw the victim before he was attacked and fell or was thrown into the pool . Lady Farnleigh did n't see him until he was in the pool ; Mr. Gore , Mr. Murray , Mr. Welkyn , and Mr. Page did n't see him until afterwards  --  or so they say . There are other things , " he prodded , " which you 'll have noticed ? " " Eh ? " said Dr. Fell vaguely . " I asked what you made of it . " " Why , I 'll tell you what I was thinking . A garden is a lovesome thing , God wot , ' " said Dr. Fell . " But what about the sequel ? After the murder , I gather , the Thumbograph was pinched from the library when Murray came out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the various persons about what they were doing then , or who might have pinched it ? " " I did , " said Elliot . " But I wo n't read it to you , sir . And why ? Because it 's one great , serene blank . Analyzed and boiled down , it amounts to this : that anybody might have stolen the Thumbograph , and that in the general confusion nobody would have noticed who did . "  | " Oh , Lord ! " Dr. Fell groaned , after a pause . " We 've got it at last . " " Got what ? " " What I 've been half-dreading for a long time  --  an almost purely psychological puzzle . There are no discrepancies in the various stories , in the various times given , even in the various possibilities . There are no incongruities to explain , except the thundering psychological incongruity of why the wrong man should have been so carefully murdered . Above all , there is an almost complete absence of material clues : no cuff-links , cigarette-ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H'rnf . Unless we get our claws into something more tangible , we shall merely fumble with the greased pig called human behaviour . Which person , then , would be most likely to kill the man who was killed ? And why ? And which person fits best , psychologically , into the pattern of devilry you 've drawn round Victoria Daly 's murder ? " Elliot began to whistle through his teeth . He said : " Any ideas , sir ? " " Let me see , " muttered Dr. Fell , " if I have mastered the essential facts in the case of Victoria Daly . Age 35 , spinster , pleasant , not intelligent , lived alone . H'mf . Ha . Yes . Murdered about 11.45 P.M. on July 3rst , last . Right , my lad ? " " Right . " " Alarm given by farmer driving home past her cottage . Screams coming from there . Village policeman , passing on bicycle , follows farmer .

Right ? " " Right . " " Miss Daly found in ground-floor room of cottage : her edroom . Strangled with bootlace . When attacked , was re'ring but had not yet gone to bed . Wore night-dress , quilted ressing-gown , and slippers . Apparently clear case  --  money nd valuables found on tramp  --  except for one fact . On examination by doctor , body found smeared with dark sooty compound ; same compound also found under all finger-nails . Eh ? This substance , analyzed by Home Office man , proved to be composed of juice of water parsnip , aconite , cinquefoil , deadly nightshade , and soot . " Page sat up , mentally stuttering . Until the last part of Dr. Fell 's statement , he had heard it all a thousand times before . " Here ! " he protested . " That 's the first time anybody 's mentioned a thing like that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisons ? " " Yes , " said Elliot , with a broad and sardonic grin . " The local doctor did n't have it analyzed , of course . The coroner did n't think it was important and did n't even bring it up at the inquest . He probably thought it was some kind of beautypreparation , which it would be indelicate to mention . But the doctor later passed on a quiet word , and Page was troubled . " Aconite and deadly nightshade ! All the same , they were n't swallowed , were they ? They would n't have killed her if they only touched her externally , would they ? " " Oh , no . All the same , it 's a fairly clear case . Do n't you think so , sir ? " " An unfortunately clear case , " admitted Dr. Fell .  | Above the noise of the rain Page heard a rapping at the front door of the cottage . Trying to place an elusive memory , he went out through the short passage and opened the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber hood and coat , under which he was shielding something wrapped in newspapers . What he said brought Page 's thoughts back from Victoria Daly to the closer problem of Farnleigh . " Might I see Inspector Elliot and Dr. Fell , sir ? " Burton said . " I 've got the weapon , right enough . And He gestured with his head . Beyond a muddy front garden pricked up into puddles by the rain , a familiar car stood by the front gate . It was an ancient Morris , and there seemed to be two persons behind the side-curtains . Inspector Elliot came to the door hurriedly . " You said ? " " I 've got the weapon that killed Sir John , Inspector . And something else too . " Again Sergeant Burton moved his head in the direction of the car . " It 's Miss Madeline Dane and old Mr. Knowles , who works up at the Close . He used to work for Miss Dane 's father 's best friend . When he was n't sure what to do he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He 's got something to tell you that 'll probably straighten out the whole case . "  | Chapter VIII THEY put down the newspaper-parcel on Page 's writing-table , and unfolded it to reveal the weapon . It was a pocket-knife ; a boy 's pocket-knife of old-fashioned design ; and , under the present circumstances , a heavy and murderous-looking pocketknife . In addition to the main blade  --  which was open now  --  its wooden handle contained two smaller blades , a corkscrew , and an implement once alleged to be useful for removing stones from horses ' hoofs . To Page it brought back the days when to possess such a fine knife was the proud mark of almost-manhood : when you were an adventurer , almost a red Indian . It was an old knife . The main blade , well over four inches long , bore two deep triangular nicks , and the steel was ragged in places ; but it was not rusty , and it had been kept razor-sharp . There was about it now no suggestion of playing at Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bloodstains which had recently dried . A feeling of uneasiness touched them all as they looked at it . Inspector Elliot straightened up . " Where did you find this ? " " Stuck down deep inside one of those low hedges ; about , "  | said Sergeant Burton , half-closing one eye to estimate , " about ten feet away from the lily-pond . " " Away from the pool in which direction ? " " Towards the left , standing with your back to the house . Towards that high hedge that 's the south boundary . A bit nearer in to the house than the lily-pond is . You see , sir , " explained the sergeant carefully , " it was luck  --  me finding it . We might have searched for a month and never found it . No more we might n't , unless we pulled all the hedges to bits . That yew 's as thick as sin . It was the rain that did it . I was running my hand along the top of one hedge ; not meaning anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hedge was wet , and my hand came away with a bit of reddy-brown colour on it . That was where it 'd left a bit of blood on the flat top of the hedge when it went through . You could n't even see the cut in the top where she 'd gone through . I dug her out . The hedge kept the rain off , as you see . " " Somebody 'd pushed it straight down through the hedge , you think ? " Sergeant Burton considered . " Yes , it 'd be that . I think . She was stuck in there straight , point downwards . Or else  --  that 's a good heavy knife , sir . Blade 's as heavy as the handle . If somebody threw her away , or up into the air , she 'd have come down blade first and gone through just like that . " There was a certain look on Sergeant Burton 's face which no one there failed to interpret . Dr. Fell , who had been sunk in some obscure musing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out in a mutinous way . " H 'm , " he said . " Threw her away ? ' After suicide , you mean ? "  | Burton 's forehead altered slightly ; he said nothing . " It 's the knife we want , right enough , " Inspector Elliot conceded . " I did n't like the jagged , crooked look of two of the three wounds on that fellow . They looked more like mauling or tearing . But look here ! ? look at the notches in this blade . They 'll fit or I 'm a Dutchman . What do you say ? " " About Miss Dane and old Mr. Knowles , sir ? ? " " Yes ; ask them if they 'll come in . That 's good work , sergeant ; damned good work . You might go and see whether the doctor has any news for me . " Dr. Fell and the inspector were beginning to argue as Page picked up an umbrella from the passage and went out to bring Madeline in . Not rain or mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-temper . She was wearing one of those transparent oilskin waterproofs , with a hood , which made her look as though she were wrapped in cellophane . Her blonde hair was done into something like curls above the ears ; she had a pale , healthy face , the nose and mouth a little broad , the eyes a little long ; yet the whole of a beauty which grew on you the more you noticed it . For she never gave the impression of wanting to be noticed ; she was one of those persons who seem cut out to be good listeners . Her eyes were very dark blue , with a deep glance of sincerity . Though her figure was good ? Page always damned himself for noticing her figure  --  she conveyed an impression of fragility . She put her hand on his arm , and gave him an uncertain smile , as he helped her out of the car under the umbrella . " I 'm terribly glad it 's at your house , " she said in her soft voice . " It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to do , and it seemed the best way ? "  | She glanced back at stout Knowles , who was getting out of the car . Knowles carried his bowler hat even in the rain , and he was picking his way in a pigeon-toed waddle through the mud . Page took Madeline into the study , and introduced her proudly . He wanted to show her off to Dr. Fell . Certainly the doctor 's response was everything that could be wished . He beamed down on her in a way that threatened to split several waistcoat-buttons , and seemed to turn on lights behind his eyeglasses ; he towered up , chuckling , and it was the doctor himself who took her waterproof when she sat down . Inspector Elliot was at his most brisk and official . He spoke like a shop-assistant behind a counter . " Yes , Miss Dane ? And what can I do for you ? " Madeline regarded her clasped hands , and looked round with a pleasant frown before her candid gaze met the in- ? spector 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I know I must do it . Someone must do it , after that terrible affair last night . And yet I do n't want Knowles to get into trouble . He must n't , Mr. Elliot ! " " If anything 's bothering you , Miss Dane , just tell me , " said Elliot briskly ; " and nobody will get into trouble . " She gave him a grateful look . " Then perhaps ? You 'd better tell them , Knowles . What you told me . " " Heh-heh-heh , " said Dr. Fell . " Sit down , man ! " " No , sir ; thank you ; I " " Sit down ! " thundered Dr. Fell . As an alternative to being pushed down , which from the doctor 's gesture seemed imminent , Knowles obeyed . Knowles  | was an honest man : sometimes a dangerously honest man . Ile had one of those faces which in moments of mental stress go transparently pink , as though you could see through the face like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning his bowler hat round in his hands . Dr. Fell tried to give him a cigar , but he declined this . " I wonder , sir , if I may speak frankly ? " " I should advise it , " said Elliot dryly . " Well ? " " Of course , sir , I know I should have gone to Lady Farnleigh straightaway . But I could n't tell her . I mean quite sincerely that I could n't make myself do it . You see , it was through Lady Farnleigh that I came to the Close when Colonel Mardale died . I think I can say honestly that I think more of her than anyone else I know . Honest to God , " added Knowles , with a sudden and unexpected descent into the human , and a slight surge up out of his chair . Then he relapsed . " She was Miss Molly , the doctor 's daughter , from Sutton Chart . I knew Elliot was patient . " Yes , we appreciate that . But this information you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Sir John Farnleigh , sir , " said Knowles . " He committed suicide . I saw him do it . " The long silence was broken only by the diminishing noise of the rain . Page heard the rustle of his own sleeve as he looked round to see whether they had hidden the stained claspknife ; he did not want Madeline to see it . It was now concealed under the newspapers on the table . Inspector Elliot , seeming even more hard-boned , was staring steadily at the butler . From Dr. Fell 's direction there issued a faint ghost of a noise , like half-humming or half-whistling behind closed teeth ; he has a  | habit of whistling thus at times , to the tune of Aupres de ma Blonde , ' though he looked half asleep . " You  --  saw  --  him  --  do it ? " " Yes , sir . I could have told you this morning ; only you did n't question me ; and , frankly , I 'm not sure I should have told you even then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of the Green Room last night , the room just over the library , looking out into the garden , when it all happened . I saw everything . " ( This , Page remembered , was true . When he had gone with Burrows to look at the body first , he had seen Knowles standing at the window of the room above the library . ) " Anybody will tell you about my eyesight , " Knowles said warmly . Even his shoes squeaked with vehemence . " I 'm seventy-four years old , and I can read a motor-car numberplate at sixty yards . You just go out in the garden there , and you take a box or a sign or something with small letters ? " He corrected himself , and sat back . " You saw Sir John Farnleigh cut his own throat ? " " Yes , sir . As good as . " " As good as ? ' What do you mean by that ? " " I mean this , sir . I did n't actually see him draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I saw him put his hands up . And there was n't a living soul near him . Remember , I was looking straight down on him and into the garden . I could see into that circular open space all round the pool ; and there 's a good five-foot border of sand between the pool and the nearest hedge all round . Nobody could have come near him without my seeing . And he was all alone in that open space , I 'll tell you to my dying day . "  | Still the sleepy and tuneless whistling wheezed from Dr. Fell 's direction . " Tons les oiseaux du monde , ' " muttered the doctor , " ' viennent y faire leurs nids ? ' " Then he spoke out . " Why should Sir John Farnleigh kill himself ? " Knowles braced himself . " Because he was n't Sir John Farnleigh , sir . The other gentleman is . I knew it as soon as I clapped eyes on him last night . " Inspector Elliot remained impassive . " What reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to tell you so you 'll understand , sir , " Knowles complained . ( For the first time in his life he showed a lack of tact . ) " Now , I 'm seventy-four . I was n't any chicken , if you 'll excuse me for saying so , when young Mr. Johnny went away from home in nineteen-twelve . You see , to old people like myself the younger ones never change . They always seem just the same , whether they 're fifteen or thirty or forty-five . Lord bless you , do you think I would n't have recognized the real Mr. Johnny whenever I met him ? Mind ! " said Knowles , again forgetting himself and raising his finger . " I do n't say that when the late gentleman came here and pretended to be the new Sir John  --  I do n't say I twigged it . No . Not at all . I thought , Well , he 's different ; he 's been to America , and you never know them after that ; it 's only natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really suspected him of not being the right master , though I 'm bound to admit that now and again he did say things that ? " " But ? " " Now , you 'll say , continued Knowles , in real and blinding earnest , " I was n't at the Close in the old days . That 's true . I 've been here only ten years , since Miss Molly asked the late Sir Dudley to offer me the honour . But , when I served Colonel  | Mardale , young Mr. Johnny used to spend a lot of time in the I ' big orchard between the colonel 's and the major 's ? " " The major 's ? " " Major Dane , sir , Miss Madeline 's father ; he was the colonel 's great friend . Well , young Mr. Johnny liked that orchard , with the wood behind it . That orchard is close to the Hanging Chart , you know  --  leads into it . He pretended he was a wizard , and a mediaeval knight , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like at all . Anyway , I knew last night , even before he started asking me about rabbits and the like , I that this new gentleman was the real Mr. Johnny . He knew I li knew it . That 's why he had me called in . But what could I say ? " ' i Page remembered that interview only too well . But he remembered other things too , and wondered if Elliot had learned them . He glanced across at Madeline . Inspector Elliot opened his notebook . " So he killed himself . Eh ? " " Yes , sir . " " Did you see the weapon he used ? " " No , not properly , I 'm afraid . " " I want you to tell me just exactly what you did see . For instance , you say you were in the Green Room ' when it happened . When and why did you go there ? " Knowles got his wits together . " Well , sir , it might have been two or three minutes before it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Inspector Elliot , with a hard passion for accuracy . " I ca n't say , sir . I did n't take any account of the time . One of them . I was in the hall near the dining-room , in case I should  | be wanted , though there was nobody in the dining-room except Mr. Welkyn . Then Mr. Nathaniel Burrows came out of the drawing-room , and asked me where he could find an electric torch . I said I thought there was one in the Green Room upstairs , which the late  --  gentleman used as a kind of study , and I said I would go and fetch it for him . I have since learned , " Knowles was now giving evidence , as his diction showed , " that Mr. Burrows found one in the drawer of the table in the hall ; but I had not known there was one there . " " Go on . " " I went upstairs and I went into the Green Room ? " " Did you turn on the light ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flustered . " Not just at that moment . There is no wall-switch in the room . You must turn on the light from the ceiling-fixture . The table where I thought I had seen the electric torch is between the windows . I went towards that table , and when I went past I glanced out of the window . " " Which window ? " " The right-hand one , facing out on the garden . " " Was the window open ? " " Yes , sir . Now , here 's how it was . You must have noticed . There are trees all along the back of the library ; but they 've been pruned down so that they do n't cut off the view from the windows of the floor above . The ceilings at the Close are eighteen feet high , most of them  --  except the new wing , which is a little low doll 's house of a place  --  and that gives you a good height of tree without having them stretch up past the windows of the Green Room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you look out over tree-tops . So you see I was high over the garden , looking down into it . "  | Here Knowles got up from his chair and craned himself forward . He had seldom executed this movement before , and it evidently gave him a twinge , but his grimness was such that he held the position while he talked . " Here I was , you see . Then there were the green leaves , lit up from underneath by the library windows . " He moved his hand . " Then there was the garden , with every hedge and path distinct , and the pool in the centre . The light was n't bad , sir . I 've seen them play tennis in worse . Then there was Sir John ? or the gentleman who called himself that  --  standing by it with his hands in his pockets . " At this point Knowles had to leave off play-acting and sit down . " That 's all , " he said , with a slightly quicker breath . " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Elliot , pulled up at this unexpected conclusion , stared at him . " But what happened , man ? That 's what I 'm trying to get you to tell me ! " " Just that . I thought I heard a movement down in the trees under me , and I glanced down . When I looked up again ? " " Are you going to tell me , " said Elliot very calmly and carefully , " that YOU did n't see what happened either ? " " No , sir . I saw him fall forward in the pool . " " Yes ; but what else ? " " Well , sir , there certainly was n't time for someone  --  you know what I mean , sir  --  to cut his throat three times and then run away . There could n't ' a ' been . He was alone every bit of the time , before and after . So he must have killed himself . " " What did he use to kill himself ? " " A kind of knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you see the knife ? " " Not properly , no . " " Did you see it in his hand ? " " Not properly . It was too far away to see that plain . Sir , " replied Knowles , remembering that he had a position in the world and drawing himself up with dignity , " I am trying to give you a true , so-help-me-God story of what I saw ? " " Well , what did he do with the knife afterwards ? Did he drop it ? What happened to it ? " " I did n't notice , sir . I honestly did n't . I was paying attention to him ; and something seemed to be happening to the front of him . " " Could he have thrown the knife from him ? " " He might . I do n't know . " " Would you have seen it if he had thrown it ? " Knowles considered long . " That would depend on the size of the knife . And there are bats in that garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis-ball until it 's ? " He was a very old man . His face grew clouded , and for a moment they were afraid he was going to cry . But he spoke again with dignity . " I am sorry , sir . If you do n't believe me , have I your permission to go ? " " Oh , hang it all , it is n't that ? ! " said Elliot , stung to youthful naturalness , and his ears grew slightly red . Madeline Dane , who had said not a word the whole time , was watching him with a faint smile . " Just one other point , for the time being , " Elliot went on stiffly . " If you had a good view of the whole garden , did you see anybody else in the garden at the time of the  --  attack ? " " At the time it happened , sir ? No . Immediately afterwards , though , I turned on the lights in the Green Room , and by  | that time there were a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the  --  excuse me , sir ; yes , there was ! " Again Knowles raised his finger and frowned . " There was somebody there when it happened . I saw him ! You remember , I said I heard a noise down in the trees round the library win-dows ? " " Yes ; well ? " " I looked down . That was what took away my attention . There was a gentleman down there , looking into the library windows . I could see plainly ; because the branches of the trees , of course , do n't quite reach to the windows , and everything was all lighted up between , like a little alley between the trees and the windows . He was standing there looking into the library . " " Who was ? " " The new gentleman , sir . The real Mr. Johnny that I used to know . The one who now calls himself Mr. Patrick Gore . " There was a silence . Elliot very carefully put down his pencil , and glanced across at Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed asleep if one little eye had not gleamed half-open . " Have I got this clear ? " Elliot demanded . " At the same time as the attack , or suicide , or murder , or whatever-we-call-it , Mr. Patrick Gore was standing down there in your sight by the library windows ? " " Yes , sir . Over to the left he stood , towards the south . That 's how I could see his face . " " Now , you 'll swear to that ? " " Yes , sir , of course , " said Knowles , opening his eyes . " This was at the time of the various scuffling sounds , the splash , the fall , and so on ? " " Yes , sir . "  | Elliot nodded in a colourless way and leafed back through his notebook . " I should like to read you a part of Mr. Gore 's testimony dealing with that same time . Listen . ' I was out on the front lawn first , smoking . Then I wandered round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear any sounds except a splash , and I heard that very faintly . I think I heard this when I had just started round the side of the house . ' He goes on to say that he kept to the side paths along the south boundary. ? Now , you tell us that , when the splash occurred , he was standing down underneath you looking into the library . His statement contradicts it . " " I ca n't help what he says , sir , " answered Knowles helplessly . " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't . That 's what he was doing . " " But what did he do after you saw Sir John go into the pool ? " " I ca n't say that . I was looking towards the pool then . " Elliot hesitated , muttering to himself , and then glanced at Dr. Fell . " Any questions you 'd like to ask , doctor ? " " Yes , " said Dr. Fell . He bestirred himself , beaming on Madeline , who smiled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Knowles . " There are several troublesome queries following your theory , my boy . Among them , if Patrick Gore is the real heir , the question of who stole the Thumbograph , and why . But let 's stick first to the vexed business of suicide v. murder . " He reflected . " Sir John Farnleigh  --  the dead man , I mean  --  he was right-handed , was he ? " " Right-handed ? Yes , sir . " " It was your impression that he had this knife in his right hand when he killed himself ? " " Oh , yes , sir .  | " H'mf , yes . Now I want you to tell me what he did with his hands after this curious seizure by the pool . Never mind the knife ! We 'll admit you did n't properly see the knife . Just tell me what he did with his hands . " " Well , sir , he put them up to his throat  --  like this , " said Knowles , illustrating . " Then he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and threw them out , like this . " Knowles made a large gesture , spreading his arms wide . " That was just before he went forward into the pool and began to writhe there . " " He did n't cross his arms ? He simply lifted them and threw them out one to each side ? Is that it ? " " That 's right , sir . " Dr. Fell took his crutch-handled stick from the table and hoisted himself to his feet . Lumbering over to the table , he took up the newspaper packet , unfolded it , and showed Knowles the bloodstained clasp-knife inside . " The point is this , " he argued . " Farnleigh has the knife in his right hand , supposing this to be suicide . He makes no gestures except to fling both arms wide . Even if he were helping support the knife with his left hand , his right would have the grip on it . The knife flies from his right hand as the arm is thrown wide . Excellent well . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its flight in the air , passed high over the pool , and dropped into the hedge some ten feet to the left ? And all this , mind you , after he has just inflicted not one , but three fatal wounds on himself ? It wo n't do , you know . " Apparently oblivious to the fact that he was holding the newspaper with its grisly exhibit almost against Madeline 's cheek , Dr. Fell frowned at it . Then he looked at the butler .  | " On the other hand , how can we doubt this chap 's eyesight ? He says Farnleigh was alone by the pool ; and there is some confirmation . Nathaniel Burrows is inclined to agree that he was alone . Lady Farnleigh , who ran out on the balcony immediately after the splash , saw nobody by the pool or within reach of it . We shall have to take our choice . On the one hand we have a somewhat preposterous suicide ; but on the other hand , unfortunately , we have a more than somewhat impossible murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Chapter IX As VIGOROUSLY and even violently as he had spoken , Dr. Fell had been talking to himself . He had not expected an answer , nor did he get one . For a time he remained blinking at the book-shelves . He appeared to wake up when Knowles ventured a frightened cough . " I beg your pardon , sir ; is that the ? ? " He nodded towards the knife . " We think so . It was found in a hedge to the left of the pool . How do you think it squares with suicide ? " " I do n't know , sir . " " Did you ever see this knife before ? " " Not to my knowledge , sir . " " Or you , Miss Dane ? " Though Madeline seemed startled and a little shocked , she shook her head quietly . Then she leaned forward . Page noted again how the breadth of her face , the slight breadth and bluntness of her nose , did not in the least detract from her beauty , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for comparisons or images when he saw her ; and he found in her something mediaeval , something in length of eye or fulness of lip , some inner spring of quietness , which suggested the rose-garden or the turret window . The senti-  | mentality of the comparison must be excused , for he felt it and believed it . " I 'm afraid , you know , " Madeline said almost pleadingly , " that I 've no right to be here at all , and that I 'm talking about things which do not concern me . And yet  --  well , I suppose I must . " She smiled at Knowles . " I wonder if you will wait for me in my car ? " Knowles bowed and was gone  --  vague and troubled ; and still the grey rain fell . " Yes , " said Dr. Fell , sitting down again and folding his hands over the top of his stick . " You were the one I wanted to ask the questions , Miss Dane . What do you think of Knowles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Only that it 's much more difficult than you think . " " Do you believe what he says ? " " Oh , he 's absolutely and completely sincere ; you must have seen that . But he 's an old man . And , among the children , he was always most fanatically devoted first to Molly ( her father , you know , saved Knowles 's mother 's life once ) , and next to young John Farnleigh . I remember he once made a conical wizard 's hat for John , out of cardboard painted blue , with silver-paper stars and whatnots . When this affair came up , he simply could n't tell Molly ; he could n't . So he came to me . They all do  --  come to me , that is . And I try to do them what good I can . " Dr. Fell 's forehead was wrinkled . " Still , I was wondering ... h'mf . . . you knew John Farnleigh pretty well in the old days ? I understand , " here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance between you ? " She made a wry face . " You remind me that I 'm past my youth . I 'm thirty-five .  | Or thereabouts ; you must n't ask me to be too precise . No , there never was even a boy-and-girl romance between us , really . Not that I should have minded , but it did n't interest him . He  --  he kissed me once or twice , in the orchard and in the wood . But he used to say that I did n't have enough of the Old Adam  --  or do I mean Old Eve ? ? in me . Not enough of the devil , anyhow . " " But you never married ? " " Oh , that 's unfair ! " cried Madeline , flushing and then laughing . " You talk as though I were sitting with my dim spectacled eyes over a piece of knitting in the chimneycorner ? " Miss Dane , " said Dr. Fell , with thunderous solemnity , " I do n't . I mean that I can see suitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Wall of China ; I can see Nubian slaves bowed down by the weight of great chocolate-boxes ; I can  --  ahem . Let us omit that . " It was a long time since Page had seen a genuine blush ; he believed , nowadays , that such mainsprings were dried up and with the dodo ; but , all the same , he did not mind seeing Madeline blush . For what she said was : " If you 're thinking that I cherished a romantic passion for John Farnleigh all these years , I 'm afraid you 're hopelessly wrong . " There was a twinkle in her eye . " I was always a little frightened of him , and I 'm not even sure I liked him ? then . " " Then ? " " Yes . I liked him later , but only liked . " " Miss Dane , " said Dr. Fell , growling out of his several chins and moving his head curiously , " some inner Little Bird seems to tell me that you 're trying to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my question . Do you think Farnleigh was an impostor ? " She made a slight gesture . " Dr. Fell , I am not trying to be mysterious . Really and truly I 'm not ; and I think I can tell you something . But , before I do , will you  --  or somebody  --  tell me just what did happen at the Close last night ? I mean , before the last horrible business happened ? I mean , what those two said and did while each was claiming to be the real one ? " " We might as well have the story again , Mr. Page , " said Elliot . Page told it , with as many shadings and impressions as he could remember . Madeline nodded her head several times in the course of it ; she was breathing rapidly . " Tell me , Brian : what struck you most about the whole interview ? " " The absolute assurance of both claimants , " said Page . " Farnleigh faltered once or twice , but over what seemed unimportant points ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I only saw him smile and look relieved once . That was when Gore was accusing him of attempted murder with a seaman 's mallet aboard the Titanic . " " Just one other thing , please , " Madeline requested , breathing still more rapidly . " Did either of them say anything about the dummy ? " There was a pause . Dr. Fell , Inspector Elliot , and Brian Page looked at each other blankly . " The dummy ? " repeated Elliot , clearing his throat . " What dummy ? " " Or about bringing it to life ? Or anything about the ' Book ' ? " Then a mask seemed to close over her face . " I 'm  | sorry . I should n't have mentioned that , only I should have thought it would be the first thing to be brought up . Please forget it . " An expression of refreshed pleasure animated Dr. Fell 's large face . " My dear Miss Dane , " he rumbled , " you demand a miracle . You demand a miracle greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider what you demand . You refer to a certain dummy , to the possibility of its being brought to life , and to something you call the Book , ' all presumably in connection with this mystery . You acknowledge that it is the first thing you would have thought should be brought up . And then you ask us to forget it . Do you think that ordinary human beings of feverish curiosity could ? " Madeline looked stubborn . " But you ought not to have asked me about it , " she protested . " Not that I know anything , really . You ought to have asked them . " " The Book , ' " mused Dr. Fell . " You do n't mean , I suppose , the Red Book of Appin ? " " Yes , I believe I later heard it called that . I read about it somewhere . It 's not a book , really ; it 's a manuscript , or so John once told me . " " Wait a bit , " interposed Page . " Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers for it . Gore later told me that it was a catch question , and there was no such thing as the Red Book of Appin . ' If there is such a thing , it makes Gore out the impostor , does n't it ? " Dr. Fell seemed about to speak , with some excitement and vehemence ; but he drew a long breath through his nose and restrained himself .  | " I wish I knew , " said Elliot . " I never thought there could be so much doubt and confusion caused by only two persons . Now you 're certain it 's one of them , again you 're just as certain it 's the other . And  --  as Dr. Fell says  --  we ca n't get much further until we establish that . I hope , Miss Dane , you 're not trying to evade the question . You still have n't answered : do you think the late Farnleigh was an impostor ? " Madeline threw her head back against the back of the chair . It was the greatest sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page had ever seen her give . She opened and shut her right hand . " I ca n't tell you , " she said helplessly . " I ca n't . Not until I 've seen Molly , anyhow . " " But what has Lady Farnleigh got to do with us ? " " Only that he  --  told me things . Things he did n't even confide to her . Oh , please do n't look shocked ! " ( As a matter of fact , Elliot did not ; but he looked interested . ) " Or believe a lot of gossip you may have heard . But I 've got to tell Molly first . You see , she believed in him . Of course , Molly was only seven years old when he left home . All she hazily remembers is a boy who took her to a gipsy camp , where they taught her to ride a pony and throw stones better than any man . Besides , any dispute over the Farnleigh name or estates would n't trouble her at all . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly half a million , and Molly inherited it all in her own right . Also , sometimes I 've thought she never really liked being mistress of that house ; she does n't seem to care for responsibilities of that sort . She did n't marry him because of his position or income , and she would n't really have cared  --  and wo n't now  --  whether his name is Farnleigh  | or Gore or whatever you like . So why should he have told her ? " Elliot looked rather dazed , as he had reason to do . e " Just a moment , Miss Dane . What are you trying to tell us : that he was or was not an impostor ? " " But I do n't know ! I do n't know which he was ! " " The startling lack of information with which we are provided , " said Dr. Fell sadly , " proceeds from all sources and o'erflows its basin . Well , let 's leave that for the moment . But on one point I insist on having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dummy ? " Madeline hesitated . " I do n't know whether they 've still got it , " she answered , staring at the window in a fascinated way . " John 's father kept it locked up in an attic room , along with the  --  books he did n't like . The old-time Farnleighs were an unpleasant lot , as you may know , and Sir Dudley was always afraid John 11 had taken after them . Though there certainly did n't seem to have been anything wrong or unpleasant about this figure . " I  --  I only saw it once . John stole the key from his father , and took me up all those stairs to see it , with a candle in a dark-lantern . He said the door had n't been opened for generations . When it was new , they say the figure was as absoI lutely lifelike and beautiful as a real woman , sitting on a I kind of padded box in Restoration costume . But when I saw it , it was only old and black and withered-looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been touched for well over a hundred years . But I do n't know what the story was that made people afraid of it . " There was something about her tone which made Page vaguely uneasy , because he could not place the inflection : he ,  | had never heard Madeline speak quite like that before . And he had never , certainly , heard of this " figure " or " dummy , " whatever it was . " It may have been very ingenious , " Madeline explained , " yet I ca n't understand why there should have been anything bad about it . Did you ever heard of Kempelen 's and Maelzel 's mechanical chess-player , or Maskelyne 's Zoe ' or Psycho , ' the whist-playing figure ? " Elliot shook his head , though he looked interested ; and Dr. Fell was so interested that the eyeglasses tumbled off his nose . " You do n't mean ? ? " he said . " Archons of Athens , this is better than anything I had hoped for ! They were among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe for two hundred years . Did n't you ever read of the harpsichord , exhibited before Louis XIV , which played by itself ? Or the dummy invented by Kempelen , shown by Maelzel , which was owned by Napoleon and later lost in the museum fire at Philadelphia ? For all practical purposes , Maelzel 's automaton was alive . It played chess with you ; and usually won . There have been several explanations of how it worked  --  Poe wrote one  --  but to my own simple mind it still is n't satisfactorily explained . You can see Psycho ' in the London Museum today . You do n't mean there 's one at Farnleigh Close ? " " Yes . That 's why I should have thought this Mr. Murray would have asked about it , " said Madeline . " As I say , I do n't know the story . This automaton was exhibited in England during the reign of Charles II. , and bought by a Farnleigh then . I do n't know whether it played cards or chess , but  | it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , it was old and black and withered-looking . " " But this  --  harrumph  --  this business of bringing it alive ? " " Oh , that was only the nonsense John used to talk when he was a silly child . I was n't trying to talk seriously about that , do n't you see ? I was only trying to go back and test what could be remembered of him in the old days . The room where they used to keep the figure was full of books with ? well , with downright evil in them , " again she flushed , " and that was what attracted John . The secret of how to make the figure work had been forgotten ; I daresay that was what he meant . " On Page 's desk the telephone-bell rang . He had been so engrossed in watching Madeline , the slight turns of her head , the intentness of her dark-blue eyes , that he groped after the ' phone before finding it . But at the sound of Burrows 's voice on the wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , " said Burrows , " come up to the Close straightaway , and bring the inspector and Dr. Fell . " " Steady ! " said Page , feeling a certain unpleasant warmth creep round his chest . " What 's up ? " " For one thing , we 've found the Thumbograph ? " " What ! Where ? " They were all looking at him now . " One of the maids : Betty : do you know her ? ? " Burrows hesitated . " Yes ; go on . " " Betty disappeared , and nobody knew what had become of her . They looked all over the place for her : that is , they looked in the only places she was likely to be found . No Betty . Everything was a bit disorganized , because for some  | reason Knowles was n't here either . Finally Molly 's maid found her in the Green Room , where it was n't Betty 's business to go . Betty was lying on the floor with the Thumbograph in her hand . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , and she was breathing so queerly , that we sent for the doctor . Old King is worried . Betty 's still unconscious , and she wo n't be in any condition to tell us anything for a long time . She 's not physically hurt , but King says there 's not much doubt about what caused it . " " Well ? " Again Burrows hesitated . " Fright , " he said .  | Chapter X IN THE library at Farnleigh Close , Patrick Gore sat back in the embrasure of the windows and smoked a black cigar . Ranged near him were Burrows , Welkyn , and a sleepy-looking Kennet Murray . Inspector Elliot , Dr. Fell , and Brian Page sat by the table . At the Close they had found a frightened and disorganized household , the more frightened because of a completely pointless upset in the middle of an ordinary afternoon , and the more disorganized because of the absence of the butler . Facts ? What did you mean , facts ? The group of domestics whom Elliot questioned did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Betty Harbottle ; a nice girl ; ordinary . She had not been seen since midday dinner . When it came time for her to wash the windows of two of the upstairs bedrooms with Agnes , another maid , Agnes had gone to look for her . She was not found until four o'clock . At this time Teresa ? Lady Farnleigh 's maid  --  had gone into the Green Room , the late Sir John 's study , and found her lying on the floor by a window overlooking the garden . She was lying on her side , with the paper-covered book in her hand . Dr. King had been summoned from Mallingford ; and neither the expression of  | his face nor Betty 's did anything to reassure the household . , Dr. King was with the patient still . This thing was wrong . Terrors should not be domestic terrors . It was like being told that in your own home you may completely disappear for four hours . It was like being told that in your own home you may open a familiar door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room you have never seen before , where something is waiting . From the housekeeper , the cook , and the other maids he learned little except domestic details ; about Betty he learned little except that she liked apples and wrote letters to Gary Cooper . Knowles 's arrival soothed the staff ; and Madeline 's arrival , Page hoped , would have a good effect on Molly Farnleigh . Madeline had accompanied her to her sitting-room while the men glared at one another in the library . Page had wondered what would happen at a meeting between Madeline and Patrick Gore ; yet there was little on which even the imagination could fasten . They were not introduced . Madeline moved past , softly , with her arm round Molly ; she and the claimant looked at each other ; and Page thought that an amused look of recognition opened Gore 's eyes ; but neither spoke . And it was Gore who put the case to the inspector when the others were gathered in the library , just before Dr. Fell flung a hand-grenade of remarkable explosive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gore , re-lighting a black cigar which would not remain lit . " You asked the same kind of questions this morning , and this time I assure you it 's no good . This time it is , where were you when the girl was ? well , whatever happened to her  --  and the Thumbograph was put in her hand ? I have replied quite simply that I am damned if I know . So have all the others . We were here .  | You ordered us to be here . But you may be sure we were not courting each other 's society , and we have not the remotest idea when the girl collapsed . " " Look here , you know , " said Dr. Fell abruptly , " a part of this had better be settled . " " I only hope you can settle it , my friend , " answered Gore , who seemed to have taken a sincere liking to him . " But , inspector , you have already had our statements with the servants . We have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's right , sir , " he said . " And , if it 's necessary , we shall have to go over them again . And again . " " Really ? " interposed Welkyn . The claimant sat on him again . " But , if you 're so interested in the wanderings of that Thumbograph , why not pay some slight attention to what is in the Thumbograph ? " He glanced at the tattered grey book , which now lay on the table between Elliot and Dr. Fell . " Why in the name of sense and sanity do n't you settle the matter now ? Why do n't you decide , between a dead man and myself , which is the real heir ? " " Oh , I can tell you that , " said Dr. Fell affably . There was an abrupt silence , broken only by the scrape of the claimant 's foot on the stone floor . Kennet Murray took away the hand with which he had been shading his eyes . The expression of cynicism remained on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indulgent , and he used one finger to stroke his beard , as though he were listening to a recitation . " Yes , doctor ? " he prompted , in that tone used exclusively among schoolmasters.  | " Furthermore , " continued Dr. Fell , tapping the book on the table , " it 's no good getting down to business with this Thumbograph . It 's a fake . No , no , I do n't mean that you have n't got the evidence . I merely say that THIS Thumbograph , the one that was stolen , is a fake . Mr. Gore pointed out last night , they tell me , that you had several Thumbographs in the old days . " He beamed on Murray . " My boy , you retain your melodramatic soul of old , for which I am glad . You believed that there might be some attempt to pinch the Thumbograph . So you came to the house last night equipped with two of them " Is this true ? " demanded Gore . Murray seemed at once pleased and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the matter carefully . " ? and , " continued Dr. Fell , " the one you showed to these people in the library was bogus . That was why you were so long in getting down to business . Hey ? After you had shoved everybody out of the library , you had to get the real Thumbograph ( a clumsy kind of book , apt to tear ) out of your pocket , and put the valueless one in . But they had said they were going to keep a close watch on you . And , with a wall of windows stretching across the room , you were afraid somebody might see you and cry trickery if you were seen fooling about with the evidence . So you had to make sure there was nobody watching " I was finally obliged , " said Murray gravely , " to get into that cupboard and do it . " His nod indicated an old bookcloset built into the wall on the same side as the windows . " It is somewhat late in life to feel as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliot did not say anything . After glancing sharply from one to the other of them , he began to write in his notebook . " H'mf , yes . You were delayed , " said Dr. Fell . " Mr. Page here , passing the windows only a few minutes before the murder , on his way out to the back of the garden , saw that you were just opening ' the Thumbograph . So you hardly had time to get down to real work ? " " Three or four minutes , " corrected Murray . " Very well . You hardly had time to get down to real work before there were alarums of bloodshed . " Dr. Fell looked pained . " My dear young Murray , you are not simple-minded . Such an alarm might be a trick , especially a trick you would suspect . You would never on earth have gone thundering out , leaving the Thumbograph open and inviting on that table . I could n't believe that when I heard it . No , no , no . Back went the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dummy one for a honeyed lure . Hey ? " " Confound you , " said Murray without heat . " You therefore decided to lie doggo and exultantly apply your detective faculties when the dummy was stolen . You have probably been sitting up all night writing out a statement about the prints , with the real Thumbograph in front of you , together with your affidavit that the real heir " The real heir is who ? " asked Patrick Gore coolly . " Is you , of course , " growled Dr. Fell . Then he looked at Murray . " Hang it all , " he added plaintively , " you must have known that ! He was your pupil . You must have known it . I knew it as soon as I heard him open his mouth ? " The claimant , who had got to his feet , now sat down  | Lather awkwardly . The claimant 's face expressed an almost simian pleasure ; his bright grey eye and even his bald-spot seemed to twinkle . " Dr. Fell , I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart . " But I must point out that you have asked me not single question . " " Look here , you fellows , " said Dr. Fell . " You had the opportunity to listen to him all last evening . Look at him ow . Listen to him . Does he remind you of anybody ? I do n't mean in appearance ; I mean in turn of phrase , in haping of ideas , in way of expressing himself . Well , of whom does he remind you ? Hey ? " And at last the troublesome sense of familiarity fitted into place in Page 's mind , while the doctor blinked round at them . " Of Murray , " replied Page , in the midst of a silence . " Of Murray . Got it in one . Misted by time , of course ; pulled round a bit by character ; but there and unmistakable . Of Murray , who had him in sole charge during the forma , tive years of his life , and was the only one with influence over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those sentences , rolling like the Odyssey . It 's only superficial , I cheerfully acknowledge ; they are no more alike in their natures than I am like Elliot or Hadley . But the echo lingers on . I tell you , the only important question Murray asked last , night was what books the real John Farnleigh had enjoyed as a boy , and what books he hated . Look at this fellow ! " ? he pointed to Gore . " Did n't I hear how his dead eye glowed when he talked about The Count of Monte Cristo and The Cloister and the Hearth ? And of what books he hated and still hates ? No impostor would have dared to talk like that  | before the person to whom he 'd poured out his soul years ago . In a case like this , facts are piffle . Anybody can learn facts . You want the inner boy . I say , Murray : honestly , you 'd better come off it and give us the truth . It 's all very well to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone far enough . " A red bar showed across Murray 's forehead . He looked snappish and a trifle shamefaced . But his far-away mind caught at something out of this . " Facts are not piffle , " Murray said . " I tell you , " roared Dr. Fell , " that facts are ? " He caught himself up . " Harrumph , well . No . Perhaps not . Altogether . But am I correct ? " " He did not recognize the Red Book of Appin . He wrote down that there was no such thing . " " Which he knew only as a manuscript . Oh , I am not his champion . I 'm only trying to establish something . And I repeat : am I correct ? " " Confound you , Fell , you do spoil a fellow 's pleasure , " complained Murray , in a slightly different tone . He glanced across at Gore . " Yes , he 's the real Johnny Farnleigh . Hullo , Johnny . " " Hullo , " said Gore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , his face did not look hard . The quiet in that room was of a dwindling and shrinking sort , as though values were being restored and a blurred image had come into focus . Both Gore and Murray looked at the floor , but they looked vaguely , uncomfortably amused . It was Welkyn 's rich voice which now arose with authority . " You are prepared to prove all this , sir ? " he asked briskly . " There goes my holiday , " said Murray . He reached into his  | stuffed inside pocket , and became austere again . " Yes . Here you are . Original Thumbograph , and print  --  with signature of John Newnham Farnleigh as a boy , and date . In case there should be any doubt this is the original one I brought with me , I had photographs of it taken and deposited with the Commissioner of Police at Hamilton . Two letters from John Farnleigh , written to me in 1911 : compare signatures with the signature on the thumb-print . Present thumb-print , taken ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement ? " " Good . Good , very good , " said Welkyn . Page looked at Burrows , and he noticed that Burrows 's face was white . Nor had Page realized that the breaking of the long tension would have such an effect on their nerves . But he realized it when he looked round , and saw that Molly Farnleigh was in the room . She had come in unobserved , with Madeline Dane just behind her ; she must have heard all of it . They all got up , ' with an awkward scraping of chairs . " They say you 're honest , " she said to Murray . " Is this true ? " Murray bowed . " Madam , I am sorry . " " He was a cheat ? " " He was a cheat who could have deceived nobody who had really known him . " " And now , " interposed Welkyn suavely , " perhaps it would he as well if Mr. Burrows and I were to have a talk  --  without prejudice , of course " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is still most irregular ; and I may point out that I have seen nothing yet in the nature of proof . May I be allowed to examine those documents ? Thank you . Next , Lady Farnleigh , I should like to speak with you alone . "  | Molly had a glazed , strained , puzzled look in her eyes . " Yes , that would be best , " she agreed . " Madeline has been telling me things . " Madeline put a hand soothingly on her arm , but she threw it off with a shake of her sturdy body . Madeline 's self-effacing blonde beauty was in contrast to the anger which blazed round Molly and seemed to darken everything away from her . Then , between Madeline and Burrows , Molly went out of the room . They heard Burrows 's shoes squeak . " God ! " said Patrick Gore . " And now what have we got ? " " If you 'll take it easy and listen to me , sir , " Elliot suggested grimly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Welkyn look at him . " We 've got an impostor who was somehow killed by that pool . Why or by whom we do n't know . We 've got someone who stole a valueless Thumbograph , " ? he held up the little book ? " and later returned it . Presumably because the person knew it was valueless . We 've got a housemaid , Betty , whom nobody had seen since noon ; but who was found at four o'clock in the afternoon , half dead of fright , in the room above this library . Who or what frightened her we do n't know , or how the Thumbograph got into her hand . By the way , where is Dr. King now ? " " Still with the unfortunate Betty , I believe , " said Gore . " But what then ? " " Finally , we have some new evidence , " Elliot told him . He paused . " As you say , you have all been patiently repeating the stories you told last night . Now , Mr. Gore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the murder , were you telling the truth ? Think before you answer . There is someone who contradicts your story . "  | Page had been waiting for it , wondering how long it would be before Elliot would bring it up . " Contradicts my story ? Who contradicts it ? " asked Gore sharply , and took the dead cigar out of his mouth . " Never mind that , if you please . Where were you when you heard the victim fall into the pool ? " The other contemplated him with amusement . " I suppose you 've got a witness . I was watching this ancient , " he indicated Murray , " through the window . It suddenly occurs to me that I have now no reason for keeping back the information any longer . Who saw me ? " " You realize , sir , that if what you say is true this provides you with an alibi ? " " Unfortunately as regards clearing me from suspicion , yes . " " Unfortunately ? " Elliot froze up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " May I ask why you did n't tell me this at first ? " " You may . And in doing so you might ask what I saw through the window . " " I do n't follow you . " Elliot was always careful to conceal his intelligence . A shade of exasperation passed over Gore 's face . " In words of one syllable , inspector , ever since I came into this house last night I suspected the presence of dirty work . This gentleman walked in . " He looked at Murray , and did not seem to know how to treat him . " He knew me . I knew he knew me . But he never spoke out . " " Well ? " " What happened ? I came round the side of the house ? as you have so shrewdly discovered  --  possibly a minute or  | so before the murder . " He broke off . " By the way , have you determined that it was murder ? " " Just one moment , please . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Murray sitting with his back to me like a stuffed dummy , not even moving . Immediately afterwards I heard all the sounds we have so often heard , beginning with the choking noise and ending with the thrashings in water . I moved away from the window , over towards the left , and looked out to see what was happening in the garden . But I did not go nearer . At this time Burrows ran out from the house towards the pool . So I withdrew again , back towards the library windows . The alarm seemed to have gone up inside the house . And this time what did I see ? I saw this distinguished , venerable gentleman , " again his curt nod indicated Murray , " carefully juggling two Thumbographs , guiltily putting one in his pocket and hastily putting the other on the table . . . . " Murray had been listening with critical interest . " So , so ? " he observed , with an almost Teutonic inflection . " You thought I was working against you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As usual , you understate the case , " returned Gore . His face darkened . " So I did not care to tell where I had been . I reserved the knowledge of what I had seen for a shot in the locker in case dirty work had been attempted . " " Have you anything more to add to that ? " " No , inspector , I think not . The rest of what I said was true . But may I ask who saw me ? " " Knowles was standing at the window of the Green Room , " said Elliot , and the other began to whistle through his teeth .  | Then Elliot 's gaze moved from Gore to Murray to Welkyn . " Has any of you ever seen this before ? " From his pocket he took a smaller section of newspaper , in which the stained clasp-knife had been carefully wrapped . He opened it and exhibited the knife . The expressions of Gore and Welkyn showed a general blankness . But Murray sucked in his bearded cheeks ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where did you find this ? " Murray asked briskly . " Near the scene of the crime . Do you recognize it ? " " H 'm . You have tested it for fingerprints ? No . Ah , a pity , " said Murray , growing brisker and brisker . " Will you allow me to touch it if I handle it with the greatest circumspection ? Correct me if I am wrong . But did n't you , young Johnny " ? he glanced at Gore ? " use to have a knife exactly like this ? Did n't I present it to you , in fact ? Did n't you carry it for years ? " " I certainly did . I always carry a pocket-knife , " admitted Gore , reaching into his pocket and producing an old knife only slightly smaller and lighter than the one before them . " But " For once , " interposed Welkyn , slapping his hand on the table , " for once and all I must insist on exercising the rights with which you , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd and improper ; and as your legal adviser I must tell you to disregard them . Such knives are as common as blackberries . I once had one myself . " " But what is wrong with the question ? " asked Gore , puzzled . " I owned a knife like that . It went with the rest of my clothes and effects in the Titanic . But it seems absurd to suppose that the one there could be  | Before anybody could stop him , Murray had whipped a handkerchief out of his pocket , moistened it at his lips ( a handkerchief in the mouth is one of the things which always set Page 's teeth on edge ) , and wiped clean a small section of the blade about halfway down . Into the cleared steel had been roughly cut letters forming the word Madeline . " It is yours , Johnny , " said Murray comfortably . " You put this name there one day when I took you through the stonecutting works at Ilford . " " Madeline , " repeated Gore . Opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his cigar into the sodden trees . But Page saw his face reflected momentarily in the gloomy glass : it was a curious , set , indecipherable face , unlike the one of mockery with which Gore usually pointed out the difference between his moods and the world 's . He turned back . " But what about the knife ? Are you suggesting that that poor , tortured , would-be-honest crook kept it about him all these years , and finally cut his throat with it by the pool ? You seem to have determined that this is a case of murder ; and yet  --  and yet He beat the flat of his hand slowly on his knee . " I 'll tell you what it is , gentlemen , " said Elliot , " it 's an absolutely impossible crime . " He detailed to them Knowles 's story . The interest exhibited by both Gore and Murray was in contrast to the evident disgust and bewilderment of Welkyn . When Elliot described the finding of the knife there was an uneasy movement through the group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gore reflectively . He looked at Murray . " Magister , this is a matter after your own heart . I do n't seem to know you . Perhaps we have grown too far apart ; but in the old days you would have hopped round the inspector , full of strange theories and bearded like the pard ? " " I am no longer a fool , Johnny . " " Still , let us hear a theory . Any theory . So far , you are the only one who has been reticent about the whole affair . " " I second that motion , " observed Dr. Fell . Murray settled himself more comfortably , and began to wag his finger . " The exercise of pure logic , " he began , " is often comparable to working out immense sums in arithmetic and finding at the end that we have somewhere forgotten to carry one or multiply by two . Every one of a thousand figures and factors may be correct except that one ; but the difference in the answer to the sum may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure logic . I make a suggestion . ? You know , inspector , that the coroner 's inquest is almost certainly going to call this suicide ? " " Ca n't say that , sir . Not necessarily , " declared Elliot . " A Thumbograph was stolen and then returned ; a girl was nearly frightened to death ? " " You know as well as I do , " said Murray , opening his eyes , " what verdict a coroner 's jury will return . It is remotely possible that the victim might have killed himself and flung the knife away ; it is impossible that he should have been murdered . But I assume that it is murder . " " Heh , " said Dr. Fell , rubbing his hands . " Heh-heh-heh . And the suggestion ? "  | " Assuming that it is murder , " said Murray , " I suggest that the victim was not , in fact , killed with the knife you have there . I suggest that the marks on his throat are more like the marks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " repeated Elliot . " The term was fanciful , " said Murray , now so didactic that Page longed to administer a swift kick . " I do not necessarily mean literal claws . Shall I argue out my suggestion for you ? " Elliot smiled . " Go right ahead . I do n't mind . And you may be surprised how much there is to argue . " " Put it like this , " said Murray in a startlingly ordinary tone . " Assuming that it was murder , and assuming that this knife was used to do it , one question bothers me badly . It is this . Why did n't the murderer drop the knife into the pool afterwards ? " The inspector still looked at him inquiringly . " Consider the circumstances . The person who killed this man had an almost perfect  --  er " " Set-up ? " suggested Gore , as the other groped . " It is a rotten word , Johnny ; but it will do . Well . The murderer had an almost perfect set-up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped the knife into the pool ? Not one person would afterwards have doubted that it was suicide . This man , an impostor , was about to be unmasked : here would have seemed his way out . Even as things are you have difficulty in believing it was not suicide . With the knife  | in the pool it would have been a clear case . It would even take care of the matter of fingerprints : the water would have washed away any fingerprints which the dead man might have been assumed to have left on the knife . " Now , gentlemen , you ca n't tell me that the murderer did not want this to be thought suicide . You ca n't tell me any murderer ever wants that . If it can be managed , a fraudulent suicide is the best possible way out . Why was n't that knife dropped in the pool ? The knife incriminates nobody  --  except the dead man , another indication of suicide and probably the reason why the murderer chose it . Yet instead the murderer takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it deep down into a hedge ten feet away from the pool . " " Proving ? " said Elliot . " No , no . Proving nothing . " Murray lifted his finger . " But suggesting a great deal . Now consider this behaviour in relation to the crime . Do you believe old Knowles 's story ? " " You 're giving the theories , sir . " " No , that is a fair question , " said Murray rather sharply . Page felt that he only just checked himself from adding , " Come , come , sir ! " " Otherwise we shall get nowhere . " " We shall get nowhere if I say I believe an impossibility , Mr. Murray . " " Then you do believe in suicide ? " " I did n't say that . " " Which do you believe in , then ? " Elliot grinned faintly . " If you get the bit in your teeth , sir , you 'll convince me that I ought to answer you . Knowles 's story is supported by  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's say I believe he was telling the truth , or thought he was telling the truth . What happens then ? "  | " Why , it follows that he did not see anything because there was nothing to see . That can hardly be doubted . This man was alone in the middle of a circle of sand . Therefore no murderer went near him . Therefore the murderer did not use that notched and suggestively stained knife you have there ; and the knife was , in fact , planted ' in the hedge afterwards to make you think it was used for the crime . You follow that ? Since the knife could not have flown out of the air , cut his throat three times , and dropped into the hedge , it is evident that the knife could not have been used at all . That argument is plain ? " " Not exactly plain , " objected the inspector . " You say it was some other weapon ? Then some other weapon hung in the air , cut his throat three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe that . Definitely not . That 's worse than believing in the knife . " " I appeal to Dr. Fell , " said Murray , evidently stung . " What do you say , doctor ? " Dr. Fell sniffed . Mysterious wheezes and noises of internal combustion suggested argument ; but he spoke mildly . " I abide by the knife . Besides , you know , there certainly was something moving in that garden ; something of damned bluish cast of countenance , if you 'll allow me . I say , inspector . You 've taken the statements . But d' you mind if I probe and pry into them a bit ? I should very much like to ask a few questions of the most interesting person here . " " The most interesting person here ? " repeated Gore , and prepared himself . " H'mf , yes . I refer , of course , " said Dr. Fell , lifting his stick and pointing , " to Mr. Welkyn. "  | Superintendent Hadley has often wished that he would not do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with proving that the right thing is always the wrong thing , or at least the unexpected thing ; and waving flags with both hands above the ruin of logic . Certainly Page would never have taken Harold Welkyn for the most interesting person there . The fat solicitor , with his long disapproving chin , evidently did not think so either . But , as even Hadley admits , the old beggar is often unfortunately right . " You spoke to me , sir ? " inquired Welkyn . " I was telling the inspector a while ago , " said Dr. Fell , " that your name seemed very familiar . I remember now . Is it a general interest in the occult ? Or are you a collector of curious clients ? I rather imagine you collected our friend here , " he nodded towards Gore , " in the same way you collected that Egyptian some time ago . " " Egyptian ? " asked Elliot . " What Egyptian ? " " Think ! You 'll remember the case . Ledwidge v. Ahriman , before Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the defence . " " You mean that ghost-seer or whatever he was ? " " Yes , " said Dr. Fell , with great pleasure . " Little bit of a chap ; hardly more than a dwarf . But he did n't see ghosts : he saw through people , or so he said . He was the fashion of London ; all the women flocked to him . Of course , he could have been prosecuted under the old Witchcraft Act , still in force ? " " A most infamous act , sir , " declared Welkyn , slapping the table . " ? but it was a question of a libel suit , and Mr. Welkyn 's ingenious defence , combined with Gordon-Bates as counsel ,  | got him off . Then there was Madame Duquesne , the medium , who was up for manslaughter because one of her clients died of fright in her house . ( Fascinating point of law , eh ? ) Mr. Welkyn was also instructed for the defence there . The trial , as I remember it , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a girl , good-looking blonde as I remember her . The charges against her never got past the Grand Jury , because Mr. Welkyn Patrick Gore was looking at his solicitor with quick interest . " Is this true ? " he demanded . " Believe me , gentlemen , I did not know it . " " It is true , is n't it ? " inquired Dr. Fell . " You 're the same chap ? " Welkyn 's face was full of cold wonder . " Of course it is true , " he answered . " But what of it ? What has it to do with the present case ? " Page could not have said why it seemed so incongruous . Harold Welkyn , examining his pink finger-nails , then glancing up sharply from little eyes , was a model of business decorum ; and yet why not ? The white slip inside his waistcoat , the glossy wings of his collar , had no connection with the clients he sought or the beliefs he held . " You see , Mr. Welkyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for asking . You were the only one who saw or heard anything queer in the garden last night . Will you read out the part of Mr. Welkyn 's statement I mean , inspector ? " Elliot nodded , not taking his eyes from Welkyn until he opened the notebook . heard a kind of rustling noise in the hedges or shrubbery , and I thought I saw something looking at me through one of the glass panels of the door , one of the panels down  | nearest the ground . I was afraid that certain things might be happening which were no affair of mine : " " Exactly , " said Dr. Fell , and closed his eyes . Elliot hesitated , debating two courses ; but Page had a feeling that the matter was out in the open now , and that both Dr. Fell and the inspector thought it was better so . Elliot 's hard , sandy-haired head bent forward a little . " Now , sir , " he said . " I did n't want to ask you too much this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement mean ? " " What it says . " " You were in the dining-room , only fifteen feet or so away from the pool , yet you did n't once open one of those doors and look out ? Even when you heard the sounds you describe ? " " No . " " I was afraid that certain things might be happening that were no affair of mine , ' " read Elliot . " Does this refer to the murder ? Did you think that a murder was being com-mitted ? " " No , certainly not , " said Welkyn , with a slight jump . " And I still have no reason to suspect that one was committed . Inspector , are you mad ? Clear evidence of suicide is brought to you ; and you all go star-gazing after something else ? " " Did you think that suicide was being committed last night , then ? " " No , I had no reason to suspect it . " " Then what were you referring to ? " asked Elliot practically . Welkyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By lifting his fingers slightly he conveyed the effect of a shrug ; but his bland dumpling countenance betrayed nothing else .  | " I 'll try to put it in another way . Mr. Welkyn , do you believe in the supernatural ? " " Yes , " said Welkyn briefly . " Do you believe that someone is attempting to produce ' supernatural phenomena here ? " Welkyn looked at him . " And you from Scotland Yard ! You say that ! " " Oh , it 's not as bad as all that , " said Elliot ; and he wore a curious , dark expression which his countrymen have understood for centuries . " I said attempting , ' and there are various ways of doing that . Real and unreal . Believe me , sir , there may be queer doings here  --  implanted here  --  growing from , ? ne ancestor to another  --  queerer doings than you think . I ame down here because Miss Daly had been murdered ; and ere may be more behind that than a purse of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't the one who suggested here might be something supernatural here . You suggested it . " " I did ? " " Yes . I thought I saw something looking at me through one of the glass panels of the door , one of the panels down nearest the ground . ' You said something : Why did n't you say someone ' ? " A small bead of sweat appeared on Welkyn 's forehead , up near the large vein by the temple . It was his only change of expression , if it can be called that ; at least it was the only moving thing on his face . " I did not recognize who it was . Had I recognized the person , I should have said someone . ' I was merely attempting to be accurate . " " It was a person , then ? A someone ' ? "  | The other nodded . " But , in order to peep at you through one of the lower panels , this person must have been crouched down to the ground or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not exactly ? What do you mean by that , sir ? " " It was moving too quickly  --  and jumpily . I hardly know how to express what I mean . " " Ca n't you describe it ? " " No . I only received the impression that it was dead . " Something like horror had got into Brian Page 's bones ; how it had come there , even when it had come , he could not tell . Almost imperceptibly the conversation had moved into a new element , yet he felt that this had always been in the background of the case , waiting for a touch to be wakened . Harold Welkyn then made a very quick movement . He took a handkerchief out of his breast pocket , wiped the palms of his hands quickly on it , and replaced it . When he spoke again he had recovered something of his old solemn , careful manner . " One moment , inspector , " he put in before Elliot could speak . " I have been trying to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ask me whether I believe in  --  such things . I do . I tell you frankly I would n't go into that garden after dark for a thousand pounds . It seems to surprise you that a man of my profession should have such ideas . " Elliot pondered . " To tell you the truth , it does , somehow . I do n't know why it should . After all , I suppose even a lawyer may believe in the supernatural . " The other 's tone was dry . " Even a lawyer may , " he agreed ; " and be none the worse man of business for doing so . "  | Madeline had come into the room . Only Page noticed her , for the others were too intent on Welkyn ; she was walking on tiptoe , and he wondered whether she had heard what had gone before . Though he tried to give her his chair , she sat down on the arm of it . He could not see her face : only e soft line of chin and cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk blouse was rising and falling rapidly . Kennet Murray 's eyebrows were pinched together . He was very polite , but he had the air of a customs-officer about to examine luggage . " I presume , Mr. Welkyn , " Murray said , " you are  --  eronest about this . It is certainly extraordinary . That garden as a bad reputation . It has had a bad reputation for centuries . n fact , it was remodelled in the late seventeenth century in e hope of exorcising the shadow by fresh prospects . You emember , young Johnny , how your demonological studies ied to raise up things there ? " " Yes , " answered Gore . He was about to add something , ut he checked himself . " And on your homecoming , " said Murray , " you are greeted y a crawling legless something in the garden , and a houseaid frightened into a fit . Look here , young Johnny : you 're not up to your old tricks of frightening people , are you ? " To Page 's surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared , was the only person who could sting him or rouse him out of his urbanity . " No , " Gore said . " You know where I was . I was keeping an eye on you in the library . And just one thing more . Just who the hell do you think you are , to talk to me as though I were still a fifteen-year-old child ? You kow-towed to my father ; and , by God , I 'll have decent respect from you or I 'll take a cane to you as you used to do to me. "  | The outburst was so unexpected that even Dr. Fell grunted . Murray got to his feet . " Is it going to your head already ? " he said . " Just as you like . My usefulness is over . You have your proofs . If I am wanted for anything more , inspector , I shall be at the inn . " " That , John , " interposed Madeline softly , " was rather a rotten thing to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For the first time both Murray and Gore looked at her fully , and she at them . The latter smiled . " You are Madeline , " he said . " I am Madeline . " " My old , cold light-of-love , " said Gore . The wrinkles deepened round his eyes . He detained Murray , and there was apology in his voice . " It 's no good , magister . We ca n't pick up the past , and now I am quite certain I do n't care to . It seems to me that for twenty-five years I have been moving forward , mentally , while you have been standing still . I used to imagine what would happen when I returned to what are poetically known as the halls of my fathers . I used to imagine myself moved by the sight of a picture on a wall or letters cut with a pen-knife into the back of a bench . What I find is a group of alien sticks and stones ; I begin to wish I had not intruded . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone out of line . Inspector Elliot ! Did n't you say a minute ago that you had come down here because Miss Daly had been murdered ' ? " " That 's right , sir . " Murray had sat down again , evidently curious , while Gore turned to the inspector . " Victoria Daly . That 's not by any chance the little girl  | who used to live with her aunt  --  Ernestine Daly , was it ? ? at Rose-Bower Cottage on the other side of the Hanging Chart ? " " I do n't know about her aunt , " returned Elliot , " but that 's where she lived . She was strangled on the night of July 31st , last year . " The claimant was grim . " Then I can at least produce an alibi there . I was happily in America then . All the same , will somebody take us out of this fen ? What has the murder of Victoria Daly got to do with this business here ? " Elliot gave an inquiring glance towards Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bulk hardly seemed to breathe , and he was watching . Taking up the briefcase from beside his chair , Elliot opened it and drew out a book . It was of quarto size , bound in dark calf-skin at some comparatively recent date ( say a hundred years ago ) , and had on its back the somewhat unexhilarating title of Admirable History . The inspector pushed it across to Dr. Fell , who opened it . Then Page saw that it was a much older volume , a translation from the French of Sebastien Michaelis , published at London in 1613 . The paper was brownish and ridged , and across from the title-page there was a very curious book-plate . " H'mf , " said Dr. Fell . " Has anybody here ever seen this book before ? " " Yes , " said Gore quietly . " And this book-plate ? " " Yes . That book-plate has not been used in the family since the eighteenth century . " Dr. Fell 's finger traced out the motto . " Sanguis eius super nos et super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His blood be upon us and upon our children . ' ? Was this book ever in the library here at the Close ? "  | Gore 's eye quickened and gleamed as he looked at the book ; but he remained puzzled . He spoke sardonically . " No , it certainly was not . That 's one of the books of darkness which my father , and his father before him , kept locked in the little room in the attic . I stole his key once , and had some duplicates made , so that I could go up there and read . Lord , the time I spent there  --  under pretext , if anyone should find me , of getting an apple from the apple-room next door . " He looked round . " Do you remember , Madeline ? I took you up there once to give you a glimpse of the Golden Hag ? I even gave you a key . But I am afraid you never liked it. ? Doctor , where did you get that book ? How did it get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell for Knowles . " Will you find Lady Farnleigh , " he said to a scared butler , " and ask her if she will come in here ? " With great leisureliness Dr. Fell took out pipe and pouch . He filled the pipe , lit it , and inhaled with deep satisfaction before he spoke . Then he made a flourishing gesture and pointed . " That book ? Because of the innocuous title , nobody at the time even glanced into it or thought twice about it . Actually , it contains one of the most unnerving documents in recorded history : the confession of Madeleine de la Palud , at Aix in 1611 , or her participation in ceremonies of witchcraft and the worship of Satan . It was found on the table by Miss Daly 's bed . She had been reading it not long before she was murdered . "  | Chapter XII IN THE quiet of the library , Page heard very distinctly the footsteps of Molly Farnleigh and Burrows as they came in . Murray cleared his throat . " Meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that Miss Daly was killed by a tramp ? " " Quite possibly she was . " " Well , then ? " It was Molly Farnleigh who spoke . " I came in here to tell you , " she said , " that I am going to fight this ridiculous claim , your claim , " her whole vigorous nature went into the glance of cold dislike she gave Gore , " to the end . Nat Burrows says it will probably take years and we shall all lose our shirts , but I can afford that . In the meantime , the important thing is who killed John . I 'll call a truce for the time being , if you will . What did I hear you all talking about when we came in here ? " A certain sense of relief went through the group . But one man was instantly on guard . " You think you have a case , Lady Farnleigh ? " asked Welkyn , all solicitor again . " I am bound to warn you ? " " A better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted Molly , with a curious significant look at Madeline . " What did I hear you talking about when we came in ? "  | Dr. Fell , fiery with interest now , spoke in a kind of apologetic thunder . " We 're on rather an important aspect of it just now , ma'am , " he said , " and we should very much appreciate your help . Is there still , in the attic of this house , a little room containing a collection of books on witchcraft and kindred subjects ? Eh ? " " Yes , of course . But what has that to do with it ? " " Look at this book , ma'am . Can you tell us positively whether it comes from that collection ? " Molly approached the table . They had all risen , but she made a gesture of impatience at the formality . " I think so . Yes , I 'm almost sure of it . All of them had that book-plate , and none of the other books have : it 's a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Dr. Fell told her . " But that 's impossible ! " " Why ? " " Because there was such a terrible fuss and bother and to-do about those books . My husband caused it ; I never knew why . We had only been married a little over a year , you know . " Her quiet brown eyes looked at the past . She took the chair Burrows set out for her . " When I came here as a  --  as a bride , he gave me all the household keys except the key to that room . Of course I handed them straight over to Mrs. Apps , the housekeeper ; but you know the principle of the thing . It interested me , rather . " " Like Bluebeard ? " suggested Gore . " No controversy , please , " said Dr. Fell sharply , as she turned to the claimant in a cold fury . " Very well , " said Molly . " Anyhow , I heard about it . My husband wanted to burn it  --  the collection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuing the property just before he came into it , they had a man down from London to look at the books . He said that little collection in the attic was worth thousands and thousands of pounds and almost danced with delight , the silly ass . He said there were all kinds of rarities in it , including something unique . I do remember what that was . It was a manuscript book which was supposed to have been lost since the beginning of the nineteenth century . Nobody knew where it had gone , and there it was right in our attic . They called it the Red Book of Appin . He said it was supposed to be the big harum-scarum hocus-pocus of magic , and it was so magical that anybody who read it had to wear a hoop of iron round his head . I jolly well do remember that , because you were all arguing about it last night , and this man " ? she looked at Gore ? " did n't even know what it was . " " As Dr. Fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he addressed Murray . " Fair play , magister . I never knew the sacred volume under that name , you know . But I can tell you what it is , and I can even identify it if it is still upstairs . I 'll give you one of its qualities . Anyone who possessed it was said to know what any inquiry would be before the inquirer opened his lips . " " That must have been very useful to you , " Molly said sweetly , " last night . " " As proving that I had read the book , yes . It was also said to confer the power of giving life to inanimate objects , which almost suggests that Lady Farnleigh must have read it herself . " Dr. Fell hammered the ferrule of his stick on the floor to call for attention . When the threatened storm had been hammered away , he looked at Molly benevolently.  | " Heh , " said Dr. Fell . " Heh-heh-heh . I gather , ma'am , that you do n't believe in the magical properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , so-and-so ! " said Molly , using a short Anglo-Saxon word which made Madeline colour . " H'mf , yes . Exactly . But you were telling us ? " " Well , anyway , my husband was frightfully upset and concerned about those books . He wanted to burn them . I said not to be absolutely silly : if he had to get rid of them , why not sell them , and in any case what harm were they doing ? He said they were full of eroticism and wickedness . " Molly hesitated , but she went on in her candid way . " That did interest me a bit , if you must know . I peeped into one or two of them  --  when he showed me the room  --  but it certainly was n't anything like that . You never read such horribly dull stuff in your life . There was nothing low about it . It was a lot of long-winded rubbish about the twin life-lines or something , and all done with those funny f 's ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer lisped . I could n't get up any interest in it . So , when my husband insisted on keeping the place locked , I never bothered any more about it and I 'm sure it has n't been opened since . " " But this book , " Dr. Fell tapped it , " came from there ? " " Ye-es , I 'm sure of it . " " And your husband always kept the key to that locked room . Yet somehow it got out of there and into Miss Daly 's possession . H 'm . " Dr. Fell was smoking in short puffs ; now he took the pipe out of his mouth and sniffed massively . " Consequently , we have a connection  --  on a thread like this ? through Miss Daly 's death to your husband 's death . Eh ? " " But what connection ? "  | " For instance , ma'am , could he have given Miss Daly the book himself ? " " But I 've already told you what he thought about those books ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fell apologetically , " was not the question . Could he ? After all , we 've heard that when he was a boy  --  if he was the real John Farnleigh , as you claim  --  he thought very highly of those books . " Molly faced it out . " You 've got me in a cleft stick . If I say he hated such things out of all reason , you can answer that it 's too much of a change and proves he was n't John Farnleigh . If I say he could have given the book to Victoria  --  well , I do n't know what you 'll say . " " All we want is an honest answer , ma'am , " said Dr. Fell . " Or , rather , an honest impression . Heaven pity the person who tries to tell all the truth . But look here : did you know Victoria Daly well ? " " Pretty well . Poor Victoria was the sort who exulted in Good Works . " " Should you have said , " Dr. Fell made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said she was the sort to be deeply interested in the subject of witchcraft ? " Molly clenched her hands . " But will you tell me , please , how on earth this witchcraft talk comes into it ? Granting that 's what this book is about ? if it comes from the attic it must be  --  does it prove anything just because she was reading it ? " " There is other evidence , believe me , " said Dr. Fell gently . " Your own native intelligence , ma'am , will show you that the important thing is the connection of Miss Daly + a locked  | library + that book . For instance : did your husband know her well ? " " H 'm . I do n't know . Not very well , I should have thought . " Dr. Fell 's forehead was wrinkled . " And yet consider his behaviour last night , as it has been described to me . Confirm this . A claimant to his estate appears . The possession of this estate , rightfully or wrongfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now the citadel is attacked . Mr. Gore , Mr. Welkyn , with their convincing stories and their deadly proof of fingerprints , are closing in on him . It is true that he paces the floor ; yet , at the very moment the attack is launched , he seems more concerned over the fact that there is a detective in the village investigating the death of Victoria Daly . Is that true ? " It was true . Page remembered it only too well . And Molly was forced to admit it . " So , we perceive , the thread spins out . Let 's try to follow that thread wherever it leads . I am more and more interested in that locked attic room . Is there anything else up there besides books ? " Molly reflected . " Only that mechanical robot thing . I saw it once when I was a little girl , and I rather loved it . I asked my husband why we could n't have it down and see whether we could n't find a way to make it work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there too . " " Ah , the mechanical robot thing , " repeated Dr. Fell , hauling himself up with a wheeze and flash of interest . " What can you tell us about that ? " It was Kennet Murray who answered , when Molly shook her head . ?  | " Now there is a matter , doctor , " Murray said comfortably , settling himself in the chair , " you would do well to investigate . I tried to investigate it years ago , and so did young Johnny . " " Well ? " " Here are all the facts I could unearth . " Murray spoke with emphasis . " Sir Dudley never allowed me to look at the figure , and I had to work from outside . It was constructed by M. Raisin , the organist of Troyes , who made the self-playing harpsichord for Louis XIV ; and it was exhibited with great success at the court of Charles II in 1676-77 . It was a nearly life-sized figure , sitting on a kind of small couch , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is argument about which one . Its actions delighted the people of that time . It played two or three tunes on a cittern ( what we nowadays call a zither ) ; it thumbed its nose at the spectators , and went through a variety of gestures , some undoubtedly indecorous . " There was no doubt that he had caught the immediate interest of his audience . " It was bought by Sir Thomas Farnleigh , whose book-plate you have there , " said Murray . " Whether it was the immodesty of the automaton that later caused a blight to fall on it , or some other cause , I have never been able to find out . But something happened  --  dead silence of all records as to what . That seems no reason for the horror it inspired in the eighteenth century , though such a contraption would n't have recommended itself to Sir Dudley or his father or grandfather . Presumably old Thomas learned the secret of how to make it work ; but that secret has never been passed on . Eh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | At the thick and exaggerated courtesy of his tone , Gore showed some contempt . But he was interested in other matters . " No , it was not passed on , " Gore admitted . " And it will never be learned . I know , gentlemen . In my younger days I racked my brains over the secret of the Golden Hag . I could easily show you why none of the obvious explanations would work . If we ? " He looked startled . " By all the gods , why should n't we go up and have a look at her ? I only just thought of it . I 'm inhibited . I was thinking of all sorts of excuses and crooked ways by which I could sneak up there as I used to do . But why not ? Why not , in the open light of day ? " He thumped his fist down on the arm of the chair , blinking a little as though he himself had just come into light . Inspector Elliot interposed rather sharply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is all very interesting ; and we can go into it another time ; but I do n't see that it has any bearing on ? " Are you sure ? " asked Dr. Fell . " Sir ? " " Are you sure ? " repeated the doctor with great intensity . " I say , somebody ! What does this automaton look like ? " " It 's a good deal decayed , of course ; at least , it was twentyfive years ago " It was , " agreed Madeline Dane , and shuddered . " Do n't go up there . Please say you wo n't ! " " But why on earth not ? " cried Molly . " I do n't know . I 'm afraid . " Gore regarded her with indulgence . " Yes , I hazily remember that it had a powerful effect on  | you . But you were asking what it looked like , doctor . It must have been uncannily life-like when it was new . The framework is of jointed iron , of course ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one missing  --  and real hair . The decay has not improved it ; it is rather fat , and used to look somewhat unpleasant when you imagined things . It wears , or used to wear , a brocaded gown . The hands and fingers are of painted iron . In order to play the zither and make gestures , the fingers are long and jointed and sharp , almost like . . . It used to smile , but the smile had rotted away when I saw it last . " " And Betty Harbottle , " said Dr. Fell abruptly , " Betty Harbottle , like Eve , has a strong fondness for apples . " " I beg your pardon ? " " She has , you know , " urged Dr. Fell . " Betty Harbottle , the frightened maid , is fond of apples . That was the first thing which was pointed out to us when we questioned the servants . I suspect our good housekeeper , Mrs. Apps , of conveying a hint . By the darkness of Eleusis , that 's exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's red face shone with concentration as he blinked at Gore ? " you told me a minute ago that you used to have a pretext when you wanted to visit the den of the books and the Golden Hag . You went to the appleroom , next door to it in the attic . Will somebody offer me odds as to where Betty Harbottle was when she was frightened , and where the Thumbograph was hidden last night ? " Harold Welkyn got up and began to walk round the table ; but he was the only one who moved . Afterwards Page was to remember that circle of faces in the gloom of the library , and the brief expression he surprised on one of them .  | It was Murray who spoke , smoothing his moustache . " Ah . Yes . Yes , it is undoubtedly interesting . If I still have my geography straight , the stairs to the attic are at the back of the passage beside the Green Room . You suggest that the girl was carried downstairs and put in the Green Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only suggest that we have got to follow our dim intelligences or go home to bed . Every thread leads back to that little den . It 's the core of the labyrinth and the heart of every disturbance , like the little bowl of fluid in The House and the Brain : which is an apter title than we may think . We had better pay a visit there . " Inspector Elliot spoke slowly . " I think we had . Now . Do you mind , Lady Farnleigh ? " " No , not at all , except that I do n't know where the key is . Oh , bother that ! Break the lock . It 's a new padlock my husband had put on ; and if you think it will help you can tear ? you can t-tear ? " Molly brushed her hand across her eyes , held tight to her feelings , and regained control again . " Shall I lead the way ? " " Thank you . " Elliot was brisk . " How many of the rest of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Gore ? Will you two come with Dr. Fell and me , please ? And Mr. Page . The others please remain here . " Elliot and the doctor went ahead , talking in low tones . Molly then put herself in front of them , as though discreetly deaf , placing them between herself and the claimant . Page followed with Madeline . " If you 'd rather not go up ? ? " he said to Madeline . She pressed his arm . " No , please . I want to go up . I do , really , to see if I can understand what is going on . You  | know , I 'm afraid something I said has upset Molly terribly , but I had to tell her : there was no other way out . Brian . You do n't think I 'm a cat , do you ? " He was startled . Though her half-smiling mouth made fun of this suggestion , the long eyes had a look of great intensity . " Good Lord , no ! What put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she did n't love him , really . She 's only doing all this because she thinks she ought to . In spite of all appearances , I tell you they were n't suited to each other . He was idealistic and she is practical . Wait : I know he was an impostor , but you do n't know all the circumstances or you 'd understand " Then give me the practical , " Page snapped . " Brian ! " " I mean it . Idealistic my eye ! If he did what they say he did , and what you yourself admit he did , our late dead friend was a hundred-carat swine and you know it . Were you by any chance in love with him yourself ? " " Brian ! You have no right to say that ! " " I know I have n't ; but were you ? " " I was not , " said Madeline quietly , and looked at the floor . " If you had better eyes , or understood things better , you would know enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear that she wanted to change the subject . " What do Dr. Fell and the inspector think of  --  all this ? " He opened his mouth to answer , and realized that he had no idea . He had no idea . Their group had gone up the broad , shallow oak staircase to the floor above , along the gallery , and round the turning of a passage to the left . On the left was  | the Green Room , its open door showing heavy study-furniture of the last century and walls biliously patterned . On the right were two bedroom doors . The passage ran straight down to a window at the end , overlooking the garden . The stairs up to the attic  --  Page vaguely remembered  --  were in the outer thickness of the wall at the end of the passage , the door to them being in the left-hand wall . But he was not thinking of this . Despite Dr. Fell 's thunderous geniality , and the easy-talking frankness of Inspector Elliot , he realized that he knew nothing whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what about routine police-work : a fingerprint here , a footprint there , a searching of the garden by Elliot or a clue sealed into an envelope ? The finding of the knife , yes ; he knew of that because under the circumstances it could hardly have been avoided . What else , even as regarded theories ? Certain statements had been taken from certain persons ; what were we to think of those statements ? After all , it was their business . Yet it disquieted him . New discoveries were being turned up out of what he had thought was old ground , like skulls at Blenheim , and you had no warning of the skull until it rolled across the table . No , better change the simile . Up ahead towered Dr. Fell 's huge back , seeming to fill the passage . " Which room is she in ? " Elliot asked in a low voice . Molly indicated the farther bedroom door , across the passage from the door to the attic . Elliot knocked very lightly at the door ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " whispered Madeline . " In there ? "  | " Yes . They put her in the nearest bedroom . She 's not , " said Madeline , " she 's not in very good shape . " The full implications of this were beginning to creep into Page 's mind . Dr. King opened the bedroom door , glanced ' behind him , and eased it softly shut as he slipped out into the passage . " No , " he said . " You ca n't see her yet . Tonight , maybe ; tomorrow or next day more likely . I wish the sedatives would take hold . They wo n't , properly . " Elliot looked puzzled and worried . " Yes , but , doctor , surely it 's not  --  not ? ? " " Serious , were you going to say ? " asked King , lowering his grizzled head as though he were about to butt with it . " My God ! Excuse me . " He opened the door again . " Has she said anything ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half of it . I wish I could find out what she saw . " He was speaking to a very quiet group . Molly , whose expression had altered , seemed to be trying to hold fiercely to accepted rules . Dr. King had been a lifelong friend of her father , and they stood on no ceremony with each other . " Uncle Ned , I want to know . I 'd do anything for Betty , and you know it . But I never realized  --  that is , it 's not really what we can call serious , is it ? It ca n't be . People get frightened , but it 's not the same thing as being actually ill ? It 's not dangerous ? " " Oh , " said the other , " it 's not dangerous . Fine , lusty wench you are ; no nerves ; surplus energy ; see something and bill it  | one . Yes , you would . Well , maybe it takes people differently . Maybe it was a mouse or wind in the chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever it was . " His tone softened . " No , it 'll be all right . No help , thanks ; Mrs. Apps and I can manage . But you might have some tea sent up . " The door closed . " Yes , my good friends , " observed Patrick Gore , with his hands deep in his pockets , " I think I am safe in saying that something has happened . Shall we go upstairs ? " He went over and opened the door opposite . The staircase inside was steep-pitched and had that faint , sour smell which comes from old stone enclosed within walls . It was as though you saw the ribs and bones inside the house , unsmoothed by modern crafts . The servants ' quarters , Page knew , were at the other side of the house . There was no window here ; and Elliot , who went ahead , had to use an electric torch . Gore followed him , then Dr. Fell , then Molly , with Madeline and Page in the rear . Nor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inigo Jones sketched out his small windows and backed his brick with stone . On the landing the floor sloped in such humped fashion towards the stairs that an unwary footstep might send you down . There was a mighty strength of oak beams , too huge for the picturesque , conveying only power to uphold or crush . Faint grey light entered ; the air was thick , damp , and hot . They found the door they wanted at the far end . It was a heavy door , black , suggesting a cellar rather than an attic . The hinges were of the eighteenth century ; the knob was gone and a more modern lock disused ; a tight chain and padlock  | now secured it . But it was not at the lock that Elliot first directed his light . Something had been flung down And partly crushed by the closing of the door . It was a half-eaten apple .  | Chapter XIII WITH the edge of a sixpence as a screw-driver , Elliot carefully unscrewed the staple which held the chain of the padlock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , like a carpenter . When the chain had fallen the door swung open of its own accord . " The lair of the Golden Hag , " said Gore with gusto , and kicked the half-eaten apple out of the way . " Steady on , sir ! " said Elliot sharply . " What ? Do you think the apple is evidence ? " " You never know . When we go in here , please do n't touch anything unless I tell you to . " " When we go in " was an optimistic phrase . Page had expected to see a room . What he found was a kind of bookcloset hardly six feet square , with a sloping roof in which a small and thick-grimed pane of glass showed opaque . There were many gaps in the shelves , where ragged calfskin mingled with more modern bindings . Over everything was a film of dust ; but it was that thin , blackish , gritty dust of attics , in which few decipherable marks are left . An early Victorian armchair was pushed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them when the light of Elliot 's torch fell inside .  | Even Elliot jumped back a little . The hag was not a beauty . She might once have been an alluring charmer , but now only one eye looked out of half a face : the other side of the head was ruined , like the remnants of the velvet brocaded gown which might once have been yellow . Her appearance was not improved by the cracks opening out across her face . Had she been standing up , she would have been something under life-size . She sat on an oblong box , once gilded and painted to resemble a couch , but not much broader or deeper than she was , and set up off the floor on wheels which were evidently of later date than the automaton itself . The hands were partly lifted with burlesque and rather horrible coquetry . The whole squat , ponderous machine must have weighed two or three hundredweight . Madeline uttered a kind of giggle , as of nerves or relief . Elliot growled , and Dr. Fell swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this anti-climax ? " " Sir ? " " You know what I mean . Did that girl try to get into Bluebeard 's room , see this thing for the first time , and ? " He paused , blowing out the ends of his moustache . " No . No , that wo n't do . " " I 'm afraid it wo n't , " agreed Elliot soberly . " If something happened to her here , that is . How did she get in ? And who carried her downstairs ? And where did she get the Thumbograph ? You ca n't tell me that the mere sight of this thing would affect her as badly as she seems to have been affected . She might scream , or something of the sort . It might give her a turn . But nothing like this , unless she 's a hysterical case . Lady Farnleigh , did the servants know about this dummy ? " " Of course , " said Molly . " Nobody has seen it , except Knowles or possibly Mrs. Apps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't even come as a surprise ? " " No . " " If , as I say , she was frightened by something in this little two-by-four place  --  of which we have n't any evidence ? " " Look there , " said Dr. Fell , pointing with his stick . The beam of the torch played on the floor by the base of the automaton . It found a heap of crumpled linen which , when Elliot picked it up , proved to be a maid 's frilled apron . Though it had recently been freshly laundered , it was stained with patches of dust and dirt ; and , in one place , there were two short jagged rents in it . Dr. Fell took it from the inspector and handed it to Molly . " Betty 's ? " he said . Molly examined a minute tab , with an even more minute name in ink , sewn to the hem of the apron ; and Molly nodded . " Stop a bit ! " urged Dr. Fell , shutting his eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing on his eyeglasses as though to keep them from falling off . When he took his hand away again , his face was lowering and grave . " All right . I 'll tell you , my lad . I ca n't prove it , any more than I could prove the part about the apple and the appleroom . But I can tell you what happened in that book-closet as certainly as though I had seen it . It 's no longer mere routine : it 's the most vital thing in the case that we should know just when , between lunch-time and four o'clock in the afternoon , that girl was frightened , and what the various people here were doing at that time . " Because , my lad , the murderer was here  --  in this book closet . Betty Harbottle found him here . I do n't know what  |  | the murderer was doing ; but it was vital that nobody should know he had been here at all . Something happened . Afterwards he used the girl 's apron to remove possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . He carried or dragged her downstairs . He put into her hand the useless Thumbograph he had stolen the night before . And then he went away , as they all do , and left the apron lying neatly in the middle of the floor . Eh ? " Elliot raised his hand . " Steady on , sir . Not so fast . " He thought it over . " There are two bad objections to that , I 'm afraid . " " Which are ? " " One . If it was so vital to conceal the fact that he 'd been in this little room , doing whatever he was doing , how was he covering his tracks just by moving the unconscious girl from one place to another ? He was n't preventing disclosure ; he was only postponing it . The girl 's alive . She will recover . And she 'll tell who was here , and what he was doing  --  if anything . " " Apparently a poser , " said Dr. Fell . " Apparently a stinger whang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he spoke with some violence , " I should not be surprised if the answer to that seeming contradiction is the answer to our problem . What 's the other objection ? " " Betty Harbottle was n't hurt . Physically , she was n't touched . She was put into the shape she was in by plain old-fashioned fright at something she saw . Yet all she could have seen was an ordinary human being doing something he should n't . It 's not reasonable , sir ; girls are pretty tough these days. ? What could have put her into that state , then ? " Dr. Fell looked at him . t  | " Something that the automaton did , " he answered . " Suppose it reached out now and took your hand ? " Such is the power of suggestion that every person in the group shied back . Six pairs of eyes turned to the ruined head and the curious hands of the dummy . They would not be pleasant hands to take or touch . Nothing about that figure , from the mildewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good to the touch . Elliot cleared his throat . " You mean he made the dummy work ? " " He did not make it work , " interposed Gore . " I thought of that years ago . That is , he did not make it work unless some electrical system or other trickery has been shoved into it since my time . Damn it all , gentlemen , nine generations of Farnleighs have tried to discover what made it work . And I 'll make you a flat offer . I will pay a thousand pounds to the man who can show me how it does work . " " Man or woman ? " said Madeline . Page could see that she was forcing a laugh , but Gore spoke in very desperate earnest . " Man or woman or child or anybody else . To the man or woman who can make it work without modern hocus-pocus , and under the same conditions as it was exhibited two hundred and fifty years ago . " " The offer 's generous enough , " said Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's have a look at her . " With some effort Elliot and Page , laying hold of the iron box on which the dummy sat , pulled it out of the book-closet with a bump over the sill . She jerked her head and quivered ; Page wondered whether the hair would come off . Yet the wheels moved with surprising ease . With a heavy creaking and  | a faint rattling noise , they pushed her over into the light from the window near the head of the stairs . " Go on . Demonstrate , " said Dr. Fell . Gore made a careful examination . " To begin with , you will find that the body of the thing is full of clockwork . I am no mechanical expert , and I ca n't tell you whether all the wheels and whatnots are genuine , or whether they were put there for effect . I suspect that most of them are dummies even if some are genuine . Anyhow , the point is that the body is completely filled . There 's a long window at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand through , and  --  oh , you scratch , do you ? " Gore 's face darkened , and he jerked his own hand back . In his absorption he made a gesture too close to the sharp fingers of the automaton ; a crooked scratch drew blood on the back of his hand . He put it to his mouth . " My good old clock-guts ! " he said . " My faithful old clockguts ! I ought to knock the rest of your face off . " " Do n't ! " cried Madeline . He was amused . " As you wish , little one . In any case , inspector  --  will you poke about among the works ? What I want to establish is that the body is full of them and that nobody could hide in there . " Elliot was as serious as ever . The glass had long gone from the window at the back ; with the aid of his flashlight he examined the mechanism and groped inside . Something seemed to startle him , but he only said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for anything here . You mean it was suggested that somebody was hiding in the thing and working it ? " " The only suggestion anybody could hazard . Now , then .  | That takes care of the automaton itself . The only other part of it , as you can see for yourself , is the couch on which she sits . Watch . " This time he had more difficulty . At the left of the couch 's front there was a small knob ; Page could see that the whole front opened out like a little door on a hinge . With some manipulation he managed to get the door open . The interior of the box , bare iron badly corroded with rust , was well under three feet long and not more than eighteen inches high . Gore beamed with pleasure . " You remember , " he said , " the explanation that was advanced for the chess-playing automaton of Maelzel ? The figure sat on a series of large boxes , each with its own little door . Before the demonstration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hoax . It was said , however , that inside lurked a small child , who deftly contorted himself from one compartment to another ; and these movements were so synchronized with the shrewd manipulation of doors that the spectators believed they had seen all of an empty inside . " Something like that was said about the hag here . But spectators have written that this could not be the case . I do n't need to point out that , first , it would have to be a very small child ; and , second , no exhibitor could possibly travel all over Europe with a child and have nobody aware of that fact . " But in the hag there is only one small space and one door . Spectators were invited to feel inside the space and make sure there was no deception . Most of them did so . The figure stood by itself , raised well off the ground and on a carpet provided by the host . Yet , in spite of there being no means by which she could come alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cittern  --  played any tune whose name was called out by the spectators  --  returned the cittern  --  conversed with the spectators by dumb-show , and performed other antics of a nature suited to the time . Do you wonder that my respected ancestor was delighted ? But I have always wondered what made him change his mind when he learned the secret . " Gore dropped his lofty manner . " Now tell me how it worked , " he added . " You little  --  ape ! " said Molly Farnleigh . She spoke in her sweetest manner , but her hands were clenched at her sides . " Will you always prance , no matter what happens ? Are n't you satisfied ? Would you like to play trains or toy soldiers ? My God , Brian , come here ; I ca n't stick this . And you too  --  and you , a police-officer  --  fiddling with a dummy  --  crawling round it like a lot of children , when  --  do n't you realize a man was killed last night ? " " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . Then , for a change , tell me how that was worked . " " I suppose you will say it was suicide , of course . " " Madam , " said Gore , with a gesture of despair , " it makes no difference what I say . Somebody invariably jumps down my throat in any case . If I say it was suicide , I am assaulted by A , B , and C. If I say it was murder , I am assaulted by D , E , and F. I have not suggested that it was accident , if only to avoid incurring the wrath of G , H , and I. " " That 's very clever , no doubt . What do you say , Mr. Elliot ? " Elliot spoke out of a personal honesty . " Lady Farnleigh , I 'm only trying to do the best I can in the most difficult business I was ever put into , which is n't helped by the attitude of any of you . You must see that . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this machine  | has something very much to do with the case . I only ask you not to talk out of plain temper . For there 's something else to do with the machine as well . " He put his hand on its shoulder . " I do n't know whether the clockwork inside this is dummy clockwork or not , as Mr. Gore says . I 'd like to have a go at it in my workshop and find out . I do n't know whether the mechanism might still be expected to work after two hundred years ; though , if clocks still go after that time , why should n't it ? But this much I did find out when I looked into the back . The mechanism in this has been recently oiled . " Molly frowned . " Well ? " " I was wondering , Dr. Fell , whether you ? " Elliot turned round . " Here ! Where are you , sir ? " Page 's conviction that anything might happen was strengthened by the disappearance of so very tangible a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Fell 's trick of fading from the scene and reappearing somewhere else , usually engaged in some meaningless occupation . This time Elliot was answered by a flicker of light from the book-closet . Dr. Fell had been striking a series of matches and blinking with fierce absorption at the lower shelves . " Eh ? I beg your pardon ? " " Have n't you been listening to this demonstration ? " " Oh , that ? Harrumph , yes . I can hardly claim to succeed off-hand where so many generations of the family have failed , but I should rather like to know how the original exhibitor was dressed . " " Dressed ? " " Yes . The traditional magician 's costume , I daresay , which  | has always seemed to me singularly unimpressive but suggestive of possibilities . However , I have been pouncing and poking in that cupboard , with or without results ? " " The books ? " " The books are the usual orthodox collection of the unorthodox though there are several witch-trials that are new to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the automaton was exhibited , which I hope I may borrow ? Thank you . But particularly there 's this . " While Gore watched him with bright , wicked eyes of amusement , he lumbered out of the closet carrying a decrepit wooden box . And at the same time it seemed to Page that the attic was filling with people . It was only that Kennet Murray and Nathaniel Burrows , evidently having grown restive , had insisted on following them upstairs . Burrows 's big spectacles , and Murray 's towering calm face , appeared over the attic stairs as though out of a trapdoor . For the moment they did not come nearer . Dr. Fell rattled the wooden box . He balanced it as well as he could on the narrow ledge of couch round the automaton . " Here , steady the machine ! " said the doctor sharply . " This floor 's got a bad canter , and we do n't want her rolling downstairs on us . Now have a look . An odd collection of the dust of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a number of child 's glass marbles , a rusty knife with a painted handle , some fishing-flies , a small heavy ball of lead into which four large hooks had been welded like a bouquet , and ( incongruously ) a woman 's garter of many years ago . But they did not look at these things . They I looked at what lay on top : a double false-face or mask made of parchment on wire , and forming a kind of head with a face  | back and front like the images of Janus . It was blackish , shrivelled , and without features . Dr. Fell did not touch it . " It 's beastly to look at , " whispered Madeline . " But what on earth is it ? " " The mask of the god , " said Dr. Fell . " The what ? " " The mask worn by the master of ceremonies presiding at witch-gatherings . Most of those who read about it , and even some of those who write about it , have no idea what witchcraft really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we have an example here . Satanism was an unholy parody of Christian ritual ; but it had its old roots in Paganism . Two of its deities were Janus the double-headed , patron of fertility and of the cross-roads ; and Diana , patron both of fertility and virginity . The master ( or mistress ) wore either the goat-mask of Satan or a mask such as we have here . Bah ! " He ticked his forefinger and thumb against the mask . " You have been hinting at something like that for a long time , " said Madeline quietly . " Perhaps I should n't ask , but will you please answer a straight question ? It seems ridiculous even to ask it . Are you saying that there is a Satanist group somewhere hereabouts ? " " That 's the joke , " declared Dr. Fell , with an expression of heavy enlightenment . " The answer is , NO . " There was a pause . Inspector Elliot turned round . He was so surprised that he forgot they were talking in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that . Our evidence ? " " I do mean it . Our evidence is n't worth that . " " But ? " " Oh , Lord , why did n't I think of it before ! " said Dr. Fell  | vehemently . " A case after my own heart , and I have only just thought of the solution . Elliot , my boy : there have been no sinister gatherings in the Hanging Chart . There have been no goat-pipes or revels by night . A whole group of solid Kentish people have not been snared into any such mad tomfoolery . It was one of the things that stuck in my gullet when you began collecting your evidence , and I see the grimy truth now . Elliot , there is one crooked soul in this whole affair , and only one . Everything , from mental cruelty to murder , is the work of one person . I give you all the truth gratis . " Murray and Burrows joined the group , their footsteps creaking . " You seem excited , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I am , a bit . I have n't got it all worked out yet . But see the beginnings of it , and I shall have something to say presently . It 's  --  er  --  a matter of motives . " He stared far off , and a faint twinkle appeared in his eye . " Besides , it 's rather novel . I never heard of the trick before . I tell you frankly , ' Satanism itself is an honest and straightforward business compared to the intellectual pleasures a certain person has invented . Excuse me , gents  --  and ladies . There 's something I should rather like to look at in the garden . Carry on , inspector . " He had stumped towards the stairs before Elliot woke up . Elliot ignored everything , and became brisk . " Now , then. ? Yes ? You wanted something , Mr. Murray ? " " I wanted to see the automaton , " returned the other with asperity . " I 've been rather left out of it , I notice , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . So this is the hag . And this : do you mind if I look at it ? "  | He picked up the wooden box , rattling it , and moved it closer to the faint dust-grimed light from the window . Elliot studied him . " Have you ever seen any of those things before , sir ? " Murray shook his head . " I have heard of this parchmentmask . But I have never seen it . I was wondering And that was when the automaton moved . To this day Page swears that nobody pushed it . This may or may not be true . Seven persons were jostling round it on a creaking , crackling floor which ran down in a smooth hump towards the stairs . But the light from the window was very uncertain , and Murray , his back to the hag , was fixing their attention with the exhibit he held in his right hand . If a hand moved , if a foot moved , if a shoulder moved , nobody knew . What they did not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a motor-car slipping its brakes . What they did see was three-hundredweight of rattling iron darting out of reach and driving like a guncarriage for the well of the stairs . What they heard was the screech of the wheels , the tap of Dr. Fell 's stick on the stairs , and Elliot 's scream : " For God 's sake , look out below ! " Then the crash as it went over . Page reached it . He had his fingers round the iron box , and he might just as well have tried to stop a runaway gun ; but he kept it upright when it might have gone **27;119;TOOLONG , sweeping the whole staircase in crazy descent and crushing anything in its way . The black weight kept to its wheels . Sprawling down the first steps , Page saw Dr. Fell peering upwards  --  half-way down . He saw the daylight from the open door at the foot of the stairs . He saw Dr. Fell , unable  | to move an inch in that enclosed space , throw up one hand as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inferno of crashings , the black shape plunge past within a hair 's clearance . But he saw more ; more which no one could have foreseen . He saw the automaton clear the open door , and land in the passage below . One of its wheels snapped off as it struck , but its momentum was too great . Lurching once , it hurtled against the door directly opposite across the passage ; and the door came open . Page stumbled down the stairs . He did not need to hear the cry from the room across that passage . He remembered who was in that room , and why Betty Harbottle was there , and what had just gone in to visit her now . In the cessation of noise after the automaton had been stopped , small sounds crept out . After a time he heard distinctly the squeak of the hinges as Dr. King opened the bedroom door , and the physician had a face like white paper . He said : " You devil up there , what have you done ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITCH Car , au fond , c'est cela le Satanisme , se disait-il ; la question agitee depuis que le monde existe , des visions exterieures , est subsidiare , quand on y songe ; le Demon n'a pas besoin de s'exhiber sous des traits humains ou bestiaux afin d'attester sa presence ; it suffit , pour qu'il s'affirme , qu'il elise domicile en des Smes qu'il exulcere et incite a d'inexplicables crimes . - J. -K . HUYSMANS , La-Bat  | Chapter XIV THE coroner 's inquest on Sir John Farnleigh was held the following day , and produced a sensation that blew off every journalistic roof in Great Britain . Inspector Elliot , like most policemen , is not fond of inquests . This is for practical reasons . Brian Page is not fond of them for artistic reasons : because you never learn anything you did not know before , because there is seldom anything of a sensa-tional nature , and because the verdict , whatever it is , brings you no nearer to a solution than before . But this inquest  --  held on the morning of Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pattern . A suicide verdict , of course , was a foregone conclusion . Yet it was spectacular enough to produce a first-class row before the first witness had said ten words , and it ended in a way that left Inspector Elliot dazed . Page , drinking very black coffee at breakfast , offered up profane thanks that they had not another inquest on their hands from the business of the previous afternoon . Betty Harbottle was not dead . But she had gone through a narrow graze of it after seeing the hag for the second time , and she was still in no condition to speak . Afterwards Elliot 's endless questioning ran in a dismal circle . " Did you push it ? " " I swear  | I did n't ; I do n't know who did ; we were tramping on an uneven floor and maybe nobody did . " Elliot summed it up when he and Dr. Fell talked late over pipes and beer . Page , after taking Madeline home , forcing her to have something to eat , quieting threatened hysterics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , heard the conclusion of the inspector 's views . " We 're licked , " he said briefly . " Not a single ruddy thing we can prove , and yet look at the string of events we 've got ! Victoria Daly is murdered : maybe by a tramp , maybe not : but with the indications of other dirty work that we need n't discuss now . That 's a year ago . Sir John Farnleigh dies with his throat cut . Betty Harbottle is in some way attacked ' and brought down from the attic ; and her torn apron is found in the book-closet upstairs . The Thumbograph disappears and returns . Finally , a deliberate attempt is made to kill you by pushing that machinery downstairs , an attempt which you only escaped by one whistle and the grace of God . " " Believe me , I appreciate that , " muttered Dr. Fell uncomfortably . " It was one of the worst moments of my life when I looked round and saw that juggernaut coming down . It was my own fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with sharp inquiry . " All the same , sir , it showed you were on the right track . The murderer knew you knew too much . As to just what that track is , if you 've got any ideas now is the time to tell me . I shall be recalled to town , you know , unless something is done . " " Oh , I 'll tell you fast enough , " growled Dr. Fell . " I 'm not making mysteries . Even when I do tell you , though , and even in the event I happen to be right , it still does n't prove any-  | thing . Besides , I 'm not sure about another thing . I am very flattered , of course . But I 'm not sure the automaton was pushed downstairs with the purpose of what is poetically known as rubbing me out . " " For what purpose , then ? It could n't be just to frighten the girl again , sir . The murderer could n't have known it would land smack against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dr. Fell stubbornly , and ruffled his hands through his big mop of grey-streaked hair . " And yet  --  and yet ? proof ? " " That 's exactly what I mean . Here are all these points , a connected series of events , and not one blasted one of ' em I can prove ! Not one thing I can take to my superintendent and say , Here ; grab this . ' Not one bit of evidence that is n't capable of another interpretation . I ca n't even show that the events are in any way connected , which is the real snag . Now take this inquest tomorrow . Even the police evidence must plump for a suicide verdict " Ca n't you get the inquest adjourned ? " " Of course . Ordinarily that 's what I should do , and keep on adjourning it until we either had evidence of murder or had to drop the case altogether . But there 's the last and greatest snag . What have I got to hope for by more investigation , as matters stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farnleigh 's death is suicide , and so is the A.C. When they learned that there are traces of the dead man 's fingerprints on that clasp-knife Sergeant Burton found in the hedge ? " ( Here was news to Page , the final nail in a suicide 's coffin. ) " ? that finished it , " Elliot corroborated him . " What else can I look for ? "  | " Betty Harbottle ? " suggested Page . " All right : suppose she does recover and tell her story ? Suppose she says she saw somebody in that book-closet ? Doing what ? And what of it ? What connection has it got with a suicide in the garden ? Where 's your proof , laddie ? Anything about the Thumbograph ? Well , it 's never been suggested that the Thumbograph was in the possession of the dead man , so where do you get with that line of argument ? No . Do n't look at it sensibly , sir ; look at it legally . It 's a hundred to one they 'll recall me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shelved . You and I know that there 's a murderer here , worming so neatly that he or she can keep right on in the same old way unless somebody stops it . And apparently nobody can stop it . " " What are you going to do ? " Elliot gulped down half a pint of beer before he answered . " There 's just one chance , as I say : a full-dress inquest . Most of our suspects will give evidence . It 's remotely possible that somebody , under oath , will make a slip . Not much hope , I admit  --  but it 's happened before ( remember the Nurse Waddington case ? ) , and it may happen again . It 's the last hope of the police when nothing else works . " " Will the coroner play your game ? " " I wonder , " said Elliot thoughtfully . " This chap Burrows is up to something ; I know that . But he wo n't come to me and I ca n't get any change out of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' something . I gather that the coroner does n't particularly like Burrows , did n't particularly like the late alleged Farnleigh , ' and himself thinks it 's suicide . But he 'll play fair , and they 'll all stand together against the outsider  --  meaning me . The ironical part is that Burrows himself would like to prove murder , because a suicide verdict more or less proves his client  | was an impostor . The whole thing is going to be just one hilarious field-day about lost heirs , with only one possible verdict : suicide , my recall , and the end of the case . " " Now , now , " said Dr. Fell soothingly . " By the way , where is the automaton now ? " " Sir ? " Elliot roused himself out of grievances and stared at the other . " The automaton ? " he repeated . " I pushed it into a cupboard . After the whacking it took , it 's not good for much now except rap-iron . I was going to have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense of the works now . " " Yes , " said Dr. Fell , taking up his bedroom candle with a igh . " That , you see , was why the murderer pushed it downstairs . " Page spent a troubled night . There were many things for e next day besides the inquest . Nat Burrows , he reflected , as not the man his father had been ; even matters like neral arrangements had to be turned over to Page . It appeared that Burrows was busying himself over some other spect of the difficulty . There was also the question of leaving oily " alone " in a house of questionable atmosphere , and the disquieting news that the servants were threatening to leave Imost in a body . These things churned through sleep into a day of brilliant sunshine and heat . The riot of motor-cars began by n. o'clock . He had never seen so many cars in Mallingford ; the ' Press and the outside world poured in to an extent that made him realize the immense noise this case was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , nobody else 's damned business . Why did n't they put up swings and round-  | abouts , and sell hot dogs ? They swamped the Bull and Butcher , in whose " hall " ? a sort of long shed built for the jollifications of hop-pickers  --  the inquest was to be held . Sunlight winked on many camera-lenses in the road . There were women . Old Mr. Rowntree 's dog chased somebody clear up the road to Major Chambers 's , and had a hysteria of barking all morning , and could n't be quieted . In this the people of the district moved without comment . They did not take sides . In country life each person depends on the other for something , giving and receiving ; in a case like this you had to wait and see what happened , so that matters could be reasonably comfortable whichever way verdicts went . But from the outside world came the tumult of LOST HEIR SLAIN OR LOST HEIR FRAUD ? ; and at eleven o'clock in the hot morning they opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed . Page felt the appropriateness of a starched collar . The coroner , a forthright solicitor who was determined to stand no nonsense from the Farnleighs , sat behind a heap of papers at a broad table , with a witness-chair at his left . First of all , evidence of identification of the body was given by Lady Farnikigh , the widow . Even this  --  as a rule the merest of formalities  --  was questioned . Molly had hardly begun to speak when up rose Mr. Harold Welkyn , in frocki coat and gardenia , on behalf of his client . Mr. Welkyn said that he must protest against this identification in the matter of a technicality , since the dead man was not , in fact , Sir John Farnleigh ; and , since the matter was of the utmost importance in determining whether the deceased took his own life or was murdered , he respectfully begged leave to bring it to the coroner 's attention .  | There ensued a long argument in which the coroner , aided by a frigid and indignant Burrows , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perspired with satisction . He had made the point . He had set the pace . He had ? utlined the real terms of the battle , and everybody knew it . It also compelled Molly to discuss the matter in reply to the ? ? roner 's questions as to the deceased 's state of mind . He Bated her well , but he was determined to thrash the matter t and Molly looked badly rattled . Page began to realize e state of affairs when the coroner , instead of next calling idence as to the finding of the body , called Kennet Murray . he whole story came out ; and , under Murray 's gentle firmss , the imposture of the deceased stood out as clear and ' ack as a fingerprint . Burrows fought every step of the way , t only succeeded in angering the coroner . Evidence of finding the body was given by Burrows and age . ( The latter 's own voice sounded wrong to him . ) Then e medical testimony was called . Dr. Theophilus King testid that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone Farnleigh Close in response to a telephone-call from Detive-Sergeant Burton . He had made a preliminary examinaon and ascertained that the man was dead . The next day , e body having been removed to the mortuary , he had on e instructions of the coroner performed a post-mortem exination , verifying the cause of death . The coroner : Now , Dr. King , will you describe the wounds on c throat of the deceased ? The doctor : There were three fairly shallow wounds , beginning the left side of the throat and ending under the angle of the ght jaw in a slightly upward direction . Two of the wounds ? ssed each other .  | Q : The weapon was passed across the throat from left to right ? A : That is so . Q : Would this have been the course taken by a weapon held in the hand of a man taking his own life ? A : If the man were right-handed , yes . Q : Was the deceased right-handed ? A : To the best of my knowledge , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the deceased to have inflicted such wounds on himself ? A : Not at all . Q : From the nature of the wounds , doctor , what sort of weapon should you say had been used to inflict them ? A : I should say a ragged or uneven blade some four or five inches long . There was much laceration of tissue . It is a matter in which it is difficult to speak precisely . Q : We quite appreciate that , doctor . I shall presently call evidence to show that there was found in a hedge some ten feet to the left of the deceased a knife with a blade such as you describe . Have you seen the knife to which I refer ? A : I have . Q : In your opinion , could the knife in question have inflicted wounds such as you describe on the throat of the deceased ? A : In my opinion , it could . Q : Finally , doctor , I come to a point which must be put with some care . Mr. Nathaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fall the deceased was standing at the edge of the pool with his back to the house . Mr. Burrows is unable to say definitely whether or not the deceased was alone at this time , though I have pressed him to do so . Now , in the event  --  I say in the event  --  that the deceased was alone , could he have flung a weapon away from him to a distance of say ten feet ? A : It is well within the physical possibilities . Q : Let us suppose that he had a weapon in his right hand . Could this weapon instead have been thrown towards the left ? A : I can not venture on a guess as to the convulsions of a dying man . I can only say that such a thing is physically possible .  | After this high-handed carrying of matters , the story of Ernest Wilbertson Knowles left no doubt . Everybody knew Knowles . Everybody knew his likes , his dislikes , his nature . Everybody had seen for decades that there was no guile in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man alone in a closed circle of sand , the impossibility of murder . Q : But are you satisfied in your own mind that what you saw was the deceased taking his own life ? A : I am afraid so , sir . Q : Then how do you account for the fact that a knife held in the right hand was thrown to the left rather than the right ? A : I am not sure I can properly describe the gestures the late gentleman made , sir . I thought I could at first , but I have been thinking it over and I am not sure . It was all so rapid that his gestures might have been anything . Q : But you did not actually see the knife thrown from him ? A : Yes , sir , I am under the impression that I did . " WOW ! " said a voice among the spectators . It sounded rather like Tony Weller speaking out from the gallery . And it was , in fact , Dr. Fell , who throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking in the heat . " I will have silence in this room , " shouted the coroner . Cross-examined by Burrows as counsel for the widow , Knowles said that he would not swear to having seen the deceased throw the knife . He had good eyesight , but not such good eyesight as that . And his patent sincerity of manner kept the sympathies of the jury . Knowles admitted that he spoke only from an impression and admitted the ( remote ) possibility of an error , with which Burrows had to be content . There followed to an inevitable end the police evidence , the evidence of the deceased 's movements , to a rounding-up.  | In that hot shed , with rows of pencils going like spiders ' legs , there was determined for practical purposes the imposture of the dead man . Glances were being cast at Patrick Gore , the real heir . Quick glances . Appraising glances . Hesitant glances . Even friendly glances , under which he remained bland and impassive . " Members of the jury , " said the coroner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall ask you to listen , though I am unacquainted with the nature of the witness 's testimony . At the request of Mr. Burrows and at her own request , the witness comes here to make a statement of importance , which I trust will be of assistance to you in your painful duty . I therefore call Miss Madeline Dane . " Page sat up . There was a puzzled stir in the court , the reporters quickening with interest at Madeline 's very real beauty . What she was doing here Page himself had no idea , but it disturbed him . Way was made for her to come to the witness-chair , where the coroner handed her the Book and she took the oath in a nervous but clear voice . As though for a kind of distant-mourning , she wore dark blue , with a dark blue hat the colour of her eyes . Something of the corrugated-iron feeling was removed . The corrugated-iron self-consciousness of the men on the jury relaxed . They did not actually beam on her , but Page felt it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the males of the population Madeline was a favourite who had few competitors . A handsome feeling went through the inquest . " Again I must insist on silence in this room ! " said the coroner . " Now will you give your name , please ? "  | " Madeline Elspeth Dane . " " Your age ? " " Th-thirty-five . " " Your address , Miss Dane ? " " IVlonplaisir , near Frettenden . " " Now , Miss Dane , " said the coroner , brisk but gentle , " I believe you wished to make a statement regarding the deceased ? What is the nature of the evidence you wish to give ? " " Yes , I must tell you . Only it 's so difficult to know where to begin . " " Perhaps I can help Miss Dane out , " said Burrows , on his feet with perspiring dignity . " Miss Dane , was it " Mr. Burrows , " snapped the coroner , losing all control of his temper , " you have constantly interrupted these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine which I can not and will not tolerate . You are entitled to question the witness when I have done questioning her , and not until then . In the meantime you will remain silent or leave this court . Hrrrr ! Ahem . Now , Miss Dane ? " " Please do n't quarrel . " " We are not quarrelling , madam . I am indicating the respect due to this court , a court gathered to determine how the deceased met his death , and a respect which , whatever may be said of it from some sources " ? here his eye sought out the reporters ? " I have every intention of upholding . Now , Miss Dane ? " " It 's about Sir John Farnleigh , " said Madeline earnestly , " and whether he was or was not Sir John Farnleigh . I want to explain why he was so anxious to receive the claimant and the claimant 's solicitor ; and why he did n't show them out of the house ; and why he was so eager to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that may help you decide about his ? " Miss Dane , if you merely wish to give an opinion as to whether the deceased was Sir John Farnleigh , I am afraid I must inform you ? " " No , no , no . I do n't know whether he was . But that 's thc whole dreadful thing . You see , he did n't know himself . "  | Chapter XV BY THE stir in the dim shed , it was beginning to be felt that this might be the sensation of the day , even if nobody knew what it meant . The coroner cleared his throat , his head turning like an alert marionette 's . " Miss Dane , this is not a court of law ; it is an inquiry ; and therefore I can allow you to give what testimony you like , provided only it has some bearing which will help us . Will you be so good as . to explain what you mean ? " Madeline drew a deep breath . " Yes , if you let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitehouse . What is hard to say in front of all of you is how he came to tell me about it . But he had to confide in somebody , you know . He was too fond of Lady Farnleigh to tell her ; that was a part of the trouble ; and sometimes it worried him so horribly that you may have noticed how ill he looked . And I suppose I 'm a safe person to confide in " ? she wrinkled her forehead half wryly and half smilingly ? " so that 's how it was . " " Yes , yes ? How what was , Miss Dane ? " " You 've let them tell all about the meeting the night before last , to argue over the estate and take the fingerprints , " resumed Madeline , with a probably unconscious thrust . " I  | was not there , but I heard all about it from a friend of mine who was there . He said what impressed him most was the absolute assurance of both claimants , right up to the taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time poor John  --  I beg your pardon : Sir John  --  smiled at all or looked relieved was when the claimant was talking about that terrible affair on the Titanic , and about being hit with a seaman 's mallet . " " Yes ; well ? " " Here is what Sir John told me months ago . After the wreck of the Titanic , as a boy , he woke up in a hospital in New York . But he did n't know it was New York or about the Titanic . He did n't know where he was , or how he had got there , or even who he was . He had had concussion of the brain , after getting some knocks on the head accidentally or deliberately in the wreck of the ship , and he was suffering from what they call amnesia . Do you understand what I mean ? " " Perfectly , Miss Dane . Continue . " " They told him his clothes and papers had identified him as John Farnleigh . There was a man standing over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his mother 's cousin  --  oh , that 's badly put , but you know what I mean  --  and told him to go to sleep and get well . " But you know what boys of that age are . He was very frightened and horribly worried . For he did n't know anything about himself . And worst of all , like boys of that age , he did n't dare tell anybody for fear he might be mad or there might be something wrong with him or they might put him in gaol . " That 's how it seemed to him . He had n't any reason to think he was n't this John Farnleigh . He had n't any reason to be lieve they were n't telling the truth in all they told him about  | himself . He had a hazy recollection of shouting or confusion , something to do with open air or cold ; but that was all he could remember . So he never spoke a word about it to anybody . He pretended to his cousin  --  a Mr. Renwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never suspected . " He nursed that little secret for years . He kept reading his diary , and trying to bring things back . He told me that sometimes he would sit for hours with his hands pressed to his head , concentrating . Sometimes he would think he remembered a face or an event faintly , like something you see under water . Then again it would seem to him that there was something wrong . The only thing he ever brought out of it , as a phrase rather than an image , had to do with a hinge : a crooked hinge . " Under the iron roof the spectators sat like dummies . No papers rustled . Nobody whispered . Page felt his collar damp and his heart ticking like a watch . Smoky sunlight came through the windows , and Madeline winked the corner of her eye in it . " A crooked hinge , Miss Dane ? " " Yes . I do n't know what he meant . Neither did he . " " Go on , please . " " In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in gaol if there should be anything wrong and they found out about it . Handwriting was no good , because two of his fingers were nearly crushed in the wreck and he could never hold a pen properly . He was afraid to write home ; that 's why he never did . He was even afraid to go to a doctor and ask if he might be mad , for fear the doctor should tell on him . " Of course , in time it got fainter . He convinced himself that 1  | it was an unfortunate thing which happens to some people , and so on . There was the War and all that . He consulted a mental specialist who told him after a lot of psychological tests that he really was John Farnleigh , and that he had nothing to worry about . But he never lost the horror of those years , and even when he thought he had forgotten it he dreamed about it . " Then it was all revived when poor Dudley died and he inherited the title and estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how can I say this ? ? academically interested . He thought at long last he must remember . And he did n't . You all know how he used to go wandering round like a ghost , a poor old ghost who did n't even know whether he was a ghost . You know how jumpy he was . He loved it here . He loved every acre and yard of it . Mind you , he did n't honestly doubt he was John Farnleigh . But he had to KNOW . " Madeline bit her lip . Her luminous , now rather hard eyes wandered among the spectators . " I used to talk to him and try to make him quiet . I would ask him not to think too much ; then perhaps he would remember . I used to arrange it so that I reminded him of things , and made him think he had remembered them for himself . Maybe it would be a gramophone playing , To thee , beautiful lady , ' far away in the evening ; and he would remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a detail of the house . In the library there 's a kind of cupboard with shelves of books  --  built into the wall by the windows , you know  --  and instead of being just a cupboard , it 's got a door that used to open out into the garden . It still will open if you find the right catch . I persuaded him to find the right catch . He said he slept well for nights after that .  | " But he still had to know . He said he would n't mind so much if he could only know , even if it turned out he was not John Farnleigh . He said he was n't a wild adolescent boy any longer . He said he could face it quietly ; and it would be the greatest thing in the world just to know the truth . " He went to London and saw two more doctors ; I know that . You can see how worried he was when he even went to a person who was supposed to have psychic powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street  --  who was all the rage then . He took a crowd of us along under pretext of having our fortunes told , and pretended to laugh at it . But he told this fortune-teller all about himself . " Still he kept wandering about the place . He used to say , Well , I am a good steward ' ; and you know he was . He used to go into the church a lot , too ; he liked the hymns best ; and sometimes , when they played , Abide with Me ' ? anyway , when he was near the church , and looking up at the walls , he used to say that if ever he were in a position to Madeline paused . Her breast rose with a deep breath . Her eyes were fixed on the front rows , and her fingers opened wide on the arms of the chair . All passion and mysticism seemed in her then , as deep as roots and as strong as hearts ; yet she was , after all , only a woman making what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm so sorry , " she blurted . " Perhaps it is better not to talk about that ; it does not concern us , anyhow . I 'm sorry if I 'm taking up your time with things that do n't matter ? " " I will have silence in here , " said the coroner , flinging round his head at the rustle that grew . " I am not sure I think you  | are taking up our time with things that do not matter . Have you anything else to tell the jury ? " " Yes , " said Madeline , turning and looking at them . " One other thing . " " Which is ? " " When I heard about the claimant to the estate and his lawyer , I knew what John had been thinking . You know now what was in his mind all along . You can follow every step of his thoughts and every word he said . You now now why he smiled , and why the relief was almost too much , when he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blows on the head in the wreck of the Titanic . For he was the one who suffered from concussion of the brain and a loss of memory that lasted for twenty-five years . " Please wait ! I do n't say the claimant 's story is n't true . I do n't know , or profess to decide . But Sir John  --  the one you call the deceased as though he had never been alive  --  must have felt a mighty relief when he heard something that in his eyes could n't possibly have been true . He saw his dream being fulfilled at last , that his identity should be proved . You know now why he welcomed that fingerprint test . You know why he was the most eager of all . You know why he could hardly wait , why he was all wire and nerves , to learn the result . " Madeline grasped the arms of the chair . " Please . Perhaps I 'm putting all this stupidly , but I hope you understand me . To prove things one way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he were Sir John Farnleigh , he would be happy to the end of his life . If he were not , it would n't matter so much once he really knew . Like winning a football pool , you know . You put your sixpence on it . You think perhaps you 've won thousands and thousands of pounds .  | You 're almost sure of it , you could swear it 's true . But you ca n't be sure until the telegram comes . If it does n't come , you think , Well , that 's that , ' and let it go . Well , that 's John Farnleigh . This was his football pool . Acres and acres of things he loved : they were his football pool . Respect and honour and sound sleep at night forever : they were his football pool . The end of torture and the beginning of the future : they were his football pool . He believed now that he had won it . And now people are trying to tell you he killed himself . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Can you believe , dare you believe , that he 'd have deliberately cut his throat half an hour before he could learn the result ? " She put her hand over her eyes . There was a genuine uproar , which the coroner put down . Mr. Harold Welkyn was on his feet . Page saw that his shiny face was slightly pale , and he spoke as though he had been running . " Mr. Coroner . As a piece of special pleading , all this is no doubt very interesting , " he said acidly . " I shall not be impertinent enough to remind you of your duties . I shall not be impertinent enough to point out that no question has been asked in the last ten minutes . But if this lady has completely finished her remarkable statement , which if true tends to show that the deceased was an even greater impostor than we believed , I shall ask leave , as counsel for the real Sir John Farnleigh , to cross-examine . " " Mr. Welkyn , " said the coroner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask questions when I give you leave and you will remain silent until then . Now , Miss Dane ? " " Please let him ask questions , " said Madeline . " I remember 1  | seeing him at the house of that horrible little Egyptian , Ahriman , in Half-Moon Street . " Mr. Welkyn got out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead . And the questions were asked . And the coroner summed up . And Inspector Elliot went into another room and privately danced the saraband . And the jury , throwing the case straight to the police to handle , brought in a verdict of murder by a person or persons unknown .  | Chapter XVI ANDREW MACANDREW ELLIOT lifted a glass of very passable hock and inspected that . " Miss Dane , " he declared , " you 're a born politician . No , I 'll say diplomat ; it sounds better ; I do n't know why . That touch about the football pools was sheer genius . It brought things home to the jury as certainly as sixpence and two wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the long , warm afterglow of sunset , Elliot , Dr. Fell , and Page were having dinner with Madeline at the unfortunately named but comfortable Monplaisir . The table stood by the French windows of the dining-room , and the French windows opened on a deep garden of laurels . At the end of it were two acres of apple-orchard . In one direction a footpath went through the orchard to what used to be Colonel Mardale 's . In another it wound across a brook and up through the Hangi ng Chart , whose slope of trees showed dark against the evening sky to the left of the orchard . If you followed the latter path up through the chart , over its shoulder , and down again , you came to the back gardens of Farnleigh Close . Madeline lived alone , having a woman who came in by day to cook and " do . " It was a trim little house , bright with military  | prints that were a heritage from her father , full of brass and bustling clocks . It stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate Victoria Daly ; but Madeline had never minded the isolation . She sat now at the head of the table beside the open windows , beyond polished wood and silver in a dusk which was not quite dark enough for the lighting of the dinner-table candles . She wore white . The great , low oak beams of the dining-room , the pewter and the busy clocks , all were a background for her . Dinner over , Dr. Fell had lit a Gargantuan cigar ; Page had lit a cigarette for Madeline ; and , at Elliot 's question , Madeline laughed in the light of the match . " About the football pools ? " she repeated . She flushed a little as well . " As a matter of fact , I did n't think of it . It was Nat Burrows . He wrote it out and made me get it word-perfect like a recitation . Oh , every word I said was true . I felt it terribly . It was the most awful cheek of me to carry on like that before all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitehouse was going to stop me ; but Nat said it was absolutely the only way . Afterwards I went upstairs at the Bull and Butcher and had hysterics and cried and felt better . Was it very awful of me ? " They were certainly staring at her . " No , " said Dr. Fell quite seriously , " it was a remarkable performance . But , oh , Lord ! Burrows coached you ? Wow ! " " Yes , he was here - half of last night doing it . " " Burrows ? But when was he here ? " asked Page , surprised . " I brought you home . " " He came here after you left . He was full of what I had just told Molly , and terribly excited . " " You know , gents , " rumbled Dr. Fell , taking a meditative pull at the large cigar , " we must n't underestimate our friend  | Burrows . Page here told us long ago that he was an unco ' intelligent chap . Welkyn seemed to run rings round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , psychologically ? confound that word  --  he had the inquest exactly where he wanted it . He 'll be fighting , naturally . It will naturally make a big difference to the firm of Burrows &; Burrows whether they keep the management of the Farnleigh estate . And he 's a fighter . When , as , and if the case of Farnleigh v. Gore ever comes to trial , it ought to be a sizzler . " Elliot faced something else . " Look here , Miss Dane , " he said stubbornly . " I 'm not denying you did us a good turn . It 's a victory , if only an outward and newspaper victory . Now the case wo n't be closed officially , even if the A.C. tears his hair and swears the jury were a pack of thick-witted yokels under the spell of a good-looking  --  er  --  female . But what I want to know is why you did n't come to me with all this information in the first place . I 'm not a twister . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can put it like that . Why did n't you tell me ? " The odd and almost comic part of it was , Page thought , that he sounded personally hurt . " I wanted to , " said Madeline . " Honestly I did . But I had to tell Molly first . Then Nat Burrows made me swear all kinds of horrid oaths I would n't breathe a word of it to the police until after the inquest . He says he does n't trust the police . Also , he 's working on a theory to prove ? " She checked herself , biting her lip , and made an apologetic gesture with her cigarette . " You know how some people are . " " Still , where do we stand ? " asked Page . " After this morning , have we gone round in the old circle to wondering which of them is the real heir ? If Murray swears Gore is , and if they  | do n't upset that fingerprint evidence , that seems to end it . Or so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't quite so sure . Certain hints and innuendoes  --  you made them yourself  --  seemed to centre round good old Welkyn . " " Really , Brian ! I only said what Nat told me to say . What do you mean ? " " Well , possibly that the whole claim to the estate might have been engineered by Welkyn himself . Welkyn , the spooks ' solicitor and spiritualists ' advocate . Welkyn , who collects some rather rummy friends , and may have collected Gore as he collected Ahriman and Madame Duquesne and the rest of them . I said when we met Gore he was some kind of showman . Welkyn , who said he saw a ghost in the garden at the time of the murder . Welkyn , who at the time of the murder was only fifteen feet away from the victim and with only a sheet of glass between . Welkyn ? " " But surely , Brian , you do n't suspect Mr. Welkyn of the murder ? " " Why not ? Dr. Fell said ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar , " that he was the most interesting person in the group . " " It usually amounts to the same thing , " said Page gloomily . " What 's your real opinion , Madeline , about the real heir ? You told me yesterday you thought the late Farnleigh was an impostor . Do you ? " " Yes , I do . But I do n't see how anybody could keep from feeling sorry for him . He did n't want to be an impostor , do n't you see ? He only wanted to know who he was . As for Mr. Welkyn , he could n't possibly be the murderer . He was the only one of us who was n't in the attic when  --  well , it seems horrible to talk about after dinner and on a nice evening , but who was n't in the attic when that machine fell . "  | " Sinister , " said the doctor . " Very sinister . " " You must be terribly brave , " said Madeline with the utmost seriousness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My dear young lady , I am not brave . The wind was blowing violently and I felt ill . Afterwards I began , like St. Peter , to curse and swear . Then I made jokes . Harrumph . Fortunately I began thinking about that girl in the other room , who has n't my padding to sustain her . And I swore a mighty oath myself ? " His fist hovered over the table , huge in the twilight . They had the impression of a dangerous force behind jokes and absence of mind , a force that could fall and bind . But he did not bring the fist down . He looked out into the darkening garden , and continued to smoke mildly . " Then where do we stand , sir ? " asked Page . " Have you found you can trust us by now ? " It was Elliot who answered him . Elliot took a cigarette out of the box on the table . He lit it with careful movings of the match . In the light of the match his expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint Page could not interpret . " We must be moving along soon , " the inspector said . " Burton is driving us to Paddock Wood , and Dr. Fell and I are catching the ten o'clock train for town . We have a conference with Mr. Bellchester at the Yard . Dr. Fell has an idea . " " About  --  what to do here ? " Madeline asked eagerly . " Yes , " said Dr. Fell . For a time he continued to smoke with a sleepy air . " I was wondering . Perhaps it would be as well if I gave a few hollow subterranean whispers . For example , that inquest today served a double-barrelled purpose . We hoped for a murder verdict and we hoped that one of the witnesses would make a slip . We got the murder verdict ; and somebody blundered . "  | " Was that where you said wow ' out loud ? " " I said wow ' many times , " answered the doctor gravely . " To myself . At a price , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to say wow , ' or at least a hint of it . I say : at a price . After all , you ought to do for us what you did for Mr. Burrows , and under the same pledge of secrecy . A minute ago you said he was working on a theory to prove something . What theory ? And what does he want to prove ? " Madeline stirred , and crushed out her cigarette . In the semidarkness she looked cool and clean in white , her short throat swelling above the low-necked dress . Page always remembered her at that moment : the blonde hair done into something like curls above the ears , the broad face even more softened and etherealized by twilight , the slow closing of her eyes . Outside a faint wind stirred in the laurels . Towards the west over the garden the low sky was thin yellow-orange , like brittle glass ; but over the mass of the Hanging Chart there was a star . The room seemed to have retreated , as though it were waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push herself back . " I do n't know , " she said . " People come and tell me these things . They think I can keep a secret ; I look the sort of person who can keep a secret ; and I can . Now it seems as though all the ' secrets were being dragged out of me , and I feel as though I had done something indecent by all that talking today . " " And ? " prompted Dr. Fell . " All the someone of the murder , and hopes he can prove it . " " And he suspects ? ? " i '  | " He suspects Kennet Murray , " said Madeline . The glowing end of Elliot 's cigarette stopped in the air . Then Elliot struck the table with the flat of his hand . " Murray ! Murray ? " " Why , Mr. Elliot ? " asked Madeline , opening her eyes . " Does it surprise you ? " The inspector 's voice remained impersonal . " Murray is the last person who should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor here calls the detective-story sense . He was the person everyone was watching . Even if it might have been only a joke , he was the person they were all thinking of as the victim . Burrows is a damned sight too clever by half ! ? I beg your pardon , Miss Dane : ' ware language . No . And again no . Has Burrows got any reason to think this , except the idea of being clever ? Why , the man 's got an alibi as big as a house ! " " I do n't understand part of it , " said Madeline , wrinkling her forehead , " because he did n't tell me . But that 's the point . Has he got an alibi , really ? I 'm only telling you what Nat told me . Nat says that if you go by the evidence there was n't anybody actually watching him except this Mr. Gore , standing down by the library windows . " The inspector and Dr. Fell exchanged a glance . They did not comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mentioning at the inquest today the little cupboard or book-closet built into the wall of the library ? like the one in the attic ? The one that 's got a door opening into the garden if you find the spring ? " " I do , " said Dr. Fell rather grimly . " Humph . Murray men- tioned that place to us himself , when he said he went in there during his vigil to change the bogus Thumbograph for the real one so that he should n't be seen from the windows . I begin to understand . " " Yes . I told that to Nat , and he was terribly interested . He said to be sure to mention it so that it could go into the records . If I understood him at all , he says you 're concentrating your attention on the wrong man . He says all this is a trumped-up conspiracy against poor John . He says that because this Patrick Gore ' has a clever tongue and an interesting way with him , you 've mistaken him for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray is the real  --  what 's that horrid word they use in thrillers ? " " Master-mind ? " " That 's it . Of the gang . Of a gang composed of Gore and Welkyn and Murray ; Gore and Welkyn being puppets who would n't have the courage for any real crime . " " Go on , " said Dr. Fell in a curious voice . " Nat was wildly excited when he explained it . He points to the rather odd behaviour of Mr. Murray all through this . Well , of course I  --  I would n't know about that . I have n't seen enough of him . He does seem a bit different from the old days , but then I know we all must be . " Poor Nat has even got a theory of how the scheme might have been worked . Mr. Murray was in touch with a shady lawyer ( Mr. Welkyn ) . Mr. Welkyn was in a position to tell him , through one of the fortune-tellers of his clientele , that Sir John Farnleigh was suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . So Murray , the old tutor , thought of presenting an impostor with forged credentia  |  | Through Welkyn he found a suitable impostor ( Gore ) among Welkyn 's clients . Murray drilled him for six months in every particular . Nat says that 's why Gore 's way of speaking and conducting himself is so much like Murray 's : the thing Nat says you noticed , Dr. Fell . " The doctor stared across the table at her . He put his elbows on the table and his head in his hands , so that Page could not tell what he was thinking . The air stirring through the open windows was very warm and full of fragrance ; yet it is a fact that Dr. Fell shivered . " Go on , " Elliot prompted again . " Nat 's idea of what happened is  --  is horrible , " replied Madeline , closing her eyes again . " I could see it , even if I did n't want to see it . Poor John , who had never done anybody any harm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight their claim , and so that it should be believed he had killed himself . Just as most people do believe , you know . " " Yes , " said Elliot . " Just as most people do believe . " " Welkyn and Gore , the sawdust-men without the courage , had their parts to play . They had the two sides of the house guarded , you see . Welkyn was in the dining-room . Gore was to watch the library windows for two reasons : first , to swear to Mr. Murray 's alibi ; and , second , to keep any other person away from looking in the window while Mr. Murray was out of the library . " They stalked poor John like a  --  oh , you know . He never had a chance . When they knew he was in the garden , Mr. Murray came out ever so softly . He 's a big man . He caught John and killed him . He did n't do it until the last moment . That is , they hoped that John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory and might not be the real heir . Then they might n't have had to kill him . But he did n't . And so they did . But Mr. Murray had to explain why he had been so unnecessarily long in comparing fingerprints . ' So he invented the story of juggling with Thumbographs , and stole one and later returned it . And Nat says " ? she concluded rather breathlessly , looking at Dr. Fell ? " he says you tumbled straight into their trap , as Mr. Murray planned you should . " Inspector Elliot carefully put out his cigarette . " That 's it , eh ? Does this Mr. Burrows explain how Murray committed a murder unseen under the eyes of Knowles and practically under the eyes of Burrows himself ? " She shook her head . " He would n't tell me that . Either he did n't want to , or he has n't got it worked out yet . " " He has n't got it worked out yet , " said Dr. Fell in a hollow voice . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homework . Oh , my ancient hat . This is awful . " Once again that day Madeline had talked herself into a state of quickened breathing . It was as though she herself , at the end of a great nervous strain , had been touched by that wind from the garden or the sense of expectancy and waiting from the house . " What do you think of it ? " she asked . Dr. Fell reflected . " There are flaws in it . Bad flaws . " " That does n't matter , " said Madeline , looking straight at him . " I do n't think I believe it myself . But I 've told you what you wanted to know . What were the hints you were going to give us , about what really happened ? " He regarded her in a curious way , as though he wondered . " Have you told us everything , ma'am ? " : r :  | " Everything I  --  I can or dare to . Do n't ask me any more . Please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at risk of seeming to make more mysteries , I 'm going to ask you another question . You knew the late Farnleigh very well . Now , the point is nebulous and psychological again ; but find the answer to the following question and you come near the truth . Why did Farnleigh worry for twenty-five years ? Why was he weighed down and oppressed in the blindness of his memory ? Most men would have been troubled for a while ; yet it should not have left such a terrifying scar in his mind . Was he , for instance , tortured by a memory of crime or evil ? " She nodded . " Yes , I believe he was . I 've always thought of him as being like those old Puritans in books , brought up to ( late . " " But he could n't remember what it concerned ? " " No  --  except this image of the crooked hinge . " Page found the words themselves disturbing and bothersome . It seemed as though they ought to convey something or suggest something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , a straight hinge ? " Sort of polite version of a screw loose ? " he asked . " N-no , I do n't think so . I mean , it was n't a figure of speech . Sometimes he seemed to see a hinge ; a hinge on a door ; a white hinge . It would become crooked as he looked , and droop or crack somehow . He said it stuck in his mind in the way you notice the pattern of a wall-paper when you are ill . " " A white hinge , " said Dr. Fell . He looked at Elliot . " That rather tears it , my lad . Eh ? " " Yes , sir . " A long sniff rumbled in the doctor 's nose .  | " Very well . Now let 's see if there are any suggestions of the truth in all this . I will give you a few . " First . There has been much talk from the beginning about who was or was n't battered on the head with what has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a great amount of curiosity about the fact , but very little about the mallet . Where did anybody get such an implement ? How was it obtainable at all ? Such an article would n't be of much use to sailors aboard modern mechanized ships . I can think of only one thing answering the description . " You have probably seen such mallets if you have crossed the Atlantic . One of them hangs by each of the steel doors which are set at intervals along the passages below decks in a modern liner . These steel doors are , or are supposed to be , water-tight . In the event of disaster they can be closed , to form a series of bulkheads or compartments against water flooding in . And the mallet by each door  --  a sombre reminder ? is for use as a weapon by the steward in case of panic and a stampede on the part of passengers . The Titanic , you remember , was famous for its water-tight compartments . " " Well ? " prompted Page , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does n't suggest anything to you ? " " No . " " Second point , " said Dr. Fell . " That interesting automaton , the Golden Hag . Find out what made the automaton work in the seventeenth century , and you will have the essential secret of this case . " " But it does n't make any sense ! " cried Madeline . " At leas I mean , it does n't have any connection with what I was thin ing . I thought you were thinking just the same things as was , and now  | Inspector Elliot looked at his watch . " We shall have to be moving , sir , " he said in a flat voice , " if we want to catch that train and still stop in at the Close on our way . " " Do n't go , " said Madeline abruptly . " Do n't go . Please . You wo n't , will you , Brian ? " " I thought we should come to it , ma'am , " Dr. Fell told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " " I 'm afraid , " said Madeline . " I suppose that 's why I 've been talking so much , really . " The realization of something different about her , and the reason for it , came to Brian Page with a kind of shock . Dr. Fell laid his cigar in the saucer of his coffee-cup . Striking a match with great care , he leaned across and lit the candles on the table . Four golden flames curled and then drew up steadily in the warm , still air ; they seemed to hover as though disembodied above the candles . The twilight was pushed back into the garden . In the snug little nook on the edge of it , Madeline 's eyes reflected the candlelight ; they were steady but dilated . It was as though in the fear there showed a measure of expectancy . The doctor seemed uneasy . " I 'm afraid we ca n't stay , Miss Dane . We shall be back tomorrow , but there are some ends of the case we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page could ? ? " " You wo n't leave me , will you , Brian ? I 'm sorry to be such a fool and to bother you ? " " Good Lord , of course I wo n't leave you ! " roared Page , feeling such a fierce protectiveness as he had never known before . " I 'll cause a scandal . I wo n't let you beyond arm 's length until morning . Not that there 's anything to be afraid of . " " Are n't you forgetting the date ? " " The date ? "  | " The anniversary . July 3rst . Victoria Daly died a year ago tonight . " " It is also , " supplied Dr. Fell , looking curiously at both of them , " it is also Lammas Eve . A good Scot like Elliot will tell you what that is . It 's the night of one of the Great Sabbaths and the powers from down under are exalted . H'mf . Hah . Well . I 'm a cheerful blighter , eh ? " Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " he said . " What 's the good of putting nonsense into people 's heads ? Madeline is upset enough as it is . She 's played other people 's games and done things for other people until she 's worn out . What the devil do you mean by trying to make it worse ? There 's no danger here . If I see anything hanging about I 'll wring its ruddy neck and ask permission from the police afterwards . " " Sorry , " said Dr. Fell . For a moment he stood looking down from his great height with tired , kindly , vaguely troubled eyes . Then he took his cloak , his shovel-hat , and his crutchhandled stick from a chair . " Good night , sir , " said Elliot . " If I 've got the geography of the neighbourhood right , we can go up that path to the left from the garden here , and through the wood , and down to Farnleigh Close on the other side ? Is that right ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you again for everything , Miss Dane , for a very pleasant and instructive evening . And just  --  keep your eye out , you know , Mr. Page . " " Yes . And watch out for bogles in the wood , " Page shouted after them . He stood in the French window and watched them go down the garden among the laurels . It was a very warm night , and the scents of the garden were thick and enervating . In  | the east stars were brightening against a slope of sky , but they winked dimly as though distorted by heat-waves . Page 's irrational anger grew . " Bunch of old women , " he said . " Trying to He turned round and saw the fleeting of Madeline 's smile . She was calm again ; but she looked flushed . " I 'm sorry to make such an exhibition of myself , Brian , " she said gently . " I know there 's no danger of any kind . " She got up . " Will you excuse me for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . Sha n't be a second . " " Bunch of old women . Trying to Alone , he lit a cigarette with care . After a very brief time he was able to laugh at his own annoyance , and he felt better . On the contrary , an evening alone with Madeline was one of the pleasantest things he could imagine . A brown moth flashed through the window and dived in a long sweep towards one flame ; he brushed it away , and shifted as it passed his face . This little core of candlelight was very soothing and pleasant , but they might as well have more light . He went to the electric switch . Subdued wall-lamps brought out the grace of the room and the pattern of chintzes . It was odd , he thought , how clear and sharply defined the ticking of a clock could be . There were two of them in the room ; they did not vie with each other , but each filled up the beats the other lacked , and produced a kind of quick rustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that drew the eye . He went back to the table , where he poured himself some almost cold coffee . The noise of his own footsteps on the floor , the rattle of the cup in the saucer , the clink of the china coffee-pot on the edge of the cup : all these made sounds as clearly defined as those of the clocks . For the first time he became  | aware of mere emptiness as a positive quality . His thoughts ran progressively : this room is absolutely empty : I am alone : what of it ? The emptiness of the place was emphasized by the clearness of the lights . To one subject he kept his mind closed , though he had guessed a certain secret that afternoon and confirmed it from a book in his library . Something cheerful was indicated  --  for Madeline , of course . This house , neat as it might be , was too isolated . Round it was a wall of darkness stretching for half a mile . Madeline was taking rather a long time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and flapped on the table . Curtains and candle-flames stirred a little . Better close the windows . He went across the bright , hard room , stood in one French window looking out into the garden , and then stood very still . In the garden , in the darkness just beyond the thin edge of light from the windows , sat the automaton from Farnleigh Close .  | Chapter XVII Fon the space of perhaps eight seconds he stood looking at it , as motionless as the automaton itself . The light from the windows was faint yellow . It stretched out ten or a dozen feet across the grass , just touching the oncepainted base of the figure . Even wider cracks gaped across her wax face ; she leaned a little sideways from her fall downstairs , and half of her clockwork insides were gone . Some effort had been made to mend this by pulling the decayed gown across the wounds . Old and smashed and half-blind , she looked at him malignantly from the shadow of the laurels . He had to force himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards her , feeling that his steps took him farther than need be from the lighted windows . She was alone , or seemed alone . Her wheels had been mended , he noticed . But the ground was so baked from long July drought that the wheels left hardly a trace in the grass . Not far to the left was a gravel drive which would leave no traces . Then he hurried back to the house , for he heard Madeline coming downstairs . Carefully he closed all the French windows . Then he picked up the heavy oak table and carried it to the middle of the room . Two of the candlesticks rocked . Madeline , appearing in the doorway , found him steadying one of them as he set down the table . " Moths getting in , " he explained . " But wo n't it be awfully stuffy ? Had n't you better leave one " I 'll do it . " He set the middle window open about a foot . " Brian ! There 's nothing wrong , is there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ticking of the clocks ; but most of all of the sympathetic presence of Madeline , exuding the wish to be protected . Uneasiness takes people in strange ways . She did not now seem so remote or selfeffacing . The aura of her  --  there is no other word for it  --  filled the room . He said : " Good Lord , no ; of course there 's nothing wrong . It 's just that moths are a nuisance , that 's all . That 's why I closed the windows . " " Shall we go into the other room ? " Better not be out of touch with it . Better not have it free to go where it liked . " Oh , let 's stay here and smoke another cigarette . " " Of course . What about some more coffee ? " " Do n't trouble . " " It 's no trouble . It 's all prepared on the stove . " She smiled , the bright smile of one strung up by nerves , and went across to the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . She seemed to be in the kitchen a long time , and he went in search of her . He met her in the doorway , carrying a fresh pot of coffee . She spoke quietly . Brian , there is something wrong . The back door is open .  |  | I know I left it shut , and Maria always closes it when she goes home . " " Maria forgot it . " " Yes . If you say so . Oh , I 'm being silly . I know I am . Let 's have something cheerful . " She seemed to wake up , with an apologetic and yet defiant laugh , and a brighter complexion . In one corner of the room , unobtrusive like Madeline herself , there was a radio . She switched it on . It took a few seconds to grow warm ; then the resulting volume of noise startled them both . She toned it down , but the flooding jingles of a danceorchestra filled the rooms like surf on a beach . The tunes seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to it for a moment . Then she returned to the table , sat down , and poured out their coffee . They were sitting at right angles to each other , so close he could have touched her hand . Her back was to the windows . All the while he was conscious of something outside , waiting . He wondered what his feelings would be if a cracked face were poked against the glass . Yet , at the same time his nerves were touched , his brain stirred as well . It seemed to him that he woke up . It seemed to him that he was rationally reasoning for the first time ; that bonds fell apart and the brain emerged from iron bands . Now what were the facts about that dummy ? It was dead iron and wheels and wax . It was no more dangerous of itself than a kitchen boiler . They had examined it , and they knew . Its only purpose was to terrify , a human purpose managed by a solid hand . It had not pushed itself across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in a wheel-chair . It had
