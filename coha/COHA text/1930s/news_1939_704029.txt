txt Continuation of the New York Stock Exchange 's drive for new listings is threatening to bring a counter move by the Chicago Stock Exchange . As a result of the loss of business by the latter through the taking of numerous Chicago issues by the big board and the New York Curb in the past few years . more and more members are demanding protective action of some sort . The form of such action is likely to be influenced importantly by last year 's successful introduction of optional odd lot trading here in leading New York issues . Thirty-four companies accepted the Chicago Stock Exchange 's offer for free listing between June and the end of the year and brought the total of issues in Its optional odd lot system to 65 . Public Demand for Service Seen The proportion of transactions in this category to total volume on the local board has risen steadily from 2.4% last June to 19.90 in May of this year This is interpreted RS conclusive evidence of a public demand for such service here . The proportion of combined odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has risen from 32.5,7 , last June to 50.8% in May 1969 . It is clear from these figures that the gain in Chicago volume this year as compared to last year is mainly due to increased odd lot trading 3n the big board stocks . It is the feeling of a growing number of exchange members , moreover , that as long as SEC regulations militate against the listing of new issues on the local board and as long as the New York exchanges continue to reach out for issues already listed on the smaller exchanges , the latter nave no alternative but to build up their odd lot business in leading New York stocks . It is. therefore , not improbable that the Chicago Stock Exchange will soon renew its offer to big board companies of free listing in order to bring a further increase in odd lot trading here . If sufficient ' acceptances are received , there Is a strong possibility that an unlisted trading department will be net up for an extensive list of New York issues . Effects on New York On the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only likely sufferers from an extension to additional issues would be the New York odd lot houses . Round lot volume on the New York exchange would stand to gain rather than to lose because of the covering operations of the Chicago odd lot houses . Besides the immediate benefit of the additional odd-lot business , which further listing of New York issues would bring or which would result from unlisted odd-lot trading in such issues here . is a belief that action along these lines might lead to a let-up in New York solicitation of issues now listed on smaller exchanges Since about 95% of the listed business of the country is already being done in New York . it IS felt on La Salle Street that the New York Stock Exchange 's stress on the necessity for further " diversification " of its trading is not entirely logical . It IS , likewise , felt that the New York exchange is using a rather flexible yardstick to determine what issues meet its requirement as to " clearly defined national interest " .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
