I HAD been a housewife for ten years . Then I was alone and had to start to earn my own living . With a capital of $2000 . I hoped to buy a business which would be intereating as well as income producing . I looked at " business opportunities " ? everything from rooming houses and tearooms to cigar stands and commercial photography , before I met the man who sold theaters for a Detroit business-brokerage firm . His brisk talk of block booking , box-office appeal , and S R 0 signs made owning a picture show sound attractive , but I was frightened at the prospect of managing any of the first places he showed me  --  neighborhood theaters in Detroit and one in Saginaw . When he spoke of small towns , I felt on more familiar ground , for I grew up in a Michigan village and liked the idea of going back to one . Milford , he explained , was only forty miles from the Detroit film exchanges , which distribute film to most of Michigan . Its only theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure-fire money-maker , a cinch for a smart woman . He would help me with everything  --  bookings , advertising and exploitation  --  untill learned the ropes . That was on a Monday in October . I did n't understand  --  not then  --  why he waited until Saturday night to take me to see the theater . The place was packed , with a , line-up at the box office . Later I discovered that Milford is a typical Saturday-night town , with all the farmers of the community making weekly trips for shopping and diversion . So I decided to buy the Star Theater in Milford , Michigan  --  property , equipment and goodwill . The following Wednesday I met the owner in Detroit to sign a land contract and pay $100 to clinch the bargain . The balance of the $1500 was to be paid when the keys were turned over to me . The price was $7500 ; terms : the down payment , an additional one of $1000 in cash at the end of the first year , and monthly payments of seventy dollars . Sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 the bustling little village looked even more attractive . On the following Saturday I took possession . The man from the brokerage firm went with me and left me to close my deal with the owner . The evening show was in progress and we crowded into the box office with his wife . In that confusion I was instructed regarding pictures under contract , advertising and equipment . I gave him the $1400 check and another of nearly $200 to cover advance payments he had made on film rental and advertising . When the theater closed he showed me where the light switches were , how to bolt the fire exits , turned the keys over to me , and left . I 'll never forget that night . From &little; after midnight until nearly morning , I paced back and forth in the little room I had rented over a caf 6 across the street . Much of the time I stood at the window looking across Main Street at the blinking lights of the star-shaped sign which gave my theater its name . Afterward I realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad I did n't . If my theater had been dark that night , I probably would have gone into a complete panic . That star was the only tangible thing in the confusion of my thoughts . After a while the many bewildering details I had been told by the owner and salesman began to straighten out . Toward morning I was able to make simple plans . In the early dawn I watched those winking lights begin to fade , and I remember the exact words I told them , " I 've spent nearly all my money to buy you . I do n't know anything about how to keep you going . I 've got to do it . I 've got to do it alone , and  --  I 'll do it ! " At first I overdid the " alone " part . Five dollars covered my necessary daily pay roll  --  three dollars for the projectionist , a dollar for a boy to relieve him and sometimes take tickets , and fifty cents each to the popcorn girl and a regular ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitor 's wife or daughter  --  in addition to my duties of management , and I also did the janitor work . I got acquainted with every inch of that house and learned the peculiarities of the furnace . By Christmas I was glad to turn the sweeping and coal shoveling over to a schoolboy for three dollars a week . On the Monday after I bought the theater I drove to Detroit to learn how to keep it . On my carefully tabulated list of things to do , the first item was to join the Michigan Theater Owners Association . Their manager spent two hours telling me how I o go about my job of being an ( Conti ... zed on Pogo 30 ) ( Conr4no  --  ri from Pogo 23 ) exhibitor . He examined the existing picture contracts for Milford and advised me to assume them . There were n't many ; they were what my town was used to ; it would give me a good start with the film exchanges if I did not disturb their bookings . Then I proceeded to learn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose membership is open to film producers and distributors as well as exhibitors . Their secretary explained the board 's chief function-a neutral board of arbitration for out-of-court settlement of disputes between members . This not only saves theater owners and exchanges the expense of litigation but also avoids the unfavorable publicity of airing theater troubles in court . I was told that defective film is a common cause of complaint . I would be entitled to a rebate of film rental from an exchange which sent me film with broken or weak edges that broke in the projector . Broken films may mean something more serious than simply stopping the show . With approximately 100 feet of film passing through the machines each minute , a break in the reel allows this highly combustible material to pile up in front . of the white-hot projection light . If it ignites , the whole reel may ' explode . Most projection rooms are fireproof and equipped with automatic devices to confine any fire to the booth . All film is-or should be-kept in fireproof cabinets , except for the reels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at Milford to make sure Michigan 's stringent fire-hazard laws were enforced . His O.K. on my well-equipped fireproof booth was well worth his inspection fee of ten dollars . I spent the balance of that first day in the various film exchanges . Most of the managers had heard that the new owner of the Star of Milford was a woman . They ushered me into their private offices to sign the contracts I agreed to assume . Some of them offered me drinks , which , I gathered , is customary . Then they tried to sell me new contracts . I declined both drinks and contracts . .17 Movie First Night I returned to Milford in time to open the Monday-night show and smile at my new patrons from the box office . I did smile , but I wished there were more customers to smile at . My little stack of quarters and dimes just covered film rental on the feature . The movie business has theadvantage of being a strictly cash affair . Customers pay before they see the show , and film rental must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the exchange before the film leaves , the cans come C. 0 . D. On Monday of that first week my receipts were $7.50 ; Tuesday , $9.00-a total of $16.50 for a show with a feature at $7.50 and a comedy at $3.00 . Thursday and Friday were a little better-$28.50 receipts against a $10.00 feature and another $3.00 comedy . My Saturday show was a $7.50 Western , with $4.50 worth of short subjects , and I was able to smile gratefully at the farmers who shoved $82.50 through the window of my box office . I met my pay roll of $25.00 and paid $12.00 for express charges on film delivery . I figured $10.00 for advertising and lights at $4.50 , and had a net of 840.50 , of which $20.00 must be set , aside for that extra $1000 payment at the end of the year . I listed my yearly overhead expense as follows : Payments on Property : 12 : Months at $70 a month Extra payment , end of year Insurance Taxes Fire inspection Association dues Film Board of Trade 10.00 Fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total overhead ? .... . $2050.00 Dividing that amount by fifty-two , I had the round figure of $40.00 overhead against my week 's net of $40.50 , and knew I had to continue my janitor duties . Later I realized that this week suffered the natural slump following the run of a widely advertised special the week before I became the owner . I could n't blame my patrons for staying away from the pictures I was showing-from what I could see of them at odd moments . I never saw a complete show . A study of my contracts and bookings convinced me I had to do something about the situation , and do it quickly . The town expected a change of policy from a new owner , which offered an opportunity to make a favorable first impression . I concluded I had to gamble on some good specials , and the time was fortunate , for October and November are among the best show months of the year in a farming community . I decided to put on a gala Opening Night with a super-special . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Milford , but I cleared $100 on it , and thought I had found , the answer to all my problems . Twenty-five dollars had been my predecessor 's top price , so there were several good specials available at slightly higher prices . For a time I ran two of them each month ; later I spaced them farther apart . My film rental increased to an average of fifty dollars a week , box-office receipts to $150 . Naturally , I did not have the $1000 extra payment to make after the first year , but I spent various amounts on improvements so that my overhead over the whole period of 134 weeks came to only slightly less than my first estimate-that is , overhead cost me $40.00 a week during the first year , but only $35.00 a week over the whole period . WEEKLY AVERAGE OF EXVESSE Operating Costs : Pay roll $25.00 Advertising 15.00 Express on film transportation 12.00 Lights 4.50 Coal and wood 2.50 $59,00 Overhead 35.00 Weekly expense without film rental 594.00 Average film rental $50 00 Total weekly expense . ..... $144.00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak week of $260.00 and low one of $95.00 ) $170.00 Average net per week $31.00 While my receipts varied widely my expenses were almost static , except for film rental . With $7.00 a day for overhead and around $12.00 for other costs of operation , film rental brought the minimum cost of any night 's show to about $25.00 , whether or not I sold the 100 quarter admissions I needed to break oven . A February night of zero temperature and piercing wind set my record for low attendance at twelve . Cold and storm were not always liabilities . Sometimes the people who habitually drove to near-by city theaters were unable to make these trips over drifted icy roads and patronized my little movie-especially if I was showing a better-than-average picture . Specials still justified their extra cost . Film rentals are based on the number of seats in your theater and the population of your town . I had 250 seats , Milford had 1600 people , so I was entitled to minimum rates . The value of a picture depends on the number of paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay thousands of dollars for a feature which may run several weeks . In a small town , where everyone would see it in two days , the exhibitor may pay as little as $7.50 for the same can of film , whether he used it one day or three . First-run theaters get an extra value in a protection period during which that picture may not he shown in other theaters within a certain radius . Football Defeat Though Milford was within the protection zone of Detroit , it was too unimportant for the big theaters to care whether or not this was enforced . As a result , I was able to run pictures soon enough to take . advantage of Detroit newspaper advertising and billboards . In some cases I was able to show them sooner than large theaters in other near-by cities where the protection was enforced . Once I booked a popular picture for dates within a week of its big Detroit run . It was a football picture , set for Thanksgivings-the best show day of the year-and should have cleared a big profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I committed the typically feminine folly of talking too much . Plain common sense should have warned me not to blab to the one man who might object to Milford showing that picture before he could . One day I met the man who owned all the theaters in a near-by city , and boasted about my Thanksgiving special . On the day before my run started , with all my advertising out , the exchange wired me that they were unable to deliver the film to Milford during the protection period . They sent an older picture with the same star , a good one which had never shown in Milford , and made no charge for this one or for the advertising matter with it-which was fair enough . My minimum film rental for features was $7.50 . At that price I got program pictures-the ordinary , run-of-themine pictures needed for the bulk of programs in movie houses making several changes each week . For specials and some of the popular stars I paid from $25.00 to $100.00 . Most prices are subject to bargaining with film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I met on my first trip to the Film Building . He was young , good-looking and very smooth . He extolled the merits of his pictures , but did n't urge me to buy . He said I was so wise not to sign new contracts until I became adjusted . He was very complimentary . He admired my furs . ( Continued en Page 38 ) THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February ha , : pap ( Continued from Page 36 ) He told me it was a pleasure to meet an attractive woman with a talent for business . When Heft , he said he would call on me soon . A little gleam in his eye betrayed that he thought a woman would he easy picking . I learned about salesmen from him . I had to buy about 200 features a year , and two or three times as many short subjects . Few contracts cover less than five pictures , but once your signature is on the dotted line , every item listed above it must be paid for . If some prove to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for them and not run them . The only way out is through the exchange offering to cancel a. few unused pictures as an inducement to sell a new contract , which puts you in a bad position to bargain . Film is perishable not merely because of its brittle composition . Once a year , when the producer has his twelve-month schedule outlined , a salesman tries to sell you the whole works . Failing in that , he makes frequent calls as long as any of his pictures are open for your town . All are ready to sell to small theaters as soon as one or two are made and have had first rims in your key city . I signed one contract which totaled more than $1000 for features and comedies , and was glad to get it , although few of the pictures were completed . It included most of my sure-fire stars , and all I needed to know was the name and the price . On Saturday nights the farmers came to town and brought the biggest part of my week 's income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie-man actors . Most of these stars make from five to nine pictures a year , few of which cost me more than ten dollars film rental . The exchanges know which ones you need and increase the price each year . Cheap stars who are popular with your patrons can be built up with special exploitation . The exchanges furnish inexpensive souvenirs , paper sombreros , and so on , with which to exploit these pictures . juggling Stars I do n't think the word " exploit " has a sting the way exhibitors use it . The dictionary gives a first meaning of the verb , " to put to use ; use selfishly , as workingmen , " a common understanding of the word . You come closer to what exploitation means in the movies if you think of the meaning of the noun , " an act marked by heroism , during , skill or brilliance . " Theater owners put their pictures to use , perhaps selfishly , but they do not exploit their patrons . They exploit exploits . When the price of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I changed him to a midweek run which brought seventy-five dollars . As dates to exploit this actor 's deeds of daring , I booked his next picture to start on a Monday in June which happened to be my birthday . I gave a matinee birthday party for all the kids of the locality . Free admission , popcorn and suckers , with an added prize attraction of a pass to the theater good all during vacation . For the coveted prize I conducted a. drawing in a spotlight on the stage . Except for popcorn and candy , my only other expense was extra pay for my operator , as / never ran in the daytime . Few small-town theaters do . The pass cost less than nothing , he-cause any person with a theater pass generally brings at leant one paid admission . With children this is apt to mean both parents  --  and quite often . My first idea about the party was to make friends with the kids . They can make plenty of trouble if they do n't like you . Anyway , I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever gave . Afterward I got a great kick from the special smiles they gave me . School had just closed and I ran a . Standing Room Only matinee . And the funny thing about it was that every child came back to the show in the evening and brought most of his family with him . For an expenditure of less than ten dollars my receipts increased from the usual seventy-five dollars on that star to $135 on these two nights , and each of his later pictures cleared an extra twenty to twenty-five dollars . was sorry he made only seven pictures a year . That 's exploitation that does n't hurt anyone . An Easter Program New ideas are usually worth money . In the movies it pays to work out almost any original idea . Naturally , a. woman 's ideas are different from the ones men have been working on for years , and a woman exhibitor may find it profitable to carry out any stunt she originates , no matter how unprecedented it may be . During the week before Easter I ran a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that idea is not new . In fact , I had to book it in January to be sure of having it for Easter . Churches often run it at Christmastime , and it is not a subject to be handled lightly . I did not use ordinary advertising , posters and window cards , for the excellent reason that the exchange did n't have any . I worked through the local churches , including the little crossroad ones . I gave them free tickets for their Sunday-school children and adult tickets to sell on 40 per cent commission . For a short sub- . ject I used a one-reel floral travelogue , and then ran the five-reel feature as slowly as possible . I raised adult admission from my usual twenty-five cents to forty cents . The picture was a silent one with a cue sheet for appropriate piano music and suggestions for vocal numbers . Soloists from the church choirs were glad to do these without pay . They sang Holy Night during the Bethlehem scenes , a solemn hymn during the crucifixion , and at the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave He arose ! " Not in any church have I ever seen a more impressive Easter service than the one I staged in a movie . I 'll never forget the exalted , rapt expressions on the children 's faces as they came out of that show . I paid twenty-five dollars for this picture , and my profit on it was about the same as on any special , but its value to me went further than that . It established my theater with the church people and offset talk of possible harmful influence of movies . It brought in people who had never come before . One very old lady told me it was the first movie she had ever seen . I followed up by running complimentary slides on Saturday nights announcing Sunday church services . Altogether , this church affiliation helped to put me , as a woman theater manager , the " show lady , " in a much better light in the town . Schools and other local organizations were more than willing to co-operate on special occasions . When I ran a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 per cent on tickets they sold . 20 per cent of box-office sales , and they provided amateur acts between shows . ' Once a week the band played in front of the theater before the first show , again on the stage before the second , and their share of receipts helped them to buy new uniforms . The American Legion brought out a good crowd for a patriotic picture on Lincoln 's Birthday . The high school put on playlets . Boy Scouts turned out in a body and helped put over a picture which was weak in box-office appeal , but an excellent show for them to see . For all these occasions I used extra care in selecting features . This is an effective way in which exhibitors accomplish practical censorship . Theater owners can not eliminate sensational pictures as long as some of their patrons want them , but they can , and very often do , use sense in setting the dates on which such pictures are shown . Children attend in largest numbers on Friday and Saturday nights , so the other days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons may have a yen for the stars in those pictures . Many exhibitors make an honest effort toward this sort of censorship . Most of theater-owner associations advocate it . Theaters know better than to advertise such a policy , but mothers can easily discover a general trend in Friday and Saturday shows . When I sold out , the very conservative local paper surprised me with a laudatory front-page write-up . They spoke particularly of the better pictures I had brought to Milford , which gave me a laugh . With some exceptions , I ran much tho same pictures any exhibitor would . I had n't much choice . I used caution in setting dates , and the different elements in town saw what they wanted to see . The community believed I gave them " better pictures " because I persistently told them so . I started using the phrase as soon as I decided I wanted better pictures . I hoped to be a better exhibitor than my predecessor , who had been in the business for thirty years . In my inexperience I thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay higher prices for them . I suppose that was " just like a woman . " Tolling the World Before I put on my Opening Night I had the newspaper shop print 500 large pink cards with the words Barran Picrearas in huge block letters , and a line below , STAR THEATER , MILFORD , UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT . I tacked those cards all over the countryside . I hammered on the words in all my advertising . Evidently I put it over . When that editor praised me , after I had left his town and he 'd never get any more advertising from me , I know he believed what he said . Notice that I said I tacked up I hose cards . I did . I put up all my advertising . Each week I covered the area , distributing handbills and tacking up cards which advertised my next special feature . I started because I knew I would do a better job than anyone I could afford to hire . I kept it up because of the showmanship value in a woman doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In well-cut riding breeches , high laced boots , a red sweater and a becoming hat , when I got out of my roadster and clambered across ditches and up high banks , I usually had an audience . On narrow country roads Passing cars had to slow up to goaround mine , and they stopped . Maybe a farmer left his plow and leaned on a fence . His family came out to see what was going on . Usually a dog or two ran around barking . Everybody laughed a lot ; a good time was had by all . I staged twenty to fifty of these performances each month and shared the spotlight with my show cards . The most casual passer-by looked at those cards and , remembering the incident , watched the place for future postings . Pepping  --  Up Main Street There was one farmer who had a nice barn on an important intersection . The first time I started to put a card on it , he came on the run to forbid such sacrilege . He never allowed signs on his barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my young patrons . He looked at my card hanging by one corner on the barn and told his dad he 'd heard that was a swell picture . I straightened the card and showed the boy my magnetic hammer , which hold the poster nails in place . The farmer stopped his hemming and hawing to watch my demonstration . I drove one tack on another corner of the card very lightly and immediately removed it . The farmer took my ingenious hammer and finished tacking up the card . Thereafter that big red barn , with only my card on it , was one of my best displays . Feminine tact is a clever tool too , I worked hard . One of the Main Street merchants told me he had never seen a woman work so hard . My days were nearly as full as my evenings . On the one night in the middle of the week when my theater was usually dark , I put on a Wednesday show in co-operation with local merchants , admission five cents with a coupon from any local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce . I explained my plan as well as I could , but was unable to answer many of their questions . I did n't know what benefit the different stores would receive for the dollar I asked each to contribute . I told them I would drive to a neighboring town , where the plan was being used , to ask various merchants what . they thought of it , and would report my findings the following week . I made the trip , interviewed thirty-one caf ? owners , gas stations , hardware men , furniture dealers , poolrooms , haberdashers and feed stores . I made individual reports and lined up twenty-five contributors . This show ran for ten weeks each summer and brought nearly 600 people to Main Street on otherwise dull nights . Each performance ran only an hour and consisted of an exciting serial and short subjects . The brevity of the show gave my patrons time to shop . The programs did not interfere with my regular feature shows and gave me an opportunity to reach new people with screen advertising . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid all expenses , leaving the twenty-five dollars from the merchants as clear profit . I made no charge for slides shown by contributing merchants , but their advertising value was slight because of the number . It 's odd that people watch the screen when slides are shown without actually seeing them . I remember one that was being used in Milford when I bought the theater . It came from a shoe manufacturer , with the name of the local dealer printed at the bottom . Milford had stared at that sign for three 40 THE SRTURDAY EVENING POST February 1 ' 8.1935 months , but not even the shoe merchant had noticed that the imprint read " Milford , Connecticut . " The Wednesday-night shows gave me a welcome opportunity to meet the town businessmen , for my social activities were necessarily limited to afternoon parties of women whose interests were different from mine . I attended three conventions of the Michigan Theater Owners Association . The trade papers ran stories with my picture as the only woman theater owner and manager in Michigan . As a lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not mix in discussions or ask questions . The entertainment for exhibitors ' wives occupied the time of the business sessions . The final banquet blowout was a bore to a woman alone . One winter afternoon I attended a tea when I might have told an exciting tale , except that I had learned when to keep my mouth shut . On the night before , my janitor had built a roaring fire in the furnace and gone home without elosiug the drafts . The show was nearly over when I smelled something hot and surmised what had happened . Hurrying toward the basement , I went into an anteroom , closed the door after me to keep the theater dark , and turned on a small light over a trap door leading to the cellar steps . When I opened this trap , smoke billowed u p , but I had to go into it and pull I he door down above me , shutting off all light . A square red glow outlined lend of the basement . Around it little the lower door of the furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall that met the wooden floor on which my patrons sat , en-I grossed in the show . Coughing and with my eyes stung by fumes , I groped for a shovel , thankful that the cellar floor was loose sand . When the fire was out . I opened rear windows for ventilation and returned to my box office . I I had a few minutes to regain composure before the auditorium lights came on . I smiled my patrons-out serenely . Jill.of.A11 , Trades ? Neither my frantic fire-fighting nor my smiling serenity was inspired by heroism . The fifteen or twenty people in the show would have been warned by smoke before they were in danger . I shoveled sand alone for the simple reason that I carried inadequate insurance . I thought of repair bills and loss of revenue if the theater closed I aired the basement to keep knowledge of the fire strictly to myself and avoid the intangible loss caused by fear  --  the instinctive fear of any kind of a theater fire , which affects attendance for a long time . My memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and last shows . During the first , selling tickets occupied most of my attention , but in my dual role of manager and cashier I had to keep a weather eye on the screen whenever possible . If anything went wrong with the picture , I signaled a warning to the operator  --  one buzz for a flicker , two for a misframe , continuous ringing for a blank , which might mean a break in the film . When I failed to note such mishaps , my customers ' laughter or growls soon directed my hand to the signal button . Then I 'd hear my operator 's quick steps in the booth above me . The picture would show clearly again , or an upside-down scene righted itself , or the floor in it dropped suddenly into place . Perhaps a glaring blank would be replaced by an explanatory slide while the operator changed reels . During summer and fall , when Saturday receipts were usually more than SIG ? , I had to open earlier and run three complete shows . Sometimes I had to repeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who always asked if they were in time for the feature . Though they never inquired about the comedy , they kept their seats at the end of the feature . They had received all they bargained for , but most of them were farmers , whose weekly trips to town were their only diversion , and I thought they needed all the entertainment I could give them . Sometimes I showed a fourth comedy to one lone farmer 's family and felt well repaid by their hearty laughter . I learned the unalloyed pleasure of giving to people who were under no obligation to express gratitude . During week-day second shows I had time to chat with customers who stopped to tell me they had enjoyed the show . I enjoyed their friendliness , particularly the regular attendants among the young people . Of course , I knew which couples were going together and my ticket window recorded the first signs of breaking up . If the girl started coming to the show with a new boy friend , the old one might stop to inquire about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often the boy or girl told me the reason for their disagreements and asked my advice . In spite of my varied activities , I was a rather solitary person . I had no one with whom I could discuss my problems , no one on whom I could rely in ease of sickness . In my second summer in Milford this phase of my affairs became more serious , for my usual good health went on a rampage . When doctors and surgeons told me I had to spend a month in the hospital , I was fortunate in having a friend who took over part of my duties . but she knew little about contracts , bookings and advertising , nor could she be expected to learn this in order to spend one month in my business . Before I could leave , it was necessary , for me to complete many details . I booked all pictures for three months in advance . I bought advertising for them and filed it in order  --  no small task on forty shows , with one and three sheet posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper cuts and display cards for specials . My advertising copy for the weekly newspaper and handbills had to be prepared also . I wrote all checks for film rental , signed and dated , ready to be mailed out each week . I finished the last detail at four in the morning of the day I entered the hospital . The Thursday Club 's Verdict Of course I came back . In just a month I was back in my box office , a bit wabbly and glad my business was arranged to run almost automatically . My bank account had suffered to the extent . of $1000 , but my health continued to improve for a few months . I tried to be careful , but , in the flush of returning health , I probably undertook too much . My heart began to act up . My doctor advised complete rest . I was spending all my free time in a horizontal position when a new danger popped up . A rumor started that one of the large theater chains intended to build in Milford . Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I knew the big chains seldom , if ever , go into towns under 3000 population . But the combination of my depleted bank account and health with the threat of ruinous competition threw me into a panic , and I called the Detroit brokerage company which had sold the place to me . Within three weeks , the Star of Milford had a new owner . In a little less than three years my original investment of $1500 had increased to about $5500 , including the amounts paid on the contract and improvements in projection equipment and screen , building alterations and a new popcorn machine , all of which came out of the business under overhead . I do n't know whether I might have secured a higher price , for I sold to the first buyer who offered cash for my $5500 equity and agreed to assume my contract on the property . Sometimes I wonder what Milford thought of the woman who was its " show lady . " I do n't think Milford gossiped about me . They thought of me as a hard-working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment gave me a place among the respected business people . On a later trip to Milford I heard one gratifying statement . My doctor told me a conversation he had heard on an afternoon when his wife was entertaining the Thursday Club , the town 's most exclusive women 's organization . He could n't remember everything they said , but assured me it had been " quite favorable . " I urged him to be more explicit . With twinkling eyes , he hesitated a moment before he explained that the ladies had always been puzzled about me . It was their unanimous verdict that I was a " woman of mystery . " Could any woman ask for more ? .
