Not the least of mankind 's fanatic fractions is that vanishing fraternity of motorists who still drive a Model T. Not the kast among them is septuagenarian Ernest A. Franke . a retired baker of Washington , D. C. One day last week Mr. Franke and his 1921 Ford chattered down Pennsylvania Avenue , wheeled into the semicircular White House driveway , and astounded White House police by pausing hard by the Executive Office . <P> " Where 's Henry ? " cackled Gaffer Franke . " I want him to see this old car . " <P> Assured that Henry Ford had not yet arrived , and that citizens ' cars could not be parked there , Motorist Franke banged decorously away , returned after a while and again toured the grounds , again missed Mr. Ford . <P> At the moment of Mr. Franke 's first appearance on the White House scene , septuagenarian Mr. Ford was trying out Attorney General Homer S. Cummings ' bullet-proof Lincoln . With Mr. Ford on a breeze through the tortuous roadways of Rock Creek Park were his son Edsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free Press and Jay G. Hayden of the Detroit News . Both Mr. Prevost and Mr. Hayden have developed excellent news contacts with Ford Motor Co. , and they later were to serve as the only authoritative reporters of a historic two hours in the life of Mr. Ford and in the Administration of Franklin Roosevelt . <P> The advisers who ordinarily arrange extraordinary conferences with Mr. Roosevelt were already complaining that the occasion had become uncomfortably historic . According to this somewhat jaundiced view , the President 's brother-in-law , Gracie Hall Roosevelt , had bungled at a crucial stage in the Administration 's Second Recovery Program . By arranging a White House invitation to Henry Ford , moaned these counselors , this onetime Detroit comptroller had also arranged a White House dramatization for the stiffest and most nonresilient member of the Opposition ; had , indeed , obliterated the effects of the friendly pronouncement from SECommissioner John Hanes 's Sixteen Businessmen ( see p. 55 ) . <P> Be that as it may , the event was legitimately historic . More than any other man , Motorman Ford personifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Way . He had consistently and successfully resisted NRA . He is currently doing battle with the National Labor Relations Board and C. I. O. And for the romantic touch dear to the reading American , this was to be his first meeting with the President since the World War days when Henry Ford manufactured submarine chasers for Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt .
