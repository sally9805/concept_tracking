txt A tiny line upon a photograph furnished yesterday the evidence by which Frederick Gross , 49-year-old bookkeeper in a chemical importing house , was faced with a charge of murdering his wife and four children with thallium sulphate , a seldom-used poison . The murder charge was ordered by District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan of Brooklyn last night after Gross had been questioned most of the day . He was not booked immediately , however , but taken to the Wilson Avenue precinct station in Brooklyn , where questioning went on through the night . He was to be formally charged this morning and arraigned in a magistrates ' court . Throughout the day 's hammering of questions from assistant District Attorneys and detectives in Mr. Geoghan 's office , Gross stoutly maintained his innocence . He did it with a mild voice , a pleasant , almost ingratiating manner , and reiterated over and over that the presence of thallium sulphate in tissue taken from his wife and one of his children was as much a mystery to him as to any one else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he had worked as a bookkeeper for Pfaltz &; Bauer , an importing firm of 300 Pearl Street , where he formerly received $35 a week . In the last year his salary had been cut to $20 . At his office he was known for his artificial leg ? he lost one leg in am accident in Philadelphia in 1905 . His friendly manner also was commented on as well as his lack of any distinguishing competence which would have marked him off as better than the average workman . Because of his long service , he had the run of the place . Among the store of chemicals kept on hand by the concern was about 100 pounds of thallium sulphate . The substance has a variety of uses but is chiefly employed as an exterminant for rodents . So seldom has it been known to have been taken by humans that the medical lore on its effect on the human body is very limited . It was on March 29 that the first of Gross 's family was stricken . It consisted at that time of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frederick , Frank and Leo , 9% , 5 and 3 , respectively , and two girls , Katharine , 7 , and Barbara , 18 months . The first to die was Frederick . Gross related to Mr. Geoghan that when he went home on March 29 his wife told him Freddie was ill . He undressed the boy and put him to bed , he said . During the night he tended him , and then while he dozed there was a scream from Freddie and they found him dying . The Grosses lived at 179 Eldert Street in a four-room " hot-water " flat in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn . Gross paid $20 a month as rent . Three days later Leo died . Both deaths were reported to the Department of Health as having been caused by bronchial pneumonia . Mrs. Gross was the next . She was taken to Bushwick Hospital , where on April 4 she died and . her death was listed as caused by encephalitis , or inflammation of the brain . The term is applied to sleeping sickness . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . The last child , Frank , was in Kingston Avenue Hospital yesterday , suffering from a malady which the physicians there had diagnosed as chicken-pox . Spectrograph Bares Poison . This succession of deaths in one family finally aroused the suspicion of the authorities . A quiet investigation was undertaken . This led to the discovery by Dr. L. Edward Gaul of 100 West Fifty-ninth Street of thallium sulphate in the tissues of Mrs. Gross and of the boy Leo . A study of tissue taken from the others and from Frank , as well as Mrs. Olga Bein , mother of Mrs. Gross , who lived with them and who was in Bushwick Hospital also , but not in a precarious condition , had not been completed yesterday . His study was said to have been the first time a spectrograph had been used for such work . Where minute quantities of the poison , sufficient for a lethal dose , might elude even the most painstaking chemical analysis  --  and Dr. Alexander 0 . Gettler , city toxicologist , was continuing an analysis yesterday  --  they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue from the smelting of zinc . In apIPearance it is white and crystalline and in general closely resembles sugar . As Mr. Geoghan and his assistants had pieced the story of Gross 's actions together yesterday , the clerk , following the death of his wife , complained to Kurt Welwer , vice president of the concern for which he worked , that he believed her death was caused by some cocoa he had purchased there . I The concern had considered importing cocoa as a business , and had bought a number of half-pound tins . Later it abandoned the plan and began selling the stock to employes . Cocoa Was Found Pure . Gross said that his mother-in-law , Mrs. Bein , had told of seeing some white , sparkling substance in the cocoa . Mr. Welwer had the firm of Seilputt &; Rusby , 16 East Thirtyfourth Street , make an analysis , and they reported that except for being slightly rancid the cocoa was wholly fit for consumption . However , the can of cocoa in the Gross home was being analyzed again yesterday . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that analysis had not been completed . The child Katherine and Barbara died on April 26 immediately after a meal , part of which Gross told Mr. Geoghan he had prepared . These two children , together with William , Olga and Victor Staib , all children of Mr. and Mrs. William Staib and cousins of the Gross youngsters , had dinner that night at the Gross home . They all had farina and cocoa . However , Gross told Mr. Geoghan , he prepared for Katherine and Barbara some orange juice which , he I said , was unsweetened . About one hour after the meal Katherine and1 Barbara became violently ill and died within four hours . The Staib children showed no sign of illness . The deaths of the two girls were also ascribed to encephalitis . Medical authorities were at odds on the specific effect of thallium , because of the rarity of such poisoning , cases . They agreed , however , that its action would be in general like that of lead or other metallic poisons , causing serious kidney and intestinal disturbances . entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally producing a comatose state ending in death . After the deaths of his two girls and with his remaining child sick in a hospital , Gross did not go to work for several days . Assistant District Attorney William F. , also working on the Investigation , declared that he had determined from the statements of neighbors that Gross did not come home during those days until around 4 or 5 A. M. After questioning Mrs. Bein for about twenty minutes early thee morning in her room at the hospital , Assistant District Attorney William said she had expressed complete confidence in her son-in-law , adding that he had " never handled the food for the family . " No Motive Is Discovered . Mr. Geoghan , although accusing - Grosd of murder , frankly admitted that the authorities were at a loss for a motive for such a crime except the straitened circumstances in which the Grosses lived . There was little or no-insurance collectible , Mr. Geoghan said . However , a. thorough check was being made of all Gross 's acquaintances and his habits . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferrari at about 1 A , M. yesterday he was in a bar near his home . He said , however , that he never drank anything but beer . It was hard for Gross to make his $20-a-week salary do . His suit was an unpressed blue serge purchased on the instalment payment plan and on which he still owed $17 . About a year ago he borrowed $180 from a small-loan company in Brooklyn , pledging his simple fdrniture . He had been paying that . back in small instalments , too , but still owed about $50 . Sitting comfortably in a chair outside the District Attorney 's office between periods of questioning , he stated his position . " I do n't know anything about chemicals . I do n't know anything about thallium sulphate . All those things are just names on invoices to me . " I was told by the doctor that something was wrong , that they found some of it in the body of my wife and Leo . I never brought it home with me . They tell me it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not afraid . I 've done nothing wrong . " Gross was born in Germany and came to this country at the age of 18 . He worked for a time in Philadelphia , he said , and got his job with Pfaltz &; Bauer thirteen years ago last March .
