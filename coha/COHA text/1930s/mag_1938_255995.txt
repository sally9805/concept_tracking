Up for election last week as New York Stock Exchange governors were 27 out &; out reformers , a complete change from the " Old Guard " whose long rule reached a climax two months ago in the Richard Whitney scandal . This revolution in the most capitalistic organization in the U. S. drew 924 members to the polls , a record . Since the reform slate was unopposed , those die-hards who wished to show disapproval had only one way to do so : by scratching names off the ballots . The man whose name was scratched most-163 times-was shock-haired Broker Paul Vincent Shields of Shields &; Co . For this the reason was clear : Broker Shields , more than any other Wall Streeter , is responsible for the Exchange 's change of front . <P> Born in St. Paul 48 years ago , Paul Shields grew up in Canada where his father was president of Dominion Iron &; Steel Co . He graduated from Loyola , flunked out of Cornell Law , sold real estate , took a crack at investment banking and in 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. was one of the largest wire houses in Wall Street with offices in 16 U. S. cities , four abroad . Paul Shields became something of a yachtsman and golfer , and his step-daughter married Gary Cooper , but reform in Wall Street remained his chief interest . <P> In 1935 he and two similarly minded gentlemen , Brokers Edward Allen Pierce and John Hanes , helped elect mild , supposedly liberal Charles R. Gay as Exchange president in place of Richard Whitney . But Gay presently swung to the right : when the market crashed last August he made a speech blaming it on SEC regulation . Paul Shields then took it upon himself to go see SEC Chairman William O. Douglas . Thenceforth , while Douglas attacked from Washington , Paul Shields and John Hanes worked from within . The Richard Whitney affair was the Trojan horse which delivered the Exchange into their hands . John Hanes then went blithely to Washington as a SECommissioner . Broker Shields had a finger in choosing the 27 new governors provided by the new Exchange constitution voted two months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McChesney Martin Jr . Last week Paul Shields landed a berth as head of the important public relations committee . Next job ahead of the new management is the selection of the first paid president in the Exchange 's history . Meanwhile Chairman Martin will fill the job . Last week , chaperoned by Bill Douglas , he bustled off to Washington , to get Franklin Roosevelt 's benediction.
