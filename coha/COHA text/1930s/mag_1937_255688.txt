The equal of Mrs. Franklin Delano Roosevelt in effortless daily discharge of endless public duties has for years been the Empire 's popular " Smiling Duchess , " that aboundingly healthy Scotswoman who is now Queen-Empress Elizabeth . Suddenly last week His Majesty 's Principal Secretary of State for India , the Marquess of Zetland , announced that new King George had told him the scheduled Coronation Durbar at New Delhi can not take place next winter for reasons having to do with Queen Elizabeth 's " health . " The official announcement voiced vague " hope " that in some other year the Durbar of George &; Elizabeth may take place , but the Marquess of Zetland could scarcely have done anything last week more worrying to the British business community which has such an enormous stake in British pageantry . <P> Because not even the Baldwin Cabinet 's best friends could believe that healthy Queen Elizabeth would not be able to come smiling through a dozen Coronations and Durbars if required , correspondents were obliged to question the India Office closely . What about Sir Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatched to India to perfect arrangements for the Durbar ? What about the King 's own uncertain health ? What about Mahatma Gandhi 's teeming Indian National Congress , its denunciation of the new Constitution now being given by Britain to her Indian Empire ( TIME , Oct. 12 , et ante ) ? And what about the Congress ' vote to boycott every festivity connected with the Coronation ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) ? <P> In tight-lipped replies this week , India Office civil servants officially denied that the Durbar announcement had " political significance . " They officially admitted that Sir Alexander Hardinge was " sent to India in connection with the Durbar arrangements . " Presently they produced a printed document superseding the previous official but verbal announcement in terms of the Queen-Empress ' health . The original verbal announcement was not denied , but the later printed announcement reads for posterity : " His Majesty the King-Emperor finds the duties and responsibilities which he has undertaken in unexpected circumstances unfortunately make it impossible for him to contemplate a prolonged absence from Great Britain during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made clear that the Coronation Durbar , possible for her , is " impossible for him . " <P> In Court circles it was re-emphasized that Their Majesties have not for years been expected to have more children . Private advices to London firms from their Bombay connections were that the Durbar had almost certainly been canceled on the advice of the Government of India . In preliminary elections under the new Constitution early returns show St. Gandhi 's followers making great gains .
