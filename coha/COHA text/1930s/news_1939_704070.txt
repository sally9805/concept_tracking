txt Europe is headed for a grave new crisis in which Czecho-Slovaks at home and abroad are ready to play a past similar to the one they played in the World War leading to the creation of their nation , Dr. Eduard Benes , former President of Czecho-Slovakia , declared yesterday in an address at a Czecho-Slovak Day celebration in the Trihorough Stadium on Randalls Island . Eighteen-thousand persons , all of them immigrants from Czecho-Slovakia or children of immigrants , cheered Dr. Benes 's call to action , which was broadcast by short wave to Czecho-Slovakia . To his people at home Dr. Benes appealed to " be prepared just as we are and do not permit yourselves to be provoked to irresponsible and premature action . " His address was preceded by a message to the people of CzechoSlovakia by Colonel Vladimir Hurban , Czecho  --  Slovak Minister in Washington , to remain united in their fight to regain independence . 3,000 in Gymnastic Fete After the addresses , 3,000 members of the Sokols , Czecho-Slovak athletic society , presented a program of gymnastics , culminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . Participating in this were men and women in the native costumes of Czechs , Slovaks , Moravians and Carpatho-Russians . A feature of the celebration was a series of native dances . It was the first Sokol celebration attended by Dr. Benes since he was obliged to flee from his country . A year ago , on July 2 , he attended the last mass celebration of the Sokols in Prague . Yesterday he expressed confidence that " a free Czecho-Slovakia in a free Europe " would rise again and that " with this motto of victory we will return to Prague . " The thousands attending the celebration , who came from New York , Chicago , Pittsburgh , Bridgeport and other cities , responded to Dr. Benes and Colonel Hurban with outbursts of cheers and applause revealing unbounded faith in the fullfillment of the promise held out by the two leaders . Declaring the dictatorial governments in Europe were bent not only on the destruction of the small independent States created by the World War , but also upon inflicting death blows upon France and England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronting Europe involved , therefore , not CzechoSlovakia alone but all Europe . Sees 1914 Reduplicated " We find ourselves where we were in 1914 , " he said . " It is the same plan which was defeated by the peace negotiations in 1918 . The Nazi Pan-Germanism is working today toward the same goal as did the Imperial Pan-Germanism of years ago . " That the Czech people ande.their leaders are agreed on this evaluation of the situation was confirmed at the celebration by statements of prominent spokesmen of the CzechoSlovak liberation movement , who declared at least 150,000 Czecho- Slovaks residing abroad were ready to go to France to fight if war became unavoidable . " The events over which we could have no control last year developed further and today every one can see that we were right , " Dr. Benes said . " To my warnings of September , 1938 , I would add only this today : that in all history no dictatorship ever survived more than one generation . The cycle of all dictatorships began with moral collapse , followed by economic difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The European dictatorships are in a critical situation today . Consequences will appear sooner or later , but they will come . We must be prepared for this moment . I emphasize : Europe is headed for a grave crisis . I do not wish to nor can I prophesy what form it will take  --  whether it will be war or a new crisis such as the ? one in September of last year . " Before a real and decisive solution of the entire European problem is forthcoming , it is likely that other States will be sacrificed . What happened in the last war is happening today . Our sacrifice and our suffering awakened the conscience of the world . We see now that our sacrifice has not been in vain . " We know that the CzechoSlovak nation is suffering keenly under the Nazi regime , but we know , too , that the Czecho-Slovak people with our help and your help will endure until truth and freedom triumph .

" " We have consolidated all our efforts here in the United States , in Canada , the British Empire , France , Poland and in Russia , " he said . " At the propitious moment we will form a political directorate which will coordinate our political and , in the event of war , our military action . " Addressing specifically his people at home , Dr. Benes assured them that their compatriots abroad would not halt their efforts to achieve the liberation of their country , and thanked them " for not submitting either to the threats or the promises of our enemy . " Speaking as a Slovak who took part in the first struggle for independence in 1914-18 , Colonel Hurban said the Czechs and Slovaks can now regain their independetice only through close unity .

" " The erman army occupied most of the Slovak territory , which is now being transformed into a military base against Poland , " he declared . " The Germans force the Slovak workers to go to Germany , where they are forced into labor camps and treated as if on military duty . " From this free country we address our words to our brothers abroad in order to strengthen their resistance . Our motto is : Czechs and Slovaks can regain their independence only by working closely side by side . " The Sokol program , In which children of the age of 6 to men and women of 60 participated , was directed by Charles Bednar , supreme commander of the Sokols in the United States . Frank Balek presided . The celebration closed with the tableau , entitled " We Lived and Will Live Again , " the central figure of which was a young woman in white on a pedestal , supported by a dozen young Sokols , holding aloft the torch of liberty .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
