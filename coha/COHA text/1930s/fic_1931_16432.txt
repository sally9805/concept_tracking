Unable to locate it anywhere he pulls out all the drawers , drops to his knees and peers into the opening . With an exclamation he runs out of his room to the room adjacent . The door is closed but not locked and dashes in , his fists clenched .

( tenderly ) Maybe it 's because I love you . . . ( she presses her handkerchief to her eyes ) Remember when I told you that some day you 'd find out you were wrong about me ?

Come along ! Anne commences to pull away , her hand lingering a moment to his . He raises it to stop her . &nbsp; BERT ( with a twisted smile ) Ai n't you forgotten something , Anne ? For just a moment she looks bewildered . Then her wet face breaks into a smile . She raises her hand as if to slap him , but when it reaches his cheek it becomes a caress . Again she clasps him to her . &nbsp; BERT ( whimsically ) Bring on that jail ! FADE OUT . THE END . pp. 86-102 &nbsp;
