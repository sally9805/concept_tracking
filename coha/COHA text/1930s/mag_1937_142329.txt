Sound George VI <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Heartiest Congrats for your excellent story on King George VI . I feel like I know the new monarch 100% better now for which I am deeply grateful after the numerous slurs he has received at the hands of our august press . <P> CHARLES WISE <P> Cincinnati , Ohio Sirs : In your issue of March 8 , you state " George VI is sound in that in which King George V was most sound , and King Edward VIII by no means sound-Character-and so is Her Majesty . " Have n't you drawn your conclusions a little early in the game ? Time will tell . David Windsor is in the forefront of the battle for human rather than property rights , and for the spirit of marriage as opposed to the Letter of the Law . He stands in a symbolic relation to his age , and will influence it as his brother never will . <P> NANCY T. POPE Denver , Colo . <P> Sirs : ... I take exception to your March 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undone , " poor George VI . This is the most uncharacteristic article TIME has carried , approaching fatuity in some of its uncritical assertions . I can not imagine my favorite editors becoming sycophantic , but if that write-up is not a press hand-out from His Majesty 's Bureau of Canterbury Tales , then I am Bumbler Baldwin . Well do I realize that you must depend upon some source for the validity of human-interest reporting , but what proof has TIME that neurologically unstable George VI " today is a better pilot than King Edward ever was ? " Or that he excels the Duke of Windsor in any important way , Character included ? The young Princesses must automatically be excluded , Edward still being a bachelor . Your enumeration of What George Can Do , and does , is not so impressive as the glossed-over fears concerning What George Ca n't Do . <P> His subservience , at any rate , is assured . The photograph , p. 24 , of Matriarch Mary with Queen Elizabeth " well in hand " is the most expressive picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance the devious story of Edward 's unprecedented behavior . In " most vulgar " American , or in any language , that expression on the Queen Mother 's face spells " Meddlesome Interferiority . " My only consolation is that TIME 'S preview has cleared up much of the " Mystery of the Coronation . " If Americans do not boycott the ceremonies , then they deserve the low opinion that Mary , churchy Lucy Baldwin and the Archbishops , and No. 10 Downing Street hold of them . Perhaps TIME 'S able editors were only pulling our legs , after all , by making of the whole bally business a reductio ad absurdum . <P> LINCOLN FISHER , M. D. , F. A. C. S. <P> Mansfield , Ohio <P> Credit to Daughter-in-Law <P> Sirs : <P> In the March 8 issue of TIME , in a story on p. 74 , TIME correctly credits Mrs. Harrison Williams with several accomplishments , including her collection of porcelains , her clothes , her husband . <P> But TIME incorrectly credits her with the authorship of the novel , Bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mona Williams ( Mrs. Henry Meade Williams ) and was reviewed by TIME 'S able reviewer . <P> Author Williams is the daughter-in-law of the late great writer Jesse Lynch Williams . <P> HENRY MEADE WILLIAMS <P> Carmel , Calif.
