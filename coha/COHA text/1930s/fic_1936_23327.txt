PHYSI C A STORY BY WALTER DE LA MARE W ILLIAM had been keeping his mother company in the kitchen . Mary , their staunch cook-general , was out and would not be knocking at the door until half-past ten . After that perhaps there would be another hour to wait , but then Emilia would be alone . Meanwhile , just like a man , William and she would be having supper together at the kitchen table , and William would have an egg with nine bread-and-butter fingers . This , once fortnightly , now weekly , Wednesday night feast had become a kind of ritual , a little secret institution . They called it their covey night . Not even Daddy ever shared it with them ; and it was astonishing what mature grown-up company William became on these occasions . It was as if all in an afternoon he had swallowed one of Jack 's bean seeds and had turned inside into a sort of sagacious second-husband . Naturally therefore , though at times she had to try a good deal , Emilia had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dark boy , William  --  small for his age . A fringe of gilt-edged fair hair thatched a narrow forehead over his small restless eyes . His sister Sallie ( poor gaunt Aunt Sarah whom she had been called after was dead now ) after a rather restless and peevish afternoon and a wailful bath was asleep now upstairs in her crib . You could tell that almost without having to creep out every now and again to listen at the foot of the stairs . William had been even more active and hoppity than usual . They had been playing Beggar-my-neighbor , and somehow every knave in the pack had managed to sidle into his hand . He had become more and more excited ; even though it was Emilia , when they changed the game , who had been twice Old Maid . When supper-time came he had at first all but danced from dresser to table , from table to dresser . They had chosen Mary 's best blue-check kitchen tablecloth ; he had said it looked cooler . " Do n't you think so , Mummie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp shrill remarks and directions to Emilia , who was looking after the cooking in the outer room , a room she had steadfastly refused to call the " scullery " merely because she disliked the word ! Though one day in a sudden moment of inspiration she had defended this priggishness by exclaiming , " Well , spell it with a k and then see what you think of itl " It was a way Emilia had : as tenaciously as she could she always put off until tomorrow even what it was merely difficult to put up with to-day . Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you , was her motto when driven into a corner . She hated problems , crises , and all horrors , though they would sometimes peep up at her out of her mind and from elsewhere when she was n't looking , like rabbits at evening out of a warren . But when they actually came , and had to be faced , well , that was quite another matter . For some minutes now , busied over her pan at the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprightly conversation piped up from the kitchen had been steadily dwindling , had almost ceased . He had preferred his supper egg fried , though " lightly boiled " was the institution . And Emilia had laughed when after long debate he had declared that he had chosen it fried because then it was more indigestible . She was dishing it . up from the sizzling pan  --  a setting sun on a field of snow  --  and with a most delicate edging of scorch . When she reappeared in the kitchen William was standing by the table , gazing across it at the window . Ile could n't be looking out of the window ; for although there was a crevice a few inches wide between the flowered chintz curtains that had been drawn over it , where the blue linen blind had not been pulled down to the very bottom , it was already pitch dark outside . Yet even at this distance she saw that he could n't be looking only at his own reflection . He merely stood , his eyes fixed on this dark glassy patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had not even turned at the sound of her footstep . So far as Emilia 's birdlike heart was concerned it was as if a jay had screeched in a spinney . But best not notice ton much . Do n't put things into people 's heads . " There ! " she exclaimed . " Why , you have cut the bread and butter thick , Mr. Stoic ! l 'm going to have that scrap of cold fish . Eat this while it 's hot , my precious . " But William had continued to wait . " I do n't think , Mother , " he said slowly , as if he were reciting something he had been learning by heart , " I do n't think I 'll have my egg after ail . I do n't think I feel hungry now . " All his eagerness and excitement seemed to have died away into this solemn , almost stagnant reverie . For a child to have the air and appearance of a sorrowful old dwarf was unutterablyfar away from its deliciously pretending to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Emilia . " Why , look , darling , it 's cooked . Look ! Lovely . You would n't know it was n't a tiny half of a peach in cream . Let 's pretend . " " I could n't like even that . Mother , " he said , glancing at it , a slight shudder ending in a decisive shake of the head as he hastily looked away again . " I do n't think I want any supper . " Emilia 's eyes widened . She stood perfectly still a second , the hot plate in her hand , staring at him . Then she put the plate hurriedly down on the table , knelt with incredible quickness beside him , and seized his hand . " That 's what it is , " she said . " You do n't feel very well , William . Your hands are hot . Not sick ? Not sore throat ? Tell Mummie . " " I 'm not ill , " wailed William a little obstinately . " Just because I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I did feel sick , should n't I say so ? That 's only what you say . " He paused as if the utmost caution and precision were imperative , then added , nodding his head a little mournfully and sympathetically in time to the words , " I have got a teeny tiny headache , but I did n't notice it until just now . " His mouth opened in a prodigious yawn , leaving tears in his eyes . " Is n't it funny , Mummie , you ca n't realty see anything out of the window when it 's black like that , yet you need n't look at yourself in the glass . It 's just as if .. . " His eyes came round from examining the window and fixed themselves on her face . " That 's what it is , " said Emilia , raising herself abruptly from the floor . " That 's what it is . " She kept squeezing the thin unresponsive fingers of his hand between her own . " You 're feverish . And I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " And instantly her voice had changed , all vain self-recriminations gone . " I 'll tell you what we 'll do , William . First , I 'll fill a hot water bottle . Then I 'll run up and get the thermometer . And you shall be the doctor . That 's much the best thing . " And she did not even pause for his consent . " I expect you know , Dr. Wilson , " she had begun at once , " it 's something that 's disagreed with my little boy . I expect so . Oh , yes , I expect so . " William , pale and attentive , was faltering . " Well , yes , Mrs. Hadleigh , p'raps , " he said at last , as if his mouth were cram-full of plums , " you may be right . That depends on what he has been eating . " " Yes , yes , I quite understand , doctor . Then would you perhaps wait here just for one moment , while I sec if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , he might like to wash his hands first and brush his hair . And pray keep on your overcoat in case you should feel cold . " She took a large dry turkey towel that was airing on a horse nearby , and draped it over William 's shoulders . " I wo n't be a moment , " she assured him . " Not a moment . " Yet she paused to glance again at his shawled-in pale face and fever-bright eyes , as if by mere looking she could bore clean through his body ; and stooping once more , she pressed her cheek against his and then his hand to her lips . " You said , " half tearfully chanted the little boy , " that I was the doctor ; and now you are kissing me , Mummie ! " " Well , I could often and often kiss lots of doctors , " said his mother , and in a flash she was gone , leaving him alone . She raced up the dark staircase as if she were pursued by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when she came to her bedroom door it was as if everything in it were doing its utmost to reassure her . The shining of the street lamp was quietly dappling the walls with shadow . The whole room seemed oceans deep in silence ; the duskily mounded bed , the glass over the chimney-piece , the glass on the dressing-table , they may until that moment have been conferring together , but now had , as usual , instantly fallen mute , their profound confabulations for the time being over . But she did notpause even so much as to sip of this refreshing stillness . Her finger touched the electric switch , and in an instant the harmless velvety shadows  --  frail leaf-shadows , many of them  --  the peace , the serenity , had clean evaporated . It was as if the silence had been stricken with leprosy , so instantaneous was the unnatural glare . Even in spite of the rose-pink lampshades . For now Emilia was staring indeed . How , she was asking herself , how by any possibility could that striped school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer on to the bedspread ? How by an utter miracle had she failed to see it when she had carried Sallie into the room only an hour or two ago ? Ties do n't wriggle out of top drawers across carpets and climb up valances like serpents in the tropics . Husbands miles away can not charm such things into antics like these ! Mary had been out all the afternoon . She herself had been out for most of it with the children , and she could have vowed , taken her oath , knew , that that could n't have been there when she had come up to put her hat on . In the instant that followed , before even she could insist on raising her eyes from this queer scrap of " evidence , " her mind suddenly discovered that it was dazed and in the utmost confusion . It was as if , like visitors to a gaudy Soho restaurant , a jostling crowd of thoughts and images , recollections , doubts , memories , clues , forebodings , apprehensions , and reiterated stubborn reassurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone again . And at that , at once , as if by instinct and as unforeseeably as a butterfly alights on one out of a multitude of flowers , her stricken glance had encountered her husband 's note . At sight of it her heart had leaped in her body , and then cowered down like a thing smitten with palsy . Novels did things like these , but surely not just ordinary life ! The note had been scribbled on a half-sheet of her own notepaper and just folded into a cocked hat  --  perhaps the only old-fashioned device she had ever known that husband to be capable of . It seemed that she had learned by heart the message it contained before even she had unfolded the paper and read it . Indeed , it did not matter what it had to say . It hardly even mattered how it had said it . So considerately , yet so clumsily and so blastingly . " She " ? that alone was enough . When shells explode why be concerned with fuse or packing ? Edward was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned . She and the children . So far , so inevitably . You can in vile moments of suspicion , incredulity , and terror foresee things like that . Just that he was gone  --  and for good . But to have come stealing back in the afternoon into a vacant house , merely for a few clothes or a little money , and she out , and Mary out ; and the children out  --  and everything else out : well , that seemed a funny , an unnecessary thing to do . " I would n't have so much minded . . . " she began to mutter to herself , and then realized that her body was minding far too much . A thin acid water had come into her mouth . Unlike William , she felt sick and dizzy . She had gone stiff and cold and goose-fleshed all over . It was as if some fiendish hand were clutching her back hair and dragging the scalp from her forehead taut as the parchment of a drum over her eyes . It was as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her knees trembled . Her hands hung down from her arms as though they were useless . And the only thing she could see at this instant was the other woman 's face . But it was n't looking at her  --  on purpose . It was turned three-quarters away  --  a very becoming angle to the long , fair cheekbone , the drooping eyelashes , the feline line of the jaw . Clara . And then suddenly she saw them both together , at a railway station , it seemed , talking close . Or was it that they had just got out of a taxi ? Emilia might as well have been dreaming all this , since although these picturings , this misery , this revulsion ofjealousy , and the horror of what was to come persisted in a hideous activity somewhere in her mind , she herself had refused for the time being to have anything to do with it . There was something infinitely more important that must be done at once , without a moment 's delay . Husbands may go , love turn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of cards ; but children must not be kept waiting , not sick children . She was already clumsily tugging at the tiny middle drawer of the old mirror , one of their first bargains , on the dressing table , and she caught at the same instant a glimpse of the face reflected in its glass : but so instantaneously that the eyelids of the image there appeared to be darkened and shut and , therefore , blind . What a boon a little methodicalness may be . What a mercy that in this world things stay where they are put ; do not hide , deceive , play false , forsake and abandon us . Where she always kept it , there lay the slim metal , sharp-edged case of the thermometer . It was as if it had been faithfully awaiting this very reunion ever since she had seen it last . In the old days , before she was married and had children , even if she had possessed a thermometer , she might have looked for it for hours before discovering it . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity . She hesitated for scarcely the breadth of a sigh at the door , and then with decision switched off the light . Stuffing her husband 's coup de gr &e; into her apron pocket , she flew into the next room , put a match to the fire laid in the hearth , pushed the hot water bottle between the sheets of the bed , and hastened downstairs . Her legs , her body , her hand flitting over the banisters were as light and sure again as if she had never experienced so much as an hour even of mere disappointment in her life . Besides , for some little time now , that body had been habitually told what it had to do . And so long as orders came promptly and concisely it could be trusted to continue to act in the same fashion , to be instantly obedient . That was what being a mother taught you to become , and to try within limits even to teach a young child to become  --  an animated automaton . Dr. Wilson stood where she had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had not even troubled to sit down . He had apparently not even so much as moved his eyes . " Now , Doctor , " said Emilia . At this those eyes first settled on her fingers , then quietly shifted to her face . " You were a long time gone , Mrs. Hadleigh , " he remonstrated . " A very long time . " He took the thermometer and pushed it gingerly into his mouth , shutting his lips firmly over the glass stem . Then his blue and solemn eyes fixed again , and without the faintest stir , he continued to watch his mother , while she in turn watched him . When half a minute had gone by he lifted his eyebrows . She shook her head . In another half minute he himself took the thermometer out of his mouth and , holding it between finger and thumb , gravely scrutinized it under the light . " A hundred and forty-seven , " he announced solemnly . " H 'm . " Then he smiled , a half-secret , half-deprecatory smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadleigh . Nothing at all . It looks to me as if all you did was to worry . Put him to bed ; I will send him round a bottle of very nice medicine  --  very nice medicine . And . . " his voice fell a little fainter , " I 'll look in in the morning . " His eyes had become fixed again , focussed , it seemed , on the faraway . " Mummie , I do wish when Mary pulls down the blinds she would do it to the very bottom . I hate seeing  --  seeing myself in the glass . " But Emilia had not really attended to this rather unreasonable complaint . She herself was now examining the thermometer . She was frowning , adjusting it , frowning again . Then she had said something  --  half-muttered , half-whispered  --  which Dr. Wilson had failed to catch . " I 'd give him , " he began again wearily , " some rice pudding and lemonade and ? " but before the rest of his counsel could be uttered she had wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him back to front so that he could clasp his hands round her neck pickaback ; and next moment he was being whisked up the dark staircase to the blue-and-white nursery . There she slid him gently down beside the fender , took off his shoes , smoothed his hair , and tenderly kissed him . " You have very bright eyes , Dr. Wilson . You must n't let them get too bright  --  just for my sake . " " Not at all , Mrs. Hadleigh , " he parroted , and then suddenly began to shiver . " There , " she said , " now just begin to take off your clothes , my own precious , while I see to the fire . Look , the silly paper has just flared up and gone out  --  though that , Dr. Wilson , should have been done first . But it wo n't be a minute . The sticks are as dry as Guy Fawkes Day . Soon cosy in bed now . " William with unusually stupid fingers was endeavoring to undo his buttons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , " he said , " do your teeth chatter , Mummie , when you are very hot ? That seems funny . And why do faces come in the window , horrid faces ? Is that blind right down to the very bottom ? Because I would like it to be . Oh dear , my head does ache , Munamie . " It was extraordinary with what cleverness and dexterity Emilia 's hands , unlike her son 's , were now doing as they were bidden . The fire , coaxed by a little puffing in lieu of the bellows , in a wondrous sheet of yellow , like crocuses , was now sweeping up the chimney as if to devour the universe . A loose under-blanket had been thrust into the bed , the hot bottle wrapped up in a fleecy old shawl , the coal scuttle had been filled , a second pair of small pajamas had been hung over the fender to air , a saucepan of milk had been stood on the stove with its gas turned low  --  like a circlet of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the fraction of a second , had been tucked up in his bed , one of his own tiny embroidered handkerchiefs sprinkled with lavender water for company . There , he had instantly fallen asleep , though spasmodic jerks of foot or hand and flickering eyelids showed that his small troubles had not wholly been left behind him . So swiftly and mechanically had her activities followed one upon the other that Emilia had only just realized that she was still unable to make up her mind whether to telephone at once to the doctor or to venture  --  to dare  --  to look in on Sallie . Blind fool ! Blind fool ! ? foreseeing plainly every open or half-hidden hint and threat of to-night 's event , smelling it , tasting it , hearing it again and again knocking at the door of her mind , she had yet continually deferred that dreadful moment when she must meet it face to face , challenge and be done with it , and accept its consequences . The mere image in her mind of her husband 's school tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sallie a last and all but insupportable straw . The futility , the cowardice ! What needs most daring must be done instantly . There had not been the least need to debate such a question . You ca n't do twenty-one things at once ! Having stolen another prolonged scrutiny of William 's pale dream-distorted face and dilating nostrils , she hastened into her own bedroom again , groped for the tiny switch pull that dangled by the bed-rail , stooped over the cot beside it and , screening its inmate 's face as much as possible from the glare , looked down and in . The small blonde creature , lovelier and even more delicate to the eye than any flower , had kicked off all its bedclothes , the bright lips were ajar , the cheeks flushed  --  an exquisite coral-red . And the body was breathing almost as fast and shallowly as a cat 's . That children under three years old should talk in their sleep , yes : but with so minute a vocabulary ! Still , all vocabularies are minute for what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sickness , no sore throat ; but headache , lassitude , pains all over the body , shivering attacks and fever  --  you just added up the yes 's and subtracted the not 's ; and influenza , or worse , was the obvious answer . Should she or should she not wheel the cot into Williams room ? Sallie might wake and wake William . Whereas if she remained here and she herself lay down in the night even for so much as an hour  --  and began to think , she would n't be alone , not hopelessly alone . It was the fear of waking either patient that decided the question . She very gently drew blanket and counterpane over Sallie 's nakedness , draped a silk handkerchief over the rose-colored shade , switched on the electric stove in the fireplace , and ran downstairs . There for a few moments , eyes restlessly glancing , she faced the stark dumbness and blindness of the mouthpiece of the telephone . Dr. Wilson was in . Thank heaven for that . Incredible , that was his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hours . He might have had a horde of dispensary patients . But no , he would be round in a few minutes . Thank heaven for that . She put back the receiver with a shuddering sigh of gratitude . All that was now needed  --  superhuman ordeal  --  was just to wait . But this Emilia was to be spared . For midway up the staircase , whose treads now seemed at least twice their usual height , she suddenly paused . Fingers clutching the banister rail , she stood arrested , stock still , icy , constricted . The garden gate had faintly clicked . There could be only one explanation of that  --  at least on a Wednesday . Edward 's few friends and cronies , every one of them , must have discovered long ago that Wednesdays were now his " evenings out , " And she  --  she had n't much fancied friends or company recently . It was he himself then . He had come back . What to do now ? A ghastly revulsion took possession of her , a gnawing ache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nausea , another kind , even , of palpitation . If only she could snatch a few minutes to regain her balance , to prepare herself , to be alone . Consciousness was like the scene of a fair  --  a dream-fair , all distortion , glare , noise , diablerie , and confusion . And before she was even aware of her decision  --  to make use of a deceit , a blind , a mere **28;386;TOOLONG  --  she had found herself in her bedroom again , had somehow with cold and fumbling fingers folded the note into its pretty cocked-hat shape again , and replaced it where she had first set eyes on it , beside the charming little traveling clock , the gift of Aunt Sarah , in the middle of the mantelpiece . What light remained in the room behind the blinded and curtained windows could not possibly have been detectable outside . That was certain . In an instant she was in William 's room once more  --  listening , her heart beating against her ribs like the menacing thumping of a drum . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door had faintly squeaked , the lower edge of the door itself had scraped very gently across the coarse mat within , had as softly and furtively shut . " Is that you , Edward ? " she heard herself very gently and insidiously calling over the banisters from the landing . " How lovely ! You are home early . I did n't expect you for  --  for hours and hours ! " And now she had met and kissed him , full in the light of the hall-lamp . " Why , what 's the matter , darling . .. ? You are ill ! " She was peering as if out of an enormous fog at the narrow , beloved , pallid countenance , the pale lips , the hunted , haunted misery-stricken light-brown eyes in those pits of dark entreaty and despair . " Is it that 's brought you home ? " He continued to stare at her as if , spectacles lost , he were endeavoring to read a little book in very small print and in an unfamiliar language . His mouth opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , and said , " Oh , no ; nothingmuch . A headache . I 'm tired . Where were you ? " " Me ? " But her lips remained faintly , mournfully , sympathetically smiling , her dark eyes were as clear and guileless and empty of reflections as pools of water under the windless blue of the sky . " I was in William 's room . It 's hateful to say it now  --  Edward  --  now that you are so tired yourself  --  but  --  but I 'm rather afraid , poor mite , he 's in for another cold  --  a little chill  --  and I should n't be surprised if Sallie . . ? But do n't worry about that ? because , because there 's nothing of course at all yet to worry about . It 's you I 'm thinking of . You look so dreadfully fagged and  --  what a welcome .. . . There 's nothing . .. ? " Her vocabulary had at last begun to get a little obstinate and inadequate , " You do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy , you know ? " she deliberately laid her hand for an instant on his , " I fancy you may be the least little feverish yourself  --  you too . Well . . " She turned away , flung up a hand as if to flag off a railway-train . " I 'll get you something hot at once . " " And Edward " ? she turned her head over her shoulder , to find him as motionless as she had left him , in almost as stolid and meaningless an attitude as " Dr. Wilson 's " had been in the kitchen , brooding on the nightmare faces in the darkness of the glass . " There is just one thing , if you could manage it . Just in case , would you first wheel Sallie 's cot into William 's room . I 've lighted the fire  --  and I had to ask Dr. Wilson to come . I 'm so dreadfully stupid and anxious , when  --  even when there 's no reason to be . 1.1 The two faces had starkly confronted each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty the hitherto unrevealed characters now inscribed on them . Each of them was investigating the map of a familiar country , but the cartographer must now have sketched it from an unprecedentedly eccentric angle . The next moment she had turned away , leaving him free , at liberty , to dispose of himself  --  and of anything else he might be inclined to . In every family life there are surely potential keepsakes that would be far better destroyed ; and perhaps a moment some time must come . But now .. . When she returned with her tray and its contents  --  a steaming tumbler of milk , a few biscuits , and a decanter containing a little whisky  --  she found him standing beside William 's bedroom fire . He watched her , as with the utmost care , she put down her burden on the little wicker table . " Millie , " he said . " I'm. not sure .. . But , well  --  it was , I suppose , because of William 's being ill that you have n't yet been into  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he had gulped , as if there was some little danger of producing his very heart for her inspection ? " seen this ? " He was holding toward her the unfolded note , and with trembling fingers she found herself actually pretending to read its scribbled lines again . Her face had whitened ; she had begun to despair of herself , conscious beyond everything else  --  the tumult in her mind , the ravaging of her heart  --  that she could hardly endure the mingled miseries , remorse , humiliation in his eyes , in the very tones of his voice , yet listening at the same time to a message of ineffable reassurance : He has not then deceived me again ! At last she had contrived to nod , her chin shaking so stupidly for a while that she could scarcely utter a word . " Yes . I have read it . I put it back . ? . could n't face it when I heard you . The children  --  I had to have time . I 'm sorry , Edward . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an awful , well , revelation ; but I was stupid ; I ought to have seen . . . I did see . But we wo n't , I ca n't go into that now . You are tired , ill ; but you are back ... for the present . " Her eyes had managed at last to glance at him , and then to break away and to keep from weeping . And , as if even in his sleep his usual small tact and wisdomhad not deserted him , William had suddenly flung back his scorching sheet and in a gasping voice was muttering to an unseen listener in some broken unintelligible lingo that yet ended with a sound resembling the word faces . " There , darling , " she answered him , smoothing back his fair fringe from his forehead , " I know . They are gone , all gone now ; and the blind is down  --  to its very last inch . " She stayed watching him , could n't look back just yet . " You see , Millie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain ? " that is , we had arranged to meet . It 's hopeless to attempt to say anything more just now . . . I waited . She did n't come ! " " I see . And so ? " " Millie , Millie . It was n't , it was n't you . Oh , I ca n't bear it any longer . If I had dreamed  --  the children ! " He had flung himself into a pretty round basket chair and sat shuddering , his face hidden in his lean bloodless hands . The few minute sounds in the room , the peevish creakings of the chair , William 's rapid , snoring breathing , the fluttering of the fire , were interrupted by the noise of brakes and wheels rasping to a standstill in the street below . A brisk yet cautious knocking had followed , awakening its echo it seemed in the very hollow of her breast bone . " Look , " she said , " that 's where that goes . There 's no time now . " The scrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conjuring trick , had been instantly devoured by the voracious flames , had thinned to an exquisitely delicate fluttering ash , and then , as if with a sudden impulse , wafted itself out of sight like a tiny toy balloon into the sooty vacancy of the chimney . " Listen . Must you see the doctor , tonight ? Unless it 's not  --  you know  --  well , bad ' flu ? Would n't it be better not ? I 'll tell him . I could find out . I could say you had gone to bed . Quick , I must go . " Every nerve in her body was clamoring for motion , action , something to face , something to do . He nodded . " And you 'll come back ? " " Yes . . . I 'll try . Oh , Edward , if only there were words to say it . It must have been awful  --  awful ! " She hesitated , gazing at his bent head , the familiar hands . .. . And now the doctor , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned to whatever fate might bring , and having carefully wiped the thermometer on the clean huckaback towel Emilia had handed him , was stuffing his stethoscope back into his little black bag . An almost passionate admiration filled her breast at his assured , unhurried movements , and with it a sort of mute , remote , all-reconciling amusement to see how closely , deep within , behind these gestures , and the careful choice of words , he resembled his small solemn understudy , William . She was returning earnestly glance for glance , intently observant of every tiny change of expression in his dark , clear-cut , decisive face , of timbre in his voice . Practically every one of the hungered-for , familiar , foreseen , all-satisfying assurances  --  like a tiny flock of innocent sheep pattering through a gateway  --  had been uttered and sagaciously nodded to ! ? " It may be just a feverish attack ; it might , it might be ' flu . " " Do n't forget , Mrs. Hadleigh , they are down one moment and up the next ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night , almost at once , and some powders . " " I 'll look in again first thing in the morning . " Then he had paused , little black bag in hand , his eyes fixed on the fire . Some day , she told herself , she must retaliate in kind : " You must understand , Dr. Wilson , that at this juncture it would be utterly useless and stupid of you to breathe the word pneumonia , which takes weeks and weeks and weeks , may easily be fatal ; and one has just to wait for the crisis . " Or , " Do n't be mistaken , Dr. Wilson , even if you were at death 's door yourself I should n't hesitate to ring you up if their temperatures got over 103 " ? that kind of thing . " You know , Mrs. Hadleigh , " he was beginning again , " it just beats me why you mothers , quite rational , sensible , almost cynically practical creatures some of you , simply wear yourselves out with worry and anxiety when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite uselessly . Getting thin and haggard , wasting away , losing all that precious youth and beauty . I say I often think these things  --  wish I could express them . You simply refuse to heed the lesson in life  --  that really great Englishman 's , Mr. Asquith 's  --  Wait and see : condensing , do n't you see , and not squandering all energy , impulse , and reserves . ' Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you . ' Is n't that good sense . It 's what 's called an old wives ' saying of course . Not a mother 's mind youl But I could have saved dozens of precious lives and bodies and all but souls , if only .. . well , literally saved them , I mean , a deuce of a lot of wear and tear . " She was drinking in his words , this delicious lecture , these scoldings , devouring them , as if they were manna dipped in honey , the waters of life . They were a rest and peace beyond expression . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flock like a shepherd . Yea , though I walk . . . Why all this Bible ? Dr. Wilson was not a parson ; he was just a doctor . And then another Dr. Wilson had piped up in memory again , " You said that I was the doctor ; and now you are kissing me , Mummiel " " I could often and often kiss lots of doctors ! " " I know , I know , " she heard herself meekly assuring him , " I 'm utterly stupid about these things . And of course if we were all sensible savages or gypsies there would n't be . . . Oh , but you ca n't think what a comfort it is to be  --  to be reassured . " He was eyeing her now more closely , totting up and subtracting yes 's and not 's , it seemed , on his own account , and on hers . It was with difficulty she met the straight clear scrutiny . " Well , there we are , " he decided . " Just look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish for ! Gypsies be dashed . There are , I assure you , Mrs. Hadleigh , spinsters galore in this parish who .. . How 's your husband ? " Her dark shining eyes had now at last quivered in their sockets , if only for the fraction of a second . " It sounds very silly , " the words were squeezing out like cooing turtle doves through too narrow an exit , " but he 's not very well either . It 's , it 's almost funny , ridiculous . All at once . Is n't it ? He came home rather late from , from the office , and he 's gone to bed . " It seemed a pity that one 's cheeks should flatly refuse not to flame up when one 's eyes were hard as brass . " The fact is , Dr. Wilson , he refused to see you . You know what men are . But could it be , do you think " ? a little nod toward William 's bed has helped her out , " that too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drily , a scarcely perceptible forking frown between his eyebrows , " it might very well be that too . But listen , Mrs. Hadleigh . II usbands of course are not really of much importance  --  not really . Necessi , tics ; but here to-day and gone to-morrow . Children are what the kernel is to the nut ; the innermost part of it . And so must be taken great care of . Therefore ? and this is not advice ; this is orders : forbid you to worry ; forbid it . I shall throw up the easel If you must stay up ? you have a maid , a good solid stolid one too . Wake her up and chance it ; she 'll love you all the better . And you can share the night between you . Otherwise ? unless of course you need me again , and you wo n't , though I should be easily handy  --  you are riot only not to worry ( more than you can help ) but you are on no account to get up more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our patients , mind you . It 's bad for them , worse for you . When they 've had their dose they 'll soon quieten down unless I 'm wrong . And I sometimes am . " He was holding out his hand , a look of unadulterated , generous , wholly masculine admiration on his vigilant , assured features . " By gad ! " he said . " Ali threel But then you know I know what you can manage when hard pressed . So that 's all right . " He was plunging downstairs into the night , and Emilia was trying in vain to keep up with him . " And after the first dose and the powders , Dr. Wilson , I should n't , I suppose , wake either of them up to give them any more medicine  --  until the morning ? " " As a general rule , Mrs. Hadleigh , " replied the doctor , carefully putting on his hat and glancing as he did so at the strip of looking-glass in the stand , " it 's wiser never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even doctor 's physic .
