Mirabai , better known as Miss Madeleine Slade , St. Gandhi 's caretaker and most devoted disciple , who came out of prison fortnight ago , gave her first Press interview last week . Everyone knows that she , a tall , grave woman with a gentle voice and a delicate , jet-black mustache , was the daughter of Admiral Sir Edmond John Warre Slade ; that she gave up a position in British society for which she does not seem particularly suited to seek spiritual peace caring for the Mahatma . Until last week she never told her own story : <P> " I was reared in luxury and ease . I had a splendid education , travelled widely , danced , had pretty clothes , lovely jewels , many admirers . But I lacked spiritual satisfaction and real contentment , and I decided that life was an empty sham . <P> " ... I began to seek light . I found it when I met Remain Holland , the great French philosopher . He advised me if I wanted to do the utmost good in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland and for a year lived in seclusion with the poorest Swiss peasants . I studied spinning and weaving , I familiarized myself with Hindustani . I read all Mahatma Gandhi 's works . . . . Then I came to India , landing at Bombay where many years previously I had been a social butterfly . <P> " . . . In Mahatma Gandhi I felt I ... had met my parent . ... It was like finding something that I had lost . . . . The political side of Gandhi is the least part of him . As a moral teacher and reformer the world has not known his equal since Buddha and Christ . He made no attempt to convert me from Christianity . I am not an orthodox Hindu . The Mahatma did not baptize me or immerse me in the holy Ganges , as has been reported . Gandhi hates conversion and believes that all religions are good . " <P> Her Hindu name , she explained , comes from Mira , a Rajput Princess who gave up her position to become a worshipper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also called Mirabehn , which means Sister Mira.
