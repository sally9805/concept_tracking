txt Heads of principal railroads were asked by Federal Coordinator Eastman to give " serious consideration " to the fact that more than half of the steam locomotives now in service are over 20 years old , that locomotive repairs and fuel constitute a substantial proportion of the total cost of operation and that these items are most directly affected by the age and design of motive power . The Eastman comments were based on a study of steam locomotives which showed that class 1 railroads as of October 1 , 1933 , owned 51,425 steam locomotives of all types . Mr. Eastman said there was " startling variations " in depreciation calculation for locomotives among the carriers . He said 23 years were calculated as the life of a locomotive in one instance , 54 in another and 48 in a third instance . In many instances depreciation charges have been inadequate . A large proportion of the roads , Mr. Eastman said , have evinced a desire to adjust these ' charges by writing off the deficiency as a charge to profit and loss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement of units " The Eastman study showed that the oldest locomotive studied was built in 1865 and that the company owning it has it scheduled for repairs in 1938 when it will be 7r years old . More than 53 , / , - of all locomotives or 27,598 , are 21 years or more of age . Of this number 6,696 , or about 1i are scheduled for retirement by the end of 1938 , the report showed . In the year ended September 30 , 1933 , 10,120 steam locomotives made no mileage . Including in this number were 2,110 units held for sale or scrap .
