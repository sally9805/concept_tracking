txt Eyes bulged today when proceedings in Common Pleas Court disclosed that Ellen J. Ackerman , mysterious little old woman in black bombazine , had left more than $200,000 in and around her weatherbeaten house at 70 Elm Street when she died there on the night of Nov. 21 . A fortune in gold coins , old goldback notes , government certificates , mortgages and Home Owners Loan certificates was found . in tin cans and tin boxes in various parts of the gloomy mansion by Surrogate J. Blauvelt Hopper ; Ronald Hopper , his deputy , and Miss Lillian Galbraith , deputy inheritance tax supervisor . From the tin cans , a trunk and boxes in the kitchen cupboard the investigators took seventeen bank books showing total credits of $60 , - 000 , most of them in New ' York banks such as the Bowery Savings , East . River Savings , Greenwich Savings and Union Square Savings . They found $1,469 in paper currency , $555 in gold coins and $2.39 in pennies . The other holdings were bonds and mortgages . Thirty relatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already have presented claims to the fortune and a legal battle is in prospect . So far as any one knows , Mrs. Ackerman left no will . Clarence Vreeland , an undertaker , tried to persuade her to make a will three years ago when she arranged for her burial , but apparently she ignored his advice . James D. Moore , Bergen County inheritance tax supervisor , was appointed by Judge J. Wallace Leyden in Orphans Court this morning to serve as temporary administrator to conserve the estate , pending final disposition . The appointment was opposed by Darwin Lord of 69 De Witt Street . Hackensack , a third cousin of the woman . Few persons In Elm Street knew1 that Mrs. Ackerman was rich , though many legends had grown up about her in the half-century she had occupied the two-story and attic frame house , surrounded by neatly clipped lawns . Most West- wood people thought she was poverty-stricken . At night she sat in the cavernous house with only oil lamps to punctuate the gloom . She draw her water from a creaking well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no modern heat in Winter ? just an old pot-bellied stove . The floors were innocent of carpets and the walls were bare of pictures : Here and there the wallpaper bulged away from the walls . Mrs. Ackerman was 88 years old when she died . She was born in Tappan , N. Y. , the daughter of Jacob Blauvelt and Jane Moore Blauvelt . Her family moved to Westwood when she was almost 40 . She was married at the time , but her husband , Peter Ackerman , died forty years ago . Second Husband Vanished : There was a second marriage ten years later , but it lasted only a short time . Joseph Gerlach , the second husband , just vanished from the picture and , so far as any one in Westwood knows , never was seen or heard from again . No one even knows if he is alive . Mrs. Ackerman 's mother died in the Elm Street house about twentyfive years ago , wand from that time on the little white-haired woman became known as the mysterious recluse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and few persons crossed her threshold . Even after her mother died she continued as organist of the old Baptist Church , but when the Rev. George Decker , the minister , died about twenty years ago , she never went back to the organ loft , and seldom , if ever , attended chui1h services . Once in a while , on Summer or Autumn nights , a few of the nearby neighbors would hear the melancholy sound of hymns issuing from the gloomy house , but that ended long ago . Mrs. Ackerman stayed behind her tightly locked shutters with the shades drawn , in a world of her own . Broke Barrier Only Once . Just once , a few years ago , she reached out into the world around her . She stopped two little girls as they were passing her door and invited them in . She led them down the bare-walled corridors to the darkened living room that contained only her old piano . It was spotless and its mahogany case glistened . Astonished neighbors paused in awe as the hollow rooms echoed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-forgotten hymns to gentle chords awakened by withered fingers . When she had her fill , the little old woman led the children up stairs and opened an old trunk . " You have been sweet to me , " she said , " and I am going to give you some of my pretty things . " From among her treasures she selected two empty perfume bottles , probably the gift of some suitor long dead . She held them to the weak light that struggled through the shutters to show their color . She gave them to the little girls and they went away . Their visit was the first social call , and the last , that the neighbors could recall . In late years the tiny old woman in rusty black ( she never bought new dresses ) became too feeble to appear in the street . Five years ago she was stricken with appendicitis and was taken to Hackensack Hospital . When she had recovered from the operation she was taken to the home of Darwin Lord to recuperate . John Murchen and his Wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ackerman dwelling ; helped her in recent years . Every morning Mr. Murchen , who is close to 60 , would work the creaking winch and draw a bucket of water for his neighbor , and his wife would cook her meals . Mrs. Ackerman paid 50 cents for each meal , but on nights when her appetite was poor she would call across the lawn , from behind the I shutters , that she wished no food . She did not pay for meals She did not eat , even though they were already cooked . She was not miserly , though . If she heard of a family In need she would Send coal or food . Her one passion , the Murchens learned , was crullers . She would send out for them or , if she was able , would don her bombazine and totter down the street , her silver hair glinting in the sun , and buy them herself . She had bought a dozen ' the day she died . When Mr. Murchen drew the water for her next day and entered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear her stirring . He found her dead in her room . The doctor said death was caused by a heart attack . The Murchens think it was the crullers . Only six were left when they looked in the larder .
