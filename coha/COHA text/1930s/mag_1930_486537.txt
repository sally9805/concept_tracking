IT is imagined that in the magazine world as well as in the vegetable it is always evident when the year declines towards its end . The preparation of the January magazine , the slumber extraordinary , which is to appear in the December holidays , at the time of the making of presents , is held to be very exhausting to editor and publisher , and the December issues  --  or rather those of mid-Novemier  --  ate usually held to be , in consequence , far feebler than common . This , however , we take to be a mistaken view , and arises , we imagine , from popular comparison of the magazine in possession with the prospective magazine with its heralded list of famous names  --  names which , as a matter of fact , very commonly cover magazine matter which is no better than the general run of periodical literature , and often is not so good . It may be the proverbial blindness of authors to the relative merits of their various works ; or it may be their easy good nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it may be for some reason so discreditable as carelessness of their own reputation and of the interests of literature , provided only money may be had ; but , for whatever reason , it is certainly true that both here and in England men of eminence can be got to sell to the publishers , more especially at the time of the New Year Magazines and Annuals , and to accept excessive pay for them , productions which often seem the mere sweepings and leavings of their portfolios and study-tables . Oftener , per-Imps , they sell productions not quite so bad as that , but still far below the level at which it becomes men of eminence to remain , and , too , far below the level at which it is profitable for the rest of us that they should remain . It is , of course , their names that they sell ; or , at all events , their names is what the publishers buy , and the quality of the goods purchased very frequently appears to show that the seller knew very well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , as we think we have observed , that despite the great noise which ushers in the first magazines of the year , these are not in the average better than the other numbers , and thus it happens that the December numbers are popularly pronounced weak . It IS not that the preparations for January induce mental and spiritual exhaustion in the editor ; primarily , the evil has its root  --  in ourselves , that we are such persons as greedily to buy cheap stuff if it have a dear brand on it ; and , secondarily , in the publisher , who takes advantage of this weakness of ours , and in the poets and essayists and statesmen and divines , and celebrated persons generally , who are not above pocketing money in a transaction which they can hardly hold in high estimation . The December magazines are on the whole readable , though there is in them hardly any work of the first class  --  if we except Mr. Howells 's essay and Mrs. Stowe 's story in the Atlantic . The former , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a work of the first class . It is marked by all Mr. Howells 's subtlety and delicacy of humor and fancy , and it is careful and finished in point of expression , as is sure to be the case with the work of this writer , who is not a writer to whose example any author will ever refer when the question comes before him of selling his name with some crude or trivial writing attached . A humorist of a decidedly different sort , as respects either subtlety or delicacy or finish , is Mr. Ralph Keeler , who writes " The Confessions of a Patent Medicine Man " ? a promising subject , but here treated in an unskilful way . The mixture of narrator and the subject sketched is unpleasantly obvious ; and the subjective humor of the writer adds nothing to the effect produced by such glimpses as we get of the really grotesque creature whose portrait he had an opportunity of painting . Some of the stories told are amusing , and probably there is little or nothing false in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsily elaborate and elaborately clumsy " Rudolph " ? an essay which appears to be an attempted satire on the system of education which crams the heads of children with more knowledge than is good for them . Such a sketch , if not based on fact , is nothing ; and , if based on fact , it would require affidavits for its support , and only then could it be anything more than a disagreeable literary failure . Other humorous pieces in the Atlantic  --  which , as it happens , is largely made up of articles falling under this general description  --  are Mr. W. J. Stillman 's " John Bull at Feed , " and the " Oldtown Fireside Story , " by Mrs. Stowe . Mr. Stillman 's essay is not particularly new , but it is pleasant reading of its well-known kind ; and whatever may be thought of some of its assertions by the admirers of French cooking and the Franco-American cooking of this city  --  where , Philadelphians and San Franciscans to the contrary notwithstanding , it is alone in America possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its main doctrines are worthy of all acceptation , and that it would be well if they could be urgently preached in all our borders . Competent observers testify of the American woman in her highest state of development , that her most cherished notion of dinner is to have some flowers on the table , and an elegant dinner service . Some form of pork , hot bread , strong coffee , no flowers on the table , and something sweet and indigestible , is the notion of a dinner entertained by vast numbers of both the women and the men of that portion of the American population which is less developed ; while in many parts of the country there is an uneasy feeling , perhaps derived from our Puritan ancestors , that there is something disgraceful in eating at all , and dinner is looked upon as a necessary but regrettable recognition of the domination of Satan over man , while man is yet confined in the corrupt house of this body . For one reason or another , although American water , earth , and air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dinner might here be glorified , there are nowhere in the world forty millions of souls who feed so wastefully and dine so little as the people of the United States . Moral causes are doubtless at the bottom of it . There is surely no geographical reason for this peculiarity of ours . Across the imaginary line that separates us from our Provincial friends , there is dining ? dining as solid , substantial , leisurely , earnest , dignified , and productive of robust men and women , as in London itself . Perhaps , even as German immigration is teaching us how to drink , the Canadians , when General Butler and Mr. Chandler have " enticed " them over  --  as the mate said when he hit the sailor with the handspike  --  may teach us Christian habits of eating . Mrs. Stowe 's sketch is admirable , and adds one more to the proofs that her best purely literary reputation she has earned in the field of close sympathetic observation and successful reproduction of distinctively New England life . In literary history her place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book more opportune than " Uncle Tom 's Cabin , " and whether or not it will long be much read or much admired , it will never cease to be spoken of as long as American slavery is remembered . And as long as Byron 's story is talked about , Mrs. Stowe has a second security against oblivion settling on her name . But when the enlightened New Zealander comes and seats himself on London Bridge , to survey the ruins of Saint Paul 's , if he has the means of making a comparative estimate of Mrs. Stowe 's various works , we are mistaken if he does not hold that her best title to admiration is not the opportune Uncle Tom , despite Aunt Ophelia and Topsy , nor the pieces of poetry , nor the prophetic swamp negro , nor the argumentation in the Byron case , but the singularly successful picture , instinct with genuine life , of the shiftless , handy , good-natured , lazy Sam Lawson , who deserves a place beside Mr. Birdafredum Sawin , though with his opinion as to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the will rather than the moral sentiment that has fallen into decay in the genus of New Englanders of which Sam Lawson is the type , and he will doubtless die on the Plymouth Platform with his " mind clear " as any deacon 's on points of doctrine , and a prayer at his funeral as comforting to his relict as she could desire . For the rest the Atlantic has the conclusion of Mr. Henry James 's story called " Travelling Companions . " It is clever and interesting , and Mr. James 's usual inscrutable young woman suggests agreeably the better sort of American young ladies . We do not find , however , that the direct effort at putting her before us succeeds in doing so . The love-making dialogue , in particular , is highly extraordinary , and Miss Evans would be justified , we should say , in breaking her engagement on her arrival among her friends in New Jersey , though her self-dissecting , criticising , mystery-making lover may very likely , as is the natural fashion of such , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Blumhardt 's Prayerful Hotel " is a fairly good description of a curious community of enthusiasts , not unlike our Spiritualists as regards the reasonableness of their faith . " A Virginian in New England " is interesting , though certainly not exciting ; it gives one a very favorable impression of the diarist , and gives us , we confess , a little chill by the picture it presents of the Massachusetts life of thirty-five years since . " Indian Summer " is to be commended for its truth of detail , for its good feeling , and its accuracy of observation , and will , by reason of these good qualities , give pleasure . In our own case , the pleasure was a little marred by the lack of vraisemblance in the incident upon which the story hinges . The poetry of the number is by Mr. Whittier and Miss Larcom , and the book-notices are numerous and good , except that of Mr. Arthur Helps 's last publication , which yet has a good deal of truth in it . Scribner 's Monthly has a prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become the favorite magazine of great numbers of people . That being the case , it is much to be wished that it should be kept free from such things as the poetry of the " Honest Fairy Story . " It is , of course , not so bad as the verses which opened the last number  --  they constituted a glaring offence against good manners , and even against common decency . But there is an inherent vulgarity in such things as these verses , with their accompanying illustrations , which also is demoralizing in its way , and a thing to be regretted . The piece entitled " Love 's Young Dream " is less objectionable , but it will do no one any good . The first article of Scribner 's is an illustrated paper on " The Street Venders of New York , " and will be of interest both inside and outside of this city , as it gives some account of odd occupations pursued by a strange class of persons , who are striking figures in the panorama of New York ? street-life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known  --  persons such as the balloon-seller , the chestnut vender , the armless man in Park Row , who whittles with a knife held between his toes , the tooth-powder man , and the Siempro vire seller . The second paper is a compilation ( illustrated ) of narratives of remarkable escapes effected by jail-birds or other prisoners , and is of a kind to be popular . So , we suppose , is Mrs. Harding Davis 's " Natasqua ; " it is like all her other work , and that , if not so well liked as at first , still finds numerous readers . Other articles in this number of the magazine are a good moralizing of an old monkish legend , by H. II . ; a " Thanksgiving Love Story , " of a good-natured sort , by Mr. E. Eggleston ; an instalment of George Macdonald 's serial novel ; a readable enough description of Berlin ; a rather noisy essay by Mr. Samuel Hopkins , who knocks the Pope about fearfully , and has a bang or two for Francis Joseph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of the Hoosac Tunnel ; and some other matter , including Mr. Welford 's Bookbuyer letter from London . About the most noticeable thing in Old and New nowadays is the way in which the editor continues to make , from month to month , his one or two jokes upon the words " old " and " new . " It begins to be something like watching a man on a dangerous tight-rope , whose effort may every time be successful , or may at any time be fatal failure , and who gives the spectator rather more pain by his danger and his profitless dexterity than his skill can give pleasure . The other contributors and contributions to the December Old and New are Dr. Bellows ( " Natural and Revealed Religion " ) ; Dr. J. F. Clarke ( " Wanted , a Statesman " ) ; a translation of a rather feeble essay ( " The Four Gospels " ) by Sainte-Beuve ; " The Improvisatore and the Heeler , " by Mr. F. W. Loring , a young writer of promise , who , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who might very profitably study methods more realistic ; " Jefferson 's Rip Van Winkle , " which is too eulogistic in tone ; and more of " Pink and White Tyranny , " which may be much enjoyed by homely young ladies as doing full justice to that silliness passing the silliness of woman which female novelists sometimes discover in young ladies whom dazzled and stupid man thinks pretty . " The Dying Gladiator " is an essay worth reading , written by Mr. Theodore Lyman , who sums up the arguments and theories as to the nationality and character of the man represented by the celebrated figure , and , after deciding it to be a Gaul , goes into some ethnological speculations which at least are not wanting in dash . " Athens and her Enemies " is some spirited verse by Mr. William Everett ; and this , with some pretty stanzas by Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney , and some more by " H. H. , " who can , when she likes , be sibyllic enough to be extremely puzzling to the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah Ying " we must mention as some readable talk , by a man who appears to know his subject , about the Chinese merchants of San Francisco . Honorable and able men he asserts them to be , and of rather better mercantile standing in California than an equal number of traders of any other nationality. ? Lippincott 's for December is as good a number of this magazine as we have ever seen . The first article tells a strange story about a certain Southern gentleman who occupied the curious position of being known by influential Southerners and influential Northerners to be in the service of the rebels as a messenger , if not a spy , at the same time that he was the Southern correspondent of a loyal Northern newspaper . He went South and North as pleased him , always provided with necessary credentials , and while , as we have said , known in his double capacity to some officials and officers on both sides , to most he was known as the devoted adherent of the side to which they themselves belonged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story may be , although from the manner of relation we are disposed to accord it full belief . It is tantalizingly told , with suppression of real names  --  a necessary precaution , perhaps , though one would think that , except in a few cases , the writer might have disregarded it . It would , for instance , be counted for glory , we fear , rather than for shame , to the Northern editor who hired our rebel friend as correspondent . Another readable article is the lively description of the new Florida the winter resort of invalids . The soil , climate , flowers , birds , beasts , reptiles , and insects , the writer takes up in turn , and as lie has well seen what lie is writing about , and is in apparently high spirits , and is well contented with himself , and is not afraid of a bad joke  --  though he certainly very well might be  --  be has succeeded in making a bright , entertaining , cheerful article , which we suppose may be useful to such invalids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who do . Here , for instance , are some comically well-selected adjectives : " A cage full of paroquets is a comical sight ; they are perpetually quarrelling  --  cursing and swearing at a great rate . " And here is something about the mocking-bird which everybody may believe who likes : " The bird is , however , considered rather a dissipated character , and sets a bad example to the young people . I have always thought that a young man who can sing well is in great danger of falling into bad company , and is likely to acquire wild habits ; and this bird is a case in point . He forages about , singing in his neighbor 's vineyard while he robs him , until the berries of the Pride-of-China tree are ripe , and then he proceeds to have a regular frolic , acquires a habit of intoxication , and gets as drunk as a lord . It is curious to see a flock of these birds at this time . They become perfectly tipsy , and fly round in the most comical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all sorts of songs , and interrupting each other in the most impudent manner , without any regard to the politeness and decorum that usually mark the intercourse of all well-bred society , whether of birds or men . They will fly about promiscuously , intrude on domestic relations , forget the way home . and get into each other 's nests and families , just like the lords of creation . After the berries are all gone and the yearly frolic is over , they look very penitent , make many good resolutions , join the temperance society , and never indulge again until the next season comes round and the berries are ripe once more . " I do not think that naturalists have noticed this peculiarity , and I have the honor of calling their attention to my interesting contribution to natural history . I believe that this habit is peculiar to birds that sing , just as wine and song go together among men . It is only another proof that wine is a mocker . " Solider articles are that by Mr. E. A. Pollard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects of the South , and who writes in a better and more mature style than is usual with him  --  and that by Mr. Amasa Walker , entitled " Expansion and Contraction . " Mr. Walker is of opinion that the action of Congress , in relation to the currency , has been such that resumption of specie payment by the Government and the banks " must be regarded as indefinitely postponed ; " and he adds that , on account of this action , the United States would seem to be willing that they should be rated financially with Austria and Russia , the condition of whose currency " has been their disgrace for half a century . " He adds further , however , that " while saying this we do not admit for a moment that the people of this country acquiesce in such a decision of this great question . " He apparently expects something from the next Congress , or more probably , perhaps , from the Congress that shall come together after the next Presidential election . ' Among the other contents of Lippincott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford  --  having in it some small quantity of " chrysophrase " and the like , but , on the whole , written really well , and containing some of the least objectionable of " word-painting " and of that " intensity " of feeling which is to true strength of feeling what hysterics are to high athletic training . " Louis " is the title of the story , and it may , we think , be enjoyed by people whom much of its clever author 's previous work has affected unpleasantly . " The Appian Way " is a charadevistially smooth , and correct , and verbose set of stanzas , by Mr. T. B. Read . " Cacoethes Scribendi " is another lore-story with a certain perfectly common and perfectly likable rawness and artlessness which it will doubtless please good-natured people to read . " Our Monthly Gossip " has some talk about Gottschalk which will interest musical readers ; a pro-French discussion of the German policy of annexation ; some reminiscences of the once famous Nicholas Biddle , who , it appears , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of the condition induced by hashish , and a eulogy , by " Oujda , " on Colonel Pemberton , an English officer killed at Sedan , who , according to most accounts of him , deserved better of his fellow-creatures in Philadelphia and elsewhere than to be written down as " my friend , the author of The Scapegoat , ' " by one of the west shameless and corrupting of contemporary female writers . The Galaxy , in taking leaye of the old year , promises for the new year a number of articles on Americanisms of speech ( Mr. Grant White ) , which can not fail to have value ; a series of sketches of life and adventure by " Porte Crayon* " ( Col. D. H. Strother ) , whose pen and pencil are favorably known to old readers of harper 's Weekly ; a novel by Mrs. Edwards ; more of the " Memoranda " of " Mark Twain , " and more of the contributions to American history , made by men who have helped to make our recent history , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of these contributions , some of the pleasantest have been those made by Mr. Thurlow Weed , who in this December instalment of his reminiscences is especially agreeable and readable . Without doubt , his " Autobiography of Mr. Thurlow Weed " will do much , in virtue of its frankness and straightforwardness and modesty , to keep his memory sweet ; it can hardly fail to persuade into a good opinion of hint many persons who have hitherto thought of him as of a mere manipulator of New York politicians . The Galaxy has , besides , an interesting narrative of a visit to the domain of a Prussian nobleman living in feudal state in Silesia ; a clever lady 's description of Wilhelmshiffie ; an essay entitled " Shakespeare as a Plagiarist , " by Mrs. Abby Richardson , who writes with intelligence ; some chapters of Colonel De Forest 's " Overland , " and of Mr. Justin McCarthy 's " Lady Judith ; " two clever , sensible , and witty essays by " Philip Quilibet , " who writes of the Franco German war ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself by laughing at one of the very British critics who disapproves of the American tourist as he appears in " The Innocents Abroad ; " and a forcible plea for international copyright , by Mr. Charles Astor Bristed , who shows us how , and with what effect , we steal books from foreign authors . There are also in the Galaxy the usual number of book-notices and brief essays under the head of " Nebulae ; " and altogether the magazine well sustains its reputation as being our best magazine for light reading of current interest . The Overland Monthly for December has , for its most noticeable article , another of Mr. Bret Harte 's poems ? " His Answer to ' Her Letter . ' " ? which will hardly be as popular as most of its predecessors , though it has their characteristic marks of local Californian color , humorous perception of character and sentimentality . It might , by the way , be worth while to know how it has happened that the cockney use of the relative pronoun " which " obtains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the idioms , vulgar and otherwise , of all lands ; but we should imagine that most Eastern readers not saturated with Mrs. Gamp would find lines such as these that follow striking strangely on his ear : " Being asked by an intimate party Which the same I would term as a friend ? Which his health it were vain to call hearty , Since the mind to deceit it might lend . " Of really good articles in the Overland for this month , one of the best is a careful one by Mr. Charles W. Stoddard , who is known to some of our readers as a ; skilful verse-maker and a poet worth some attention . " A Canoe Cruise in the Coral Sea " is the title of it . Good , too , is the historical sketch of Mr. Robert J. Walker 's Administration in Kansas , and that of the Red River Country and its people . The attention of all careful readers of Mr. Froude 's " History of England " should be given to the current number of the Catholic World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous , more candid in tone than is usual in the case of semi-polemical controversy , and seemingly conclusive , which attacks Mr. Froude for something worse than what at the best is gross carelessness . The article has been preceded by others equally worthy of study , and is to be followed by still others which may very probably be of still further discouragement to the pictorial and partisan school of history-makers . Most of the other matter in the Catholic World will be equally edifying to the Romanists and to the Protestant reader , it being of the Catholico-arguinentative order as'regards logical method , and the subject-matter being such as is generally left to religious disputants . In Harper 's we have Mr. Curtis in a graceful , kind , and sensible essay , written apropos of the so sadly timely and untimely death of the late Fitz Hugh Ludlow ; also , on " The Perils of Political Life ; " Mr. M. D. Conway , in the last of his curiously learned papers , entitled " The Sacred Flora ; " halfa-dozen illustrated articles of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Literary , " " Scientific , " and " Historical Records , " followed by the stories of the " Editor 's Drawer " ? making altogether the typical American magazine , and one of which we need not be ashamed ; although its existence as it is need not prevent its from indulging , in respect of magazines also , our American belief in an indefinitely better future in store for us . HOLIDAY BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG.  - -  - III. * Tam animals talked about in " Curious Facts for Little People " are the mole , badger , otter , deer , dog , sheep , horse , birds , dolphin , and whale , with a capital illustration for each . The stories are fresh and attractive , and told in simple language as well as printed in bold type ; and the book is altogether a handsome and appropriate gift for a little child . " John Whopper " began his mendacity , we believe , in Old and Nets. , and though in the magazine the story was apparently designed for adult readers , it can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual product of a grown man , or as the amusement of men and women , the performance is slight enough ; but school-boys and girls may possibly enjoy the fancy of a newsboy 's trips through the earth 's centre to the antipodes of Boston  --  to Canton in China  --  his passage through the earth 's axis to the North Pole , and subsequent voyage home on an iceberg . A certain local flavor is given to these adventures which will make them rather more interesting to read in the circle of which the Boston Transcript forms the centre than elsewhere . But the fiction is too purposeless to find enduring favor , we apprehend , even in those limits among the young . As to Mrs. Samuels 's success as a writer for children , there will hardly be two opinions among the little folks themselves . The six books which form her " Springdale Stories " will be found interesting by all children , from the youngest who can read at all up to boys and girls of twelve or fourteen years ; and two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " Netta 's Trial , " and " Johnstone 's Farm "  - -  might be read aloud by parents to still younger ones , and found entertaining by both readers and listeners . And that , we suppose , is as much as saying that the books have plenty of incident , very little moralizing , no mock sentiment , and are written in what the author calls " readable English , " which is not over the heads of the audience . The children , too , whose adventures are related , though we are not going to praise them for their naturalness , are yet quite sufficiently like real boys and girls to make a personal interest in them quite possible . Whether , however , the account of all the " hairbreadth ' stapes " that Mrs. Samuels puts her little heroes and heroines through  --  one of them , a boy of twelve or thirteen , goes down in a diving . bell , saves a baby from a burning house when all the adult firemen are afraid to venture , sets a prairie on fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others have adventures nearly as thrilling  --  whether , we say , so much exciting reading will not make anything short of a sensational novel pall hereafter on the children 's tastes , is a question which parents might do well to take into consideration . The books are certainly more interesting than children 's books are apt to be , and that they are so is due to the easy simplicity of the narrative and the rapid succession of striking incidents . That they are not over-probable incidents nor particularly natural characters to whom they occur , are defects which will be likely to trouble adult readers more than the little ones  --  and we suppose , too , that it is not at all to the detriment of the latter that the good children in these stories are once in awhile almost too good for this There is nothing to be urged against the " Fairy-Folk Series " on the score of its exciting character ; and children being , whether fortunately or not we do not pretend to decide , so willing to read or listen to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibly give pleasure to such of them as have nothing better to measure them by . They are tolerably dull , however , and show on the part of their authors a commonplace effort to be imaginative , and a desire to be perfectly decorous , and a willingness to adapt themselves to the supposed capacity of their readers , which is a rather melancholy indication that writing children 's books is not the precise work for which nature intended them . " On the Seas " is an English book , the scene of which is , however , laid in the first place in " New York , the greatest merchant city in the United States of America , " where the father of its hero , Captain Griffin , has a " handsome house in the Broadway . " It is not a bad story of adventure in the Arctic seas , written with a certain old-fashioned simplicity of manner , and boys of twelve and upwards might find it interesting reading . Very much better than it , however , and for readers about the same age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian gold diggings . Mr. Locker seems to understand his audience better , and to respect both them and himself more than is often the case with people who write for boys . His incidents are exciting without being unhealthily so ; and , with every temptation and facility for heightening his effects by means of the horrible , he never tells a cruel story , keeps himself well within the bounds of probability , and writes with a pleasant straightforwardness which will do his readers good . It is a book which may safely be put into the hands of boys , which is true of very few of the books written expressly for them . We being judge , as much could by no means be said of Mrs. Wood 's " Orville College Boys . " As a picture of school-boy life it seems to us to be worse than worthless ; and the only moral it would be likely to suggest to readers of any age is , that a little less Christian forbearance , and a little more manly assertion of his authority and his claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , the persecuted German master , would have been much better for all parties concerned . This is the book , too , which Mr. Hope , the amusing author of the " Book about Boys , " criticised as having been written in a " peculiar dialect , based upon English " a criticism which any page taken at random more than justifies . We can not number the years since our first reading of William Howitt 's " Jack of the Mill , " but it was long ago , and we are glad to see the story revived , finding our pleasant recollections of it confirmed on reperusal . It is not beyond criticism , as an artistic narration , but that will not injure it in the opinion of its proper readers . It is written , as it clearly shows , pretty much as it was told by the fireside , being , as the preface describes it , a " hatch-up " ? that is , a tale invented as the author went along , and therefore unnecessarily ( though we think agreeably ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercised imagination , This is especially true of the first part , which only after repeated tellings , perhaps , was linked with a more serious design than pure entertainment . As it is , it is a semi-historical novel , relating to the persecutions of the Lollards and the wars of the Hussites , under Ziska , and inculcating religious freedom also by examples of Jewish fidelity and humanity . The portraiture of Old England in those days , both in its scenery and in its social and political condition , is calculated to leave truthful and lasting impressions , while the romantic adventures of the hero are , if our own experience is a test , sure to be vividly remembered beyond the age of childhood .
