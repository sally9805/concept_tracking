It 's Hitting the Luxury Trades i FIRST knew Lina as Miss Holmquist 's little sister . For years Miss Holmquist has been teller at the Farmers ' National Bank back home , and has occupied the second floor of the Hanson house , just south of the old Lutheran church . She calls her rooms " my flat , " and takes . ( Inlet pride in their neatness and respectability . Miss Holmquist was one of the older children in a big family living on a prairie homestead eight or ten miles west of town . Her brothers wanted her to stay on the farm and " help out . " But Miss Holmquist escaped to town and the business college , and justified her daring by becoming teller in the Farmers ' National . Lina must be twenty years Younger than her energetic sister . When I first saw her , perhaps ten years ago , she was a blonde , rather graceful youngster ; putting out fresh pens and blot ? ters on the customers ' desk in the bank . Miss Holm-. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I want you should know my little sister . She 's come in from the farm to live with me . She 's in second year High , and she 's doing fine . " Even at fourteen , the " little sister " was beautiful in a still , arresting way . I remember thinking how different she was from plain , dumpy Miss Holm ? quist , and Miss Holmquist thought so , too . The ' older sister liked to talk about Lina to all her acquaintances , and to the girl herself . " She 's too good for common things , " she used to say . " With her looks and her brains she belongs in Chicago . . I would n't be surprised if she went on to New York some day and got a fine job there . " I think she turned the girl 's head with such notions . Lina be ? came restless and critical and her schoolmates con ? sidered her " stuck up . " Even after my parents moved out to the Coast and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 11Y from Miss Holmquist , for the Farmers ' Na- tilonal. handles such small business matters as I still have in the Middle West . Last winter Miss Holm ? quist sent me her sister 's address and urged me , as She had many times before , to " look her up . " She vrote , " She 's with a splendid firm , and her flat must bv 1. e , 1 ? vely . " It was quite a good address , just east - Fifth Avenue , not far from Washington Square . . - uriotis , I called on Lina , and after that I dropped otoften for " Kaffee " on my way home from the ' ace . I never met Sam . Stein , Lina , I learned , began her New York career with in , Fink and KaCan , as secreta to Sam Fink. a in Bhry c her were p two years at the state university , ' Year in a secretarial college , three years ' experi- truce in a Chicago department store , where she be- t'an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11'hecame private secretary to the manager . " I learned a lot in that store , " Lina once told me . " That was where I got the difference between an import and a copy . And I got interested in furni. , ture and early American things . " Armed with credentials from the university and the manager , Lina made her attack on New York the summer she was twenty-five . She was tall and slim , with the pink and gold coloring , the low , pretty voice , the quiet composure of her Scandi ? navian ancestry . A deft way with clothes and hair had somehow been part of her always , and she had , as she said , learned a lot in Chicago . An employ ? ment agency sent her to Stein , Fink and Kaplan . Sam took one look at her blonde loveliness , the poise and careful grooming that he mentally ticketed " class , " and declared she : would " do . " Two years later , Lina gave up her position and moved from her boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick house on the edge of Greenwich Village . Lina loved her apartment . She had a well trained maid to do the actual housework , and with Sam 's generosity and her own leisure and taste , she made the place charming as well as " different . " Serenely disregarding Sam 's puzzled arguments in favor of " class " and the shouting advertisements of " nineteen-thirty furnishings " she bought time-mellowed cherry and maple and apple wood , old prints , pieces of hand-woven linen and satiny pew- ter and ruby glass . She even found the faded por ? trait of a primly smiling New England lady to hang over the narrow white mantle , and a benign old gentleman to look down on the drop-leaf table at the other end of the room . Perhaps it was her sense of her own insecurity , always carefully hidden even from herself , that made Lina surround herself with these symbols of a more stable age . Once in a while Sam had Lina " throw a party . " They were always rather noisy affairs , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canapes , than a " swell " dinner , followed by more drinks and dancing that soon became frank and rather maudlin petting . Sam included in these par ? ties a few of his business acquaintances and their " girl friends . " Lina 's parties apparently " went , " though she never made any effort to " keep things ? , , moving . She drank sparingly of Sam 's florid cock ? tails and stiff gin highballs , and remained quiet and friendly and serene , however " rough " the party became . " Look at her ? ai n't she the princess ? " Sam would gloat , and " the boys " never failed to ao-ree . " You might think she was a cold proposition , " Sam was apt to , go on , " but I 'm the one to tell you you 're all wrong ? " and a wink or nudge would give point to his confidences . " I hate him when he 's like that , " Lina told me . Lina herself often puzzled over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sam , that she loved him , though she appreciated in. him virtues that were hidden from most people under his noisy vulgarities . She had worked hard those two years with Stein , Fink and Kaplan ? evenings , Saturday afternoons , whenever she was needed . Her sister , her teachers , her employers had told her that that was the way to get on . She had climbed , in her five years of wage earning , from eighteen to forty dollars a week , from a back hall bedroom , two floors away from the bathroom , to " sunny front room ; semi-private bath . " She had not , for all her hard work , gained the well appointed home for which she yearned , the suave , knowing dresses and hats and " little things . " Nowhere in sight was there any leisure or security . Various young clerks and bookkeepers had tried to initiate her into the joys of " heavy petting , " and had even suggested matrimony , but none of them offered her more than a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after office hours . For all her hard work Lina seemed , at twenty-seven , as far from what she wanted as she was the day she left the farm . And then Sam made his " proposition , " not without imagination and delicacy , praising her beauty , referring sadly to Momma 's indifference and lack of understanding , showing her the " slick duplex " he had found , offering her clothes , an allowance , whatever she wanted . They had not been bad years . Momma and the children and the vast complexity of their relatives and connections remained unreal and remote . Her life with Sam was pleasant enough and very com ? fortable . And then , suddenly , it was all over . Stein , Fink and Kaplan have skirted the rocks for months . Things did not pick up in April , and at last it became clear that there was going to be no " fall revival . " Sam talked to Lina endlessly about " business " and " the times , " " God , sweetie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to spill it to , I 'd go bugs . " It was on one of those sharp , late October days , when the papers were at last putting unemployment and hard times on the front page , that Sam finally told Lina " the game was up . " He had his duty to Momma and the children , he explained , laboriously . Both the girls are in expensive finishing schools , and Sam , Junior , is a sophomore at Dartmouth . The family was going to have to get along with two maids for a while , he said , and only one car . Mom , ma had given up her opera seats . Momma was being fine . So were the children . And he hoped Lina understood . . . . Once the break was made , Sam seemed relieved . Lina told herself that it was having the financial burden eased a little , but she was not sure . After all her indifference , she found herself needing Sam 's // clumsy devotion , reaching toward it , feeling lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam was suddenly and completely " through . " There were no histrionics and no scenes . He had decided on " the best thing . " Whatever pain or regret his course entailed , he was going through with it , and he was absorbed in the practical details that had to be " wound up . " He quickly disposed of the lease to a broker . A greasy young man came and eyed Lina 's treasures coldly , did some rapid figuring in a soiled little notebook , told her " I 'll make the old man a price on the outfit . . . . " Even some of her clothes went , her mink coat , her Fortuni wrap , her silver-fox scarf , the Vionnet suit she had scarcely worn . Of course , they were really Sam 's things , but she had never thought of them that way . I received one day a letter from Miss Holmquist : I am so worried about Lina . Would it be imposing on you to ask you to go around and see her ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she has written of seeing you . Perhaps she has only been over ? working and needs a rest . But I ca n't help worrying . Her letter does not sound natural . Miss Holmquist enclosed the incoherent little note : Sometimes I feel as though I had never been alive before . I did n't know anything could hurt like things hurt now . Times are bad . Everyone is half crazY here . They are working themselves to death , the ones that have jobs , and the rest are worrying themselves to death over having nothing to do . Everything makes you sick . Anyone who knows the Holmquist breed would have been upset by such a letter from Lina . I thought perhaps one of Sam 's cocktails had hit at last , and Lina had written her sister when she was half drunk . I had not heard , of course , that she and Sam had " broken off . " I went at once to see her . I found Lina in her denuded living room . It was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford the luxury of Lina and the duplex , but the furniture had been taken away , the hangings were folded and wrapped in brown paper ' Lina 's baggage was ready for the drayman . Lina herself was walking , white lipped , dry eyed , thr ? 11gh the dismantled rooms . She said : have " You have n't come to say ' I told you so , you ? I suppose Selma got you to come . .. " " She was worried about you . Your letter , Y ? know . " " I was dumb to send it . I knew I was at the d to time . Maybe I should have called you . I ha den say something to somebody . " Then in a slid rush of words she added , " It was such a sweet home Sam and I , we were so easy and comfort ch able together . I guess things do n't matter filu to men . Oh , what 's the use . . . " December 17 , 1930 THE NEW " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " Sam has always been generous and I have put money by , enough to keep me going all winter , if I am careful . I imagine I can get a job when things Pick up . I used to be a good secretary , if I do say it . And Sam will fix up letters for me . He offered , and I guess it 's all right to take that much from him now . I suppose I ought to be thankful I am so well off . Do you remember Peggy Newton , that little red-haired girl you met here one afternoon ? O'Neal 's turned her off , and in two years with him she has n't saved one penny . He 's been open handed with her , too . She was here this morning , trying to borrow a few dollars . She ca n't get a job , with things 8 the way they are .
