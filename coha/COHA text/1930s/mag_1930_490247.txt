IT seems to us that all the suggestions , Presidential and other , for making the dry laws work overlook the one factor which would insure success . If the Government really wants to prohibit , all it has to do is to bribe the enforcement officers . The suggestion is not impracticable . Let the United States , with a fine gesture , give up three or four new cruisers , say , and for a starter put the money into a bribe fund . The Drys might be willing to contribute out of their own pockets or they could collect pennies from school children , just as pennies used to be gathered to build a battleship with . The AntiSaloon League might have ideas of its own on how these things are done . All seized liquor could he exported and sold abroad , or even auctioned at home , the proceeds to go into the fund ton . Of course the bootleggers would keep on trying and that would make it a revolving fund . The bribes could be distributed among the enforcers through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deducting its income tax from the bribes , possibly to be added to the bribe fund . The plan is really very simple , compared with the way things are now . EVERY year , for about twenty-five years , the Ohio Society has held a banquet in the Waldorf . To such a society , the annual banquet is an affair solemn and inevitable , an affair almost religious . This year we were movedto speculate on what would happen to the Ohio Society , now the Waldorf is gone  --  where would they turn for accommodations after all these years ? " Annual banquet ? " they said , answering our query . " Why , there will be no annual banquet . There is no Waldorf , and there will be no banquet " Somehow , applying this news to banquets in general , it seemed to us a rather cheerful little item . Maybe the Waldorf has n't toppled in vain . PARROT fever is the latest and most amusing example of the national hypochondria . Newspapers , playing up bizarre items , have a neat way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall , several years ago , the case of a boy who was bitten by a shark in a creek near Matawan . That summer the papers carried stories every day about how the Gulf Stream was shifting and bringing shoals of sharks to New Jersey beaches . One hardly dared take a tub in the privacy of one 's own bathroom . A little later a man died from anthrax poisoning , supposed to have been caused by an unsterilized shaving brush . Everybody took to boiling shaving brushes  --  boiled the living daylights out of them . When Mrs. Morgan died , cases of sleeping sickness suddenly cropped up all over the country , and anybody developing a headache would seem to recall having been bitten by a fly , and a tsetse fly at that . Then there was the icebox scare  --  the mysterious gas emanating from electric refrigerators in the dead of night . There have been hundreds of national menaces , keeping us all on tenterhooks , keeping the populace feeling the national pulse and applying the national stethoscope . Psittacosis is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably happen will be that some reporter will invent a disease traceable to something that happens to everybody : " Otis heart " from riding in elevators , maybe , or " corn-flakes itch " from eating breakfast food , and we 'll all die of autosuggestion . WE were arrested fast week for the sins of Daisy , who was without a muzzle when she met Patrolman Porco , badge No. 10020 , in front of 1 Fifth Avenue . Patrolman Porco had a summons book in his hand , and no eye for Daisy 's blandishments . Next morning we paid a two-dollar fine in the Third District Magistrate 's Court , Second Avenue and Second Street , after waiting two hours and fifteen minutes . The fine was for leading a dog without a muzzle , in violation of the Sanitary Code . We take this opportunity to point out to William McAdoo , Patrolman Porco , Magistrate Dodge , and the clerk of the court , that while we were waiting in court to answer the charge , four garbage cans on the    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
