Soccer is somewhat to England what baseball is to the U. S.-the most popular professional sport . Last week , while 23-year-old Joe Di Maggio was demanding more than the $25,000 offered him to play baseball for less than six months this year , British soccer players were engaged in a British version of the American holdout . With businesslike dignity they demanded that their minimum wage be raised from 4 to 5 ( $25 ) a week and their maximum from 8 to 9 ( $45 ) . <P> For his 8 a week , a top-notch British soccer professional is expected to play two bruising games a week for eight months of the year , is traded from one club to another ( sometimes for as much as 10,000 ) , may be a hero to 90,000 cheering spectators but can hope for nothing more than his standardized weekly wage .
