SIX of the eleven counties in which Circuit Judge Cordell Hull held court in Tennessee do not contain a railroad . The judge himself saw his first train of ears when be was seventeen years old and a lumberjack riding a timber raft on the Cumberland River to Nashville . The next year he was bark as a raft pilot , a job which carried such an aura of prestige that no office he has held since has given Mr. Hull a greater sense of well-being . Three or four years thereafter , the ex-raft pilot was in Nashville again , the youngest member of the Tennessee Legislature . On his return from the Spanish-American War , with a reputation as the best company commander and the best poker player in the Fourth Tennessee Infantry , the voters changed CaptaM Hull 's title to judge . Resigning from the bench in 1906 , Cordell Hull went to Congress as a representative , then as a United States senator , then into Mr. Roosevelt 's Cabinet as Secretary of State . But in Tennessee he is still " Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his court , Judge Hull was reading in his room at the little county-seat hotel when an elderly , plainly dressed mountain woman presented herself . " I see you do n't know me , do you , Judge Hull ? " " No , ma'am , " said the judge . " I do n't believe I have that pleasure . But wo n't you come in and take a chair ? " The old lady asked Judge Hull if he had ever heard his father tell of the time the Yankee bushwhacker shot him during the Civil War . The episode forms a legend in that part of Tennessee . Cordell Hull replied merely that his father had told him the story . And did he tell about the woman who helped him into her cabin and nursed him till lie was fit to travel ? " Judge Hull said that his father had told of the woman who had saved his life . " Well , " said the caller , " I am that woman . And , Judge Hull , 1 cm the mother of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I got left . If that jury convicts him and you fine him . he 'll go to jail and I 'll go to the poorhouse . " Judge Hull walked to a window and looked out , drawing slowly on his cigar . " Madam , " at length he said , " after my father recovered from his wounds , did he reimburse you ? " " Yes . He gave me a hundred dollars . " It was a generous reward  --  as much money as many a mountain family in those days was likely to see in a year . " Well , " said Judge Hull . " possibly my father considered a hundred dollars adequate recompense . But his son owes you a debt as yet undischarged . I want to give you something on it . " He handed the woman a hundred dollars . That afternoon her son was found guilty . Judge Hull sentenced him to pay a fine of fifty dollars . To chart the rise of Cordell Hull , it is unnecessary , however , to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Mr. Roosevelt made him Secretary of State , Hull was inconspicuous enough for the announcement to create surprise and nimble corrections of prophecy by the experts who had been sure that a " big " name would head the Cabinet ; John W. Davis , Al Smith and Owen D. Young being among the guesses . Not that Cordell Hull was then unknown . In Congress , where he had spent twenty-four years , he enjoyed the highest reputation , though not a , reputation which had seeped very far into the country . Hull was an authority on the tariff and on taxation , subjects not readily susceptible of one-syllable dramatization . Nor is Hull a master of the arts of build-up and of ballyhoo by which nearly any topic may be popularized . He is no orator , but a scholar , earthy and self-taught . He dislikes crowds , formal functions and official falderal . His manner is quiet , his appearance distinguished in a homely way , and genuinely captivating . Hull 's is a typical mountain build . Without standing very straight , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cumberland idiom , and as lean as a fence rail . He uses two languages , English and the hill vernacular , preferring the latter . Like his speech , his movements are deliberate , but not awkward . The easy grace of them , like the high cheekbones and the brooding , reflective , dark eyes , may be a heritage of the Cherokee Indian blood in his veins ; and anyone familiar with Indians respects Cherokee blood . Cordell Hull is easy to approach , but not easy to know . Yet , despite a reputation as a silent recluse , place him in a small congenial company , where he can throw a long leg over the arm of a chair , and he is quite a conversationalist , though one who seldom speaks of himself . A man who has known Hull a quarter of a century learned only lately that he had been a soldier in Cuba . In Mr. Hull 's eyes , one of the hardships of life in the State Department is the custom of wearing a coat and vest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as Secretary of State , the experts explained their miscarriages of prophecy by saying , " Another office boy . " The conclusion seemed difficult to refute . In a Cabinet not of first distinction , Mr. Hull seemed a statesmanlike counterpart of The Invisible Man . Today the prestige of Cordell Hull is the highest in the Cabinet . Those who do not think this quite true in the United States grant that it holds in the remainder of the world , where the prestige of the Secretary of State , who is our minister of foreign affairs , is most useful . Yet one can count on his fingers the secretaries , from Thomas Jefferson ( Iowa , who have enjoyed that prestige to the extent that Mr. Hull enjoys it now , and have left enough fingers to converse with the deaf and dumb . . A Free Trader in fiction WITHWITH party nominations not much more than a couple of political light-years away , a good many crystal gazers think they can spot the nomineeto-be in a list of ten . And on nearly every list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him first  --  even realistic Hull partisans , who within recent weeks have begun silent spade work looking toward 1940 . But they think the tide for him is rising faster than for anyone else . They point to the fact that Mr. Hull was runner-up for the Nobel peace award for 1937 , which went to Viscount Cecil , of England , and to the announcement that Great Britain has consented to enter negotiations for a reciprocal trade treaty , lowering tariffs now in effect between the United States and the United Kingdom . Already Mr. Hull has made trade treaties with sixteen nations , working salient changes in the pattern of world commerce . The adhesion of Great Britain , our largest customer , to Mr. Hull 's philosophy of fewer trade restrictions between nations would be the most significant event . in world trade in a generation . Though the parley may be tedious and the bargaining spirited , neither Washington nor London doubts that a treaty will be signed , probably about next June . Nor have Mr. Hull 's adherents here or in Latin America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors for peace . But whether this happens or not , unmistakably , Cordell Hull has shown an ability to climb in the public esteem , which is exceptional among the phenomena of New Deal men and measures . Exceptional , for instance , in this respect : Mr. Hull 's emergence has added nothing to the public debt , which is something that can not he said for that of Mr. Wallace , Mr. Ickes , Mr. Hopkins , and so on . You could lose the whole State Department in one corner of a PWA project . Its largest unit , the Trade Agreements Division , through which Mr. Hull negotiates his commercial treaties , has only eighty persons on the pay roll . Another thing about the rise of Hull is that he started below scratch . Almost his first spot , in the public eye came through a public humiliation at the hands of the President , and the report that Mr. hull would resign . Friends say he came near resigning . The contretemps occurred in connection with the World Monetary and Economic Conference in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pristine days of the New Deal . In the comet-crowded heavens above Washington , one 's eye met the streaking glare of General Johnson , Rexford Tugwell , Messrs . Berle , Tatissig , Peek , Sprague and the commodity-dollar professors . The State Department had its bright particular star in the person of Prof. Raymond Moley , the titular Assistant Secretary . He had the President 's ear and wore a path to the White House door . His press conferences were numerously attended , those of Mr. Hull slenderly so , because the pickings were poor . Professor Moley confessed to being a nationalist , which seemed to place him in accord with General Johnson 's NRA , Mr. Wallace 's AAA , Mr. Ickes ' PWA and the commodity-dollar economists ' isolationist experiments . Cordell Hull confessed to nothing and criticized nothing , though a record of twenty-four studious years in Congress identified him as an old-fashioned free trader . He believed that healthy and enduring recovery could come to the United States only as it should come to the world ; and that this could be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hampered the free flow of commerce from one part of the earth to another . The London Program QINCE the war , Mr. Li Hull had watched those walls go higher and higher , brick by brick . He saw a fear-crazed world strangling itself . and inveighed against the consequences . Few listened . Reporters on the hill heat avoided the tall , white-haired semi-tor from Tennessee who seemed to have but one string to his bow . " War , thar and ev'rywhar , " he 'd declaim , lapsing comfortably into the mountain dialect , " these bar-riers ? " A newspaperman nicknamed him Old I-Far-Thar-andEv'rywhar . While the brilliance of Professor Moley flooded the landscape about the State Department , an observer with an eye for the minute might have discerned that Old H'arT har-and-Ev ' ry wh a r had not ? forsaken his creed . The Secretary 's mild brown eyes had fallen upon the looming London conference . He sketched a program : ( 1 ) the United States to join in some form of international currency stabilization , so that traders could enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound or a franc would be worth the same when a contract . was performed as when it was made ; ( 2 ) tariff walls to be sealed down . The President apparently agreeing to this formula , Mr. Hull hopefully crossed the ocean . Before the representatives of sixty-six nations , the American Secretary of State made his proposals . Discussions had not ( Continued on Paso 31 ) progressed far when it became the duty of Mr. Hull again to address the assembly . The ordinarily tranquil lines of the Tennessean 's lean face were taut .. Upon few American statesmen has devolved a task more unexpected or more humiliating than Cordell Hull 's reading of a wireless message from President Roosevelt repudiating to the core the proposition his Secretary of State had laid before the conference . Blandly Mr. Roosevelt declined to stabilize the dollar in terms of gold . America would go its way alone , and the rest of creation was privileged to do the same . Not only Cordell Hull was nonplused by that wireless . The conference was stunned . Its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard to mutter " that person , " meaning the President of the United States . Guido , Tung , of Italy , and Georges Bonnet , of France , sputtered about Roosevelt 's going back on his word . All agreed that so long as currencies continued to gyrate , discussion of the tariff would be futile . Barriers would remain  --  here , there and everywhere . The conference seemed on the rocks . Nor was the position of Cordell Hull rendered more enviable when Professor Moley bounced into London , squired by that dynamic master of publicity , Herbert Bayard Swope . Instead of joining the American delegation at Claridge 's Hotel , the professor put up at our embassy . He received the press , mingled with foreign statesmen and began addressing cables to the President , critical of Cordell Hull . In the last particular , Professor Moley 's frankness appears to have been encouraged by a misconception of the telegraph arrangements . Seemingly , the Assistant Secretary thought his messages were coded and sent from the embassy . Instead , they were sent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their spicy context leaked to Mr. Hull . Crumbs From a Conference Table In hot water with the spokesmen for the gold-standard nations , presently Professor Moley sought to consult the Secretary . He found him leaving the hotel to attend a garden party at Ludy Astor 's . " Mr. Secretary , what shall we do ? " We shall do nothing , " was Cordell Hull 's unruffled reply . " You may do as you please . " Professor Moley caught a steamer for home . That Mr. Roosevelt 's radiogram did not dissolve the conference in bewildered and bitter chaos is due to Cordell Hull , who remained . He pleaded with the delegates not to return to their peoples without having accomplished " something . " He indicated a dozen points of international friction susceptible of amelioration . For twenty-three more days the conferees labored . Much of their toil was over pretty small beer  --  mere face-saving . But anything was better than a bust-up . Much of Mr. Hull 's effort was directed toward deflecting world criticism from the President , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards against him , the homely mannered American departed from London one of the big men of a conference to which sixty-six nations had aimed to send their best . Just before the Secretary landed in New York , Professor Moley was transferred to the Department of Justice . After a talk with the President at Hyde Park , Mr. Hull told reporters that he would not resign . A little later the professor retired from official life , the first of the prodigious New Deal morning-glories to fade . A few months after his return from London , Secretary Hull was on the high seas again , rolling down past Rio to the Seventh International Conference of American States at Montevideo , Uruguay . Until the last moment he had been urged not to go . Our participation in previous Pan-American get-togethers had not been crowned with distinguished success . This time , with Cuba on a powder-stained rampage and talk of intervention in the air , with other of our Latin neighbors critical and suspicious , the chances of doing any good seemed so slim that the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preserve his dignity , and let . State Department understrappers take the rap . When Cordell Hull said " No , " a disturbed Administration outlined a program of amiable and innocuous inaction . The American delegation was to avoid controversial issues such as the tariff , but it might safely champion an intercontinental highway for motorcars and wax eloquent over the need for brighter beacons to illuminate the Pan-American air routes . Writing under the eyes of their statesmen , South American journalists prepared the atmosphere for Mr. Hull 's reception . A cartoon in a Buenos Aires newspaper , not notable for its hospitality to the United States , bore the caption , Wrie WILL BELL , THE CAT ? The drawing exhibited Secretary Hull , in the lineaments of a great eat , seizing with his forepaws two mice labeled Cuba and Mexico , while other defenseless little rodents , representing the rest of Latin-America , looked on , terrified . The United States emissaries moved into the Parque Hotel . Before trunks were unpacked , the Secretary disappeared for several hours . Asked where ho had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the clothes in which he had stepped from the steamer , and attended only by Jimmie Dunn , of the State Department staff , as interpreter , the Secretary had set out on foot for the other hotels . Unannounced , the American diplomat would rap on a door and present a card which was inscribed simply : CORDELL HULL . The heads of a good many delegations were not in their suites . In such cases Mr. Hull talked to whoever was on hand . One chief of delegation was taking a bath , another dining . We are all away from home , " Hull would say , shaking hands ; " some of us , like myself , pretty far away . I just dropped in to get acquainted . " Though Mr. Hull understands a lit-le Spanish , wh hill he learned long ago in Cuba , lie dues not attempt to speak it .. Yet his tote-fi-t6tes have au intimate quality . ' ' I have just come from that conference in London , " was the burden of his remarks . " We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My hope is that we people of the Americas may do better . want you to tell me what the United States can do to help  --  to help its to have peace over here , and then prosperity . I want to say , for my own part , that the United States is not going to send any marines to Cuba . We are going to take our marines out of Haiti , as we have already done from Nicaragua . I want to go home and tell your friends in the United States that we have done something to help our merchants and our farmers to exchange the things which you have and we want . for the things we have and you want . " As casually as that did Cordell Hull interpret by amendment instructions concerning the taboo on essentials . The Secretary 's hearers , of course , did not know this ; which was fortunate , their astonishment already being as much as the traffic would bear . The representative of the Colossus of the North paying the first call ! Mr. Hull 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , any time there is anything you wish to take up with me , just telephone my hotel room and be right over . " The Secretary " dropped in " on President Terra , of Uruguay . The courtly Latin alluded to the pleasure it would give him to see Mr. Hull at his right hand at the formal dinner the Uruguayan executive planned for the visiting dignitaries . " Not at your right hand , Your Excellency , " protested Cordell Hull . " That chair belongs to the ranking secretary of state at this meeting . " The rank of a secretary of state is determined by the date of his a ppointwent . Mr. Hull insisted on the rule which placed him near the foot of the table . The sessions had not been long tinder way when a Cuban exploded on the subject . of intervention . A Haitian commended the sentiments expressed . The eyes of the representatives of twenty-one nations turned toward the American delegation . When it seemed clear that Mr. Hull did not intend to reply , a Colombian delegate arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stated the facts , adding that the only time his North American confrere , Sefior Hull , had intervened in Cuba was in 159.8 , when he had fought to make that island free . Linking Two Jimericas Presently , Sefior Hull was working hand in glove with Carlos Saavedra . Lamas , Foreign Minister of Argentina , and perhaps the most influential of South American statesmen  --  able , crafty , and hitherto no friend of the United States . Hull went along with one of the Argentine 's pet projects , and in return gained the support of that potent personage for Hull 's pet project of knocking holes in the tariff walls . Unanimously , a msolution was adopted praying for the abandonment of " economic conflict " by breaking down hindrances to trade through reciprocal treaties . On this note the conference adjourned , with the chief American delegate far and away the most popular figure ; a celebrated Argentine journalist writing , " Mr. hull tore down traditions which for the past fifty years have separated Latin America from Anglo-Saxon America sowing fears and grudges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated his conquest of Latin-American hearts at the Conference for the Maintenance of Peace in Buenos Aires in 193G . Hardly a week passes lint an item in the news attests the bond between the Americas , as in November , when President Vargas , on establishing a dictatorship in Brazil , ? rebuffed the totalitarians across the Atlantic with the declaration that friendship for the United States remained the ruling consideration of Brazilian foreign policy . That was a change from 1933 , when a large part of Latin-America was veering toward the orbit of Europe . Instead of scolding his Secretary of State for stopping outside of instructions at Montevideo , Mr. Roosevelt did an unusual thing . With the Administration still committed to isolationist experiments , ho fell in with the ideas expressed in the world-minded Bull 's Montevideo resolution so far as to ask Congress for authority to negotiate trade treaties . This was punctually granted in the Trade Agreements Act , which , in the hands of Cordell Hull , has become , in three and half years ' time , the keystone of our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panorama of world affairs . ( Con educed on Papa 33 ) ( Can tinned from Poi ? 31 Hull 's grand object is to preserve peace and to achieve prosperity through-out the world by giving trade among nations a chance to thrive . His formula comprehends , the whittling down of barriers against trade  --  here , there and everywhere . His method is to say to a country , " We will lower our du ties on such-and-such items , which you have and we need , if you will lower them on such-and-such items which we have and you need . " Hull does not stop there . When concessions are granted to a nation by direct negotiation , they are made to apply to all other countries as well . And when a nation grants us specific concessions , it binds itself to admit all our exports on the same basis as the exports of the most favored nation with which it has commercial relations . In direct negotiation with France we lower the duty on champagne , say . Automatically , this concession is granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France admits our automobiles , say , on even terms with the automobiles of any other nation . In this way the influence of treaties made with sixteen nations to date is felt throughout some seventy nations with which we have trade relations . Has this been a good or a bad thing for the United States ? Since the tariff has always been a controversial subject , more than one answer to the question should be considered . In the pages of this magazine , on November thirteenth , Sen. Arthur Capper took the negative . Though certain industrial groups have benefited , on the whole , Mr. Capper says American producers , particularly farmers , are " being sold down the river . " The senator abhors the automatic benefits that come to nontreaty countries " without the slightest obligation to return the favor . . . We buy the candy . They eat it . . each trade agreement should involve the two signatories and no More , " other nations getting the same terms only when they give them . The State Department 's dinstver Mr. Capper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total exports rose from $2,085,092,000 for the year ending July , 1935 , to $2,374 , - 159,000 for the year ending July , 1936 , an increase of $289,067,000 , for which we paid too big a price , as follows : An increase in imports of $417,635,000 for the same period . Our farmers were the big sufferers , achieving a gain of only $97,591,000 in their products sold abroad against an increase of $206 , - 105,000 in the products of foreign farms sold here . That , says Mr. Capper , is too much to ask our people to pay to further Mr. Hull 's peace work , worthy though it is . On the other hand , the State Department maintains that the increase in farm imports is due largely to the droughts of ' 34 and ' 36 , not the trade agreements . A sense of Administration loyalty prevents mention of a contributing factor , the AAA plow-undera which caught us without adequate reserves . A breakdown of the excess of agricultural imports over exports shows that 80 per cent of them fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , such as coffee , tea , rubber and silk : ( 2 ) products affected by the droughts , such as corn , wheat , flour , fodder ; and ( 3 ) products such as long-staple cotton , certain types of wool , wraPperi tobaeco , hides , which we normally import in large quantities because we can not produce enough of them to meet manufacturing needs . Not all these products come under the Hull treaties , and imports have increased despite high duties . As for the charge that we receive nothing in return for extending benefits to nontreaty . nations , it is pointed out that those benefits are small . What other nation than France can profit greatly by a lowered duty on champagne ? This is no isolated example . Last year-such nou tree ty-cou n try imports amounted only to $30,000,000 , and assured friendly treatment for our exports to those countries worth many times that figure . The treaties have greatly increased our export trade in manufactured articles such as automobiles , farm machinery , oil , refrigerators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . Specific injuries to American producers , industrial and agricultural , are more than recompensed by the general gains ? greatest - good - to - greatest - number theory . The general lowering of world-trade harriers is doing away with arbitrary diversions of trade and the bottling up of trade which have contributed to eeonumic stresses which the Have-Not nations offer as justification for acquiring markets and raw materials by force of arms . So , briefly , Mr. Hull . The Ballyhoo Ban Another view of the treaties combines features of both straight con and pro opinions sketched above . The writer has heard this view expressed in a private conversation by an authority on international trade and trading , including their political implications . This authority considered some of Mr. Hull 's concessions " generous , " on a spot dollars-and-cents basis , As instruments of peace he was inclined to think them worth-while . As a means of keeping the dictator states from setting the world on fire , he considers Hull 's trade pacts almost as much a factor as the British navy or the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quick look at the three schools of thought on a subject concerning which the country will hear more during 1938 . It is natural that the Secretary should defend a thing he believes in unselfishly . " A lie , " he says , " can travel halfway around the world while the truth is getting its breeches on . " Tho heads of all Government departments defend their pet schemes , and to this end have been created , at public expense , engines of propaganda , the like of which this country has not seen ' before . In the State Department is no such engine . Mr. Hull vetoed a suggestion to set up one . The department jogs along with the little " press-relations bureau " inherited from other administrations arid years behind the times , Nevertheless , the Hull compacts do not lack defenders  --  a fact which will be more apparent in the future than it has been in the past . Presently you will begin to read in youl ? newspapers and to hear over your radio commendations of the trade agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . High up in the direction of this Committee will be Raymond Leslie Buell , a foreign-relations expert , now president of the Foreign Policy Association . The membership will include names from industry , finance , agriculture , labor , scholarship and journalism . General Motors may have one of its big men on it ; so , probably , will one or two oil companies , as well as banks doing international business , labor and farm groups . Skilled professionals will turn the wheels , as they do in any well-run and well-heeled propaganda outfit . A distinction from other publicity agencies boosting Administration policies is that the Committee on Economic Policy will be financed by interested parties and not from the public till . Contact between this organization and the State Department will be maintained through George Fort Milton , of Chattanooga , Tennessee , lately appointed Special Assistant to the Secretary of State . This seems a fortunate choice . The rotund figure of the affable Special Assistant had scarcely cast a shadow in the corridors of the Department before things began to hum . George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . Of several parts . There is Milton the editor and owner of the Chattanooga News , one of the South 's good newspapers ; Milton the historian and author , whose books rank high in biographical literature ; Milton the battler for causes and persuasive political organizer ; Milton the scholar , who will probably wind up as a university president . Newest of that always-engaging company of Washington subalterns , he will bear watching . As Hull 's pacts come to the fore , Hull comes to the fore , bringing his name more into the vortex of presidential discussion . At this stage , what better forerunner to a campaign organization could an aspirant wish for than something like this nongovernmental , cosmopolitan CoMmittee on Economic Policy ? Not that anyone close to Mr. Hull will talk presidential politics now . They talk of trade and of peace . Yet the presidential surmise persists . The Secretary 's mail is beginning to be burdened with it . He says nothing , unless privately to a misguided friend , as lately , when a resident of Nashville broached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Expectations , " observed the Secretary with a smile . The full membership of the Tennessee Legislature seems to have brushed up on Mr. Dickens ' novel  --  and this with the shade of Andrew Jackson hovering over the state capitol . It was a resolution of the Tennessee Legislature , nominating him for the presidency , that dragged Old Hickory from retirement and started him on the way to the White House . Last fall the legislators adopted a similar resolution presenting the name of Cordell Hull . In the opinion of party strategists elsewhere , it would have been wiser to wait a year . In the Presidential Tradition When twelve months or more roll around , it may be suitable to stress an item of the Secretary 's qualifications which takes us back to another era of presidential campaigning : Mr. Hull was born in a log house . It stands on a place . County hillside near the Ken-tucky line , still known as the old Hull When William Hull , the Secretary 's father , made his acquaintance with that property , it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the household . When he married Elizabeth Riley he went there to live . From those sloping acres Billy Hull coaxed good crops , bought a better farm in the Cumberland River " bottom , " and laid the foundation of a comfortable fortune by cutting timber for the Nashville market . As soon as his five sons  --  restos , Cordell , Sylvanus Sirnadus , Wyoming and Roy ? could swing an ax , they became woodsmen too . At fifteen , Cordell matrieulafail at Montvale College . Atria , Tennessee , the president and 50 per cent of the faculty of which was Prof. Joe McMillin , who taught surveying , geometry , anatomy and Greek . Each Friday evening young Hull walked thirteen miles home . Each Sunday he walked back . Next the young man attended National .

He was not twenty-one when nominated for the Legislature , though of age when elected .

Hull has a name for being easygoing , and usually he is , though there are some who might say differently . He did n't place himself on the plane he occupies by agreeing with everybody , ! Continued on Page 301 36 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January IS , 19.18 ( Continued from Pag ? 331 including the President. , Tennessee discovered that streak in Cordell Hull when lie ascended the bench of the Fifth Judicial Circuit  --  where some of the citizens had been accustomed to settling about as many disputes out of court as in . When the young judge first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pickett , a few miles from his birthplace , the independent element decided on in demonstration : calculated to disincline the jurist from taking his responsibilities too seriously . With jugs of corn and rifles dangling from their saddles , they rode down from the hills early in the morning , and by the time court convened , they were feeling pretty good . No sooner had the judge ordered the reading of the docket than the visitors mounted their horses and started riding around the courthouse square . shooting and whooping . Judge Hull stopped the clerk 's reading and instructed the prosecuting attorney to start drawing indictments for public drunkenness and disturbing the court . He instructed the clerk to issue capiases in blank , and ordered the sheriff to deputize as many special officers as he thought he would need . Then he directed the grand jurors to scatter about the square and get the names of the demonstrators . Within thirty minutes the grand jury was back , returning indictments . C'apiases were tilled in , and the special deputies were sent to arrest the entire mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridors . Meantime a jury panel had been selected , and within an hour the trials started . Every man paid a fine or went to jail to sober up . When the last sentence had been pronounced , it was noon and Judge Hull adjourned his court for dinner . In Congress , Hull wrote the Federal Income Tax Act of 1913 , the modified Act of 1916 and the Federal Inheritance Tax Act of 1916 . When President-elect Roosevelt called him to Warm Springs to receive a Cabinet offer , the Tennessean told friends he would prefer to remain in the Senate . There are those who believe his indifference to the title he now holds is responsible for the independence Hull has displayed ip swinging one branch of the Government away from New Deal nationalism . Mr. Hull has increased the dignity of the title while diminishing the stiffness . When he took office , letters from the Department were directed to " Sir " or " Madam , " as the gender might be . It was an inherited form . " Lot 's just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in our correspondence , " suggested the Secretary . Hull upsets some popular conceptions of a Southern Democrat .. Though a consistent party man , he knows what a Republican looks like . Any mountaineer knows that . In the district Hull represented in the House are enough Republicans to carry county elections rather often . Hull 's first law partner , Judge John Gore , is a Republican . The Secretary has kinfolk who are Republicans , Year after year that district sent its representative to Washington not so much because he was a Democrat as because he was Cordell Hull . As far as memory goes , Mr. Hull is the first Secretary of State to live in a hotel . Bryan tried it , but soon felt obliged to take a house to give tone to the state dinners at which he served grape juice . The Hulls have a seven-room apartment at the Carlton , with the only kitchenette allowed in the hotel . They have one servant , a middle-aged Tennessee Negress named Martha .

Who , besides a Tory , could have seen , or a Briton predicted " the tragic state of affairs : ' And so the Convention that met at Philadelphia on May 25 , 1757 , was called , on the initiative of Virginia , for the purpose of curing the universally recognized " imbecility " of the Confederation . This Convention was in fact the last- hope for a government both strong and free . The delegates knew it , and acted accordingly . The roll of the members is bright with valor and wisdom . The delegates represented by far the largest fraction of the power and wisdom of the thirteen states . George Washington was the inevitable and unanimous choice for president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the venerable president of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . Benjamin Franklin . The Founding Fathers ' Purpose The delegates had two main purposes . They wished , as James Wilson said on May thirty-first , to establish " a federal government that will insure freedom and yet be vigorous . " The liberties they sought to protect were of two sorts  --  our political independence from Great Britain , and also our freedom from the possibility of tyranny of whatever sort . On these principles all the delegates were agreed . But the Convention was not united . Its members differed widely as to what sort of general government should be set up . Clashes of interest were ninny . The small states distrusted the large ones . The slave-holding South had already seen that its own interests conflicted with those of the Middle and Northern states . Already we see the germs of a tariff contest between the beginnings of industry in Pennsylvania and elsewhere , and the largely agricultural states . Numbers of real patriots , of whom Luther Martin , of Maryland , is an example , believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to create a nation . Yet all these interests were unified and at least in part reconciled by the Constitution as it finally emerged from the Convention . The growth in the Convention of the whole new scheme of government. , and of the judicial power as one of its essential parts , is of absorbing interest . What did the Framers intend as to the judicial power ? Let us begin by defining the power , and distinguishing two very different things . There is , of course , the veto of the President . If Congress passes a bill which he thinks unwise , lie can veto it ; and his veto stands unless two thirds of each House repass the bill . This is the veto power . It is legislative and political in its nature . The power of the Supreme Court is wholly different . Unlike the President , the Court is not concerned with the wisdom of legislation , but only with the question of whether Congress had power under the Constitution to pass that particular act . It has not and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . All that it can ever do is this : When a case is brought before it , and a party claims that his constitutional rights have been violated , the Court merely decides whether the Constitution has been violated , and if it has , gives effeet to the Constitution and refuses to give effect to the offending act . Call this power of the Supreme Court the " judicial power to disallow , " There can be no doubt that the Convention , as u whole , understood and intended that the Federal judiciary should have this power . The evidence affirmatively shows that twenty-four of the twenty-five leading and dominant figures  --  all but Butler , of South Carolina  --  intended and believed that the power did exist under the Constitution as drawn . These leaders include such men as Washington , Madison , Hamilton , the Morrises of Pennsylvania , Luther Martin , Gerry , Randolph , Rutledge and many others . There is likewise affirmative evidence that nineteen of the remaining thirty understood the power and knew that it was being conferred ; and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nine others , there is either some slight evidence that they favored the power , or no evidence either way . Two others , Bedford and Spaight , are commonly listed among the opponents of the power . But neither they nor anyone else asserted that the power did not exist . The nearest to such an assertion that I have found are two remarks  --  one by Mercer , on August fifteenth , that he " disapproved " the doctrine , and another by Dickinson that he " thought no such power ought to exist . " Neither of these , of course , is a denial of the existence of the power , which both men later recognized . A number of the Framers declared the existence of the power in plain terms . Thus on July twenty-third Gouverneur Morris said : " Legislative alterations not conformable to the federal compact , would clearly not be valid . The Judges would declare them as null &; void . " And Madison , whom Mr. Roosevelt recognizes as the delegate most responsible for the Constitution , echoed Morris ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people themselves , would be considered by the Judges as null st. : void , " Witnesses Out of History Statements of this sort are sprinkled abundantly through the records of the debates ; nearly always without opposition to the principle and always without denial of the existence of the power . The very opponents of the power testify to its existence . Lansing and Yates , of New York , left the Convention on July tenth because , they explained , they feared injury to the " uncontrouled constitutional rights of the States . " Later Yates , writing as Brutus against Hamilton 's Federalist , cited the existence of the power as one reason why New York ought not to ratify the Constitution . The evidence , then , is that forty-five of the fifty-five delegates , including twenty-four of the twenty-five leaders , acknowledged the existence of the power and knew that it was being conferred . Not more than five or six delegates opposed the power . There is no evidence known to me that any delegate , opponent or not , made any denial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . It is fascinating for us to trace the growth in the Convention of the idea of a Constitution of supreme but limited powers , guarded and limited by an independent judiciary . The germ of the idea is found as early as May twenty-ninth , in the Virginia Plan of government presented by Randolph . This plan provided that the national judiciary should be independent  --  not a single delegate ever questioned this principle , so it can be assumed from now on  --  and that it should have jurisdiction in the " dernier resort " of " questions which may involve the national peace and harmony . " A few days later , June fourth , Madison proposed that the growing legislative power should be checked by a joint veto of the executive and the judiciary . In the debate that followed , Gerry opposed such a veto , because it was " quite foreign from the nature of ye office to make them judges of the policy of public measures , " and also because they had the judicial power to disallow . King agreed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . No one disagreed with Gerry and King as to the constitutional power of the judges . As early as June eleventh , Williamson , of North Carolina , first stated : " The union will become the law of the land . On June fifteenth , New siersey presented another plan of government , which provided that acts of the Congress " made by virtue and in pursuance of the powers . . . vested in them . . shall be the supreme law , " and so oil . Thus New Jersey also desired to limit the Federal Government to such powers as should be granted . The debate continued . One question was how to prevent the states from flouting the new Constitution as they had the Articles of Confederation . One proposal was that Congress should have a veto on state laws . This was voted down on July seventeenth , Madison , Sherman and Gouverneur Morris urging , without contradiction from anyone , that the judiciary would have the power to disallow unconstitutional laws , and arguing from that that the additional power was unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " clause , very MentIneed OM1 Pays 38 )
