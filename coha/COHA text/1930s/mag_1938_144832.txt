Travesty <P> Sirs : LIFE , in its issue of May 16 , carries an advertisement of TIME , which tells of the editors , writers , researchers and correspondents of the new Radio Department , who have for three months been exploring the field . They are described as having gathered news " from London , where television has failed dismally . " Some member of your team has surely betrayed you here . Any of the many thousands of people , who watched on the television screen Bois Roussel make his winning dash in the Derby , or Eddie Phillips knocking out Ben Foord in the ninth round , or Donald Budge playing at Wimbledon , could have told him better . Television in England has its own difficulties to overcome ; but it is now providing a daily service of excellent quality to many thousands of viewers . It is a travesty of the facts to describe it as a dismal failure ; and as a regular , if transatlantic , reader of TIME , I am jealous for its reputation for accuracy . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite right . TIME 'S advertising copywriter was off base . However , TIME 'S Radio section has pointed out several times in recent weeks the technical excellence of British television. - ED . <P> Thumbology <P> Sirs : After our tourist bureaus spent oodles of money advertising that the map of Michigan is the Right Hand of Hospitality Extended you fellows call it the left hand palm-down , in TIME , July 4-5 article on " Electrified Thumb . " Helpful , are n't you ? M. JORLING Saginaw , Mich . <P> In outline the backside of the left and the palmside of the right hand look the same to TIME. - ED . <P> Sirs : . . . No doubt , the REA is to be lauded for its Thumb child . However , TIME has overlooked another public-spirited organization . . . . Detroit Edison bought the interests of an ill-managed , holding-company-owned public utility company in The Thumb in 1935 . . . . In November 1935 , 11,000 Thumb farmers were in need of rural electric service : within two years D.E.C. had supplied the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of its first three years , has extended its services to some 1,500 farmers at current date . It hopes to serve 4,000 to 5,000 when and if effectively established . Co-op rate for 100 kilowatt-hours per month is $5.07 ; D.E.C. sells 100 kilowatt-hours per month for $3.39 . Co-op borrowed $2,000,000 from the Federal Government . It is a fact of irrelevance that D.E.C. paid a little over $2,000,000 in taxes to the Federal Government in 1937 . . . . ED MOYLE ( A TIME reader and New Dealer ) Ferndale , Mich . <P> Sirs : . . " You speak of the $1,000 a mile charge made by the Cooperative for stringing its lines . You say that " private utilities had been charging customers from $1,500 to $2,500 a mile for stringing lines to their doors . " So far as Detroit Edison Co. is concerned , their rate book shows that they charge $500 per mile for stringing the lines to their customers . If the customers connect to the line at the time it is strung , each customer receives a rebate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers in any mile , the line-stringing costs the customers nothing . If there were but one customer to a mile , it would cost but ( $400 . . . . J. A. GALLERY Tuscola County Advertiser Caro , Mich.
