By tradition of the Roman Catholic Church , the Sacred College of Cardinals may number 70 prelates . But until two years ago it was always short of this plenum by at least three or four members . Reason was that , should a Pope die suddenly , his successor might wish immediately to make cardinals of his best friends and working associates . Impatient of tradition , Pope Pius XI brought the Sacred College up to 69 two years ago . Continuing a policy of creating cardinals as deaths occurred in the College , the Holy Father last week let it be announced that he would award five new red hats at two consistories in mid-December . The five cardinals-to-be : <P> Most Rev. Arthur Hinsley , 72 , Archbishop of Westminster . Primate of 2,300,000 British Catholics . Since Pope Pius IX , in 1850 , re-established the often suppressed British hierarchy , under Nicholas Patrick Stephen Cardinal Wiseman , the see of Westminster has traditionally been entitled to a cardinal . But Archbishop Hinsley , soon after his appointment to succeed the late Francis Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Italo-Ethiopian war . Replying energetically to the anti-Italian attacks of the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Archbishop of Westminster announced that the Pope was powerless to intervene in the war because he was " a helpless old man . " For this , Archbishop Hinsley , long-jawed Yorkshireman , was passed over when on two occasions the Pope raised other prelates to the purple . <P> Most Rev. Ermenegildo Pellegrinetti , Apostolic Nuncio to Yugoslavia who earned his red hat by a pyrrhic victory . He negotiated a concordat with Yugoslavia so favorable to his Church that it led to religious rioting and the Yugoslavian Parliament dared not ratify it ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) . <P> Most Rev. Pierre Gerlier , well-loved and smooth-spoken bishop of the French diocese which includes the famed shrine of Lourdes , who was raised last summer to be Archbishop of Lyons . This post carries with it the ancient , honorable but now empty designation , Primate of Gaul . <P> Most Rev. Adeodato Giovanni Piazza , a militant churchman who is considered one of many candidates to be the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an archbishop but holding an ancient title ( like the Patriarchs of Lisbon , the East and West Indies ) which stands because no one ever bothered to abolish it . <P> Most Rev. Giuseppe Pizzardo , 61 , scholar and diplomat , who is secretary of the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs , head of the Church 's bureau of Catholic Action . Once detested by Italy 's Fascists because he fought the Pope 's battle with them over the matter of educating Italian youth , Monsignor Piz-zardo , like the Pope , is today disposed to collaborate with Fascism . As much as any prelate in the Vatican , he has the Holy Father 's ear in business and financial affairs . Last May he was the Pope 's legate to the coronation of King George VI , but was permitted only to sit outside Westminster Abbey in a special tribune .
