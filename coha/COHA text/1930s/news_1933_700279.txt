txt Jobless Women Need Clothing . To the Editor of The New York Times : The John Hall House Shelter , started by a group of women from the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church , at their Neighborhood House , 1,147 First Avenue , feeds and gives lodging to twenty " white-collar " women who have no jobs or money . Some lof them come to us without even a tooth-brush because their rooms have been locked in their absence for nonpayment of rent and their landlords would not let them in . Almost all of them need clothing In order to make a good appearance when applying for a job . Just at present , after being closed through October for lack of funds , we have no clothing on hand with which to outfit these women . We need shoes , stockings , dresses , coats , hats , underwear ; umbrellas and overshoes are greatly needed . If you have anything which you can share with these less fortunate women , we will receive it gratefully . Or if you . will phone Regent 4-3590 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Nov. 6 , 1933.
