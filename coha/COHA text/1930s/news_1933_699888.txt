txt Our dispatch describing All Nazi anger in Germany over Think the suppression of the Nazi Alike . movement in Austria is quoted from the Vossische Zeitung . This former outstanding organ of liberal opinion now states that it must be war to the death between the wicked Austrian Government and . the Nazi movement . Foreign correspondents in the dictator-ruled capitals have a distinct advantage over their colleagues in countries where free institutions survive . In London , Paris , Stockholm or Madrid one must lbok at three or four leading newspapers to arrive at a consensus of opinion . But in Moscow , Berlin or Rome it does not matter what paper you pick up . All the editors think alike if they have any regard for their health . Any German Zeitung is like any other , Vossische or KOlnische or Allgemeine . The other day when Hn'LER suppressed Herr Hues N BERG ' s Green Shirts the Hugenberg papers had to ibe happy about it . " And so , " said Alice to Why the Duchess , " you are Look sternly opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Certainly , " said the Duchess . " I see no sense in going abroad to get entangled when we can stay home and get ourselves tied up in so many knots we do n't know whether we are coming or going . Put me down as emphatically believing in national self-sufficiency . " " That sounds like something very hard to understand , " said Alice . " Not at all , " said the Duchess . " It means that there 's no use spending a lot of money on steamship fares for American delegates to disagree with foreign delegates , when they could stay in Washington and disagree with each other . We could take the money that it costs us to have our Secretary of State disagree with our Assistant Secretary of State in London and turn it back into the Treasury . " " But in that case , " said Alice , " the Secretary of the Treasury would probably disagree with the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury how to use the money ? " " Exactly , " said the Duchess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally self-sufficient and have all the excitement we want . " New York City 's tentaAid tive program of public for works , to be carried out the Cities . with Federal aid , consists largely of bridges , tunnels , subways , streets , parks and housing in the form of large multiple-family developments . This is significant . When people build more tunnels and subways and apartment ? houses in New York , and describe them as self-liquidating , they assume that New York City is here to stay . It may even grow , with more people and intenser traffic . This would hold true in all other cities where much of the Federal Government 's $3,000,000,000 in public works relief is to be spent . Apparently the greater part of the money will go into urban territory . In other words , we have an economic crisis which many people think has . been brought about by excessive industrialization and urbanization . They believe that the proper bale ance between cities and farms has been upset . We have 12900,000 unemployed because we have too many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the relief funds are being spent largely to foster urbanization . American parliamentary Names etiquette as applied by GovIn governor Cox in the London Debate . Conference Monetary committee manages at the same time to be effective and formal . Europeans are impressed when Mr. Cox says " the Chair recognizes the gentleman from India . " The nearest approach to this is in the British House of Commons , where debaters may still refer to each other as the Member for Stoke Pogis , though the practice of saying Mr. Smith or Mr. Chaucer-Jones is becoming more common . On the Continent debate is much more informal . Orators will address each other directly instead of pretending to address the Chair . They will refer to each other by name without the prefatory " Mr. " Foreign practice in general is much less punctilious about proper names than we are . They think the " V " in JOSEF V. STALIN , as we write , is a little funny , and even the JOSEF could be dispensed with . They take it for granted that when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROOSEVELT , people are likely to get the idea .
