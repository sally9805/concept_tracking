A little egg-shaped Negro with a small , sharp , smiling face went the rounds of Manhattan bankers . For two weeks Haiti 's President Stenio Vincent tried to get a refunding loan of $11,000,000 so that he could pay off Haiti 's present U. S. bondholders and rid his little republic of the U. S. 's watchdog , Sidney De La Rue . Financial Adviser-General Receiver of Haitian Customs . But the bankers wanted De La Rue on the spot to protect the refunding loan too . President Vincent had gotten exactly nowhere last week when he left Manhattan for Washington . <P> Suddenly he found everything right again . At the Washington station to greet him stood a proud company : Secretary of State Hull , the Assistant Secretaries of State and a dozen other high officials . Next day he was received by President Roosevelt . In the course of conferences lasting all afternoon he got from the President nearly all he asked : <P> 1 ) Watchdog De La Rue will pass over his duties to Haiti 's National Bank and quit Haiti . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Port-au-Prince next November , there will be left behind , Congress permitting , much Marine equipment as a gift to the native Garde d'Haiti . <P> 3 ) A trade treaty will help Haiti to export more goods to the U. S. , notably rum . <P> When the two Presidents posed for photographers both smiled readily . President Roosevelt had smoothed off one of the last rough spots in Latin-American relations . President Vincent had something to show the boys back home .
