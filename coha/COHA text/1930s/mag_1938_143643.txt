Of China 's 4,480,992 square miles Japanese forces took : , BR&gt; 9,215 in the last week 15,730 in the last month &lt;BR&gt; 155,002 in the last year &lt;BR&gt; 655,002 since 1931 <P> Outstanding in the U. S. Midwest for the competence of its foreign news coverage and the number of its special correspondents , Chicago 's Daily News printed last week much matter which the Chinese Government 's censors had slashed out of its Shanghai correspondents ' dispatches during the Japanese advance to capture Nanking , the former Chinese capital ( TIME , Nov. 29 , et seq . ) . Examples of what was slashed : <P> " Nanking 's greatest fear , which explains the sudden evacuation of the capital despite the fact that the Japanese troops are still 110 miles east of the city gates , is looting by Chinese troops-not fear of bombardment from Japanese warships . . . . Inside the Chinese lines the utmost confusion prevails . . . . Chinese troops have not been paid since August . . . . There is severe lack of food for front-line troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention for the Chinese wounded . . . . Then , too , might be added the strong resentment of the Chinese front-line troops at the fact that while they are under constant aerial bombings from Japanese bombers no Chinese bombers have appeared during daylight hours , although every Chinese soldier had been given to understand that Chiang Kai-shek 's chief threat to Japan consisted in his air force . . . . What now ? Japan has succeeded in plunging China into chaos which will take several years , perhaps decades , to straighten out . . . . With China 's near collapse understood , neither Russia nor any other nation will feel desirous of giving China military assistance . " <P> During the World War no correspondent would have dreamed of handing to a French or German censor a dispatch containing such obvious dynamite , however correct , and the placid Chinese censor as a matter of fact indulged Chicago 's Daily News to the extent of passing this : " Only one thing can save the Chinese Army now , this correspondent learns-continued torrential rains for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Japanese forces were at the moment approaching the great Shantung city of Tsingtao and in it Chinese looters , firebugs , panic-stricken soldiers and gangsters were creating fresh chaos as they laid waste the $100,000,000 of Japanese property in the city . <P> The moon-faced mayor of Tsingtao , Admiral Shen Hung-lieh of the insignificant Chinese Navy , at first did his best to have Chinese looters shot on sight , and numerous corpses accumulated in front of Japanese shops . Later as the mayor 's authority crumbled , and as maddened <P> Chinese started looting and burning indiscriminately , Admiral Shen adopted the desperate expedient of having signs put up directing prospective looters to Japanese premises , in the hope that they would spare others . Finally the Admiral fled pell-mell with Tsingtao 's Chinese police .
