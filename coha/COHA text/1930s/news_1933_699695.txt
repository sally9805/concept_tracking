txt For almost no conceivable plan of restriction would lessen their hourlong discussions of the relative merits of " Jake-leg " ( Jamaica ginger ) , " Tiger Sweat , " " Jungle Juice " and what-have-you , all more or less based on denatured alcohol . The strange thing is that the control plan of Toronto , vastly better though it is than Montreal 's , regularly passes out across its counters so good a substitute as Catawba wine for these deadly concoctions that it makes Montreal 's near-bums green with envy . qwq the wineries of the Niagara region to go too far in first stepping up or fortifying their alcoholic content , and next , in the interest of cheapness , selling it without proper aging . In fact , the cheapness , ferocity , and popularity of this native stuff with my near-bum companions supports almost the only question I could raise against the good faith of the Ontario Liquor Commission . For it must be said that no one can talk with these commissioners or read their reports without feeling that , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to temperance is in actuality operated as a plan for selling liquor , Ontario 's board , on the other hand , is made up of men sincerely anxious to exercise control over the consumption of alcohol . " The only reason why half bottles have not been sold , " so they give evidence of their objective , in their report for 1931 , " was that the ordinary half bottle could be carriel in the pocket as readily as a flask , and that half bottles would facilitate drinking in motors and other illegal places . ... " The board has , however , taken up the question as to whether a half bottle can be made that would be very inconvenient to carry on the person , and if carried could be easily detected . A half bottle triangular in shape . has been adopted . . . . If , notwithstanding its peculiar shape , It is found that its sale promotes illegal drinking , it will be withdrawn . " Ability to Buy Decides Certainly they indicate in a variety of ways their wish to temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears a conspicuous signNOTICE  --  Do n't buy permits unless you can afford them . Liquor will not be sold to those the board finds to be in needy circumstances . With the help of various inspectors something like strict enforcement is supposed to be given to such rules as these : ( a ) Liquor must not be sold to thole who abuse it , and sales should not be made so as to render possible a continuance of drunkenness . ( b ) Liquor must not be sold to those who from the amount of their purchases and from their standing and circumstances are likely to be supplying bootleggers. ( c ) Liquor must not be sold when the financial standing of the purchaser is such that the sales must be followed by a diminution of the comforts of life in the family . In line with this every vendor is also empowered to restrict a doubtful customer to buy at a single store , ' where his purchases and totals to date can be scanned and also to withdraw any license altogether . During the fiscal year a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of ' a total list of permits of all sorts numbering 435,000 . Transfer of Permits " We find the board always anxious sincerely to cooperate , ' said the head of a social organization serving thousands of needy families . " Cancellation does n't always solve the problem because a man can always get liquor on the permit of a friend or neighbor . But I understand that the commission was asked , last fiscal year , by social agencies to report on a total of 59,330 individuals and found that of these 2381 had permits  --  which were forthwith taken away . So it does prove a helpful assurance that needy people are genuinely obstructed from trading charitable money or provisions for hurtful liquor . " Conceivably the friends of prohibition are right in claiming that this arrangement for rescinding permits . while representing good intentions , nevertheless falls to meet anything like the proper number of family crises and these too late . Conceivably , too , these objectors are justified in pointing to a constant increase in the number of motor accidents . As to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a serious effort to remedy the situation . " Drunken driving is so likely to get seven days in jail  --  even if you 're a railway president , " said a newspaper editor , " that if any of us plan to go on an evening 's binge or bender , we jolly well plan to leave our cars at home . One night one of my friends got so lit up and yet remained so sober that he went out and stole the key out , of his inebriated pal 's car in order to make sure they 'd both have to be taxied home ! " " I 'm drunk . " so a man insisted to his friend , according to another story of the way all fear arrest , " so I must go back and give my name and number to the policemanyessir , law requires it ! " But maybe he was fairly sober ; for when he further explained to the astonished bobby that he wanted him to know just where tomorrow evening 's box of candy would be hailing from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again increase or decrease of motor accidents for 1000 miles , of indictable crimes , of arrests for drunkenness , etc. ? as to all these and various other results and concomitants of control the battle of statistics rages between sincere prohibitionists and , I 'm inclined to say , equally sincere commissioners and oontrollists . I 've troubled little with them , partly because prosperity and depression serve to complicate their teachings and partly because quite evidently , they accomplish slight change of attitude in either contestant or observant citizen . What 's more to the point , I 'd lay , is this testimony of a thoughtful Toronto social worker executive : ' Under prohibition until 1927 , when present arringemenee were adopted , the percentage of needy families showing alcohol as a cause became quite insignificant . Since then  --  that is , under control ? it has , I must be frank to state , shown increase again . For the upper classes here , prohibition proved hurtful . For the worker I fear control is now proving hurtful . Certainly it has made drinking more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bottom , and between . " Meanwhile , in an average year , the Provincial Government makes a profit of around 58.000.000 out of selling to a population of around 3,500,000. about $24,000,000 of hard liquor , around $2.500,000 of wine , and about $18,000,000 worth of beer . To sell or to control  --  promote or demote  --  permit or prohibit ? ? by no means a simple problem !
