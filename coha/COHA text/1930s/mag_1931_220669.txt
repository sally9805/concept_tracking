Months of bickering between two sister dominions ended in an ominous quarrel last week when Sister New Zealand said in effect : " <P> Sister Canada , from now on you are a foreign nation to me-so there ! " <P> New Zealand 's spokesman was of course her potent Hon. George William Forbes , Premier , Finance Minister , Minster of External Affairs , Minister of Customs , Minister of Stamp Duties and Minister in charge of Public Trust , Legislative , State Advances , Land and Income Tax . Scientific and Industrial Research and High Commissioner 's Departments . As one competent to speak with authority about almost anything , Mr. Forbes postulated the impossibility of reaching an agreement with Canada for reciprocal tariff favors . This being so , the only thing for New Zealand to do-in Premier Forbes 's opinion-was to discipline Sister Canada . <P> The Discipline : the New Zealand Government last week deprived Canadian imports of the benefit of " imperial preference " which is the lowest tariff rate in all British countries . Hereafter Canadian goods entering New Zealand will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on goods from " foreign countries . " <P> To this new and drastic rule , Mr. Forbes made three exceptions . New Zealand being a pastoral country , needs plenty of rubber boots and wire . Also she is not averse to buying paper cheap from Canada 's famed mills . Therefore all kinds of Canadian rubber boots , Canadian wire of certain kinds , and Canadian paper of certain types will continue to enter New Zealand by " imperial preference . "
