In Texas a black buck known as Lead Belly murdered a man . He sang a petition to Governor Pat Neff and was granted a pardon . Back in the Louisiana swamplands , where he was born Huddie Ledbetter , his knife made more trouble . He was in State Prison at Angola when John A. Lomax , eminent ballad collector , stopped by last summer and asked the warden if he could please hear Lead Belly sing . <P> John Lomax arrived in Manhattan last week to lecture on ballads and with him was Lead Belly , wild-eyed as ever . The Negro had been pardoned again because Mr. Lomax had made a phonograph record of a second petition and taken it to Louisiana 's Governor Allen . Lead Belly was released from prison on Aug. 1 . Month later when Mr. Lomax was sitting in a Texas hotel he felt a tap on his shoulder . It was Lead Belly , saying : " Boss , here I is . " His knife bulged in his pocket . In his hand was a rickety green-painted guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue hickory shirt over a yellow one , Lead Belly sang in Manhattan last week for University of Texas alumni . And John Lomax was nervous . Theatrical agents and radio scouts insisted on hearing his protege , who had been out on a wild 24-hour rampage in Harlem . Until it was time for him to sing Lomax kept his hell-raising minstrel locked up in a coat room . But the performance went off without mishap . Lead Belly 's voice is rich and clear . He plays and sings with his eyes closed , taps single time with one foot , triple with the other . He claims that most of his songs are his own . He sang about when " me and a bunch of cowboys had that famous battle on Bunker Hill , " and again about the Negro who " throwed his jelly* out of the window . ' The minstrel was proudest when he chanted the petition which won him his first pardon . The refrain : <P> I am your servant , composed this song ; <P> Please , Governor Neff , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will jump and shout When de train roll up and I come steppin ' out . <P> Please , Governor Neff , be good an ' kind , Have mercy on my great long <P> time , I do n't see to save my soul ; If 1 ca n't get a pardon , try me in a parole . . . . <P> Please , Governor Neff , be good and kind , And if I ca n't get a pardon , will you cut my time ? <P> If I had you , Governor Neff , like you got me , I would wake up in the mornin ' and set you free . <P> And I 'm going home to Mary-po ' <P> Mary . <P> <P> *A " jelly " in the Louisiana swamplands means a very fat woman . Many of Lead Belly 's songs are in Lomax 's excellent book , American Ballads and Folk Songs ( Macmillan , $5 ) .
