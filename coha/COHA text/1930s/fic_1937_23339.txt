COTSWOLD HONEY A STORY BY FRANCIS BRETT YOUNG T uE taxicab , which had been held up in Bayswater by a series of those impediments which are only encountered by people who have no time to spare , slid down the incline of the Paddington Station " departure " - side and pulled up with a jolt that nearly threw its one passenger , who was straining forward as though he thought this attitude would get him there sooner , into the glass partition . The clock in the gable pointed to four forty-four . Only one minute to gol Mr. Hopkins , who had been keeping his eye on his watch and on the taximeter , methodically adding each three-pence as the figure appeared in the slot , to the sum he held ready in his hand , threw open the door , flung his suitcase to a running porter , and crammed the fare into the taxi-man 's glove as he dismounted . " Where to , sir ? " the porter asked . " Chadminster , " he gasped . " The four-forty-five . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no time to get your ticket . Number One Platform . First or third ? " " First smoker . " " Keep close to me , sir . We may just about do it . " The wooden platform , thunderous with echoing feet , was swept by two streams of people moving right and left . The porter , accustomed to this sort of navigation , butted his way through . Mr. Hopkins , less used to crowds , floundered after him like a feeble swimmer caught in a double current . Before they reachedthe edge of the platform the engine-whistle shrieked ; an inspector cried " Stand back , please " ; the train started to move . Already the porter had pulled open the last carriage-door and thrown in the suitcase . Mr. Hopkins scrambled in after it and , fumbling for coins , threw him a florin . The man grinned and touched his cap . This was money for jaml The train gathered speed . Mr. Hopkins leaned back in the seat and breathed heavily . The exertion , to which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several minutes to recover his breath . When he did so his eye caught in the morning paper he had mechanically unfolded a florid advertisement addressed to men over forty , expatiating on the perils of high blood-pressure . This warning disturbed him ; for the middle-aged gentleman depicted gasping for breath with his hand on his heart was not , when he came to look at the picture , unlike himself . Palpitation , giddiness , shortness of breath . At this moment every one of the symptoms was applicable and sinister . He thought : " I 'll make a note of the name of this stuff and get some . " Since his retirement , six months ago , he had rather been given to worrying about his health . A man can not spend thirty years in the tropics  --  particularly in such an unhealthy region as Koboland which , if it is n't exactly the White Man 's Grave , is the next worst thing  --  without emerging from them rather the worse for wear from their routine of quinine interspersed with bouts of fever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wakobo , the savages in whose country he had worked as District and then as Provincial Commissioner for all those years , he had not had much time to think about such things as health . He had found a vocation  --  not one that had Ied to any spectacular fame or success , but still a vocation  --  and a reputation of sorts as the first living authority on that unsavory people 's language and morals and customs while now , automatically retired in what men of his age called " the prime of life " on a meager pension , he had no prospect left so far as he could discover but that of writing a volume of monotonous experiences and ethnological researches which would probably never be published and , if published , never would be read by anybody . He had been conscious of this the moment he landed at Tilbury . On the homeward-bound ship , among his African colleagues and their wives , going home on leave , he had still been " somebody . " A provincial commissioner , even from Koboland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the dank air of that greasy quay received him , no sooner had he surrendered his innocent baggage to the scrutiny of a suspicious customs-officer , than he realized that Gilbert Sylvester-Hopkins Esq. , C.M.G. , had abruptly become a person of no importance . The same humiliating sense of his own unimportance  --  that bathos which betrays even such splendid creatures as governors , who are used to being addressed as " Your Excellency " and making their entrances to " God save the King " ? had pursued and depressed him during his stay in London . This return had none of the enchanting freedom of his previous visits to England on leave when , his outward passage booked and his salary assured at the end of it , he had been able to make a splash and live carelessly at the rate of a fellow with money to burn on a holiday . Now his income was less than that of a moderately successful professionalman . It would be as much as he could do to make two ends meet on it . Every penny counted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had not even the right to be traveling first-class  --  much less to go tipping porters at the rate of two bob a minute . The thought of that recklessly wasted florin haunted him as much as that of his purely hypothetical blood-pressure . And that was n't all . The England to which he had looked forward as the reward of his services was not merely grudging of recognizing them and prodigiously , frighteningly expensive ; it was also depressingly unlike the England of a tropical exile 's dream . Again and again , in his steamy solitude , he has wistfully pined for her . Often , beneath his mosquito net , he had thought of ( and even repeated to himself ) that poem of Browning 's about being in England now that April was there , about the brushwood sheaf round the elm-tree 's bole and the chaffinch singing on the orchard bough . Well , here he was in England , in April , and it rained every day ; and the West-end pavements were slimed with black grease and the great red buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parks , where there were neither elms in tiny leaf nor chaffinches but only leprous plane trees and hungry sparrows , could one breathe the authentic air of the kind of spring on which he had set his mind . Seedy men walked through them , muffled to the neck , carrying furled or erected umbrellas ; and Mr. Hopkins bitterly wondered how many of them were disgruntled Empire-builders with C.M.G . ' s to their names like himself , or even K. 's . The thing that got most on his nerves in this English April was the paucity of light . The climate had obviously changed since the days of his boyhood  --  even since his last leave ; for he remembered his schooldays and even those holidays as having been full of sun : not the splendid suns of Koboland , soaring out of the gray-green bush with a superb and joyful gesture of mightiness and drench-ing the early morning world in floods of gold , but pleasant , moderate , neighborly suns , somewhat reserved maybe ( like the English character ) , but admirably adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket fields , and hot enough , on occasion , to tempt one ( provided one 's blood were not thinned by malaria ) to bathe . But this April , even when the pale sun shone , there was not a vestige of heat in the air ; and the people who sat out on green chairs in the parks , smiling and seeming to bask in it , filled Mr. Hopkins ' shivering soul with annoyance : they were just showing off , he felt , like those objectionable skinny old men who plunge into the Serpentine before breakfast on Christmas morning . And he was mortally lonely . He had never had any relatives to speak of ; and those for whom he had felt any kindness were either dead or living in distant country-houses to which , when he announced himself , they invited him in terms not suggestive of ardent enthusiasm . Their letters were as mistily chilly as April . There was a world of difference , it seemed , between a relation home from the wilds on fairly short leave with plenty of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England on a smallish pension , and was no longer able to entertain them and give them a good time when they dashed up to London . As for friends , he had hardly any left after twenty-five years ; and those few who remained seemed even more distant to him than the easy acquaintance he had picked up on the boat and who now , that artificial intimacy relaxed , were dispersed and no more inclined to substantiate their promises of eternal friendship than Mr. Hopkins himself . That was why , in a fit of unusual gloom imposed by the frigidity of his club , in which , though he had belonged to it for twenty years , the porter regarded him with suspicion and asked what he wanted there , he had sent out an almost literal S.O.S. to a Koboland colleague , rather senior to himself , who had retired from the service a couple of years before him and had settled in the Cathedral city of Chadminster in the Western Midlands . If they had little else in common , he thought , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping-sickness , and dysentery , and the events of the native rising in nineteen-sixteen , and grumble as they took walks together about the English dimate and the Colonial Office . His friend , if that were the proper way to describe him , had replied on a laconic post card inviting hint to run down to Chadminster for a short week-end , which was better than nothing , though not very much , and had suggested a train . Neither he nor his wife , he had added , was in very good form at the moment ; at the moment of writing both of them suspected colds . There was nothing extraordinary in that , Mr. Hopkins thought ; as far as he could see everybody in England either had a cold or was getting over one or just on the point of having one . In spite of this rather discouraging prospect , Mr. Hopkins was thankful to feel that , at last , he had shaken the mud of this huge , inhospitable London from his cold feet . It had been a mistake , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , after all , country-bred and unused to cities . All the richest memories of his youth were set against an English country background : the vicarage in which ( following the example of most provincial commissioners in Koboland ) he had been born and spent his childhood ; the surroundings of his not very important public school ; even Oxford itself  --  undistracted then by the making or breaking of motor vehicles  --  had worn , in his time , the air of a tree-shaded city surrounded and interpenetrated by green fields . Yes , Oxford . . . Of course . Until this moment  --  the train was now whirling through Slough with the tower of Windsor Castle on his left  --  it had not occurred to him that this Chadminster express must actually pass through Oxford and would probably stop there . Not that the idea of revisiting Oxford attracted him now . During his last leave , when he had still been able to flatter himself that he was in the running for a Chief Secretaryship , he had " run down " to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been a success . He had been charitably invited , it was true , to dinner at the high table by a don whom , as a contemporary , he had always disliked ; but the familiar stones were too full of the ghosts of dead ambitions to tempt him again . There was , in fact , only one of his undergraduate memories on which he could brood with any satisfaction ; and this was connected not with Oxford itself but with a village lost amid the lower folds of the Cotswolds some miles away to the west of it . That memory , which had never quite left him even in the recesses of Koboland , returned to him now with a pleasant poignancy and continued with him , even more poignantly , when the train had left Oxford . This was partly , no doubt , the effect of the April air which , now that the train had escaped from the London haze , was as limpid as April air should be . The sun had come out ; the water-meadows shone green ; here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole landscape through which he was carried assumed an air of invincible youth and of hope , so persuasive that Mr. Hopkins , forgetting his arteries , permitted himself to dream . It was a dream of first love  --  the only love , as he told himself , that really mattered ; since his later essays in that adventurous pastime had not been satisfactory . He saw himself , again , in his last term at Oxford , cycling west in the company of an acquaintance named Dick Martin , who had invited him to spend Saturday night and Sunday at his home in a village called Westbury-under-Wychwood . He had accepted the invitation not so much because he liked Martin , who was n't exactly in " his set , " as because he was at a loose end and the April air tempted him . They had set out at mid-day and lunched on bread and double-Gloucester cheese and beer at a pub near Woodstock . It had been nearly teatime when they arrived at Westbury , a village of tawny gray cottages nestling in a dip in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windrush . Mr. Hopkins remembered how at the crown of the road they had dismounted and looked down on the village and how , of a sudden ( for he had been dreadfully shy , even in those days ) he had wished in spite of its beauty he could find courage to invent some lie about a forgotten appointment and turn back to Oxford . But his cowardice was greater than his shyness ; he could find no excuse ; and this fellow Martin , who seemed much nicer than he had imagined , was so pathetically transported by the sight of his home that it seemed mean to damp his enthusiasm . " We 'll slip down very quietly , " he said , " and give them a surprise . " " What ? They do n't know we 're corning ? They 're not expecting me ? " " Oh , that does n't matter a bit , " Martin laughed . " It 's all the more fun . In any case there 's nobody there but Mother and Lucy . " They coasted silently down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream flowed , stood an Inn called the Coach and Horses , and a string of stone cottages standing back from the water and separated from the road by a pellucid feat , or feeder . They pushed their bicycles up a flagged path bordered by pallid daffodils to the porch of a low house with stone-mullioned windows that was larger than the rest . Martin knocked at the door and called " Mother ! " A woman appeared in the passage . She was dressed in black ; her hair was silvery-gray , and her eyes , beneath brows that still were dark , had tawny lights in them like the bottom of a Cotswold brook . It was the most serene face , Gilbert Hopkins thought , he had ever seen , oddly young and soft in spite of the lines on it and full of a patient sweetness . When she saw her son her face was transfigured with joy . " Why , Dick , " she said quietly . " I never expected you . " " Of course you did n't , darling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hopkins . You 'd much better call him Gilbert . He 's come for the night . Whet e 's Lucy ? " " She 's gone to see old Mrs. Crump . She 'll be back for tea . " That was how the visit began . Today , in the train slowly penetrating the rising Cotswold , its details came back to him more dearly than for many years . This lucidity of the past , no doubt , was a sign of old age ( or hardened arteries ) , though it was also sharpened by the landscape 's suggestions ; for the railway ran roughly parallel , he guessed , with the road he and his friend had traversed , and the season , as well as the character of the country , were the same . As he sat there , above the rumbling wheels of the last coach which swayed as the train took its corners , he remembered vividly how Dick Martin had taken him upstairs to a low-ceiled , lavender-perfumed room with two beds in it where they were to sleep ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discovering violets and primroses , and strolled to a bridge in the middle of the village to watch shadowy trout in the stream ; how they had laughed and talked about Oxford , in an intimacy heightened by distance , and had come back hungry to tea in the one big living room , with a wood-fire flaring in the ingle , from whose shadowy interior , although it was still day outside , the stone mullions of the low windows and the black oak furniture stole most of the light . Apart from its welcoming air of modest gentility , the whole " feeling " of that room was extraordinarily gracious , as a result , no doubt , of Mrs. Martin 's serene presence . Up till then Gilbert Hopkins had had little to do with women . His own mother had died when he was a school boy and he had no sisters . There was a gentleness , a sense of security , in this kind of life that made him vaguelyhappy , yet vaguely homesick . There was nobody in the world , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could expand as Dick Martin did with his mother . This was an experience he had missed and now desired and envied . A kettle sang on the hob beside the embers ; a spaniel , whose name was Nell , lay sprawled before them ; a black cat rubbed itself friendlily against his shins . The very silence of that room had a friendly quality . They were half way through their leisurely tea and the dim room had nearly darkened when his friend 's sister , Lucy , returned . She entered the house so quietly that Gilbert Hopkins did not hear her coming . He looked up at the sound of an opening door and saw her standing there , doubtfully examining the unexpected visitors . Like her mother , she was dressed from head to foot in black ( they were still in deep mourning for Dick 's father ) and the light of the wood-fire , illuminating only her face , gave it an unusual pallor . She was a tall , slim , golden-skinned girl , with hair nearer pale amber than gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the same warm hazel eyes . She had her mother 's soft voice and an even greater lightness of movement that was part of her youth . When her hand met his Gilbert Hopkins thought he had never touched anything so soft and so cool . When she sat down on a hassock at her mother 's feet in front of the fire its flame seemed to transfuse her ; her body was all warm light . " Oh , how that old woman does talkt " she said , " and how hungry I am ! Why , Mother , you 've never given these poor boys any Cotswold honey . You know Dick loves it , and I 'm sure Mr. Hopkins would like some . " Cotswold honey . . . . That , oddly enough , had been throughout all the years intervening their symbol , their leitmotif , the key that unlocked this chamber of memory . All the attributes of this ambrosia  --  its sweetness , its aroma , which was fresh and delicate , being prin-cipally distilled from the essences of white clover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Lucy Martin 's hair , represented , in his mind , the delicate color of her personality  --  reminded him , whenever he thought of them afterward , of that girl and that spring . For that brief week-end of course was only the rapturous prelude to many others . Until then he had failed to realize what a charming fellow Dick Martin was . No doubt he found in Dick Martin 's looks and his voice reflections and echoes of Lucy 's , and so sought his company as a sort of vicarious solace . Though apart from their identical academic ambitions , the two boys had little in common , Gilbert Hopkins , once having set foot in the house at Westbury , meant to go there as often as he could , and succeeded in doing so . All that spring , all that summer , for five enchanted months , they cycled there every week-end ; no such halcyon seasons had ever existed before or ever come since . Under cloudless skies they watched the hedgerows break and burgeon and blossom and the great trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he came and when his note cracked . They saw the white clover dust the verges with ivory and then fade . They lounged in the garden or went for exhilarating walks over the hedgeless roads of the upland or through its watery valleys . On hot still nights they waited in a hushed silence to hear the nightingale . Every moment in those two sweet seasons was saturated and made magical by the enchantment of Lucy 's presence . And at teatime , whatever else there might be , there was always pale Cotswold honey . The odd thing about the whole business was that he never made love to Lucy ; though , indeed , perhaps it was not so odd as one might think ; for not only was the young man abnormally shy and made dumb by sheer rapture , but also there was in the nature of this adoration an almost religious strain , not uncommon in first love , which made him feel that the least admission of anything so common asphysical passion  --  though , heaven knows , he felt it  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature he worshipped . There was even , as in most religions , a virtue and a mystical satisfaction in abnegation . Added to this , there was in his mind a certain diffidence : the consciousness of his youth ( he was not twenty-one and young for his years ) and of his doubtful financial position which entirely depended on his success in entering the colonial service and , even if he succeeded , would not permit him to marry for five or six years . And again , when he saw Mrs. Martin whom , in a different fashion , he adored almost equally , so dependent in her recent widowed loneliness on Lucy 's company , he shrank from the thought of invading this precious relationship and taking her daughter away from her . the stage of obvious mute adoration , which , no doubt , was extremely puzzling to the poor child and her mother as well . And when at the end of the summer he took his degree ( which was a brilliant one , for he expressed himself better on paper ) and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did equally well , there came , as it were , a lapse in continuity . From the distance of London the village seemed terribly remote , and his head was so full of his new career 's ambitions and the business of assembling his tropical kit , that when his orders to embark for Koboland came at short notice , there simply was n't time to " run down " to Westbury . He decided indeed , before he sailed , to write Lucy Martin a letter in which , with considered eloquence , he would express the multitudinous things he had meant  --  but not managed  --  to say . Yet when he sat down to it , once more that odd , diffident streak in his nature obstinately intervened . Would it be fair , he asked himself , to demand that this exquisite creature should tie herself blindly to a man who had never courted her and was going to be more than four thousand miles away for outline change , as the train ran on , with at least five years ? So the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last turned out to be a final good-by , strange disquiet , for it reminded him of thanking the family for all their kindness the hopes of youth and told him that the and addressed rather more to the mother career which had once seemed so full of than to the daughter . promise was over and the promise unful- During the next month , on board ship , filled ; that he was a middle-aged man , he learned a lot more about women . with the best of his life behind him , and His willing instructress was a Koboland that its best had been none too good . civil servant 's wife who had been sent Such reflections were better suppressed . home for reasons of health and was now " In a moment , " he thought , " we shall reluctantly returning .

On the contrary , as to Pembeni , and in the space of three they approached the familiar platform weeks she had completed the young man 's he was conscious not only of the fact that education to her own satisfaction and left it was slowing down but also of a certain him no less shy but confused and rather unfamiliar smoothness in its progress . ashamed of himself .

He was sorry , but there it was . Of course , if the gentleman liked to hire a motor car in the village and drive on , or drive hick to Oxford . . . " " If I stay here to-night , " Mr. Hopkins said , " is there anywhere I can sleep ? " " Nowhere nearer than Westbury . That 's only a matter of two miles , sir , the other side of the hill . If you like to go there the porter can carry your bag when he goes off duty . He lives in the village . Mr. Morris , at the Coach and Horses , will make you quite comfortable .

But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , I know , " Mr. Hopkins answered impatiently . " I suppose I shall have to do what you suggest . The porter had better carry my bag to the Coach and Horses . " It was typical , he reflected , of the way in which Fate played tricks with one that he should have been arbitrarily brought to the one place on earth that was capable of disturbing his established composure . As he climbed the Long slope Mr. Hopkins felt deeply aggrieved ; yet when from the crest he looked down on the Westbury valley another emotion affected him even more deeply . The village seemed to be just as it had been ; not a stone was changed . When he dropped down into its green quietude his heart fluttered ominously ; he felt more like a ghost than his solid , everyday self . First he went to the Inn and booked his bed for the night . Then , still conscious of an odd unsubstantiality , he made his way to the Post Office and rang up his friend in Chadminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritable and hoarse voice answered him . His host was only too thankful to get in touch with him . Only that morning he had tried to get hold of him in London and failed . He could n't have met him anyway ; for both he and his wife were down and had gone to bed with this cursed English influenza . It would be much better , he said , to call the visit to Chadminster off , and to arrange another next month when the weather was more settled . If he liked to propose himself later ... " Mr. Hopkins rang off . Even in this , it seemed to him , he was no longer a free agent . He returned to the Inn  --  there was nothing else to be done . A shower passed and spangled the still air with glistening raindrops . Birds sang and the wet earth exhaled an odor that pierced the heart with bitter-sweet reminiscence . He sat down to a late high-tea in Mr Morris 's musty best-room . The man was communicative ; at this season ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched Mr. Hopkins eating his fried eggs and home-cured ham , talking all the time , and when he had finished them , produced a tall jar : " My wife says you ought to taste our Cotswold honey , sir , if you 've never tried it . All the gentlemen that come here think the world of it . It 's the white clover , they say , that makes it so tasty . " " I know it quite well . I 've been here before , " Mr. Hopkins said . " Fancy that , now ! And here have I been taking you for a stranger ! Now when might that have been , sir ? " It was , Mr. Hopkins said , a long time ago . Thirty years . " Ah , well , that 's before my time , sir ; but I reckon the bees wo n't have changed . Thirty years . Well , well ! So you used to stay here then ? " " No . . . I stayed with people called Martin . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live here of course , sir . That is to say , Miss Martin 's here . Mrs. Martin , she died just about five years ago . If you 'd like me to send a message to say that you 're here , it 's as easy as winking . The Old Vicarage , that 's where Miss Lucy  --  I should say Miss Martin  --  lives . It 's only just down the road . " " No , you need n't do that , " Mr. Hopkins said hurriedly . " I 'll stroll round there later . " He added , " Perhaps . . . " There was of course no " perhaps " about it . From the moment when the slip-coach deposited him , incongruously mixed with the funeral party , on the platform at Wychwood he had realized that his movements were no longer quite under his own control . He found it none the less difficult to nerve himself for the next step in his obligatory task . For years he had shrunk from the least threat of emotional disturbance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any he had ever faced . There was nothing in it , after all , he assured himself , that need really embarrass him ; he was merely , more out of duty than inclination , about to renew his acquaintance with an old friend . They would talk of old times  --  times so old as to have lost the power of moving either of them ; and when the polite conversation was ended and the proper inquiries made , he would take his hat and shake hands and return to the Inn  --  in a mood faintly sentimental perhaps , but otherwise matter-of-fact and entirely composed . That was all very well in theory . In fact , as he left the Inn and moved , in faint starlight , down the remembered road his legs trembled slightly and his heart beat faster than usual . When he reached the gate , his mind was divided between an intense , breathless curiosity and the desire to turn back . But he knew there was no going back . Whatever awaited him , he had to go through with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow flagged path was so familiar to his steps . On either side , in the starlight , he saw the spikes ofdaffodil-leaves and their pallid trumpets . He approached the porch and knocked at the door ; and as he did so he was aware that the whole progression of action and movement was an uncanny repetition of something that had happened before on the very first day he had ever visited that house ; and now , as if to accentuate the precise similarity , he saw as the door opened inward not the slim figure whose delicate enchantments he had always carried in his mind , but a woman , whom , if the landlord had not assured him she had been dead these five years , he would certainly have mistaken for Mrs. Martin . She was dressed in black . Her hair was a silvery-gray beneath brows that still were dark ; and though he could not see the color of her eyes , he knew they had tawny lights in them , like the bed of a Cotswold brook . The serene face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence . He said : " Miss Martin . . . I happened to be in the neighborhood , so I thought I 'd Iike to call on you . Of course I ca n't expect you to remember me . I 'm Gilbert Hopkins . " " Gilbert Hopkins ? How strange I was thinking of you only yesterday . Please come in . " He thanked her and followed her . The room was exactly the same . A wood-fire flickered on the ingle ; a spaniel lay curled on the hearth-rug ; a black cat passed Iike a shadow behind the chair to which she pointed him , and , in front of the other , stood a table and a tray laid with tea-things . " I was just having my supper and tea together , " she said . " I came in late from seeing one of mother 's old ladies . Wo n't you join me ? I remember you used to like our white clover honey .

All the time , as he sat there trying hard to recapture the immutable vision , he could not persuade himself that this woman was Lucy , that she was n't , in fact , Mrs. Martin . He told her how like her mother she was . " Yes , I suppose I am . I like to think so , " she said . " I must be just about the age mother was when first you came here . " She sighed . " That 's a long time ago . More than twenty-five years . " " Nearer thirty , " he said . " It 's incredible , is n't it ? " So they went on talking together while she finished her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least embarrassed . He almost wished that she were . It seemed unnatural that the air between them should be stirred by no waves of emotion . But it was n't in the least . They just sat there quietly talking over old times and what had happened in the village during the last thirty years ( which , it appeared , was next to nothing ) , and how Dick Martin had got on ( or rather not got on ) in the world , and what his wife and his children were like and what sort of a house they lived in somewhere in Dorset . The room seemed as familiar as if he had left it only the night before . It was all extremely peaceful and blandly domestic . The spaniel snored and growled at other dogs in his dreams , and the black cat came and rubbed its back against Mr. Hopkins ' shins just as its grandmother in the ninetieth generation had done thirty years before . And all the time the thing that troubled him was that he felt as though he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of his memory , but to her mother . He could n't get this impression out of his mind . When at half-past nine he knocked out his pipe on the identical spot in the fireplace where he had knocked it out when he was an undergraduate it seemed to him almost ridiculous that he should be leaving the house to sleep at the Inn . Lucy preceded him as far as the door to light the path with a fiashlamp . They stood on the threshold where dozens of times he had wondered if he could summon up courage to kiss her . But the idea of kissing Mrs. Martin had never occurred to him ; and when Lucy now shook hands with him , wished him good-night , the fingers that lay in his , though cool and soft , were not the soft , cool fingers whose touch had once thrilled him . She said calmly : " I 'm so glad you got into that slip-coach , Gilbert . I suppose it 'll be another thirty years before I see you again . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt him . " I should like to see you again to-morrow , " he said , " if I may . " " But I thought you said you were going back to London ? " " I think I 'll stay at the Coach and Horses a day or two longer . . . if you 'll let me , " he said , " If I 'll let you ... ? " " Good-night , " Mr. Hopkins said hurriedly . " Good-night . " " If you 'll come to tea , " she called after him , " you shall have some of your favorite honey . " He stayed at the Coach and Horses exactly three weeks . Every afternoon , at five o'clock precisely , he walked up the path where the daffodils faded and shrivelled , and knocked at the door . Every evening they sat in the firelight and talked . As time went on they talked less . It seemed as if they really had nothing left to talk about . During all this time , in his lonely walks through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he woke  --  for he was sleeping badly  --  Mr. Hopkins ' mind was fiercely debating the question : should he or should n't he ? Of one thing he was certain now , He was n't in the least in love with Lucy Martin  --  or rather with Lucy Martin 's mother , for that was what it came to . He was n't even sure that they had n't disastrously come to the end of each other ; that they had anything in common in fact but a store of memories some of which were much better forgotten . And yet . . . And yet the fact remained that nowhere else , since the day when he landed in England , had he felt so completely at home , so free from the feeling of being a spiritual alien , as by that familiar fireside and in her company . At the end of the third week he managed to make up his mind . As they sat in the firelight he suddenly asked her to marry him . For a moment or two she was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This serene composure in such an unusual situation was just what he might have expected of her  --  or at least of her mother . This was the sort of wife , he thought , that a middle-aged man ought to have . Yet as Mr. Hopkins waited for the complaisant answer which , he felt , was going to give him a comfortable home , quiet company , and complete emotional security for the rest of his life , he became uneasily aware of the gathering in the dark space between them of an atmosphere charged as it were with a high potential of feeling . The silence was like that which precedes a crackle of dry lightning ; and her voice when she spoke was not the comfortable voice whose tones he had found so soothing during the last three weeks , but harsh and intense . Strangely too , it was no longer the voice of Mrs. Martin , but that of the girl he had loved thirty years ago . " You have waited rather a long time to say this , have n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't exactly impulsive , Lucy , " he said . " After all , it 's only three weeks .. . " " Three weeks ? " she broke in with bitter scorn . " Three weeks ? You 're mistaken . It 's nearly thirty years ! " Mr. Hopkins shuffled uneasily . " Well of course if you like raking up the past . . . " " I do n't like it , " she said . " It hurts me too much . But I 'm going to do it . You came here thirty years ago with Dick and you fell in love with me . " " A . . . a boyish attachment . . . " " Please do n't interrupt me , Gilbert . You know that you fell in love with me as well as I do . And that would n't have mattered if you had n't made me fall in love with you too . " Mr. Hopkins gasped . " If I 'd even imagined . . . " " You did n't . Imagination was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shred of imagination to-day you would have realized that you could n't come down here like this and ask a woman whose whole life you had broken to marry you just to suit your convenience . I was in love with you  --  in real , devastating love , not your kind of love  --  for fifteen years . When you went away without speaking it nearly killed me . But that did n't stop my loving you . You meant everything to me . I was fool enough  --  mad enough , if you like  --  to go on believing and trusting that you had something in your mind that I did n't understand but ought not , because we loved each other so much , to question . I went on believing that you would come back . But you did n't come back . And one day  --  I suppose it was just about fifteen years ago  --  I suddenly woke up and came to myself as they say . Yes , I got up one morning and looked in the glass and saw not the gentle soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a hard , dry woman of thirty-five ; and from that moment I knew that I had wasted the best part of my life , thrown away the last chance of all the things that count most in a woman 's life  --  a home , companionship , children  --  for the sake of a childish dream and my romantic idea of a man who really meant nothing to me whatever . Then , if you want to know the truth , I began to hate you . I tore out of my life every single thing that reminded me of you . If I look hard , I thought , I 'm going to be harder than I look . I went on hating you bitterly for another ten years . But ten years is a long time to go on hating .. . or loving . I do n't hate you now , Gilbert : I have n't the slightest feeling for you , one way or the other . When mother died five years ago I saw for myself how short life is and how little things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why your wanting to marry me , if you really do want to , seems  --  how shall I put it ? ? faintly ridiculous . " " It would have been kinder , I think , " Mr. Hopkins complained , " if you had sent me away when I came here the other day . " " Kinder ? What do you mean ? You must n't expect me to be kind . You must n't expect me to be anything but what you made me . I wanted to see  --  surely that was natural enough  --  just what I had . . . missed . And I have . I know exactly . " She paused . " Wo n't you have some more tea ? " " I think I had better be going , " Mr. Hopkins said heavily . " I should like to get back to London this evening if I can . You do n't happen to have a timetable , do you ? " She laughed . " I 've never had such a thing in my life . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyway ? " " Then I 'll say good-by . It was good of you to put up with me . " She held out her hand . He took it . It was deathly cold . " If you 're ever in these parts again , " she said , " you 'll come and have tea with me , wo n't you ? " Mr. Hopkins , returning to the Inn in a breathless hurry , demanded a timetable . The landlord produced one with difficulty . It was three years out of date . " But that do n't make much difference , you know , sir , " he said , " because there 's no train stops at Wychwood after the five-thirty . " " I must get to London this evening , " Mr. Hopkins insisted . " Then I reckon you 'll have to get Jim HoHies to take you to Oxford in his car , " Mr. Morris said . " Sixpence a mile , he charges . It 'll cost you the best part of two quid afore you 've finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hopkins declared . " Go and get him at once . "
