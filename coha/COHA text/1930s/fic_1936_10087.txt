THE HURRICANEfrom one end of Oceania to the other . It is worthy to pass into the legends of the race . But to get on with the story  --  He did not speak again for some time , but sat with his hands clasped loosely , staring at the deck beneath his feet . The old priest gazed at him compassionately , observing the gaunt face , the eyes terribly inflamed by sea water , but more than this , the sombre indomitable expression within them . " Where are we , Father ? " he asked , presently . The priest pointed to the north . " Manukura is there , just over the horizon . " " And you are waiting here for . . . ? " For you . For night , if you would have it so . " " I escaped from prison three months ago . You knew , on Manukura ? " The priest shook his head . " We have had no news since the Katopua last came . She is expected again soon . Terangi was again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoulder . " My son , " he said , " I first saw you an hour after your birth . I watched you grow from babyhood to manhood . All the events of your life have been open to me . You trust me ? " " I do , Father . Wait before you speak further . When I escaped this last time , a guard of the prison was killed . " By you ? " THE HURRICANE 41 " Yes . He was at the gate of the prison yard . The gate was open to let the prisoners enter who had been working on the roads . It was a chance . I rushed at the guard . He fired his pistol at me and missed . I struck him on the chest , with my fist . Who would believe that such a blow could kill ? But so it was . The man was dead when they took him up . This I learned when hiding in the mountains . " You were innocent of the wish to kill him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Mako . The man had befriended me more than once . I wished only to escape . " " It is a grievous sin , but with God , the intent is all . He can forgive heavier ones in those who truly re-pent . " " But that will not give life to a murdered man , and so it will be judged by those who sent me to prison . If I am caught , I shall be sent to a place they call Cayenne . Where it is I do not know , except that it is far away . And those who are sent there never come back . " " Terangi ... " " Yes , Father ? " " No one knows that you have left Tahiti ? " " No one save you and Mako ; that is certain . They must be searching the mountains for me still ; but it may be suspected , by this time , that I have escaped elsewhere . " " What would you do now ? " 42 THE HURRICANE " I would see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child that I have never seen . Then let what will come . The little daughter is mine ? " " Can you doubt it ? " " I have been eager to believe it . There has been no one else , then ? " " Never ! Your wife has thought of no one but you. , , " Six years is a long time , and she is young . I could understand if . . . " The priest interrupted him sternly . " Never , I tell you ! You do her an injustice to hold such a thought ! " " I wished only to make sure . " " You do not know your wife . " " And what time have I had to know her ? We were but six weeks married when I was put into the prison . " Father Paul 's stern expression softened to one of compassion . He had no struggle with his conscience in deciding what his attitude toward the fugitive should be . Secular law was one thing , Divine law another . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the second , and he believed , as did everyone else on Manukura , except the Administrator , that Terangi was a deeply wronged man . Secular law could be implacably , inhumanly just . So it had been in Terangi 's case , but he well knew that de Laage took a different view of theTHE HURRICANE 43 matter . The father had little hope that the Administratorcould be kept long in ignorance of Terangi 's presence on the island . In a place where everything was known , and quickly known , concealmentwould be enormously difficult . There was no man or woman on the island who would not guard the secret as carefully as himself , but the children in their innocence might easily betray him . To avoid this possibility it would be best that none should know save Terangi 's nearest relatives : his wife and mother ; Fakahau , the chief , his father-in-law ; and Fakahau 's brother , Tavi . The priest was careful to impress upon Terangi the great need for caution . " I have been a hunted man too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " I shall be taken again , that is certain ; but I shall have some weeks , even months , perhaps , before they learn where I have hidden . The Administrator is now on Manukura ? " " No ; but he is expected to return with the Katopua . He has been visiting the islands to the south . " They then proceeded to discuss plans for the immediatefuture , and it was decided that Terangi should conceal himself on Motu Tonga , an uninhabitedislet eight miles across the lagoon from the settlement . Father Paul would inform only those mentioned of Terangi 's arrival ; the family could then take counsel as to what was best to be done . Sail was now gotten on the cutter . A little before sunset44 THE HURRICANEthey raised the land , but night had long since fallen before they were coasting along the lonely reefs of Motu Tonga . Mako ransacked the scanty supplies on board , preparing a little bundle of things for Terangi 's immediate needs : a waterproof tin containingmatches and tobacco , a pareu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other articles . These he rolled into a tight bundle covered with a piece of matting , and Terangi fastened it with a cord , high on his shoulders . The priest steered the cutter to within a few hundred yards of the reef . Great combers were breaking across it , but Low Island folk are as much at home in the surf as the fish themselves , and a night and a day of rest had restored Terangi 's strength . When they had run midway along the islet he shook hands with his rescuers , slipped over the cutter 's side , and struck out for the land . In the faint starlight he was soon lost to view , but they waited until they heard a distant halloo from the beach . The cutter then stood off to the northeast , and at dawn entered the pass by the village islet . CHAPTER IVYou will agree that chance had played a sorry trick upon those two young people . I am speaking of Terangi and his wife . Father Paul had told the barest truth in assuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of their marriage , and all through the years of his imprisonment she had lived for the day when she would have him at home again . As year followed year and the Manukura folk learned of the appalling sentence he had piled up by his repeatedattempts to escape , most of them gave up all hope of his return , but not Marama . She gloried in his unconquerable spirit and loved and respected him the more for what some of the older people called his stubborn foolishness . Other young men would have liked nothing better than to take the absent husband'splace , but none of them dared tell her so . However , when it became known that Terangi had sixteen years to serve , several hesitant offers were made to Marama . They were refused with vigorous scorn . She came , as did Terangi , from the best blood of the Archipelago . For all the chaotic social conditions46 THE HURRICANEthat followed the European conquest of Polynesia , pride of birth was not lost amongst its people . It was not an empty pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and that is true to-day . Fakahau , Marama 's father , was first on Manukura because he was the natural leader of his people , as his father and grandfather had been before him . The office of chief , under French rule , is elective , but the business of choosing one on Manukura was a mere formality . It would have been unthinkable that anyone except Fakahau could have been chosen . It is curious to reflect upon the antiquity of some of these Low Island families . That of the chief traced its descent back through more than forty generations . Terangi , too , was of the ariki class ; his family was second in distinction only to that of Marama . She was a handsome girl , the elder of Fakahau 's two daughters . Her skin was a light olive and her rippling , copper-colored hair framed the oval of her face to perfection . You observe that I speak of her with a certain enthusiasm . During my years out here , traveling from island to island , I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me add , in types of Polynesian beauty . I have yet to find a girl worthy to be compared with Marama . Tita , her little daughter , was six years old at this time . I have spoken of the unkindness of chance in separating the young parents so soon after their marTHEHURRICANE 47 riage . This was more than made up to them in the manner in which the family was reunited . Father Paul was not able to inform Marama of Terangi 's return . As it happened , she had gone to Motu Tonga two or three days earlier , and was there when Terangi swam ashore . Motu Tonga was the wildest and loneliest of the lands on Manukura reef . No copra was produced on this islet , which was left in its natural state . Its coconut palms were self-sown , growing as nature would have them among thickets of purau and the screw pine . The undergrowth was , in most parts , sparse and scattered : vines and hardy , shrublike trees found what nourishment they could in the coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several magnificenttou and pukatea trees , huge in size and centuriesold , that had been growing there in heathen times . Motu Tonga had been the site of the ancient settlement , but after European discovery and with the coming of the trade in copra and pearl shell , the village had been moved to the more accessible islet by the pass . Marama had gone , with Tita , to gather a particular kind of snail shell found in the coral sand of Motu Tonga . The work of gathering these shells would have been considered tedious by most women ; but those of Manukura , having leisure in abundance , loved the occupation , and from these almost microscopicshells , of various colors , they made beautiful48 THE HURRICANEhei , the shell wreaths worn by atoll folk on their pandanus hats , both as a decoration and to keep them from blowing away on windy days . They sometimeswent in parties on these excursions , half a dozen women together . They would take food and beddingwith them , build little shelters of fronds to sleep under , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a distraction in their lives , of which they never tired . As often as not they would go alone , or with some of their children , as Marama had done on this occasion . She and her daughter suited that lonely landscape . They gave it significance ; the sea birds themselveswere not more at home in it than those two . I like to think of them there , as they were on the day of Terangi 's arrival . Marama was in complete ignoranceof his presence , of course ; they had long been asleep when he swam in through the breakers , nor had they seen Father Paul 's cutter at dawn the following morning . It was Tita who discovered her father . Marama was preparing their breakfast over a fire on the outer beach and Tita had wandered off by herself along the shallows of the reef to the westward . Presently she came running back , too excited for speech ; not frightened , but in a child 's state of hushed astonishment when it sees something it ca n't account for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen was a man , asleep , not far from their camp . THE HURRICANE 49 " But who , Tita ? " " I do n't know , " the child replied . " You must know ! Is it Rongo ? Or Maviri ? Or Tamatoa ? " Tita shook her head at each of these suggestions . " It ' s no one , " she said . " Just a man , an ugly man . " Marama was puzzled by the child 's replies no less than by her manner . In a settlement so small as Manukura , everyone is known ; no child of six would have been at a loss to name any man or woman in it . " You saw his face ? " she then asked . Tita nodded . " It is covered with hair , like Father Paul 's . I could see only a little . Then I ran away . " The mother , who had been kneeling by the fire , rose to her feet . " Come , show me where he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the long slope of the outer beach and followed it westward for severalhundred yards . Presently the child drew back . " He ' s there , " she whispered , pointing to a clump of bushes a little distance before them . " Do n't go , Mother ! Perhaps it ' s a varua inc. ! " A century of contact with Europe has done little to lessen native superstition ; they still believe in spirits , both good and bad . An evil spirit is known as a varua ino . Father Paul believed in them as implicitly as did the natives themselves , but he had taught them that a good Catholic need have no fears in their presence . To make the sign of the Cross was to draw a charmed circle about one which no evil spirit could50 THE HURRICANE pass . The mother now did this and Tita the same The child clung tightly to her hand as they move soundlessly toward the screen of bush and peere through it . Terangi was stretched out on the sand asleep , just beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them . Marama recognized him a once . I leave you to imagine her astonishment and joy but she did n't cry out or try to waken him . Some- how , Terangi had come home . She did n't question herself as to how this miracle had taken place , although she scanned the beach for the sight of a canoe . He was sleeping like the dead , and the gaunt face covered with beard , the hollow eyes deep in their sockets , told her all that she needed to know of the sufferings he had gone through . Laying a finger on Tita 's lips , she seated herself with the child in her lap , where they could look at him . Tita 's curiosity was , naturally , great , and she could see from the expression on her mother 's face that there was nothing to fear . " Who is it ? " she whispered . " Your father , Tita . He has wanted to come home all these years , ever since you were a tiny baby . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the wicked men on Tahiti would n't let him . " " But now at last he has come . " " Who brought him ? Did he come alone ? " " Hush ! I do n't know . He is very tired . We must n't disturb him . He will tell us when he wakes up . The sun was well above the horizon by this time , and at first the low bush shaded him . Before the light could strike his face , Mararna gathered an armfulof pandanus leaves and quickly plaited them , making a little screen which she propped up at his side to shelter him . Tita became restless . Her father was a mere name to her and she was evidently disappointed at this first view of him . She was glad when her mother sent her off to play along the beach . It was midmorning when Terangi stirred and opened his eyes . Marama was sitting beside him , facing him . He stared at her vacantly ; then he sat up , scarcely believing in her presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amazonian type . On the contrary , she was what might have been called petite in figure , but now she got to her knees and gathered him in as a mother might have done , holding his head against her shoulder . She was too profoundlystirred for tears and clung to him with a combinedfierceness and tenderness , as though he were a child rather than a man  --  a child who had come to her for protection . She was bare-footed , bare-legged , dressed in the simple island fashion , in a flowered pareu fastened across her breast and reaching to her knees , and her hair fell loosely over her arms and shoulders . Terangi was naked save for a pair of52 THE HURRICANEragged dungarees , chopped off at the knee , in which he had swum ashore . Neither of them could find words , at first . Terangi put back her hair and held her face lightly between his hands , gazing into it as though he would never have done . Then he found his voice . " Marama , we are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure , after so many years . " " We three , " she replied " taha ? " We three , " and she pointed to where Tita was wading through the salt-water pools a hundred yards distant . She called to the child , who came running toward them and halted at a little distance , gazing solemnly at her father , with curious , appraising eyes . After a little urging she consented to sit in his lap and he stroked her dark hair and felt her sturdy arms and legs as though trying to convince himself of her reality . They remained there for half an hour or longer , too happy for much talk , but making tentative efforts now and then to build bridges of words across the abyss of time , nearly six years deep , that had separated them . Tita helped . Despite her father 's beard and his forlorn , unkempt appearance , her feeling of strangeness and disapproval soon vanished , and she prattled away as though he had always been with them . Marama got quickly to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I have half a dozen fine tingct-tinga which I caught early this morning , and a tin of beef , and rice and hard biscuits from Tavi 's store . I was ready to cook our breakfast when Tita came to tell me a very ugly man was asleep on the beach here . " Words soon came easily to both . They talked like two children , interrupting one another , as they returned to Marama 's camp . Her hut was a lean-to such as fishermen make for shelter on the uninhabitedislets , open toward the sea , which was ruffled to the deepest blue by the fresh southeast wind . Some coconut husks were smouldering in front of the hut . Marama gathered up a handful of leaves and dry sticks and placed them on the coals . Terangi fetched water from a small well , three or four feet deep . In the Low Islands , there are such shallow wells on most of the large motu , and they are used , chiefly , for washing clothes . The water is brackish at the bottom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marama tasted it . " Only a little salt , " she said . " It will do well for the rice . " An iron pot was hung over the fire and , while the water was heating , she broiled the fish on the coals beneath . Terangi climbed a near-by palm and threw down a dozen green drinking nuts . When the rice was cooked , Marama emptied into the pot a tin of beef that had been opened and left to simmer at the edge of the fire . She stirred the savory mess well so that the juices and54 THE HURRICANEthe rich gravy of the meat should be thoroughly mixed with the rice . Terangi sniffed the fragrant steam . " How good it smells ! " he said . But for all their hunger , when the meal was ready they set it aside to cool , having the native dislike for hot food . When they began , they ate slowly , with keen relish , talking little until the needs of the body had been satisfied . The meal was a ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food in any variety is scarce . They know the pleasure of anticipation and the sharp delight of eating . Marama gave him the news concerning their familiesand of the changes that had taken place during the years he had been absent : who had died , who married , what children had been born , and their names . Terangi then told her of his voyage , passing over it as briefly as he had in telling Father Paul , and how he had been picked up by the priest and Mako . Marama questioned him eagerly concerning the details , but soon gave over , seeing how unwilling he was to speak of that weary time . He said little of Tahiti and his experiences there , nor did he speak of the future . Like other men of his race , he had the precious faculty of recognizing present happiness and the wisdom to seize upon it , without forethought or afterthought . Women , whatever the race , are more practical ; nevertheless , Marama said nothing of plans throughout the day . It was not until late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HURRICANE 55 Tita was asleep , and they were lying on a mat , under the stars . " We must speak of What is to be done , " she said . You have a plan , perhaps ? " Terangi was long in replying ; then he said : " I have come home . I have you and Tita , and I shall see my mother once more . I shall stay as long as I can ... " " And then , what ? " " You know as well as I , " he replied , sombrely . " They will find me . " She sat up , taking his hand and holding it fiercely between her own . " Find you ? Never ! Believe that as I do ! Believe It for Tita 's sake if not for mine ! " Terangi shook his head . " I shall not blind myself to what will come . I shall be taken again . Soon or late they will come here . I know them too well . " The hopelessness in his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through his eyes , of an inexorable thing called the Law , from which there was no escape . ' To her , it assumed the shape of Monsieur de Laage : cold , courteous , impersonal . She shuddered inwardly at the thought of the glance of those blue eyes which saw so much , which seemed to read one 's very heart . She feared that , strive as she might , her manner would betray Terangi 's presence to the Administrator . One thing was certain : she must avoid meeting him , face to face , for as long as she could. 56 THE HURRICANE " What of this , Terangi ? " she asked , presently . " The Katopua is coming soon . Captain Nagle will go south this voyage , and east as far as Mangareva . We three could hide in the hold before she sails . The sailors are all Manukura boys . The captain could put us ashore at one of the unpeopled islands : Tematangi , or Maria , perhaps . " " He must not be told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are like a son to him . My own father could not have been kinder to me than he has been all the years you have been away . " " Think of the danger to him . He is a man of importance and well thought of by those at the seat of government . If it became known , great trouble would come to him . We must not call on him for help . He would give it gladly , to his own hurt . " " It need never be known . " " You deceive yourself , Marama . And even on Tematangi or Maria we would not be safe for long . Vessels sometimes call at those islands for firewood or to fish . They would be certain to find us . The sailors on most of the schooners are men from Tahiti . They are treacherous people and would like nothing better than to betray me . Every time I have been caught , a Tahiti man has told the police where I was hiding . There is a reward of five thousand francs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice posted on a tree in Tautira . " He broke off againTHE HURRICANE 57 and was silent for some time . " Let us speak no more of this , " he added . " We have this little time together . Let us not spoil it by thinking of what is to come . " They were in the midst of this conversation when they were startled by a low hail such as the natives use when approaching others unnoticed . Terangi sprang to his feet , but there was no time for concealment , nor was there need for it . The man was within a dozen yards of them . It was Fakahau , the chief , and with him Mama Rua , Terangi 's mother . She was a slender woman of sixty , with thick white hair which she wore in a single braid down her back . She was as resolute in character as her son , but the gentleness , the wistfulness , of age was in her face . Terangi was her only son , and all the love of her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had suffered during his imprisonmenthad aged her beyond her years , but while she felt keenly the wrong that had been done him and the cruelty of his prolonged punishment , her spirit had been neither crushed nor embittered by it . Marama ran forward to meet her ; then she walked aside with her father , leaving Terangi alone with his mother for a while . Presently they rejoined them . A stranger , looking on at the meeting , would not have guessed its significance . Tuamotu folk , particularlythe men , are not demonstrative at moments when their deepest emotions are engaged . Fakahau's58 THE HURRICANEpride in his son-in-law was as boundless as his admiration for his courage and resourcefulness , and Terangi , ever since his father 's death , had looked upon the chief in the light of a parent ; but the two men greeted one another as casually as though they had last met only the day before . Mama Rua clung to her son for a time , her head on his shoulder . Then she drew back , brushing away her tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It has done me good to weep a little . Now we must talk . We have little time . We must return to the settlement at dawn . Marama , you and Tita are to come with us . " " To-morrow , at dawn ! " Marama exclaimed . Her father spoke . " You can stay no longer now . The reason is plain . There must be no suspicion of Terangi 's presence here . " " But such a thing will not be thought of , " Terangi replied . " Even if it were , there is no man or woman on Manukura who would not shield him as eagerly as ourselves , " Marama put in . " They would bite their tongues out rather than betray Terangi . " Her father nodded . " It is true , " he said , " but think how much safer and better it will be if none save ourselves know . " " That is impossible , " Marama replied . " Such a secret can not be kept . Others are certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay on Manukura it would beTHE HURRICANE 59 impossible . Elsewhere he may be safe . You shall go with him , you and Tita . " Terangi looked up quickly . " Go ? Where ? " he asked . " Listen well , Terangi , " said the chief . " This plan we three have made : your mother , Tavi , and I. No time is to be lost , for the Katopua has been expected this week past . The Administrator will come back with her . You should be gone before he arrives . It is your freedom alone that matters . If the wind favors , you must go the moment our preparations can be made . " " But where ? " " To Fenua Ino . " " To Fenua Ino ? We three , alone ? " Marama asked , in dismay . " You would not wish to be left behind ? " Mama Rua asked quietly . " Never ! " the girl replied . " Where Terangi goes , I go , but I had not thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of ill-omen to me . What Manukura man has seen it except from the sea ? Who has ever set foot upon it ? " " Terangi 's grandfather has , and my father , and I with them , " Fakahau replied . " I was young , then , no older than you are now . It is not an evil place for all its name , and only eighty miles from here . Some old trouble happened there , so long ago that neither my father nor my father 's father knew what it was. 60 THE HURRICANEBut this I know : some of our people lived there in times long past . Then the island was abandoned ; they came to Manukura , bringing the bones of their dead , save those of one man who was my ancestor . The land was made forbidden , and so it has remained through all the years . " " I have passed the place a dozen times on the Kato pua , " Terangi remarked , " but none of us ever landed there . Captain Nagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two small motu on the reef and nothing more . The rest is bare coral washed over by the sea , mile after mile after mile . There is said to be an islet in the centre of the lagoon , but no such land is shown on the chart . If it exists , it lies at too great a distance to be seen from the reef . " " The land exists , and you shall go to it , " said Fakahau . " It was there the people lived in the ancient days . It was there I went with my father and your grandfather ; they wished to bring home the bones of our ancestor who had been left behind . My father knew where he had been buried and we found him . " " How great is the land ? " Terangi asked . " A score of families might live on it . It is good land , higher than any of the mote of Manukura . There is a narrow crooked passage through the reef on the northern side ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . The lagoon is full of shoalsTHE HURRICANE 61 for a distance of a mile or more ; then you have deep water to the islet , which lies almost in the centre of the lagoon . On a calm day it is a three hours ' paddle from the nearest point on the reef . " Marama and Terangi listened with intense interest . The girl 's eyes shone with a new light ; as for Terangi , he was another man . He said nothing , now , of waiting for what must come . " The very place ! " he exclaimed . " No white man has ever been told of the islet , " said Fakahau . " Once you are safely there , you can live with your mind at peace . You will never be found . You need have no fear of the place . The ancient tapu had never been removed , but this was done by my father at the time of our visit . " " Why , then , was it never made known ? " Marama asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt . Perhaps they thought it best that the land should remain a forbidden place in the eyes of all our people . I will not say , " he added , gravely , " that they may not have been given foreknowledge of the need there would be for a refuge there for one of our family , in years to come . So , at least , it has happened . We may well be grateful to them for their silence . " " A lonely place , " Terangi said , musingly . " We should see no one from year 's end to year 's end . For that I am prepared . But Marama and Tita ... " 62 THE HURRICANE " Lonely ? We three together ? " Marama replied . " Have no fears . We shall be happy where you are . " " You could not come with us , Mother ? " Terangi asked , hesitatingly . " But no , " he added quickly . " We should not think of it . The life would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply for some time , except to take his hand , stroking it gently . " It is what I would wish , " she said , " but it is not to be .. . . Terangi , I knew that you were to come home , though I did not speak of it to Marama . I wished her happinessto be unlooked for , and so it was . Your father came to me in a dream , twenty-six nights ago . There is no doubting what the dead tell us ; least of all , such a man as your father . He told me that I should see you here , on Motu Tonga . A little time only , and for the last time . " " And what more ? " " He told me that I should be with him soon , very soon . It is true . I know it . I feel it , " she added quietly . Her two children , son and daughter-in-law , listened , awe-struck and profoundly moved . Low Islandfolk believe as implicitly in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their open eyes . Who am I to say that such belief is absurd , the foolish credulity common to primitive folk ? I have seen too many of their dream propheciesfulfilled not to have , to say the least , an openTHE HURRICANE 63 mind in these matters . They know , as we do , that some dreams are mere nonsense , without significance ; but when their loved dead appear and speak to them , telling them what is to come , there is no doubt in their minds as to the truth of what they are told . If they remember their words and are convinced , upon awaking , that no mistake has been made in recallingthem , they act upon them with the same quiet assurance with which we accept any of the certaintiesof life . So it was with Mama Rua in this instance . She believed in her approaching death no less firmly than she had believed in Terangi 's homecoming ; and her listeners believed with her . Fakahau had already been told of the dream , and his confirmationonly added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were silent for some time , each of them engaged in his own reflections . Marama was the first to speak again . " You have yet to say , Father , how Tita and I are to go with Terangi . How can our absence be ex-plained ? " " This too we have thought of . It is a hard thing . ... We can see but one way . It must be believed that you and Tita have been drowned . " " Drowned . . . ! " " This can be arranged so that none shall suspect . When all is ready , you and Tita shall come again to Motu Tonga . A reason for the return can easily be64 THE HURRICANEfound . Two or three days later , when I know that you three have gone , I shall send here after you . Some of your clothing shall be found and the canoe in which you came , in such a way that all shall be-lieve . " " Truly believe ? Our own people ? " Marama asked . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our kinsmen alone shall know the truth ; it must be disclosedto no one else . Later , perhaps , others may be told , but not now ; not until some years have passed . For Terangi 's safety , nothing must be known , lest some careless word should betray him . Even now I could wish that Mako did not know . Good lad that he is , there is danger . He is too young to be trusted with such a secret . " " You have told Father Paul of this plan ? " Terangi asked . " No , " said Fakahau . " He would not wish to be told , of that I am sure . It is best for the father 's sake that we keep him clear , from this time on , of any knowledge of what we do . He will suspect , but will be saved from the burden of knowing . For the same reasons , Captain Nagle shall not be told . " " We shall need many things on Fenua Ino , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Fakahau , " which I will suppose has gone adrift and out the pass . Tavi is now preparing the things you will most need . There will be room for a good store of foodTHE HURRICANE 65 and supplies : tools , canvas , rope , pots and pans , clothing , bedding  --  nothing shall be forgotten ; you can depend upon us to see to that . At some future time I shall find means to visit you , never fear . " " When must we go ? " asked Marama . " You and the child must return here the day after to-morrow , in a small canoe . The village should witness your departure , thinking that you come again for shell gathering . That night the large sailing canoe will be loaded and ready and Mako will sail it across . For your sakes I dare not come again . The canoe is too heavy to draw across the reef and launch through the breakers . You must go out through the passage after the moon has set . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the westward in approaching the pass . If on that night the wind should not favor , you must wait here until it does . " " Short is the time we have together , " said Marama , sadly . " I am thinking of you , Mother , and Terangi . This one night and no more . " Mama Rua took the girl 's hand . " My child , it must be so , " she said. , " If I could have my way you would be gone before the new day comes . " CHAPTER VFAKAHAV had not been mistaken in urging the need for haste . Not that he considered the immediate danger serious ; but he wished to have Terangi safely away from Manukura before the Administrator 's return . This was not to be , however . The Katopua was sighted the following morning . The coming of Captain Nagle 's schooner was the great event in island life . I used to catch something of the excitement myself . For at least a week before she was expected , every youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would post themselves in the tops of the tallest coconut palms along the outer beaches and remain there for hours , each one eager to give the first shrill hail : " Te pahi ! Te pahi ! " that would be taken up from mouth to mouth and quickly passed along the entire length of the settlement . On that day all work was suspended . The women would get into their best finery and the men don their Sunday suits of white drill , and long before the schooner appeared in the pass , everyone on the island would be assembled at the landing place . The vessel brought bags of mail from distant relativesTHE HURRICANE 67 and friends , and the parau-api  --  the news . The members of her crew , from Captain Nagle to the cabin boy , well understood what was expected of them . They gathered the details of every event , no matter how trifling , that happened in the island world , and knew how to make the most of their stories . The events of the greater world beyond aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted most to hear was about old Paki of Fakarava , who had married a gay young wife ; about the Hikueru man who had found a pearl worth fifty thousand francs ; about the woman of Marokau whose arm had been bitten off by a shark ; about Terangi 's latest escape . These topics of conversation , elaborated in the most meticulous detail , were made to last a full six months . The Katopua carried to the world 's markets all the copra that the island produced , and everything consumed there  --  save coconuts and fish  --  was fetched in her capacious hold . Food , clothing , buildingmaterials , tools of every sort , the very tree cotton that filled the mattresses on which the people slept , came from Tahiti . The Manukurans could live  --  had lived for centuries  --  with none of these things , but copra made them rich , and what they earned , they spent . Some of the elders used to find it wearisometo exhaust their credits at Tavi 's store , but the young men and women had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be shelves68 THE HURRICANEfilled with gay new prints , tins of beef and salmon and fruit ; behind the counters were barrels of flour , cases of tea , coffee , tobacco , rice , and , in the long showcases , cutlery and jewelry of all sorts : knives , scissors , flash lamps , brooches , rings , and ear pendants of nine-karat gold . Stocks were usually low by the time of the schooner 's next visit , but when Tavi was sold out , as had happened more than once in the past , his clients returned to the simple life of their ancestors in a care-free manner which proved how little , at bottom , imported luxuries meant to them . The return of the Administrator made this latest arrival of the Katopua an event of more than usual importance . Fakahau was in the forefront of the crowd , wearing the tricolor sash of his office , with his brother , Tavi , beside him , and Madame de Laage on his right hand . De Laage had been absent for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the shoals we could see him with his binocularsleveled upon his wife . The moment they were alongside , he stepped over the rail and greeted her in his usual courteous , smiling manner . His pleasures and his duties were performed with the same unalterablerespect for decorum ; he was not the man to make a public display of his more intimate feelings . After a word or two with Madame de Laage , he turned to the chief . I could see how surprised he was not to find Father Paul present . He liked all the events of life to fall into their customary places , THE HURRICANE 69 and Father Paul 's absence on schooner day was , indeed , extraordinary ; such a thing had not happened within memory . Nevertheless , de Laage proceeded as usual , shaking hands and chatting for a moment with Fakahau , Tavi , and myself , then standing with Madame de Laage while all the men and women of the island came forward to welcome him home . This ceremony concluded , he retired to the Residency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a clearer picture of de Laage . He was a tall , spare man , with prominent blue eyes , a bald spot at the crown of his head , and a large , straw-colored moustache . There was Flemish blood in him . In temperament he resembled the English rather than the French type of administrator . He believed in the mission civilatrice , in education on European lines for the natives , in the necessity for maintaining white prestige . A devout Roman Catholic and a Royalist under the skin , he regarded science as a kind of heresy , liberal thinking with aversion , and politics as a game for the vulgar . He was not ambitious . The fact that he had remained in the Tuamotu for eighteen years  --  a post extremely distasteful to him  --  sufficiently indicatesthat he was not moved by a desire to get on in life , and no doubt the authorities at home were glad to have so dependable a man in the position . He was guided by another motive than the wish to rise : a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dominated70 THE HURRICANE every act of his life . As for his integrity , no man , white or native , had ever questioned it . His reading was confined almost entirely to L'Action Francaise , to which he was the only sub- scriber in this part of the world . Immense bundles of the little Royalist daily reached him twice a year when the schooner came in . These he arranged in order of dates , and each morning , when he sat down to his fruit , eggs , and coffee , he opened " to-day 's " newspaper , then anywhere between six and eight months old . The shelf in his office contained all the books he possessed : a few volumes of law , manuals for the guidance of officials , and one arid-looking tome on the Science of Administration , which was a kind of Bible for him . In a place like this , successful administration con- sists in stopping trouble before it starts , and the official must know , above all , what is going on . He is the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there is a good deal of litigation about land , the titles to which are based upon genealogy , it is essential to have some idea of the rights of each case in advance . The best administrator , in a way , is the best listener , and the native  --  even the exceptional man who knows a little French  --  will speak his thoughts only in his own tongue . To work with an interpreter is to learn only what the interpreter desires one to learn . After his eighteen years in the Group , de Laage did not know eighteen words of the language  --  at any rate , he was never heard to pronounce them . The truth is that he was a born chef de bureau . Without his wife , he could never have made a success of hi : job . When he went to the war , in 1914 , Madame de Laage remained on Manukura . Officially , there wa ! no Administrator ; actually , she carried out her husband'sduties so capably that the islands have never been better governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of the Tuamotu : an ancient , beautiful , highly inflected speech , capable of infinite shades of meaning . Madame de Laage spoke it fluently , with a lack of accent that was positively startling when one glanced at the speaker . Small enough to be called doll-like , with a gift for dress that always made her fresh and charming , even on a cutter voyage , she looked like a girl in her twenties until one saw her face . Even then one would hardly have guessed her age within ten years . The tropical sun seemed powerless to harm her complexion ; she preserved her fresh coloring well into middle life , but it was her eyes that first attracted attention . They were dark , almost black , and alight with intelligence and interest in the world . Most women in her position would have expired of loneliness and ennui , but her life , I am sure , was truly happy . I doubt whether she was ever bored72 THE HURRICANE with her own companionship ; she had too many re sources within herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of her piano , which she her self kept in tune . Unlike her husband , she was great reader , and the books in their library were al hers . A sister in Paris kept her supplied with post war fiction , drama , biography , and the like , but he tastes were not confined to general literature . Sh had a fine collection of works on Polynesia , from th eighteenth-century volumes of exploration to moder treatises on anthropology , botany , on the fish in th lagoons and the shells to be picked up along the reefsIn character , the man and wife were as unlike a the books each read . In his honest , straightforwar way , de Laage looked up to his superiors and down o those he considered beneath him . Madame de Laag looked neither up nor down , regarding all men an women as fellow human beings , interesting an worthy of respect . She could go into any hous on Manukura and spend an agreeable evening wit the women , joining in their tasks and taking part i discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . She could weave a hat orpandanus mat with the best of them , or design an sew one of the native patchwork quilts . She neve wearied of exploring the minds of her companions for the differences of outlook which usually ac as barriers between races were to her no barriers a all . I am sure that she looked forward withoupleasure to the day when her husband would be transferred to another field , or , failing that , be pensioned off at last to return to France . She was his superior in many respects , and must have been aware of the fact . I believe that she was genuinely fond of him ; it may have been because he had such need of her . Certainly , there was no question of his love . He was a lonely man , intensely reserved ; all the warmth of his nature was centred upon his wife . When away from her he suffered tortures of anxiety . I have made voyages with him when my heart went out to him on this account . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing him as I did , I also knew how utterly lost and miserablehe felt when absent from home . It was their custom , on the day the schooner came , to have Father Paul , Captain Nagle , and myself to dinner with them . I went with the captain that evening , rather earlier than usual . Madame de Laage appeared in the doorway to receive us , and a moment later her husband stepped out on the verandah in the mess jacket to which he never failed to change for dinner . He informed us that Father Paul had sent word asking to be excused . " It ' s extraordinary ! " he added . " I 've never known him to miss one of our dinners in all the years we have been here . And he was not at the wharf this morning . Have you seen him , Doctor ? He ' s not ill ? " 74 THE HURRICANE I replied that I had seen him at work in his garden early in the afternoon . " I ' m profoundly glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Laage said , feelingly . " Eugene have you told them the news ? " The Administrator sighed . " I have not wanted to think of it , " he said . " I have spared Captain Nagle thus far , but you will both have to share it with us , soon or late . I may as well tell you at once . It is this : in the bag of mail you brought for me from Tahiti , Captain , I found a letter from the Bishop . He has set me a task . . . a task , he frankly admits , that he has no heart for . In a word , Father Paul 's Order has recalled him to France . " Madame de Laage turned to me . " Think of it , Dr. Kersaint ! What stupidity ! What injustice to uproot Father Paul after all these years ! It will kill him ! I know it ! What can Monseigneur be think- ing of to consent to such a cruel thing ! " It is not a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laage replied . " He realizes as we all do what this will cost Father Paul . You must know how the religious Orders are administered . The discipline is almost military ; commands from headquarters must be obeyed without discussion . The Bishop tells me that he wrote a four-page letter to Father Paul , at- tempting to soften the shock , and then tore it up . He has passed on to me the task of delivering these iarsh orders with whatever words of comfort I can summon . Captain Nagle was as shocked as myself at the news . ks for Madame de Laage , she could scarcely keep back ; he tears as we spoke of it . She perceived much pore vividly than her husband the full cruelty of the situation . For more than fifty years , Manukura and ; he half-dozen neighboring islands had been Father Paul 's world . Never in all that time had he even ; one so far afield as Tahiti . No man could have ived a happier , more useful life . Now he was to be ieprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which all his heart was centred , and of his last wellmrnedpleasure which he regarded with serene anticipation : being laid to rest , by his children , as he : ailed them , in the coral sand of the island he loved . " But why should they want him in Paris ? " Madame 3e Laage asked . " He sha n't go ! We must n't let bim go ! Eugene , do n't let him know ! There must be a way to prevent such an unkind plan from being carried out . " " I have no doubt they have excellent reasons for wishing his return , " her husband replied . " What possible justification would I have for failing to deliver to Father Paul the commands of his Order ? He would not thank me for such mistaken officiousness in his behalf . No ; much as he will hate to go , he is a soldier of the Church . His duty is to obey . " 76 THE HURRICANEMadame de Laage was silent for a moment . " It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be told , but do n't let it be at once . Captain , you mean to call again here before returning to Tahiti ? " " Yes , " said Nagle ; " I am going to Mangareva this voyage . I shall be back at Manukura in a month 's time . " " Then wait , Eugene , until the Katopua returns before telling Father Paul ! This will give him one more month of happiness . " " Nothing is to be gained by putting off unpleasant tasks , " her husband replied . " The Bishop asked me to let the father know at my earliest convenience . " " Please , for my sake , " his wife urged . " The delay wo n't matter in the least , since he ca n't go in any case until the schooner returns . " She pleaded with him so earnestly that the Administratorconsented to the delay , but it was plain that he was disturbed about it . A moment later Arai came to announce that dinner was on the table . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fakahau , and lived at the Residency in a relationship peculiar to Polynesia : half servant , half companion and friend to Madame de Laage . For all their pride of birth , Polynesians are the most democratic of people . No tasks are considered menial , and a chief 's daughter could serve at the Administrator'stable without any loss of dignity or prestige . I learned long afterward that Arai knewTHE HURRICANE 77 of Terangi 's return ; in fact , all the immediate members of the two families had been informed , but there was nothing in her manner on this evening that could have betrayed the presence of the secret she shared . It was natural that our talk , during the course of the meal , should have drifted to Terangi 's latest escape . The whole island was , of course , discussing it ; I had heard but little else throughout the day . The Administrator informed us that he had received a communication on the subject from the Governor of Tahiti . " Terangi has been playing the very devil there , " he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intractable prisoner and the authorities are determined to capture him . I am aware , Captain Nagle , that he was once your protege . It may be that the question is an unfair one ; nevertheless , I shall ask it . Do you think there is a chance of his making his way here ? " I have no doubt that Nagle thought , secretly , that there was an excellent chance , but he was not to be caught off his guard . " You do n't believe , Monsieur de Laage , that he would compromise me by stowing away on my ship ? " he asked , smiling . " Never ! " Madame de Laage put in warmly . " I know him too well to suspect that . " " I am certain that he could never do it with your consent , " de Laage replied , " but I ca n't share your78 THE HURRICANEbelief in this young man 's delicacy of feeling . Your sailors are all Manukura boys . They would gladly conceal him aboard , if they could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tahiti share your belief , " Nagle replied , drily . " They made a thorough search of my ship before we left Papeete . It is n't the first time by any means . They even examined my large sea chest and the drawers under my bunk . " " Do n't imagine for a moment that I suspect that you would connive at the business . You would do me a great injustice if you supposed that . I am thinking of the natives of the Tuamotu . They would shield him on any of the atolls . Granted that he could not hide in the Katopua , it strikes me that he might work his way out here little by little , traveling from island to island in cutters or sailing canoes . He would certainly attempt this if it were at all possible . " Captain Nagle shook his head . " He would have come long since if there had been any chance of it , " he replied . I observed that Arai , who was serving the fish course , was listening with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance that missed its mark , for he went on :  --  " The Governor wrote to put me on my guard . It ' s astonishing where Terangi can have got to . He escaped more than three months ago and Tahiti has been searched from end to end without result . NotTHE HURRICANE 79 only Tahiti : all of the other islands of the Society Group have been thoroughly combed without a trace of the man being found . The police believe that he has somehow gotten clear of the Archipelago . They suspect that he is already somewhere in the Tuamotu and that Manukura is his goal . They 've had more than enough of this incorrigible fellow . He has made a mock of all lawful authority . I thoroughly agree with them . Such things ca n't be permitted . Cayenne is the only place for such characters . The Governor informs me that he is to be sent there when he is taken again . " An awkward pause followed . De Laage realized of a sudden that his zeal had led him to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took advantage of the silence to fill the glasses once more , and we were soon speaking of other matters . CHAPTER VIMANUKURA village was deep in the profound slumber of the hour before the dawn . The booming of the breakers along the outer reef , now loud , now muted in the flaws of the light breeze , thundered an unceasingaccompaniment to the people 's dreams , a sound of which they would only have become aware had it ceased . High among the fronds of the palms , noddy terns perched with their young , croaking with long-drawn , muffled tones . Here and there , behind the outdoor kitchens , swine grunted softly , rooting in the soft coral sand for left-overs from the evening meal . A flock of curlews , on their annual flight to their Arctic breeding grounds in Asia or North America , passed overhead with lonely piping cries . Presently , far off at the eastern end of the islet , a rooster crowed , and cock after cock took up the challengingcall . The colony of maina birds roosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakened all at once and burst into a chorus of whistles and twitterings . Slowly the gray light from beyond the horizon gave place to the flush of dawn . In two houses of the settlement there had been THE HURRICANE 81little sleep that night . Both the chief and his brother , Tavi , had been busy with the preparations for Terangi 's departure . There had been need for the greatest secrecy in this matter , and the work of collecting the supplies had taken place in the small hours of the morning ; they were stored , well concealed , in the canoe shed belonging to Fakahau . All the preparations were now completed . It remained only to wait for another night , when Mako would sail the great canoe to Motu Tonga . By the dawn of the third day , Terangi , Marama , and their daughter would be out at sea , their canoe well below the circle of Manukura 's horizons . For all his sleepless night , Tavi was at his place behind the counter of his store at the usual time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for an hour or two in the early morning it was as much as Tavi and his older children could do to take care of the eager press of customers . Tavi was a huge man , like Fakahau , with thick black hair lightly sprinkled with gray . He was a true cosmopolitan , having left Manukura in boyhood . He had spent many years at sea and there were few large ports , the world over , that he had not visited ; but he had returned home at last to marry a Manukura woman , well content with what he had seen and learned of the ways of other peoples . He was a man of fine intelligence , a shrewd observer , and could have missed little , during his roving life , worthy of attention. 82 THE HURRICANEI used to spend evenings without number in Tavi 's company . A more amusing and interesting companionwould have been difficult to find . No man on the island took a greater interest in Terangi , or had been so thoroughly pleased to learn of his many escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police of Tahiti . He was as proud of his niece 's husband as though he had been a blood relative , and Fakahau himself was not more determined that he should never again fall into the hands of authority . On this morning , when the press of business for the day was over , Tavi set out along the village street in the direction of the cemetery . The houses of Manukura were scattered for a mile or more along a single wide roadway that followed the curve of the lagoon beach . There was not a prettier village in the whole of the Archipelago , nor one in which the inhabitants took greater pride . They kept it scrupulously clean ; fallen fronds and leaves were carefully swept up and burned each day , and owing to the sparseness of the undergrowth , one had a series of charming views . The Residency stood at the far western end of the village , near the passage into the lagoon . It stood in its own grounds a hundred yards from its nearest neighbor . Tavi 's store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a verandah in front , faced the lagoon beach near the coral pier where the schooner was moored . SomeTHE HURRICANE 83 little distance farther to the east was the chief 's house , and across the road from it the little thatched home of Mama Rua . Beyond this again was a depressionin the land which crossed the islet from north to south . It had been made , evidently , by some great storm in the past , and as the ground was moist and swampy there , a footbridge had been erected over it . On the opposite side stood the church , and here another path branched northward to the cemetery . Manukura 's dead slept in a lonely plot of ground by the outer beach , three hundred yards distant from the church . The place had been a sacred one long before Commodore Byron 's discovery of the island , for the temple of the old god , Tangaroa , stood there , and three ancient pukatea trees near by had been planted in his honor . No trace remained of the heathen temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , but something of the ancient atmosphere of sacredness seemed still to linger in the air , as if the heathen god 's presence were tolerated by the God of Father Paul . The fringing reef was little more than a stone 's throw distant , where , all day long , the smoke of the breakers drifted away to leeward , shot through with rainbow lights , half veiling the surf when the swell was high . Save for the old trees and the greenish gloom beneath them , the burying ground was all white : the coral sand , the low wall that surrounded it , 84 THE HURRICANEthe blossoms of the flowering shrubs , the headstones of the dead  --  even the ghost terns that sailed back and forth like tiny voiceless spirits were as white as snow . No sound of life in the village reached this place . In the cool of the early morning or evening , husbands or wives or mothers would come to spend an hour beside some grave , deriving pleasure from a sense of the physical closeness of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , Manukura cemetery was not an unhappy place . Here it was that Tavi found Fakahau standing with Mama Rua at her family burial plot , directing the labors of two young men . They had finished digging a grave and were now erecting above it a little roof , supported on four posts , to keep out the sun and rain . Close by , sheltered with a roof of corrugated iron , long since red with rust , was the tomb of Mama Rua 's husband . The headstone was a slab of whitewashed cement , inscribed : " Nui Matokia , 1868-1919 . " The headstone of another grave was so weathered that the inscription was barely decipherable : " Terangi Matokia , 1881 . " Terangi 's grandfather lay here , born in pagan times when no man knew his age . Three or four women were buried in the same plot , as well as two children who had died in the influenza epidemic of 1918 . Tavi joined the little group in silence , looking on as the chief directed the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polynesians wouldTHE HURRICANE 8 have found something fantastic in the scene , had h known the circumstances , but none of those presen considered it in that light , nor did the rest of th Manukura folk . All knew by this time that the spiri of Mama Rua 's husband had appeared to her in dream , telling her of the imminence of her death and they no more doubted that the prophecy woul be fulfilled than they doubted the rising of to morrow 's sun . It was fitting that the members o her family should proceed at once to make read her last resting place . " Let the posts be painted white , " Mama Rua wa saying ; " and it is time that the roof over my husband grave was changed . You will see to this , Fakahau ? The chief nodded as he laid a hand on the ol woman 's shoulder . " Come and sit in the shad Mama . The sun grows over-warm . " Nui has waited long for you , Mama , " said Tav " Can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head as they walked slowly to th nearest tree and seated themselves there , out of hear ing of the men at work on the grave . " No , " sh said ; " I have seen my boy as I was told that I shoul My time is at hand . I would see him once more , I could , " she added wistfully . It is hard , having s little time with him after all these years . A fe hours  --  no more ! I must be content with that . " Shall we wait another day ? " Tavi suggested . " could send a small canoe to-night , to fetch him ove86 THE HURRICANEYou could meet him at the far end of the islet when all are sleeping . " The old woman shook her head . " The risk would be too great , " she replied , firmly . " They must go to-night , as we have planned . . . . Fakahau , I should like the singing to be at your house . " " It shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marama ? She has Tita with her ? " " She will not let the child out of her sight . There will be little danger on that account . It is your son I fear , Tavi . Mako has the secret in his eyes . " " I have cautioned him well , " said Tavi . " He is not to leave the house this day . " " Coffee ! Was that on the list ? " Mama Rua asked , abruptly , after a moment of silence . " Yes , " said Tavi . " Nothing has been forgotten , Mama . Set your mind at rest . The coffee is with the other things , well packed in a small cask . " " There is room and to spare in the big canoe , " said Fakahau . " Every tool they will need can be taken . Sugar , rice , flour  --  they will not lack even such things for many months . " Mama Rua sat with her hands clasped lightly in her lap , gazing to the north across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook her head . " It is a hard choice for them , " she said . " I am thinkingof your daughter rather than my son . A lonely life it will be for her and Tita . " " My daughter 's place is with her husband , " saidTHE HURRICANE 87 Fakahau . " We must not grieve for them . They are young and strong . They have their child , and others will come . " " One thing you have not thought of , Tavi , " said Mama Rua . " Let Marama 's frigate bird be taken with them . When it returns we shall know that they have arrived safely . " " Aye , that will be well , " said Tavi . " I will catch it when I return to the village . " They broke off their talk as they observed Madame de Laage approaching . The chief stood up to greet her . She seated herself beside Mama Rua , who took her hand between her own , stroking it gently . For all her years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Laage had never been able to accustom herself to the native attitude toward death . The realization that Terangi 's mother , bright and active for her years , had decided to die and was supervising the preparation of her own grave inspiredin her an emotion bordering upon horror . She had seen others , old men and women , apparently in the best of health , do the same . The sudden cessationof the will to live , and the calm acceptance of what they believed was their fate , were incomprehensible to a European . Strangest of all , there was nothing morbid in the native character ; certainly , despite the teachings of Christianity , their thoughts were never shadowed by the problem of evil , nor by reflections concerning the cruelty and the futility88 THE HURRICANEof life . Mama Rua wanted to be with her husband , that was all . Now that he had called her , she would go , and willingly . " You have your husband , " she said , as she continued stroking Madame de Laage 's hand . " Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her old friend 's gentle voice and the touch of her hand brought a sudden dimness to Madame de Laage 's eyes . " Aye , Mama , " she replied , softly ; " tei iaoe . You know what is best . Perhaps I understand , a little . " She then spoke quietly of other matters with these old friends , but soon rose to go , perceiving with her woman 's intuition that they wished to be alone . As she walked slowly back along the path to the church , a realization came to her of the immense remoteness of her life from that she had known as a girl , in Europe . What would her sister in Paris think of such a scene as that she had just witnessed ? How fantastic life would seem to her in these scattered island worlds ! But not more so than the islands themselves , minute ringed shoals , microscopic in size , compared with the vast ocean round about . She halted before Father Paul 's small coral-lime house which stood not far from the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door to his little reception room stood open ; there was no one within . She went on to the gate leading into the garden and looked in . Madame de Laage loved this place , as indeed we allTHE HURRICANE 89 did . The garden was a truly remarkable one to be found on a low island . The work of creating it had been a labor of love with Father Paul over nearly half a century . Tropical fruits and flowers common to the high islands will not grow on the atolls unless planted in high-island earth . Little by little , with extraordinary patience , zeal , and skill , the father had fashioned a little paradise , two acres in extent , sheltered from the sea winds by a wall eight feet high . Captain Nagle had had his share in the work ; he never came to Manukura without bringing the priest two or three tons of rich volcanic earth , in copra bags , from Tahiti or the Marquesas .

His breadfruit , lime , and orange trees were as fine as any to be seen on the high islands . He had laid out paths , shaded with banana and papaia trees , flower beds , small lawns , and arbors covered with flowering vines whose fragrance had never before perfumed the air of a low island . There was nothing throughout the Archipelago to be compared with this garden , and it was typical of its creator that its fruits were reserved for his parishioners : the children , the old , the sick . His reward , and he found it ample , had been the joy of making it , and continued to be the joy of improvingit . Madame de Laage found him hard at work there , 90 THE HURRICANE his rusty old soutane tucked up under its cord , help ing as well as overseeing some boys who were mixin a heap of rich reddish soil with decayed coconu husks and coral sand , preparatory to filling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here you find me , my child , " he said , looking u at her approach .

" " It is certain to thrive , Father , under your care , " Madame de Laage replied . " Let us hope so . If it does half as well as thi mango , I shall be well content . Have you seen finer fruit than these on Tahiti ? " He pointed to a basket containing half a dozen fruit , on a bench near by . " They are for Tavi 's daughter , she who will soon have her child . Will you take them to her on your way home ? But keep one for yourself . " " She shall have all . There could be no kinder gift . Women 's appetites are fickle at such a time .

You look sad , or do I imagine this ? You have had no bad news in your letters from France ? " " I have come from the cemetery , " Madame de Laage replied . " Mama Rua is there , with Fakahau . Her grave is ready . Will she die , Father ? " " But it is certain , " the priest replied , quietly . " You have seen it happen with our old people before . " " I know ; but it is so strange , so unnecessary , so ... " So unnatural , you would say . I do not think so . What is natural is not only what we Europeans know . I have lived on Manukura too long to believe that . " " But she is so full of life . I ca n't believe it possible that we are to lose her . " " She knows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death troubles you now . It will not be so when you are old like Mama Rua and me . I too have my grave ready . " He smiled as he pointed with the stem of his long pipe to a shady corner of his garden where , in fact , Father Paul 's own grave had long since been made . " You see ? I am a true native ; I ought to be , after so many years . Like the others , I wish to be prepared . But I shall not go soon . No , no ! Not for many years . I shall live to be one hundred . And I could wish to live one hundred more ! " " You have no desire to go home again ? " " Home ? " " To France . To see our dear country once more . " The old man shook his head , quietly .

But what a talk of graves and dying we have had ! And here is my fine young avocado tree to plant ! " The Administrator had spent all of that day at his desk . Over the large , immaculate table where he worked hung a portrait in oils of his father , a vet- eran of the Franco-Prussian War , in the uniform of a colonel of infantry . The old gentleman , who bore a striking likeness to his son , stood with a hand on his sword , the upper part of the figure in sharp relief against a curtain of velvet , looped back to give a glimpse of a smoke-dimmed battle scene . De Laage had commanded a battalion of the same regiment in 1918 , and on the opposite wall his own photograph in his major 's uniform faced the portrait painted in a more romantic age . There was only one other pic- ture in the room : a double-page in color from L'Il- lustration , in a narrow frame of dark wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paix in War Time , " and imparted to me , at least , the very breath and spirit of those stirring days . It was one of those hazy , autumn afternoons at the hour just before the lights began to twinkle on the streets . The kiosque of a news vendor was in the foreground , with the crowded pavement and the famous terrace beyond , where sol- diers of all the Allied armies were sipping their drinks at the little tables . Whether or not this picture aroused any emotion in de Laage , I ca n't say . I never heard him speak of it . In his office his mind was , I think , wholly engrossed in his work . He took deep pleasure in making his reports , worded in polished , academic French , and written without a blemish in his fine , regular hand . His returns on vital statistics , on the imports and exportsof the Archipelago , on transfers of land and the proceedings of the various land courts over which he presided , were positive works of art . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but transitory : to be glanced at by some clerk who would jot down a hasty notation before consigning them to the central archives . If so , the thought was not permitted to interfere with the satisfaction he derived in composing them . His office was a refuge from disturbingreflections of whatever kind . When he closed the door and glanced about him at the rows of manuals on their shelves , his letterpresses , the chairs for visitors aligned along one wall , the files where at a moment 's notice he could lay his hand upon any one of a thousand papers , and the inexhaustible supply of official forms and writing materials stowed away in drawers for each size and kind , he felt the pleasure of a creator contemplating the small ordered world he has made . Outside of his office , unoccupied with routine tasks ; he was less sure of himself . There were decisions to be made , judgments to be given on matters still in94 THE HURRICANEtheir fluid state , that had not yet solidified for comfortablehandling in reports of things past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter . Neither he nor his wife referred to it again , either at dinner or later during their eveningon the verandah , where he smoked his cherootwhile she played through the new music she had receivedfrom France . Nevertheless , the conviction that he had been remiss in his duty worried him profoundly . He should have informed Father Paul at once , as the Bishop had requested , but he had promised his wife to withhold the news until the Katopua returned . His word to her would have to be kept . He retired at ten , slept badly for an hour or two , and found himself wide-awake once more , still thinking of Father Paul . Liking and respecting the priest as he did , every day of delay would make the task of telling him the harder , and he was deeply grieved , as much upon his wife 's account as upon his own , at thought of the change that would be brought into the life of their little community by the departure of the priest . Who would be sent to replace him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never fill the place of Father Paul . Endeavoring to dismiss these unpleasant thoughts from his mind , he fell to thinking of Terangi and what the Governor had written concerning him . Was it possible that the fellow might find his way back to Manukura ? He would try , certainly . All of his THE HURRICANE 95 people were here . Nagle was a thoroughly honest man . It was n't likely that Terangi could succeed in stowing away on his schooner , but all the Tuamotu people were making a hero of him ; a cutter would be placed at his disposal at any island of the Group . It would be a simple matter to land a solitary passenger on one of the remote Manukura islets and sail away , leaving no one the wiser . Compounding a felony meant nothing to these people where one of their own race was concerned . It was bad , this lack of respect for the law , due , no doubt , to slackness in administration . De Laage tossed restlessly in his bed , wondering whether he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . Had he been too easy-going in his own administrative policies ? That , certainly , had been the case on Tahiti with respect to the enforcement of police and prison regulations . Terangi 's numerous escapes , apparently at will , offered convincing proof of the fact . Justice should be well tempered with firmness in dealing with the inhabitants of all these islands . They were only too ready to take advantage of what they considered weakness on the part of the authorities . De Laage consulted his watch by the light of his flash lamp . It was past one o'clock . He rose , dressed , stepped out on the verandah , and then proceededalong the path that led by the outer beach , away from the village . It was a beautiful night , cool and cloudless . He hoped that a three-mile walk to96 THE HURRICANEthe eastern end of the islet and back along the lagoon beach would ensure a sound sleep upon his return . The path was a lonely one ; there was not a house of any sort along the outer beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on so small a place there were trails everywhere , and this one was used by the men when fishing along the reefs , and often by the women when going to wash clothes after a rainfall , in the pools of fresh water among the rocks . The moon was well down toward the horizon , and de Laage was conscious of a feeling of solemn pleasure as he watched the silvery light flashing along the concave mirrors of the combers as they rose to crash down on the reef . There was a certain beauty in a low-island land and seascape on such a night : that he admitted ; but there had been opportunity in his eighteen years of atoll service to enjoy it well past the point of weariness . How many times had he taken this same walk on just such nights ? Not often , in late years ; that was true . In fact , considering the matter , he could not remember having left the grounds of the Residency , after dinner , during the past year and more . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islet . Crossing over to the lagoon side , he seated himself on the beach to watch the setting moon , and remained there for some time , enjoying a vacancy of mind refreshing and soothing after his troubled reflectionsof the hour before . Turning his headTHE HURRICANE 97 presently for an idle glance across the islet , he observed that someone was approaching from the direction of the village . It was a lad who moved at the quick , shuffling trot of the heavily burdened , and who carried a pole over his shoulder with a five-gallon kerosene tin hanging at either end . The **25;4185;TOOLONG his back and turned to regard the intruder with an intent stare . The policeman in him was suddenly very wide-awake . What could this young fellow be doing at such an hour ? What was he carrying in those tins ? Water , of course ; they were used for nothing else , but who could want water carried here ? The lad passed in the moonlight without perceiving the watcher , and disappeared in the shadows of a thicket farther along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came upon him as he was setting down his burden alongside a large sailing canoe , concealed among the trees at the water 's edge . Suddenly aware that he was not alone , the boy gave a violent start and seemed half-minded to make a run for it . His expression of terror further aroused the Administrator 's suspicions . He glanced at his face , revealed in the moonlight , and recognized him at once . It was Mako , the young son of Tavi , who had for some time been acting as the sailor and deck hand on Father Paul 's cutter . " What are you doing here ? " the Administrator98 THE HURRICANEasked . The boy made no reply . De Laage bent forward to look into the canoe . It had been packed with supplies of various kinds : axes , fishing spears , cooking utensils , bedding , with boxes and bundles carefully stowed away in all the available space . De Laage struck a match to examine the contents of the canoe more carefully . It contained a surprising assortment of things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you doing here ? " Still there was no reply . " Ca n't you speak ? Tell me where you are going . " Mako hesitated and finally said , without raising his eyes : " To Motu Atea , monsieur . " The Administrator stared down at him . The copra cutting on Motu Atea had been finished well before the Katopua 's arrival and the people had returned home . Why should this boy be preparing to go there at such an hour and with such a cargo ? " To Motu Atea ? For what purpose ? . . . Why are you going there ? " Mako made no reply , but continued to stand with his head down , staring at the ground between his feet . Impatient at his stubborn and nervous silence , de Laage ordered harshly : " Come with me . " He went along the path at a rapid walk , the boy following . It never so much as occurred to de Laage that he might run away , nor , in his terror and anguish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aweTHE HURRICANE 99 of the Administrator was far too great to permit the slightest disobedience of his orders . De Laage 's mind was busy as he walked . A strange business , this . What the devil could the boy be up to ? The chief himself had told him that the last of the copra makers had returned from Motu Atea the week before . Why then should this boy be going there ? He was lying , evidently ; but for what purpose ? What reason could he have . . . . All at once a stupefying thought crossed his mind . Terangi ! By heavens , could it be possible ? Was the fellow on Manukura , concealed on one of the islets ? Why not ? His wife was here , all his people were here . Who else would be so glad to shield him ? There had been ample time , after these many weeks , for him to reach home . His complete disappearance from Tahiti could only mean that he had gotten clean away . De Laage felt a shiver passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , they might make him the laughingstock of the colony : an administrator ignorantof the fact that a notorious criminal was hidden at the very seat of government , on an island whose land area was scarcely greater than a large farm ! The village was profoundly silent as they passed its scattered houses . Here and there a dim light showed through the chinks in the thatch , from a kerosene lamp turned low , left burning as a protection against evil spirits , but the inmates were sleeping . Not so , 100 THE HURRICANEhowever , in the house of Mama Rua . Marama was crouched near the door , left slightly ajar , watching for Mako 's return . Hearing footsteps crunching over the coral gravel , she opened the door an inch or two wider . The forms of the two passers-by were indistinct in the starlight , but as they passed the house she had them in clear relief for an instant against the surface of the lagoon . With her keen sight she recognized them at once . She gave a little gasp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she exclaimed in a whisper . " Aue , Mama ! " The old woman crept forward in the darkness to her daughter-in-law 's side . " What is it ? Who passed ? There were two . " " Monsieur de Laage ! He has Mako with him ! " " Eaha ? " " It was Monsieur de Laage ! I could n't mistake him ! " She sprang to her feet . " I must tell Father ! " Mama Rua gave an exclamation of anguish , pressing her hands tightly together . " Wait , child ! He may know nothing . Follow them ! Keep well hidden ! Hide by a window and listen . Make haste ! I will tell your father . " Next moment Marama was gone , running lightly in the shadows alongside the road . Followed by the terrified Mako , de Laage reached his house , stepped softly on to the verandah , entered his office , and lit the lamp . He placed a chair forTHE HURRICANE 101 the boy so that the light would shine full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seated himself in his swivel chair , with his back to the lamp . The lad gave him a brief terror-stricken glance and then sat with his hands tightly clasped , gazing at the floor . " Your name is Mako , eh ? " the Administrator began , in the dry , inquisitorial manner he knew so well how to assume . " Now , Mako , I want the truth . Where were you going with that canoe ? " The lad made no answer . " You shall not leave this room until you have told me , understand that , " de Laage went on , " and it will be the worse for you if you keep me waiting long . Answer me ! For whom were those things in the canoe ? Who told you to put them there ? " An agonized silence was the only reply . As the Administrator sprang to his feet , feigning more anger than he felt , the door opened and Madame de Laage appeared , in her kimono . " What is it , Eugene ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Since I have had the misfortune to waken you , perhaps you will stop for a minute and help me . It may be that this boy understands less French than I supposed . Be good enough to ask him in his own language where he was going . Tell him there is no good in his lying . I will have the truth ! " Madame de Laage turned to Mako , smiled encouragingly , and questioned him in a gentle voice. 102 THE HURRICANE He tried to meet her eyes , but could not , and answered briefly , in a whisper almost inaudible . " He says he was going to Motu Atea . " " Nonsense ! So he told me . I ' 11 have no more of this ! He understands French as well as yourself . Tiers ! I ' 11 soon have the truth ! " Swinging about in his chair once more , he faced the boy sternly . " Look me in the face , Mako ! Look up , I say ! " Slowly the lad raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canoe ? " Mako opened his mouth , but no words came . He tried to lower his gaze , but the Administrator 's eyes held his in a kind of . " Shall I answer for you ? " de Laage asked , sternly . " Shall I tell you for whom they were designed ? " He paused , subjecting the lad 's face to a merciless scrutiny . " For Terangi ! He is here ! You know it ! " The expression on Mako 's face was enough . If the boy had written and signed a statement of all he knew , of all he had hoped to accomplish , the confession could scarcely have been more complete . Marama , who had been crouching outside the open window , sank down with her head in her arms at the mention of Terangi 's name . In an instant she had overcome her agitation . She stole down theverandah steps , passed through the gate like a shadow , and ran toward her father 's house at a pace few of the young men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . His face was impassive ; what went on in his mind was another matter . " When did he come ? " he then asked . " Answer me , boy ! How did he get here ? " Mako was at the end of his self-possession . He mumbled in a voice , terrified and indistinct : " On the cutter . " " The cutter ? Whose cutter ? Germaine , what cutters have come in since I have been away ? " " Only Father Paul 's . " De Laage gave a gasp of dismay . He turned sharply to Mako , taking the boy 's chin in his hand , raising his head until he could look him full in the face . " Mako , do you mean to tell me that Terangi came here with you , on Father Paul 's cutter ? " The lad made no reply . CHAPTER VIIMAKO sat huddled in his chair , a look of unutterable misery and desolation upon his face . Madame de Laage herself was profoundly distressed . You can imagine her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray . As she glanced at her husband , she was conscious of a feeling almost of hatred for him , and of loathing for herself as his instrument . With her warm heart and quick intelligence , she was able to visualize the misery that would be brought into the lives of Terangi 's family  --  the grief that everyone on the island would feel at his recapture . And yet , what else could the Administratorhave done ? He could hardly be expected to close his eyes and allow an escaped prisoner to go his ways . De Laage halted and turned to Mako . " You will remain in this room , " he said , " until you have my permission to leave it . " The lad made no reply . " You understand , Mako ? " Madame de Laage asked , gently , addressing him in the native tongue . There was a look of piteous appeal in his eyes as he glanced up at her . He gave a barely perceptible nod and again stared at the floor . THE HURRICANE 105 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administrator added . " Understand ! You will be severely punished if you disobey me ! " Mako 's heart was so numbed with despair at what he had been forced to disclose that the warning was quite needless . There could be no saving Terangi now : that he knew . The harm was done . De Laage called his wife outside the room for a moment , shutting the door behind them . " I ' m sorry , my dear , " he said . " There is no help for it . I must ask you to remain with him . If the boy should bolt , let me know at once . You can send Arai . But no . . . that wo n't do . You will have to come yourself . I shall be at Father Paul 's . " " You need have no fears , " Madame de Laage replied . " I know Mako . He will do as I say . " The Administrator was a man of unalterable habit , scrupulously exact in performing all the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at precisely six o'clock , arrayed himself in an old-fashioned bathingcostume of blue flannel , put on his dressing gown and slippers , and stepped out to the lagoon beach . There he would swim clumsily for fifteen minutes , a few yards offshore , and then return to his bathroom , a small detached building containing a fresh-water shower , connected with the dwelling house by a covered passageway . Fresh water is precious on all the low islands and limited to what rain water is caught from those houses provided with tin roofs. 106 THE HURRICANE On Manukura there were three cement reservoirs : a large communal one which received the water from the roof of the church , another at the chief 's house , and a third , a one-thousand-gallon tank , at the Resi- dency , supposed to be for the use of the Adminis- trator 's family alone . But he was as unselfish as he was just and precise in the performance of his duties , and in times of scarcity the water in his reservoir was for the use of all the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the household needing it . His own received no more than the others . Even in times of plenty , when the tank was full to overflowing , he limited himself to two gallons for his morning shower , drawing off in a pitcher this amount , which he placed in the container overhead . But first he would shave , using a pint of water for this purpose . He had a razor case , lined with black velvet , in which were seven razors , one for each day of the week . He had , I am sure , a secret contempt for any man who used a safety razor , and took pride in the fact that he shaved without a mirror . His hand was as steady as a rock , . and I must do him the credit to say that no barber could have made a better job of it . This task finished , he would have his shower and dress for the new day in white ducks , well starched and crackling . One of the trials of Madame de Laage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been to find a native woman who could launder her husband 's clothes to his satisfaction , and a maid who would lay out a fresh suit in the evening , preciselywhere and in the manner in which he wished to find it . These matters are by the way . I speak of them to give you a side view of his character . Little things were as important to him as large ones . Do n't mistakeme ; I am not poking fun at him . I had great respect for him , and I will venture to say that , during the war , France had no more dependable and fearless battalion commander throughout her armies . He brought the same trustworthy , unimaginative qualitieswith him as Administrator of the Tuamotu . Had it not been so , he would , certainly , on this particularmorning , have proceeded at once with his investigation , without making his usual careful toilet for the coming day . He may , in fact , have omitted the sea bath , but that was the only omission . Having left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower , and dressed carefully and methodically in the fresh suit Arai had laid out for him the previous evening . It was still dark . He put on his sun helmet and was about to take his electric flash lamp , but thought better of this . The village was asleep , and he wished no one to be aroused and curious as to his movements until he had seen Father Paul . It did not occur to him , apparently , that there could be any immediate danger of Terangi 's escape . He was unspeakably shocked at what he had learnedTHE HURRICANE 109 lis face . No , it must be that Terangi was here . and had not Father Paul avoided him ever since his return ? For the first time in years he had not come : o dinner at the Residency . The Administrator proceeded toward the church , : rossing the depression in the land that almost divided the islet on the footbridge made of two squared : oconut logs laid side by side . For all his disturbed mind , he had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced the broken handrail . Before his departure from Manukura , months before , he had asked that this be done . He made a mental note of the matter . That handrail was to be made usable before another day had passed . Upon reaching Father Paul 's little house , he hesitated for a moment , and then knocked firmly . The priest , like most elderly men , slept lightly , and was aroused at once . He got into his threadbare old soutane , put on his straw slippers , lighted his lamp , and came to the door , searching his mind as he did so as to which member of his flock might have need Df his services at such an hour . He gave no outward indication of surprise upon finding the Administrator standing on the doorstep . As he entered , de Laage apologized for the untimely visit . His manner was administratorial  --  polite , but coldly formal and punctilious ; it was not his customary manner in speaking with Father Paul . The priest broughtfrom Mako . That the priest should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withoutimmediately reporting the man 's presence was a breach of faith inconceivable to the Administrator . In fact , he could scarcely believe it possible . Might not Mako , in his confusion , have assented to something that had no basis in truth ? He had put the direct question to him . In his terror , the boy might have replied without knowing what it was he had affirmed , and , growing more confused , have been unable to correct the mistake . The Administrator recalled that , some years before , three Manukura boys had been caught making off with a small cutter belonging to one of their fathers . Their purpose had been to sail to Tahiti , to see the sights of the great capital . They had heard of motor cars , of motion pictures , of many marvelous things unknown on Manukura . They had wanted to see them for themselves , and were not in the least daunted by the thought of a 600-mile voyage . Mako had had a wide experience in sailing from island to island with Father Paul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringleader in another madcap boyish venture . The large canoe was provisionedas though for just such a voyage . De Laage halted . It might be that . It might well be that . He was uncertain whether to go on or to turn back for a further questioning of Mako . Then he recalled the boy 's manner , the anguish and terror in110 THE HURRICANEforward his only easy chair and then seated himself on a wooden stool by his writing table . The little receptionroom was austere in its simplicity . The walls were whitewashed and bare save for a crucifix and a framed lithograph of Leo XIII which hung over the table . The only furniture consisted of the easy chair , the wooden stool , a bench for visitors , and the table holding an unshaded kerosene lamp . A few perfunctory remarks passed , followed by a moment of awkward silence . De Laage cleared his throat . " I must explain to you the purpose of this call , " he began . " Late this evening , being unable to sleep , I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chanced to see the boy , Mako , pass with two large tins of water on a carrying pole . I was curious as to what he could be doing at that hour and followed him . I found him placing the tins in the large sailingcanoe belonging to the chief . The canoe was loaded with supplies and provisions of all sorts . The boy was greatly confused at my questions and made replies which I knew were false . I took him with me to the Residency and questioned him further . The confession he as good as made to me is incredible . " He paused . Father Paul sat with one sturdy brown hand resting lightly on the table , his childlike blue eyes regarding de Laage steadily . The Administrator'sgaze was fixed upon the portrait of Pope Leo . And the confession was . . . ? " the priest asked . THE HURRICANE 111 " That the escaped prisoner , Terangi , had been brought to this island in your cutter . " " It is true , " the priest remarked , quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now at liberty , on Manukura ? May I ask why I have not been informed ? " " Monsieur 1'Administrateur , a priest of the Church has duties to perform that differ from your own . Such a duty is concerned here . " De Laage 's pale face flushed and he stared at the priest incredulously . " He may , then , consider it his duty to harbor a fugitive , a murderer , no less ; to set at defiance the just laws of the State and those who are sworn to enforcethem ? " " He may , under certain circumstances . " " And what are those circumstances ? " There was a note of appeal in the father 's voice as he replied . " Monsieur de Laage , I have known Terangi his life long . I have known his parents and their parents before them . In all its branches , there is no family throughout the Archipelago more worthy of respect . This son , Terangi , is a deeply wronged young man . How he left Tahiti I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cutter , thirty miles from Manukura . He was clinging to a capsizedcanoe ; the outrigger was gone . He had been clinging there for two days and a night . He had made a voyage of nearly six hundred miles in that112 THE HURRICANEsmall canoe that he might see his mother , his wife , and his little daughter . Those are the circumstances . Would you have had me give him up ? " " This deeply wronged young man , as you call him , has only himself to blame for the severity of his punishment . I am your fellow countryman ; your Administrator , as you are my priest . I am your parishioner no less than he . What of the wrong you do to me ? " " The wrong . . . ? " " I am here to enforce the law ; and yet you would keep this fugitive in hiding , at the very seat of the administration . If he succeeds in escaping elsewhere , I shall be held responsible , and justly so . It will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove . It may , quite possibly , mean the end of my career . " " I had not thought of that , my friend , " the priest replied gently , after a moment of silence . " I am much to blame , and I ask your forgiveness . And yet , even if I had remembered , I could have done no other than I have done . But there shall be no blot upon your record . If a wrong has been committed , the fault is mine , and I shall take it upon myself . " The Administrator rose abruptly . " Father Paul , I will ask you one question , " he replied , coldly . " Where is Terangi Matokia ? " " I do not know . " " You know that he is on Manukura ? " THE HURRICANE 113 " I know that he was here ; that I brought him here . But where he is now I do not know . " The Administrator took up his helmet , and , with a slight formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will understand that neither Fakahau nor Tavi had been idle during this time . At the moment when the Administrator passed in the street , with Mako , the chief and his brother had been upon the point of settingout for the end of the motu . The chief was waiting in the darkness at his house , with Tita asleep in his arms , when Marama came back from the Residency . They set out at once for the end of the motu where the canoe was moored . They reached the place in a quarter of an hour and by that time Fakahau had told his daughter what she must do . Their farewellswere of the briefest . Marama clung to her father for a moment , then took her place in the stern of the canoe . The sail was quickly raised and made fast . Tita , awake now , puzzled to know what was happening , took her place beside her mother . Noiselessly , Fakahau pushed the canoe out into deep water , the light breeze caught the sail , and the long slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in waist-deep water , looking after it until it vanished in the darkness . Wading ashore , he struck into a dim path that led through the groves inland , at some distance from the lagoon beach. 114 THE HURRICANEDark as it was under the palms , he kept to the path by instinct , walking swiftly . Far down the motu he could see a light burning at the Residency . As he approached the settlement , he saw a second light appear in Father Paul 's house and immediately guessed the reason for it . Mata , his wife , was waiting for him , in a small thatched hut that stood behind the chief 's European dwelling . He entered by the doorwayin the north end and called softly . Mata crossed the room and took his arm . They have gone ? " she asked quickly . " Yes . The wind is at east , and light . There will be no danger of capsizing . Marama can handle the canoe as well as a man . They will be on Motu Tonga in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The chief could detect the note of intense anxiety in his wife 's voice . " The Administrator knows that Terangi is here ! The pass will be watched . Even though it were not , day will break before they could reach it . " " There is only one thing that can be done , and that I have arranged . Terangi and Marama will sink the canoe off the beach at Motu Tonga , in such a place that none could find it . Their supplies they will bury in the sand . The Administrator will search every motu along the reef , that is sure . And he will find no trace of them  --  nothing . " " But what of themselves ? . .. Aue ! I know ! Te Rua ! " THE HURRICANE 115 " They will hide there , " said Fakahau . " He may search Motu Tonga , all the motu , until he is weary . He will never find them . Later , we can decide what is best to be done . " Mata seized her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will believe they have escaped ; gone elsewhere . " " What else can he believe ? We will wait and see what he will do then . " They broke off their whispered conference upon hearing a knocking at the front door of their main house . Fakahau knew that knock , and the precise frame of mind of the man who thus announced himself . Under ordinary circumstances , he would immediatelyhave put on his white trousers and coat , but in this instance he wanted it to appear that he had not recognized the summoner . He whispered to Mata : " Call out . " " Ko vai tera ? " she demanded , shrilly , as though asking which of her neighbors might be making so untimely a call . The only reply was a repetition of the double knock , even louder than before . Fakahau waited no longer . He went as he was , barefoot and dressed only in his pareu . Mounting the steps to his back verandah , he went along the hallway that divided the main dwelling house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front parlor . Fakahau 's European house was the pride of116 THE HURRICANEManukura . Although he and his family spent little time in it , much preferring the cool native dwelling in the back yard , he felt that it was his duty as chief , for the honor and dignity of his people , to have exotic possessions worthy of his estate . His salon was a spacious , high-ceilinged room filled with ornate furniture : chairs and sofas upholstered in red and green plush , and tables with the tortured legs common in France a generation and more ago . Cheval mirrors stood in the corners , and others , gilt-framed and quite as large , hung from the walls . There were , also , oil paintings representing rustic scenes in Europe : stags that had proudly halted to pose for the artist against snowy backgrounds , French youths and maidens of the sixties and seventies , boating upon lakes or sitting pensively in gardens . I believe that Captain Nagle had bought the lot of them for Fakahau at an auction sale in Tahiti . Opposite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by anyonesave the Bishop on his single visit to Manukura . The bed was eight feet long and six wide and held a kapok mattress at least three feet thick . Have you ever slept on  --  or , better , in  --  an untufted kapok mattress ? Probably not . There is nothing hotter in this world , nor , probably , in the next . The hopefulguest is rather pleased by the feel of it at first , as it snuggles itself around his weary body ; then he sinks deeper and deeper and the sweat begins to pour out . Within half an hour , granted that he has been THE HURRICANE 117 able to endure it for so long , he finds himself lying in a deep puddle of his own perspiration , for kapok is wonderfully water-tight ; and once the " give " has been taken up , there is nothing harder to lie upon . It is like being set in a bed of gradually solidifying cement . I can imagine what a glorious night the Bishop must have had . I was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the following day , he went through his round of duties and sat through the elaboratefeast prepared for him with a decidedly glassy look in his eyes . Forgive the digression . I ca n't help smiling , inwardly , when I think of Fakahau 's state bedroom . But when I think of him and Mata , and that I shall never see them again , the smile vanishes . Two more admirable persons never lived . Fakahau , having lighted the lamp , lost no time in going to the door . He wished , by his manner , to expresssurprise upon seeing who his visitor was , but this was lost on de Laage , who strode into the hallway and then halted , as in duty bound , until the chief should show him into the salon . During the brief walk to the chief 's house , there had been time to put a stern check upon his emotions . He was appalled , no less , at what he considered Father Paul 's disloyalty , so deeply disturbed and angry that he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have said something regrettable , beneath the dignity of an administrator to give voice to ; and118 THE HURRICANEhowever unworthy the priest , his position must be respected . There was now no doubt in de Laage 's mind that all Manukura , save only himself and his wife , had known of Terangi 's return . He believed that Captain Nagle himself must have known as he sat at his table at dinner , the evening before . If Father Paul could shield this escaped criminal it could hardly be expected that Nagle would have a more scrupulous standard of honor . As for Fakahau , the man 's father-in-law , it would be futile to ask him where Terangi was hidden . It was to be assumed that he knew . The line of action to be taken was clear-cut . By the time he had reached the chief 's door , he knew what this should be . Fakahau was a giant in stature , six feet four and a half , with strength in proportion to his size . De Laage was a tall man , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he resented this contrast so unfavorable to the representative of France . He would have much preferred a smaller man for chief , one with less native dignity ; but he had been compelled to resign himself to the fact that Manukura would have no other . " Be seated , please , " he said . Fakahau did so , apologizing at the same time for his waistcloth . He spoke excellent French , having been reared in the household of a former administratorwho , upon discovering his intelligence , took great pains to teach him . Polynesians have a lanTHEHURRICANE 119 guage of courtesy equal to our own , and the chief was able to translate the forms of it with an ease that had always surprised de Laage . At this moment , it seemed the very language of subtle dissimulation . His heart was filled with anger , and it shocked him that a man should be able to hide so well his true thoughts and feelings . He listened coldly as Fakahau bridged the awkwardness of the moment . The first light of dawn was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet strong enough to dim the light of the lamp . De Laage drew out his watch , consulted it , and held it in his hand as he spoke . " I wish you to assemble all the people , excepting the small children , by the himine house within half an hour 's time , " he said . " Every man and woman , the young people as well . No one is to be excused . You will also have all the canoes collected and drawn up on the beach near by . Dress and attend to this matter immediately . When you have done so , I will inform you and the others of my reason for wishing it . He then rose and , with a slight cold nod to the chief , walked out of the room . CHAPTER VIIITHE village was waking as de Laage left the chief 's house . He walked to the beach and looked out over the lagoon . It lay empty to the gaze as far as he could see , placid and shimmering in the pale light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village islet , de Laage was determined that he should not leave it unseen . He tore a leaf from his pocketbook and wrote a note to his wife , telling her of what he had arranged and asking her to send his binoculars . He sent the note by a lad who had just appeared from a near-by house , and walked slowly up and down the beach until the boy returned . Meanwhile , Fakahau had promptly carried out the Administrator 's orders . Messengers had been sent in both directions , and within a quarter of an hour all the settlement was astir . Until this morning , you will understand , Terangi 's presence on the island was known to none of the natives outside his own family . By the time the people had assembled at the himine house , everyone knew it  --  that is , all of the adults . There was no longer the possibility of secrecy , nor the need for it . Realizing this , Fakahau had seen to THE HURRICANE 121 it that the news should be spread , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden , with his wife and daughter , in the cave they all knew on Motu Tonga . The Polynesian method of disseminatingnews is as swift as it can be secretive when there is need for secrecy . For all my years in the Archipelago , I do not yet know just how they managethis sort of thing . Little is said , but by slight gestures , glances , the intonation of the voice as they make elliptical comments to one another , everything is told . The chief well knew the loyalty of his people . There was no danger that any of them would search with the intent of discovering Terangi 's hiding place . All the canoes were being assembled ; young men and boys were paddling them in from both sides to the beach near the himine house where they were drawn up in a long line , around fifty in all , taking large and small together . There were a dozen large sailing canoes , and two reef boats , each capable of holding a dozen men , which were used for the transportof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach , watching over this carrying out of his orders , but speaking to no one . The chief , now dressed in an immaculate suit of white duck , wearing the sash of his office and with a broad-brimmed pandanushat on his head , was among the men , superintendingthe alignment of the canoes which were drawn up for inspection . In the background , amongdeleted linesI liked to let my glance wander from one to another , comparing them and the gathering as a whole with similar assemblies I had seen on other islands of the Group . There are , often , striking contrasts between the people of one island and those of another , so marked , even in these days , that one is led to believe that they are of different racial stock . That is the opinion of many ethnologists with respect to Polynesiansin general . They recognize among the differentgroups at least four divergent racial types . There is no reason why this should not be so . These islands were peopled by successive waves of migrants from the West . When one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India , and the many archipelagos that must have been halting places on their eastward migrations , the mixture of bloods is easily accounted for . Whenever de Laage addressed the village as a whole , he spoke to them directly , as though assuming that they understood French . Fakahau would stand at his side , a little behind him . When a perceptible halt was made , the chief would know that he was expected to translate what had just been said . De Laage 's face was stern and his manner impressive . He spoke briefly , informing the gathering that the escaped prisoner , Terangi , was somewhere hidden on Manukura . He did not accuse the people of knowing it , or assume by his manner that they must know of it . He spoke of Terangi 's stubborn inTHEHURRICANE 125 tractability as a prisoner , of his many escapes , made possible , he said , by the leniency toward him of the authorities on Tahiti . He had grossly abused their kindness . His original sentence was six months . Had he quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . By his willful foolishness he had increased this sentence by many years . At his last escape he had killed a prison guard . This fugitive the government was determined to recapture ; if necessarythey would dispatch the gunboat , stationed at Papeete , to apprehend him . Whatever the attitude of Manukura might . be toward him , it was the solemn duty of every man and woman to assist their Administratorin his recapture . A search of the atoll was now to be made , and he expected them to fulfill that duty . The people listened in deepest silence , and when de Laage had finished , not a question was asked , not a comment made . I observed Tavi , who sat directly below the platform , his hands clasped over his huge solid belly ; he was listening with the placid attention he might have given to one of Father Paul 's sermons . The others were as quietly attentive . De Laage then dismissed them , to await his orders outside . It was then that he asked my assistance in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search the village islet . If Terangi were not found here , he would proceed along the northern reefs to Motu Atea . He asked me to take charge of a second party to go along126 THE HURRICANEthe opposite side of the atoll , by way of Motu Tonga . He regretted having to commandeer my services , but there was no one else he could trust , and two search parties were essential if Terangi was to be caught . Never have I had such an unpleasant task . It was outside my province as a medical officer , and my sympathies were all with Terangi . But I could not refuse , although , technically , I would have been justified in doing so . The Administrator was in a difficultsituation . The search had to be made , and no native could be put in charge of either party . The chief was to remain behind , in the settlement . There were twenty-five in my party , men and youths together . We set out for Motu Tonga in the two reef boats . Each rowed six oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under sail . Tavi was with me and his son-in-law , Farani , a lad of twenty . After five years on Manukura I knew everyone , of course . I was " Taote "  --  Doctor  --  to all of them , and they had come to accept me without reserve . It went sorely against the grain with me to be sent on such an expedition as this . I well knew how they loathed it . Nevertheless , I was bound that our work should be done thoroughly . There was a charming cove at the western end of Motu Tonga , on the lagoon side . It was the customarylanding place . We reached it in an hour and a half . I smile as I look back to that morning and see myself there with my men gathered around me . THE HURRICANE 127 Ceremonial plays a great part in native life , and a little speech making is the preliminary to all communalactivity . I was rather pleased with myself at the forthright , **26;4212;TOOLONG mannerin which I addressed my men . I told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no escaping the long arm of the law . Whatever we , as individuals , might think of the injustice of his imprisonment , we should only harm him by the attempt to shield him . Ours was an unpleasant task , but , as the Administrator had said , if we failed to perform it , the Governor of Tahiti would order the man-of-war stationed there to come to Manukura . Failure in our duty would only postpone a little the evil day for Terangi , and so forth , and so forth . I must have talked for a good five minutes . The Administrator himself would have highly approved of this Voice of Duty speaking through the mouthpiece of his medical officer . Then we got on with the duty itself . I extended my men in a single line , stretching across the motu from ocean to lagoon beach . I took my position toward the centre and behind it , so that I could make sallies to one side and the other , keeping my eye upon them all ; and I had my binoculars so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I was surprised at the thoroughness with which they went about the business ; more particularly , at Tavi 's hearty cooperation . They really did search , and care-128 THE HURRICANEfully . They beat every small thicket ; examined each of the old tou and pukatea and purau trees . These , with the scattered coconut palms , were the most likely hiding places , and I saw to it that they were well exploredas we proceeded . Between , were clumps of scrub , none of which were missed , but the islet , for the most part , was free from thick undergrowth and you had clear views across the four-hundred-yard extent from the inner to the outer beach . I flattered myself that I was an efficient , painstaking leader of a search party . Although I kept close watch , I saw no footprints in the sand , except those I judged to be our own . I could not , of course , be everywhere at once , but by the time we had reached the eastern end of Motu Tonga , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left four boys to sail the reef boats to that end of the islet . They were awaiting us , and we immediatelyset out , just inside the reef , in the direction of Motu Atea . " Atea "  --  it is a name I love , meaning " distant , " " far-off , " and well suited to the islet that enclosed the extreme eastern end of Manukura lagoon . It lies , as I may have said , twenty miles from the village islet , and is not visible from Motu Tonga . Between the two islets is mile after mile of bare reef where the long rollers of the Pacific batter themselves into foam and wind-driven spray . There are many unforgettable sights to be seen in a world so rich and varied as ours , but I know of none more memoTHEHURRICANE 129 rabic , and more awe-inspiring , than the view , from a small boat or canoe , of the surf piling over the reefs of a coral island . The best vantage point is from within the lagoon , close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they approach . On all low islands , the slope of the outer reef is scarcely a slope at all ; it descends with astonishing steepness into the depths . The soundings only a short distance offshore are in hundreds of fathoms , and a mile beyond , the lead must descend a thousand before fetching bottom . For this reason the combers are almost upon you beforethey break , and the thread of the reef , often no more than fifteen or twenty yards across , seems no protection at all . On the morning of our search , there was a surprisinglyheavy surf along the reef . I call it surprising , for there had been no wind to account for it . The men in my boat were as glad as myself to have some topic of conversation other than Terangi ; we discussed the surf , trying to account for the huge swell that had set in . " It ' s not from the south'ard , " Maunga said . " You can see that for yourself , Doctor . " Old Kauka , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " E. It ' 11 be heavier than this along the northern reefs . That ' s where it ' s coming from : northeast . There ' s been dirty weather off there . " Tavi fancied himself as a weather prophet , and Ideleted lines132 THE HURRICANE THE HURRICANE 133deleted lines134 THE HURRICANEmet de Laage 's party near the centre of the islet . Terangi had not been found . De Laage walked aside with me while the members of the two parties gathered on the beach , squatting on their haunches , native fashion , to await further orders . I was sweaty and bedraggled , but the Administrator was nearly as immaculate as he had been early that morning . He never perspired , even on the hottest days . I often wondered , in a manner half-envious , half-professional , if there was n't something amiss with his pores . He was greatly upset , in his calm way , over our double failure , and questioned me closely as to the method of procedure I had taken with my party . He had confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men might have found opportunities to skimp the search . I set his mind to rest on that point . He too had been surprised at the apparent willingness of the men to find Terangi if he was to be found . " There is only one explanation , " he said , with an air of finality . " They know that he has escaped  --  left the island . " " You are convinced that he was not missed on the village islet ? " I asked . " Wholly convinced , " he replied . " Even the church was examined . This I could not have done , had not the priest himself suggested it . " Never before had I heard him refer to Father PaulTHE HURRICANE 135 except by name . His speaking of him as " the priest " showed me how deeply the father lay under his displeasure . " Not only is Terangi gone , but he has taken his wife and child with him , " he continued . " The large canoe belonging to the chief is missing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely he was close by when I discovered the boy , Mako , putting supplies into the canoe . While I was questioning the boy at the Residency , he must have gathered up wife and child and sailed out of the pass in the darkness . " A stern reproach to himself , for not having foreseenand forestalled this possibility , was implied in his manner . " ' We must return to the settlement immediately , " he said . " There is only one thing to be done . I must commandeer the Katopua and proceed with the search , elsewhere . " " Where shall you go ? " I asked . " First , to Amanu . I can almost promise myself that he will be found there . He would sail for the nearest island . With the threatening weather now making up , he would not dare go elsewhere . He may be compelled to remain at Amanu for several days before he can push on . In any case , I shall seize him at one of four islands : Amanu , Hao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was no more eager than the men to return at once to the village . We had had a hard136 THE HURRICANEday and very little to eat , and the thought of paddling and rowing up the twenty-mile lagoon in the teeth of the wind was anything but a pleasant one . It had veered round a bit more , toward the southwest , but there was not enough of a slant to enable us to use our sails . But the Administrator put aside the suggestions of Tavi and Kauka that we should delay our departure a little . Nor would he come with my party in one of the reef boats , much more comfortableto travel in , in such a heavy sea as had now made up . He preferred to remain with his own party . As we set out , the sun was just setting in a weirdlookingsky , overcast with a dirty yellowish haze through which the last light of day shone wanly . We made headway slowly . The sailing canoes , with their high sides , are awkward to paddle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no more than half an hour from Motu Atea , the wind chopped around to full southwest . It was welcomed with joy by the weary men . We made sail , thinking how lucky we were , but immediately we had , the wind died away to the lightest of airs , not enough to give our heavily laden boats steerageway . Down came the sails and out went the oars once more . The men rowed in disgruntled silence , broken only by the solid thud of the waves against our bow , each one like a brusque , powerful hand , checking our little way as it passed . " Hoe , lads ! Hoe ! " said Tavi . " Put your backs into it . It wo n't be for long . " THE HURRICANE 137 " Eahahoia ! " one of the rowers exclaimed . I have always loved that mouth-filling native expression , which means so many different things , according to the inflection of the voice from the mouth that it filled . It expresses astonishment , dismay , incredulity , anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiced with the one word . On this occasion it meant : " It ' s all very well for you to say Hoe , ' you fat storekeeper ! Why do n't you do a little rowing yourself ? And what do you mean , it wo n't be for long ? Only until to-morrow morning ! " But Tavi had not gained his reputation as a weather prophet without deserving it . Presently the wind sprang up again , from due east , this time , and it blew more and more freshly . Tavi said nothing , but it amused me to see the expression on his face . There was pride in it , and supreme contempt for the Eahahoia exploder as he turned to me and remarked : It will come full circle , Doctor , before it ' s done , but we ' 11 be at the village long before that . I do n't like the look of the sky , " he added as he took the sheet . Now we tore along at a splendid clip . The other reef boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , the men shouting taunting comments as one or the other gained a little advantage . And then came the canoes that we had left so far behind , with their great wing spread , their wakes creamy white , and their sharp bows sending the spray high in air . We138 THE HURRICANEwere doing a good seven knots , but the four of them passed us , one after the other , as though we were standing still . In a stiff breeze , a Tuamotu canoe will sail at from twelve to fifteen knots . They made a splendid sight as they passed , men on the outrigger runways , ready to shift at a second 's notice to the hull side or the outrigger side as the strong gusty wind heeled them down . Those at the steering paddles leaned against their huge blades , but all had time to yell derisively at us as they went seething by . Ten minutes later they were lost to view in the gathering dusk . CHAPTER IXTHE northwest wind grew stronger during the night , making up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were followed by sudden calms , while sheet lightning played along the horizon and the rising sea made itself heard along the reef . Dawn revealed low gray clouds scudding above a leaden sea , and palm tops whipping and thrashing to the gusts . De Laage was up before his usual time . On the way to his bathroom he stopped for a glance at the gauge on his water tank which he found had been filled by the night 's rains . Then he peered at the recording barometer in its case . The glass stood a little low , yet at a level more or less normal for this time of year . No doubt this was only another of the northeasters the natives call f aarua , which would blow itself out in a day or two . The equinox was at hand ; one always expected uncertain weather at that time . When he had shaved and dressed , he joined his wife in the dining room , where coffee was already on the table . THE HURRICANE 141 shall lose nothing by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sail ? " " Where do you wish to go ? " " To Amanu , first , and I hope only there . You will guess my errand . I must find Terangi . If he is not at Amanu we shall have to visit the neighboring islands as well . " The captain was silent for a moment . " I ' 11 take you , of course , " he said . " A man ca n't argue with the Government . We ' ve nothing more to unload . I can be ready when you like . " " Then I shall be aboard in half an hour 's time , if that ' s not hurrying you too much ? " Madame de Laage accompanied her husband to the dock . They found Tavi awaiting them there , with a cage of laths in which squatted a full-grown frigate bird . It was a strange and beautiful creature , smoothly feathered in black , shaded with chocolate , with a long , hooked beak and round unwinking eyes of velvet brown in which glittered pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tavi 's tame frigate birds on his tours of the Group , in case he wished to send a letter home . Tavi carried the cage aboard while the Administrator turned to bid good-bye to his wife . " I shall soon be back , my dear , " he said in his matter- of-fact voice . " Do n't wait to see us out of the pass . There ' s another squall coming ; you ' ve just time to reach the house . " A quarter of an hour later , with her engine going140 THE HURRICANE " You still mean to go , Eugene ? " she asked anxiously . " I must , " he replied . " But what of the weather ? It looks threatening to me . " " Nothing but a northeaster . Has Arai taken my note to Captain Nagle ? " " Yes . He ' s coming . " A moment later they saw the captain turn in at the gate . Another heavy squall drove down from the north . The captain halted on the verandah to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to meet him . " Come in , Captain . I ' m sorry to trouble you so early . Germaine , pour the Captain a cup of coffee . " " I can do with a second cup this morning . A wet night , eh ? There ' 11 be water and to spare in the tanks this morning . " " How does it look to you ? " " The weather ? Nothing to worry about . My glass is at twenty-nine eighty . " The Administrator nodded with a chilly smile . " I ' 11 come straight to the point , Captain . I ' ve asked you to come here to tell you that I must commandeeryour schooner in the name of the Government . I may need her for a week , or a fortnight . " " This is a bit sudden , " Nagle replied ruefully . " I 'd expected to leave for Fakahina to-morrow . " " The need is sudden , " de Laage replied . " YouTHE HURRICANE 143 " Atira ! " Marunga exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come ! " With sullen eyes and dragging feet , Mako followed his mother into the store . His face burned with shame as the chief came forward and laid a hand on his shoulder . " The fault was not yours , Mako , " he said . " That we know . Think of it no more . You know where they are to be found . You shall go and tell them that Monsieur has gone . He will be absent for a week , at least . " The boy swallowed hard and shook his head . " I can not . " " You can and you shall , " his father put in . " Faka- hau is right ; it is fitting that you should be the mes- senger . " He turned to his brother . " But will they be in the cave ? " " Yes , " said Fakahau . " I told Marama that they were not to stir out of it until I sent them word . Now go , Mako . Off with you . " Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to go . He chose a light canoe and cut a green coconut frond , making it fast , upright , for a sail . Scarcely anyone was aware of his de- departure , for the stormy weather had driven most of the people indoors . Sitting at his steering paddle , while the strong northeast wind sent the canoe tearing through the chop , Mako half forgot his troubles inand her foresail set , the Katopua was headed for the passage , heeling a little to the gusts . In a hidden nook among the piled-up bags of copra in his father 's shed , poor little Mako had passed s night of misery such as only adolescents know . Hi had not tasted food since the day before and ha ( slept only in snatches broken by troubled dreams He felt that he could never again show his face in the village , and longed heartily to die . Twice durin  --  the previous afternoon he had heard his mother calling him , but had made no response . He had heard the sounds of the schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall had seen her set sail . He knew that Terangi had not been caught . Now , seeing that the schooner was gone , with the Administratoron board , he felt a thrill of hope . All at once he realized that he was starving , crawled out of hi retreat , and stole cautiously to his mother 's outdoor kitchen , where he found a loaf of bread and a leafwrappedpackage of baked fish . He was eating hastily when his mother appeared from the store . " Eaha nei ! " she exclaimed . " Where have you been ? Come to the store . Fakahau is there in search of you . We told him you were not here . " " What does he want of me ? " " He did not say . " " Let him continue to think that I am not here . " 144 THE HURRICANEthe exhilaration of speed . In less than an hour he had drawn his light craft up on the beach at Motu Tonga . Near the eastern end of the islet , an ancient storm had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , wedged together in disorder , over a part of the old reef in the lagoon . Beneath this species of roof , weighing hundreds of tons , and now decomposing on the surface and overgrown with coarse grass , lay the cave . Light and air filtered clown through chinks between the boulders , and the only entrance was a hole a fathom deep in the lagoon . In heathen times , when Manukura was raided by war canoes from neighboring islands , the women and children had taken refuge in this place , which was called " Te Rua . " Its existence was a secret never disclosed to outsiders . Not even Father Paul had been told of the cave . Mako stripped off his shirt , tucked up his pareu , and pulled down the diving goggles held on his head by an elastic band . He drew in a series of long breaths as he waded out to where the coral dropped away vertically in a submarine cliff . Then , half expellingthe air from his lungs , he plunged into the lagoon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall man might have stood upright without touching the coral overhead . Propelling himself with a diver 's long , deliberate strokes , he entered the cavern and rose into Te Rua 's black , still pool . THE HURRICANE 145 " Ko vai tera ? " Mako shivered at the sound of Terangi 's voice . " It is I , Mako , " he replied . " Come , we are here . " A match flared , disclosing Terangi 's erect figure , and Marama and Tita seated on the ledge . Then the match winked out , leaving the boy blind until his eyes grew accustomed to the faint light in the cave . With a sinking heart , he swam to where Terangi stood and pulled himself up on the clean dry sand of the ledge . " Well ? " said Terangi . " Fakahau sent me . Monsieur has gone with the schooner to Amanu . He will not return before a week is up . Terangi . .. " Mako could say no more . He sat huddled with his hands around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Terangi 's eyes as he looked at him . " Mako , do you remember the cigarette you made for me four days ago , in the cutter ? It was my first smoke in many weeks . And before I swam ashore you gave me your tin of tobacco with your papers and matches . I have it here . Your hands are wet . Shall I make a cigarette for you ? " The boy was unable to speak for the joy and relief he felt . Marama patted his shoulder . " We know , Mako , " she said . " What could any boy have done confronted by such a man ? There is no anger in Terangi 's heart , nor in mine . Come , let us get out of here . " THE HURRICANE 147 to make a hut . Mako , cut the fronds . I will plait them while Terangi puts up the framework . " The weather grew steadily worse . The wind hauled slightly to the north , blowing with ever-increasingforce , and by late afternoon a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squalls had ceased ; the trees swayed and bent to the wind which hummed through the streaming palms with an ever-rising note , while a procession of dark ragged clouds scudded by close overhead . Alone at the Residency , Madame de Laage had made fast all the doors and windows save those on the south side . The thought of her husband at sea worried her , and she admitted to herself that she was equally worried because of Terangi and his family . They had , undoubtedly , gotten through the pass during the dark hours of the day before , and must have reached Amanu long since if they had gone that way ; but Madame de Laage was by no means so sure as her husband that Amanu was their destination . Althoughshe had said nothing to him about it , she thought it more likely that Terangi would leave both Amanu and Hao to leeward and make for more distantislands : Paraoa or Ahunui . Paraoa , as she knew , was an uninhabited island belonging to the people of Hao ; it would afford an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canoe would still be146 THE HURRICANESix-year-old Tita was the first to go . She was like a fish in the water , but her mother was close beside her as she dived . Terangi and Mako followed , and a few moments later they were all on the beach . Terangi glanced at the windward horizon and shrugged his shoulders as he glanced at Marama . She proceeded to dig out their buried property from its hiding place in the sand , while Mako helped Terangi to float the sunken canoe . It was filled with lumps of coral and lay in two fathoms of water . After they had dived repeatedly , each time removing a stone or two , the canoe rose to the surface and they pulled it ashore . Presently they had collected all their hiddenpossessions . " You can go nowhere in such weather , " Mako ventured to remark . " We must be patient , " Terangi replied . " The storm will blow itself out in two or three days . " " Where shall you go then ? " the lad asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terangi gave Marama a warning glance . " It will be best to hide on one of the islands to leewarduntil the trade wind sets in strong and true . Then , perhaps , we shall sail to Rakahanga or Manihiki , or some other British island far to the west . " " Aye , that will be best , " Mako replied eagerly . " There , Terangi , they could never find you ! " " Come , you two , " said Marama . " We must hastenTHE HURRICANE 149 hurricanes . I told her what I had learned from my books on meteorology . How these tropical revolving storms originate is still largely a matter of conjecture , but the places of their origin are well known : the belts of doldrums on either side of the Line . Hurricanes revolve counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere , clockwise in the Southern , and it is believed , with some reason , that this is due to the trade winds blow- ing in toward the Equator from northeast and sbuth- east . In the region of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . Some travel only a few miles in the course of a day ; others move southward at a speed the fastest ship could not equal . I discussed these matters with Madame de Laage in a manner of scientific detachment , but I refrained from mentioning one thing that was beginning to disquiet me : the fact that a steadily increasing wind from one quarter , accompanied by a dropping glass , indicates , in the case of a hurricane , that the observer is squarely on its track . At that time , however , I did not seriously believe that we were in danger . I had seen other storms , as bad as this , blow themselves out within thirty-six hours , with no greater damage than a few trees up- rooted and a cookhouse or two blown down . There were acres of tall old coconut palms around the vil- lase which must have been planted fifty years before : proof that hurricanes were by no means common here. 148 THE HURRICANEat sea . She shuddered at the thought of a sailing canoe being abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsized ; Terangi and Marama alone could never right so large a canoe . For the tenth time that day she stepped out to the sheltered south verandah to peer at the glass . Though it was not yet five o'clock , it was already so dark that she was obliged to return for her flashlight . She carefully studied the little wavering line on the coordinatepaper . Instead of the customary slight rise after four o'clock , the barometer had continued to drop , and now stood at 29 : 5 0 , the lowest she had ever seen it on Manukura . She tapped the case slightly ; the instrument responded by dropping to 29:45 . The barometer at the Residency was the only one on the island . I myself called to consult it at this time , and found Madame de Laage still bending over the glass . Although far from easy in mind , I did my best to reassure her , saying that while we were probably in for a gale , there was no reason for believing that anything worse was on the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass should drop below twenty-nine . " You need have no fears for the Katopua , " I added . " Long before this time , Nagle will have her safe at anchor inside Amanu lagoon . " Outwardly , Madame de Laage was calm enough , but I knew that she was anything but reassured . She insisted on making me some tea , and while we were drinking it , in the dining room , questioned me aboutI. , 150 THE HURRICANETo be sure , they had swept other islands of the Group much more recently . I had often heard the natives speak of the great storms of 1903 and 1906 . That of 1906 had all but destroyed Hikueru and its neighboringislands , and had done great damage to the Society Group as well . But Manukura seemed to be out of the zone of most of these storms . I reminded Madamede Laage of the island 's long immunity , and despite the low barometer , she herself was not , I think , seriously worried . At the moment , she was much more concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we were searching the island for Terangi , his mother had taken to her bed , and when I saw her , not twelve hours later , I had no doubt that she was dying . I made shift to take her pulse and found it alarmingly weak . I should have been glad to give her a stimulant , but refrainedeven from suggesting this . The people were willing to call upon me at most times , but I well knew that , in this case , my services were not wanted , least of all by the dying woman . Upon leaving the Residency , I returned to Tavi 's for supper ; I had taken my meals with his family ever since coming to Manukura . I found him alone in the store . " You have heard , Doctor ? " he asked . " Mama Rua is going . Father Paul has been sent for . She will not live through the night . " Tavi 's wife , Marunga , came in at this moment . THE HURRICANE 151 She had just returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the storm , they had taken the old woman to the chief 's house ; her own small dwellingwas not felt to be safe in such a wind . The rising storm , the expected death , and the fact that Hitia , their married daughter , was nearly at the point of confinement , made Marunga more than usually garrulous . Hitia had had certain warnings an hour or two earlier . This was her first baby ; she was a little frightened , and believed the pains signalized the child 's immediate birth . Under these conditions , Tavi and I made a hasty meal . I examined the girl , who lived with her parents , and made sure that there was no immediate need for me . I had her mother put some kettles of water on to boil ; then Tavi and I set out for the chief 's house . It was a boisterous night and no mistake ! The narrow beam from my flash lamp seemed to make the surrounding gloom the more profound . The palms were thrashing furiously in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on all sides ; we narrowly missed being hit half a dozen times . Most of the village was gathered at the chief 's ; little groups crouched in the darkness , in the lee of Fakahau 's cement reservoir , or in the shelter of the house itself . Two kerosene lamps on the south verandah flickered and flared , casting leaping shadows across the roadway , and a bright light burned in the state bedroom. 152 THE HURRICANETerangi 's mother was lying there , under a ti f ai f ai spotless and freshly ironed . She looked no larger than a child in that immense bed . Tavi and I tiptoed up the steps to the verandah . Madame de Laage was already present , the chief having sent for her . The wide porch was thronged with friends and relatives , waiting in deep silence . I had a glimpse of Father Paul in his robes , beside the bed , and presently we heard his voice , rising above the sounds of wind and sea : " Repeat after me . . . I confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to blessed Michael the Archangel  --  to blessed John the Baptist  --  to the holy apostles Peter and Paul . ... ' " The words of that solemn ritual , heard under those circumstances , on an island so far removed from the ancient home of the Christian faith , made a bizarre impression upon me . We could hear , by snatches , Father Paul 's voice , but Mama Rua 's responses , if any were made , were lost . So strong in me was the doubting European that , even at that moment , I could not share the belief of the hushed throng of villagers , waiting for the end . Nevertheless , within an hour 's time the end had come . CHAPTER XMY house was a tongue-and-groove cottage not far from the chief 's . It was cozy enough in my bedroom , with the lamp burning and the windows closed , although the frail building shook with each gust of wind . I blew out the lamp at ten and made an effort to sleep , but my thoughts returned to Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people possessed a power over the body that our harassed civilized minds had lost ? Like most white men in this part of the world , I had been witness to certain events difficult to explain . When the chief of Amanu lost his life in a reef boat which overturned in the breakers , the people of Manukura knew of his death and all the attendant circumstances a month before the schooner brought the news . I can hazard no opinion as to how this was communicated ; I can only vouch for the fact . Strange divinations were of fairly common occurrence , but Mama Rua 's death impressed me above and beyond this kind of thing . That a human being , apparently in normal health , should be able to die merely by wishing it shocked as well as irritated the medical man in me . THE HURRICANE 155 plush-upholstered chairs were ranged in their customaryplaces along the walls ; the watchers sat crosslegged on the floor , on either side of the bier . The other people were in the rooms beyond and the leesideverandah was packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long lines , their faces dimly illuminated by two lanterns hanging overhead . Sleeping children lay with their heads in their mothers ' laps , and some of the women suckled babies as they sang . One could feel the earnestness of the singers and the solemn pleasure they took in carrying out the dead woman 's wishes with respect to these last rites . You have not yet heard native singing . The taste for it must be acquired , no doubt . I well remember my first experience of it , aboard Nagle 's schooner on a bright starlit night far out at sea . There were thirty or forty Tuamotu folk , both men and women , aboard , going to a native festival at Makemo . One evening they gathered on the forward deck , and of a sudden broke into one of their pari pari fenua  --  the ancient songs of the land . I am , perhaps , rather susceptible to the emotions stirred by music . On this occasion I was not able to decide what the emotions were . Astonishment bordering upon incredulity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard singing in the least resembling this . Beyond anything else Polynesian it convinced me of the centuries of isolation from other branches of the human family that must have been necessary to evolve anything so154 THE HURRICANEFrom Terangi 's mother my thoughts wandered to her unfortunate son . In those days I knew nothing of the cave on Motu Tonga . I shared de Laage 's opinion that Terangi had slipped away in the night and made off to leeward . Poor devil ! By this time he was either ashore at some island where he was certain to be caught , or drowned , together with his wife and child . I inclined to the latter possibility , and even went so far as to hope , for his sake , that it might be true . Presently I got up , lit my lamp once more , and took down the dullest novel I possessed . It was past three when I awoke . I opened the door which gave on the south verandah and perceived at once that the wind had increased . The moon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by scudding clouds . Between the gusts I heard wild bursts of singing . They were holding a wake for Mama Rua as they always did for the dead . I dressed , blew out my lamp , and returned to the chief 's house , keeping an anxious eye on the bending , thrashing palms . The old woman , dressed in a gown of black satin with a mother-of-pearl brooch at her breast , lay in state in the chief 's salon . The candles burning at her head and feet guttered and flared in the eddies of wind that found their way through the cracks under the doors . None but the watchers were in the room : Mata , the chief 's wife , a middleagedwoman who was a niece of Mama Rua , and two grandmothers with snow-white hair . Fakahau's156 THE HURRICANEunique . Their harmonies , at first , are more than strange to European ears , but they have an intricate beauty of their own which becomes more and more fascinating the oftener one hears it . At least , so it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be written in our notation . I know that Madame de Laage , who was a thoroughly competent musician , made many efforts to take down some of the Manukura songs , and at last gave up the attempt as hopeless . Manukura was celebrated throughout the Archipelago , both for its songs and for its singers . Many of the people , the men in particular , had magnificent voices , but all could sing and sing well . They had an extraordinary ear for pitch . No instrument of any kind accompanied the voices , but they could begin and carry through one of their long choruses without the slightest flaw in key . The singing went on throughout the night , now plaintive , now wildly exultant , each hymn ending in the same fashion , with a deep humming of the basses , brought to an abrupt and simultaneous stop , followed by a long-drawn exhalation of breath , like a sigh , in which both men and women joined . All this while the wind was making the house tremble and the roar of the surf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever before heard it ; the ground shook under our feet at the impact of the seas . Duringone of the intervals I spoke of these portents toTHE HURRICANE 157 Fakahau . He answered me absent-mindedly . Like the other singers , he was rapt out of himself , stirred by the emotions evoked by these ancient songs of his race . Dawn was breaking when Madame de Laage returned . When she had paid her respects to the dead , she came to where I was sitting . " I ' m becoming frightened , Doctor , " she said , in a low voice . She smiled as she spoke , but I could see that she was seriously worried . " Do you know what the barometer reads ? Twenty-eight seventy ! And the wind is growing stronger every minute . " The news of the barometer gave me a shock that I took care to conceal . In these latitudes , the glass varies from 30:15 down to 29:70 , the latter during the rainy season when the wind comes from the northwest . It now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not westerly , but north to northeast . I would have been much easier in mind had the wind shifted one way or the other , for that would have been a sign that the storm was to pass to the east , or west . But it held steady at north-by-east . If a hurricane were on the way , it was headed straight for Manukura . The singing came to an end as Father Paul appeared , followed by two young men bearing a coffin of rough pine boards over which had been tacked a cotton sheet . When the body had been laid in it , the father placed a crucifix in the cold hands and made a sign to the chief . All Manukura filed into the room , each158 THE HURRICANEman and woman bidding Mama Rua farewell . None were dry-eyed and several of the older women wept in the Biblical sense , lifting up their voices . The pallbearers then shouldered the coffin and led the processionto the church . A more ominous-looking daybreakI have never seen . The clouds streaming southwardwere of a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . As we entered the church the bell began to toll : a sound faint and solemn , snatched away by the wind . When the brief service was over we set out for the burial ground on the outer beach . It was as much as we could do to make our way to windward against that mighty torrent of air ; nevertheless , all came , the young people helping the old . Another song was sung as Mama Rua was lowered into her grave , but standing to windward I could scarcely hear the voices , and for the moment I had eyes and ears for nothing but the sea . The spray came flying down wind in sheets that drenched us like rain , concealing the reef for long moments , but when it cleared we had glimpses of long gray ridges running in at an appalling height , thundering across the reef and up the beach far beyond high-water mark . Where we stood we were scarcely two feet above the level reached by those huge combers . A thrill of fear seemed to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings gazinganxiously seaward as Father Paul pronouncedTHE HURRICANE 159 the Eternal Rest . Although we had heard the deepeningroar of the surf throughout the night , none , I think , realized until that moment how high the sea had risen . We now filed quickly past the grave , each one leaning far over as the holy water was sprinkled , in a hopeless effort to prevent its being carried away by the wind . Then the people , as though moved by a common instinct , turned their backs to the sea and hurried toward the settlement . I remained with Father Paul , Fakahau , and Tavi , while the grave was hastily filled . We crouched behind the low wall of the burying ground , watching the seas piling higher and higher up the beach , almost at the foot of the wall itself . Never before had a low island appeared to me so incredibly low , so pitiably insecure . I felt a thrust of fear at my heart at the thought that this narrow causeway , no more than four hundred yards wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , we had to shout to make ourselves heard . Tavi had his hands cupped around his eyes , gazing northward through the flying scud . Presently he turned his head . " Have you noticed ? " he yelled . " All the sea birds are gone . That ' s a bad sign . They know there ' s something coming . " I had not remarked the fact until Tavi called our attention to it , but it was true . Manukura 's colony of sea fowl had disappeared : noddy terns , boobies , frigate birds , all had fled before the storm . This160 THE HURRICANEwas something that had never happened before during my time on the island . I put my lips to the chief 's ear . " What do you think , Fakahau ? Will the sea cover the land ? " " It may , " he shouted back . " A great storm is upon us , that is certain . It may be the matangihuri f enua . " Nothing could be more expressive than this native term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind that overturns the land . " " The church will stand , however strong the wind , " said Father Paul . He spoke with a quiet confidence which I envied him but could not share . The task of filling the grave was now finished . " Come , " he said . " We can do no more for our poor friend here . We must now think of the living . " I still have a vivid picture in my mind of the village islet as it appeared on that morning , the palms bent far over and their tattered fronds streaming out as stiff as boards in the wind . Perpetual clouds of spray from the reef half concealed the land , and through them one had glimpses of men and women running here and there along the village street , carrying their children from one refuge to another , while others worked desperately in an effort to anchor down their flimsy thatched dwellings with ropes fastened to near-by trees . I saw one small house go skittering over an open space until it was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vanished in THE HURRICANE 161 thirty seconds . Several other houses had already blown away and their contents were scattered far and wide over the lagoon . It was soon evident to all that the thatched dwellings would go , and the people were hastily gathering up bundles of their belongings and taking refuge in the church , the chief 's house , and Tavi 's store . The air was filled with flying debris , the most dangerousat this time being clusters of coconuts torn loose from the palms . When I reached Tavi 's house , a lad was brought in with a broken arm , and for the next half hour I was busy setting the bone  --  a clean fracture , luckily  --  and binding on the splints . I had just finished this task when I heard faint cries from the beach . A crowd of people gathered in the lee of Tavi 's copra shed were gazing southward across the lagoon . Not half a mile out , a sailing canoe , close-hauled , on the port tack , was footing it up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely touching the water , supported three human figures far out on the boom . The man at the steering paddle was leaning against it with all his strength , handling the flying canoe with the quick , certain gestures of the seaman born . An exclamation went up from the people around me : " Terangi ! " It was a splendid sight . Heeling far over to starboard , despite the counterbalancing weight of those on the boom , the canoe seemed to gather itself and rise , skimming the flat wind-torn surface of theTHE HURRICANE 163 were crowded with women and children and the younger people , looking at Terangi with all their eyes . Whatever his thoughts with respect to the news he had just heard , he put them to one side . He raised his hand for silence . " There is no time for many words , " he said . " A great storm is at hand . Our highest land is on Motu Tonga , and the width of the lagoon shelters it from the north . I have come to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge on Motu Tonga ; but those who will go must go at once . In an hour 's time it may be too late . " There was a hum of talk and argument as he sat down . Some were for taking his advice . Others could not , or would not , yet believe that a hurricane was upon us . Presently Fakahau stood up , his deep voice making itself plainly heard above the tumult of wind and sea . " Terangi has spoken , " he said . He has crossed from Motu Tonga at great risk to warn us of the danger . Let none of you mistake ! We shall need what refuge our lands can offer us . The moon will be full to-night . The worst will not come until then . My belief is that the sea will rise and overwhelm the land where we are , but my place is here with those who are too old to be moved . It is for each man to choose what he will do for his family , but let those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no time to be lost . " 162 THE HURRICANElagoon like a racing hydroplane . Full and by as she was , she was footing it at all of fourteen knots . Close to the pier , Terangi gave a heave on his paddle and the canoe shot up into the wind . The outrigger came smacking down ; Marama , Tita , and Mako sprang inboard , and the sail slatted wildly as half a dozen people rushed into the shallows to give their aid . Leaving the canoe to them , Terangi waded ashore with his daughter in his arms , followed by his wife and Mako . An old woman took him by the shoulders with both hands , giving a wailing cry as she did so . " Aare , Terangi ! You have come too late ! She is dead , your mother ! Dead and buried ! " Terangi glanced swiftly from face to face of those who awaited him and read the confirmation in their eyes . Others , Fakahau amongst them , were hasteningup . The chief , without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us following . To say that I was astonished at the appearance of Terangi and his family would be an understatement . I could scarcely believe my eyes . That was my first view of the man , for you will remember that he had been a prisoner during the whole of my time on Manukura . It was evident that the canoe must have come from Motu Tonga , but I did not then try to explain to myself how it had gotten there , or where Terangi and his family had hidden during our search for him . A moment later , Tavi 's store was filled with the chief men of the island , and the windows and doorsTHE HURRICANE 165 " It is now too late , " he said earnestly . The hur- ricane is upon us . You will sail her under if you make the attempt . " But the man whose family it contained was not to be deterred . His wife and three children and the wife 's father were already in their places . He took up his steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Seeing that further argument was useless , they did so . The small craft moved swiftly away from the scanty shelter of the land , yawing wildly as it tore over the smoking waters . Those on the beach gazed after it in anguish , the women wringing their hands . A curtain of rain obscured it for a moment ; then we caught a brief glimpse of it about a mile distant . As it rose to the crest of a sea , a gust of wind caught the sail broadside . A cry went up from the watchers as the canoe heeled over and capsized . Then we saw it no more. 164 THE HURRICANEThe chief then sent young men in both directions along the village street to inform the others . No commands were given , for , at such times as this , the decision as to what should be done was left to the heads of the families . Meanwhile , the whole of the northern sky was covered with a black squall that came upon us with incredible swiftness . The wind increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in horizontal sheets impossible to face . When it had passed , the first of the canoes made ready to cross the lagoon . It contained an entire family , with a heap of food and bedding under a tarpaulin amidships . Half a dozen neighbors held the little vessel bow to the wind , while the triple-reefed sail slatted wildly . The father , at the steering paddle , made a sign to the others ; the released canoe bore off , while the sail filled with a violence that made the slender mast bend like a fishing rod . She tore away to leeward , and a moment later had vanished in the rain . Canoe after canoe followed during the next hour . I admired the courage of those who went in them ; nothing could have induced me to take such a chance . But the wind was gathering strength with every moment , and it was soon clear that the risk of the eightmilecrossing had become too great for further attempts . Nevertheless , one last canoe was ready to go , despite the warnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , Tavi 's store was the most substantialbuilding on the island , and by early afternoon most of the families at the western end of the village had taken refuge there . An hour before , I had gone with Farani , Tavi 's son-in-law , to fetch Madame de Laage and Arai , who were still at the Residency . While they were gathering up a bundle of spare clothing , I took the opportunity to consult the glass once more . It was so dark that I could scarcely make out the track of the little pen . I perceived with a kind of horror that the instrument stood at 28:01 , a figure which meant , almost literally , the end of the world in these parts . There was no longer the slightest doubt of what was coming . It was a full quarter of a mile from the Residency to Tavi 's store . How we covered the distance I scarcely know , for the force of the wind was incredible . Tavi , with three or four men to help him , was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was overhaulinga couple of hundred fathoms of new Manilla lineTHE HURRICANE 167 which he passed rapidly through his hands as he examinedit for flaws . Outside , others were chopping down coconut palms on the beach a little to the east of the house . The force of the gale was such that the trees came crashing down to leeward after only a few strokes of the axe , leaving stumps four or five feet high . To these stumps Tavi now proceeded to make fast a pair of bridles with a thirty-fathom hawser attached to the middle of each . His plan was to ride out the storm , with any friends or neighbors he could persuade to join him , in his double-ended reef boats , which would lie to bridles side by side , about twenty yards apart . They were heavily built , seaworthy boats , and would hold a dozen people each . The stumps to which the bridles were made fast were the best of anchors , with their innumerable tough , fibrous roots spreading wide and deep in the coral soil , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cables with the heavy kedge anchors from the boats , bent on in the shallows about twenty yards from the beach . Within an hour 's time these preparations were completedand the boats left to ride to the bridles . Then Tavi took Madame de Laage and me aside . There was no doubt of his deep earnestness as he urged us to stay with him and his family and trust our lives to his keeping . " This will be such a storm as Manukura has not known within the memory of its people , " he said . THE HURRICANE 169 place ! Father Paul says make haste , those who are going to the church ! " There were , perhaps , a score of people huddled in Tavi 's leeside verandah , still uncertain as to what they should do . News of the rising sea now startled them into action . They gathered up their children and a variety of small packages done up in pareus and set out for the church . I had gone only a short distance with Madame de Laage when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . A group of natives were already gathered on the westward side of the bit of low-lying ground I have spoken of that crossed the island from north to south . The old footbridge had already been swept away and a stout hawser was now stretched across the place , as a hand rope , between the boles of two coconut palms . Several young men were stationed here to assist the women and children in crossing . Terangi was among those on the farther side . Madame de Laage stopped short at sight of him ; then her glance met mine . I knew as well as if she had spoken what her thoughts were . Both as- tonishment and relief were in her glance , but when she again looked toward Terangi there was no light of recognition in her eyes . She was determined not to see him . We had come to that place none too soon . As we stood on the bank another wall of water shoulder- high , carrying with it an indescribable mass of debris , came foaming through the depression from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you and the Doctgr ! The sea is still rising . By to-night it will cover the land . We have room for a score in the boats , but few are willing to come . They trust to the palms . Give no heed to them . Come with us , you two ! " Madame de Laage shook her head . " No , Tavi . It may be as you say , but I am terrified at thought of the boats . I put greater trust in Father Paul 's church . " Tavi laid a hand appealingly on her arm . " Madame , I was through the hurricane on Manihiki , in 1913 , when there was no land in sight from eveningto the break of day . Those of us who spent the night in boats , anchored as mine are anchored , lived . All those on the land were lost . " But Madame de Laage was not to be persuaded . As for myself , I was wholly of her opinion that the church with its thick walls of masonry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that my place was with Tavi and his family , for the birth of Hitia 's child could not be long delayed . Tavi was too generous to speak of this matter at such a moment , but I well knew that he wanted me there , in case the child should come . I told him that I would return as soon as I had seen Madame de Laage safely to the church . We were interrupted by a young man who burst into the room , his body streaming with rain . " The cP-i - " hP PXIa ; , , , e 1 . " It is crossing the land at the low170 THE HURRICANEbeach . It filled the gully from bank to bank . As the wave receded , draining away into the lagoon , Fakahau took Madame de Laage in his arms and rushed across , the rest of us following him . We squattered through the shallows like wounded ducks and all had reached the farther bank before another wave came . We entered the church through the small southern door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of masonry , was startling . Nearly all of the women and children of the island were assembled there , with Father Paul and a sprinkling of old people too feeble to be of assistance outside . The candles had been lighted on the altar and the small flames cast leaping shadows on the walls . The heavy door at the north end of the church had been closed and made fast and several men were now barricading it with bags of sand . The tall Gothic windows admittedonly a faint gray light , and lanterns were burning here and there on the benches where the old people sat . The priest came forward at once when he saw us . He took Madame de Laage 's hand . " Thank God you are safely here , my child ! " he exclaimed fervently . " I have been anxious . Had you not come I would have gone for you myself ! " After a word with the priest I again went outside , where there was work for every able-bodied man . The native is not an imaginative person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the last moment his preparationsto meet trouble or danger of whatever kind ; but in his casual manner he generally succeeds in beingready when the time comes . The hurricane was almost upon them before the men of Manukura began to choose the palms in which they hoped to see it through . Both the young and the old palms were passed by in making the choice . The trees selected were those from thirty-five to forty feet high , with well-establishedroot systems and no rotten spots in the boles . Men were swarming into the trees , lopping off the fronds with their bush knives , leaving a cluster of stout butts about a yard in length , with a few fathoms of rope tied to each cluster to assist them in climbinginto the trees when the time came . It was wild work with the trees swaying crazily and the heavy lopped-off fronds flying down wind . Ropes were stretched below , from tree to tree , which would give the people a handhold should a wave breach over the land while they were making their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist-high , through the groves , and from the church to two giant purau trees , each of them capable of holding a dozen people among its branches . I had been lending a hand here and there with the others , but the chief now warned me that I must return to Tavi 's house at once if I was to go at all . I was of the same mind , and I confess that I little172 THE HURRICANErelished the prospect of the journey back . I ran into the church once more to take leave of Madame de Laage and Father Paul . The priest was going about among the members of his flock , helping mothers with their small children and directing the work of the men who were arranging benches along the wall so that the old people might lie upon them in some comfort . His manner was as calm as if it had been a bright summer 's day outside ; he even made a little joke as he chided a young mother who had burst into frightened hysterical sobbing . " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuringly . " Fakaoti ki to oti  --  enough of premonitions of death . You are safe here . God will not desert us . " I was cheered by that quiet , confident voice , and deeply regretted the necessity for leaving those solid sheltering walls . My farewells were of the briefest . At the door I turned for a last glance back into the church . The roar of the wind in the belfry , the huddled groups of women and children in the flickering candlelight , and the white-bearded priest in his worn soutane moving from group to group , cheering them all by his presence , made a powerful impression upon my mind . Fakahau and Terangi were awaiting me outside . It was strange , at such a moment , how Terangi and I took each other for granted . We might have been friends of many years ' standing . Fakahau put his lips close to my ear . " Terangi ' s going with you , Doctor , " he yelled . THE HURRICANE 173 " Urge Tavi for my sake to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusts to the boats ! They can never ride through such a storm as this ! Go now , you two ! " We waited for a moment , watching the waves sweeping through the gully , each one carrying earth and sand with it into the lagoon . Then Terangi touched my arm . He led the way at a run out of the shelter of the church and was carried half a dozen yards to leeward before he could bend his body and adjust himself to the force of the wind . As I followed him , clutching desperately at the boles of the palms , I gave no thought to flying debris . What I now feared was being blown away like an autumn leaf . The danger was real , I assure you . Terangi had chosen the moment well . Three or four great waves had swept through the gully , and when we reached the bank , the water was no more than waistdeep . Even so , I would have been carried by the current into the lagoon had it not been for Terangi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast to whatever came to hand , we at last reached the store . Glancing down the road , I perceived with amazement that the Residencyno longer existed . Nothing remained of it save the whitewashed pillars of masonry upon which the house had rested . As for Tavi 's house , the whole of the weather side of the roof was gone and I expectedthe rest of it to disappear even as I looked atTHE HURRICANE 175 rugated iron , torn from the roof of the store , went hurtling past not a dozen yards above our heads . There could be no more dangerous missiles ; men have been known to be cut in two by them . Tavi yelled a warning , but we all saw our danger and threw our- selves flat on the bottom of the boat , between the thwarts . At that moment the land was once more blotted out by a tremendous horizontal squall of rain . In the midst of a tropical revolving storm , one con- tends not only with huge waves and winds of a hun- dred miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of the sea itself , caused by the sharp drop in atmospheric pressure . That part of the vil- lage islet where the church stood was , perhaps , a foot higher than the land elsewhere , but it was not long before the great volume of water being hurled over the reefs began to gain on this highest ground . What happened ashore at this time I did not , of course , know until all was over , but I shall tell of it here in the light of my later knowledge . Terangi got safely back to the church . By that time all the people had taken shelter within it save for the chief and half a dozen men who were crouched outside by the southern door . None spoke of what hey feared , but the same thought was in every man 's mind . They had done what they could . Nothing now remained but to wait to learn the sea 's will with hem . The roar of the surf piling over the reefs only174 THE HURRICANEit . He had gathered his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the boats with it forlorn little cargo of human freight already rod to her bridle ; the other was made fast in shallov water close to the beach .

" I shouted the chief 's messag into his ear . He shook his head resolutely . " To the church Never ! It will go , Doctor . There will be nothing left ashore by nightfall . " An instant later Terangi was gone . Before he ha ( proceeded thirty yards we lost sight of him in a blind . ing torrent of rain . We dared wait no longer in the lee of that shakin house ; the walls threatened to collapse at any moment My heart went out to Hitia . You can imagine the poor girl 's condition with her child still unborn , bui hurricanes take no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an oilskin . He no-% picked up his daughter and ran with her to the boat the rest of us following . We waded through the shallows and pulled ourselves over the gunwale , one by one . The mooring was cast off , and with four men at the hawser we slacked away gingerly until we rode to our bridle alongside the other boat . Nc sooner had we done so than several sheets of corTHEHURRICANE 177 and entered the church , followed by the others . The building was raised about six inches above the ground , but tongues of water had already found their way in at both doors and were spreading rapidly over the floor , reflecting the light from lamps and candles . Mothers with their children gathered round them gazed at the sight , their hearts numb with terror . They sat on the benches with their feet drawn up under them , as though they believed that they might be safe so long as the water did not touch them . Father Paul was standing under the altar with a sob- bing child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father , the church is no longer safe , " he said . " We must take to the palms . " " No , my son , " the priest replied calmly . " I built this church with God 's help , to withstand wind and sea . It will not fail us . " " Come , Father , " Terangi added earnestly . " I have a place ready for you in one of the purau trees . The sea already covers the land and is rising fast . Soon there will be no choice . Those who remain here will be caught without hope of escape . " Imagine the scene : the roaring wind adding its tumult to that of the sea , the water rising , even as they spoke , until it was ankle-deep over the floor of the church . And imagine , if you can , the unshak- able trust of the old priest in God 's mercy . He was not to be moved , for all the earnest pleading of those176 THE HURRICANEfour hundred yards away stunned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the church concealed the land from their view . Now and then one of the men would peer to windward around the corner of the building , but there was nothing to be seen in that direction save a few of the nearer palms , ragged fronds still clinging to them , bent far over in the torrent of air that was half flying water . Presently their bodies , sensitive to every warning of increasing menace , felt through the ground on which they rested the shock of an impact mightier than any that had preceded it , and soon a shallow wave , only a few inches deep , came licking along the sides of the building , slender tongues of water sinking into the sand around their feet . Terangi turned his head to glance at the chief , who was staring straight in front of him . They waited , each man eager to ignore what his eyes had seen , unwilling to acknowledge that the great enemy , the Sea , had come at last . Another wave followed , only a little deeper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring in tiny runlets into the lagoon . Then came a succession of small waves , smoking , hissing , harried by the wind , spreadingrapidly fanwise as they advanced , making narrow channels in the sand before they sank from sight . Terangi leaned over and shouted into the chief 's ear : " You have seen , Fakahau ? And the eye of the storm is yet far off . The church will go . " The chief nodded . The two men got to their feet178 THE HURRICANEwho lacked his faith . But he would have none stay with him against their will . He now stood on one of the benches to speak to his people , who crowded close to hear what he would say . " My children , the chief believes that our church is no longer safe . I do not share his belief . God sees us . Our need He knows . He will not suffer us to be lost . But I would have you do as you think best for your safety . Those who would take refuge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and save you all ! " So great was the people 's trust in Father Paul that many decided to stay in the church . It was , in fact , the only possible decision for some of the old people , too feeble to endure exposure to the full force of wind and rain . The leave-takings of that moment , as they were described to me later , must have been heartrending , as affecting to those who went out into the storm as to those who remained behind , for none of them but knew how desperate were their chances , whether they should go or stay . Those who were to go crowded about the door at the south end of the church as though unable to proceed farther , reluctant to forsake the last comfort remaining to them  --  that of numbers . It was Terangi and the chief together who roused them into action . Taking up his child in one arm , with Marama clinging to the other , Terangi made a run for the nearer of the life lines which had been stretched from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old iurau trees about forty yards to windward . Immediately they lost sight of everything save the lines to which they clung . The waves sweeping across the land were now knee-deep . They fought their way to windward , scarcely able to breathe in the torrents of rain and flying spray that lashed across their faces . They did not catch sight of their tree until they had all but reached it . Thick gnarled limbs branched from the trunk only a few feet above the ground . Marama scrambled up first , Terangi following close behind with Tita . They climbed to a great fork , a full fifteen feet above the ground . Tita was wrapped in an old oilskin coat which covered her completely except for a small opening through which she could breathe . Handholds of rope had already been preparedat the most likely perches , but Terangi secured his daughter with two or three turns of stout line that held her against the leeward side of the trunk . Marama was secured in the same manner close beside the child , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm for a moment , she drew her husband 's head close and shouted into his ear : " Madame de Laage ! " Terangi nodded , climbed quickly down the tree , and disappeared once more in the direction of the church . The scene there was one of the wildest confusion . The roofing iron of the steeply pitched roof was ripping off sheet by sheet , and as Terangi entered by180 THE HURRICANEthe small door on the lagoon side of the building , the tall Gothic window in the northern wall was burst in with a crash of rending wood and splintering glass . The candles had been snuffed out the moment the roof had started to go , and the only light now left burning was a hurricane lantern that Father Paul had set in a sheltered place under the altar . The chief , too , had returned to the church to give aid to others , having placed Mata , his wife , and their two younger children in one of the purau trees . Peering through the dim light , Terangi caught sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He perceived at once that she was keeping herself under control by a firm effort of the will . Some of the women had given way to hysteria and were moaningand crying , their heads in their arms . You must come with me , Madame , " he shouted brusquely . Your place is in the purau tree with my wife and child . It is your only chance . " She gazed up at him , incapable of speech . Taking her arm , he raised her to her feet . " Come , " he repeated , and led her quickly to the door . She accompaniedhim blindly , like a woman walking in her sleep . She drew back involuntarily when she perceived what awaited them outside , but Terangi took a firm grip on her wrist . " Do n't be frightened , " he shouted . The water is n't deep . Bend low ! . . . Now ! " They ran for the life lines , but had no more than reached them when Terangi saw that he had startedTHE HURRICANE 181 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the flying spray , was sweeping down upon them from the north , dashing high among the boles of the palms . He seized the woman 's hands , clenched them on the line , and braced himself for the shock . Madame de Laage 's hair , plaited in a single thick braid which had been coiled on her head , had fallen during their brief run from the church . Terangi seized it just as the wave was upon them and settled to a mighty grip on the line with his left hand . Both lost their footing in the swirl of waters that swept over them . The strain was too much for Madame de Laage . She felt her hands torn from the rope and fetched up with a shock that seemed almost to tear the scalp from her head . Terangi held on grimly , and when the force of the wave had spent itselfseized the woman in one arm . Holding fast to the life line with the other , he gained the shelter of the tree . When he had Madame de Laage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground , Terangi took his place beside his wife and child . He had done what he could , and now his place was with those under his care . The rain had ceased for the moment , and in the wild gray light of evening they could see for a distance of twenty or thirty yards , perhaps , on either side of them . A dozen people had taken refuge in this same tree , and there were as many more in the other purau a little to the west of them . There would have been room for others , but most of those182 THE HURRICANEwho had left the church put greater trust in the coconut palms . Through the clouds of spray , Madame de Laage caught glimpses of those near by , wedged in among the lopped-off butts of the fronds , and of isolated figures clinging desperately to the boles as they climbed aloft . Some of the people behaved with a strange perversity . Perhaps they believed that the storm had reached its height , refusing to admit that there might be worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They feared , it may be , that the final surrender of taking refuge in the palms would raise to greater fury the elements against them . At any rate , many of the young and able-bodied still remained below , holding fast to the ropes in little clusters as the combers swept over the land . Those in the trees peered down at them , straining their eyes in the uncertain light , shouting anguished warnings which were lost in the tumult of the wind . Against her will , Madame de Laage kept her eyes fixed on one group of five small dark figures who succeeded in maintaining their hold as comber after comber swept over them . They could not or would not , it seemed , seek the safety of the trees . Horrified at the sight , she closed her eyes for a moment . When she looked again they were gone . Night now descended upon Manukura , an hour of roaring darkness which preceded the rising of the moon . CHAPTER XIITHE two reef boats were moored , as I have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One held six . Ah Fong , our old Chinese baker , was among them , as were Mako and a married sister of Marunga , with her husband and their small daughter . There were eight in ours : Tavi , his wife , their boy Taio , their daughter Hitia , with her husband , Farani , Arai , a man named Kauka , and myself . By moonrise the rain began to fall in earnest . I have witnessed many tropical downpours , but the tons of water that descended upon Manukura that night were something new to my experience . " Descended " is not the word . It was driven against us and into us like knife blades ; like iron pellets . The sides of the boat afforded a little shelter , but even so our bodies beneath our clothing were tortured by the force of it . Imagine what it must have been for those who took refuge in the trees , exposed to the full force of those assaults . You will understand that we were not sitting up in the boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thwarts . Arai , Hitia , and her mother were184 THE HURRICANEin the bow , Tavi , Taio , and I amidships , and the other two aft . A piece of canvas large enough to have covered the women was torn from our hands as we were trying to place it around them . They wore oilskincoats and lay side by side on a mattress that had been reduced to sodden pulp by the rain . The moon was at the full , suffusing the clouds that raced across it with ashy light . It would emerge through tattered shreds of vapor , affording us glimpses of minute black dots that were people , two or three together , clinging to the frond butts of the palms . For all that the fronds had been chopped off to lessenthe purchase of the wind , the palms were bent far to leeward , vibrating like steel wires to the stress of the mighty force that held them so . Now and then one of them would snap off , halfway up the bole , and the upper part hurtle away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of straw . I saw one palm top in which were three people vanish in this manner . Lying as we did , so close to the beach , we were fairly safe from flying wreckage . I saw the last of Tavi 's house go . The walls collapsed and vanished in the winking of an eye . It was an uncanny sight . Before you could have pronounced two words , the foundations on which the house had stood were swept bare . Not long afterward the chief 's house followed , with its mirrors , its upholstered chairs and sofas , oil paintings , huge guest bed  --  in an instant there was THE HURRICANE 185 nothing left save the cistern of masonry against which the great seas breaching across the islet dashed and foamed . But the church still stood , and a lonely , desolate sight it was ! As though I had them before my eyes , I could see the little group inside , protected thus far from the full force of the wind , but with spray and solid water driving through the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers as the combers hurled themselves against the thick walls . I thanked God that I had taken Tavi 's advice . The building was doomed . Father Paul himself must have known it by this time . Nothingelse remained of Manukura village . The very land itself had all but disappeared beneath the seas that swept the islet from the north . In the swiftly changing light , now bright , now dim , only the trees could be seen , and the church with its gleaming white walls . It gave the impression of sinking slowly , as the seas , a fathom and more deep , swept around it , meeting beyond in great bursts of spray . Then it would appear to rise a little , as though buoyant , to meet the onset of the next wave . And all this while , above the tumult of the hurricane , we could hear , at times , the faint clanging of the bell , tolled by the wind . Its tones , remarkably sweet and clear , reached us as faintly , almost , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in so far as things human were concerned , and a desolate voice it was ! 186 THE HURRICANETrees were going down on all sides , many with people in them . It was unbelievable that those which might be able to withstand the wind could survive the battering of the sea . And yet the stumps to which the boats were moored held fast . We rode the seas well . The great force of them was broken before they swept into the lagoon . Rain and sea forced us to bail constantly , and for this purpose we used three brand-new chamber pots of enameled iron . They came from Tavi 's store . In our haste in leaving for the boats he had suddenly remembered the need we would have for bailers , and had seized upon the first things that came to hand . They served our purpose well . Being smooth and rounded and provided with good handles , the wind could not tear them out of our grasp . Even so , bailingthat boat was work as exhausting as I have ever done in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sprawled headlong over one another by the force of the wind . One vivid picture remainingto me from that night is of Tavi , crouched and facing aft , his broad back to the wind , taking his turn at bailing . Of a sudden a fiendish gust threw him at full length , but he held fast to the chamber pot . I can still see him so , his face turned toward me , with an expression of incredulity upon it that was faintly comical , even in our terrible situation . His lips were moving , but no sound of his voice reached me . We could only communicate by signs . THE HURRICANE 187It was at this time that a picture flashed into my mind of the quiet , comfortable bureau at the Ministry of Colonies , in Paris , and of my uncle and myself standing before the wall map on the morning when he tried to dissuade me from accepting the post in the Tuamotu Archipelago . I could hear him saying : " Another drawback , my dear nephew : those islands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are most unpleasant things to encounter . " The words kept repeating themselves in their appalling inadequacy . Unpleasant ! But what could my uncle , who had spent the better part of forty years in that sheltered room , be expected to know of hurricanes ? He dealt in statistics , not in the naked truths of life . The nakedness of a hurricane 's truth is not revealed at once . You think you are seeing it within an hour after the wind comes , but your experience of the pitilessmajesty of nakedness is enlarged from moment to moment . It must have been toward three in the morning that we saw the real thing . We had been bailing hard and had the boat clear of water to the battens . Tavi and I were lying side by side . He gripped my arm , and at the same moment I was aware of something more coming . It was that strange , immediate awareness of deeper menace one had during the war , when , as one lay under an intensivebombardment , scores and hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in action. 188 THE HURRICANEIntensity was intensified beyond all conceivable limits . So it was here . The island , what little remained of it , disappeared from view . Raising my head to the level of the gunwaleand shielding my eyes with my hand , I looked sidewise along what had been the beach . There was nothing to be seen  --  nothing : no church , no trees , no sign of any sort to show that land had ever been there . In that dim light , with the air filled with flying scud , it was impossible , of course , to see more than a few yards , but I did n't think of this at the moment . I thought we had gone adrift . I believed this in despite of reason which told me that it could n't be so , else we should have been immediately engulfed . Then came a deluge of rain that made the others seem light by comparison . We bailed withoutdaring to halt for an instant , although the ones without bailers could do no more than throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind take it . I was at the end of my strength when the rain slackened and ceased , but Tavi and Kauka worked on as though their powers of endurance were inexhaustible . Tavi was a big man , weighing well over two hundred pounds . He gave the impression of fatness rather than strength , and it was not until you felt one of those huge arms or legs that you realized how mistakenthe first impression was . The boat was once more cleared of water , and with the passing of that deluge the light increased . Presently , for a few moTHEHURRICANE 189 ments , the moon was shining in an all but cloudless sky . Moonlight . . . the full moon . . . what suggestionsof peace , of serenity , are in the words ! There can be nothing more beautiful in nature than a coral island , on a windless night , under the light of the full moon , but I leave you to imagine the desolation of the scene we now beheld . I looked first toward the church , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession of combers . No vestige of it remained above the waste of moonlit water . The whole of the village islet was like one of those great mid-ocean shoals so feared by mariners , except that there was still evidence that land had been there . Hundreds of palms were down , but others yet stood , with men , women , and children in them . I should never have believed that the coconut palm had such resilient strength . The stems of those that remained were bent in what seemed impossible arcs , but the sea was their great enemy , washing away their holdingground so that the wind could take them . So many had gone that I could now see for the first time one of the old purau trees that stood near the church . It was a superb old tree , with a trunk four feet in diameter , and seemed a contemporary of the island itself . I could make out several people clinging to what remained of it , but at that distance it was impossible to recognize them . The other purau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HURRICANEWe lived from moment to moment . None of us believed that we could survive the night , but we clung to life as all animals do . I crawled forward to where Marunga and Hitia lay , fearing and more than half expecting that Hitia 's child might have been born within the past half-hour . She lay on her side , between Arai and her mother . Her eyes were closed and her drawn face told me of the pain she was in . Marunga tried to shout some message to me , but I could hear nothing . She shook her head , indicating that there was no immediate need for me . Something was amiss in the other boat . We saw the men crouched in the bow , trying to pull themselvescloser to their mooring . We could n't at first make out what they wanted to do ; then we saw that one thick strand of their Manilla line had parted . I have looked on at many pitiable scenes in my time , particularly during the war , but on none more heartsickeningthan this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten feet from the bow of the boat , and they were trying desperately to heave in that small length of line . But what could three men do against the combined strength of wind and sea ? Had they been straining at the mooring line of the Normandie the attempt could not have been more useless . And we could do nothing but look on . At last they gave up . I was spared the anguish of helpless watching . Hitia 's labor came on at this time . Once , duringTHE HURRICANE 191 the war , I delivered a peasant woman in the cellar of a shell-wrecked farmhouse , at a moment when French and German troops were fighting with bombs and bayonets for the heaps of brick rubble overhead . I had established a first-aid dressing station in the cellar only that morning , and there were a dozen badly wounded men lying on the floor . How this woman chanced to be among them I never knew , but there she was , and she gave birth to her child in the midst of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was tying up the umbilical cord when a bayoneted German pitched down the stairway at my feet . He had been stabbed through the belly . I remember thinking : I shall never again have an obstetrical case under such conditions as these . A doctor should have known better than to make so rash a statement . Life can show a diabolical ingenuity , at times , in varying even its most commonplace occurrences . Until Hitia 's child came , I was able to put aside , as a physician must and can , thought of everything except the matter in hand . I do n't say that I forgotthat we were in the midst of a hurricane . That would have been impossible , God knows ! But I was conscious of a feeling of something like peace  --  a core of quietness in my heart . You will understand if ever you ' ve had work to do that had to be done , no matter what the conditions ; even though you knew that you might not survive the accomplishmentof it. 192 THE HURRICANEMarunga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body gave some protection from wind and sea . Hitia lay with her head in her mother 's lap . Few white women could have survived such an ordeal ; for one thing , their labor would have been more prolonged and the exposure would have killed them . Hitia 's child was born within the half-hour . Marunga was prepared to take it the moment I could pass it to her . She had brought , inside her oilskin coat , a folded cotton quilt . Wrapping the infant in this , she opened her dress and placed it next her body , rebuttoning her dress and the oilskin coat . I had scarcely finished with Hitia when land and sea were blotted out in anotherdeluge of rain . When it had passed , I saw that the other boat was gone . No trace of her , nor of those who had been in her , was ever found . I shall not speak further of the events of that night . There were none , unless the stupefying forces of wind and sea may be called events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conception of either . When day broke , the sea was at its height , and the only land visible was a mound of coral fragments which had been heaped up among the stumps of the coconutpalms , close to the lagoon beach . The mound remains to this day , an adequate memorial of a hurricane 's strength . Some of the boulders are tons in weight , fragments torn from the outer reef and carried by the sea across the land . Had it not beenTHE HURRICANE 193 for the refuge afforded by that heap of coral debris , I should have been dead these ten years past . We reached it by one of those freakish chances which are the result of the most delicate balancing of forces . The wind abated about seven in the morning , and in a time incredibly short it fell away to a dead calm . I mean precisely that : not a breath of air stirred . The sky above us cleared until it was of the serenest blue , but far away , on the rim of the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous in the morning light . A more ominousspectacle could not be imagined . For hours we had been beaten and battered almost out of our senses by wind and rain . The sudden assault of silence , of profound , sunlit tranquillity , was stupefying . We were not prepared for it , and when we spoke , we still shouted to one another . Tavi almost deafened me by yelling into my ear : We ' ve not seen the last of it , Doctor ! There ' s more to come ! " I had little doubt of that . Every sign indicated that Manukura lay directly in the path of the hurricane , that we were now passing through the centre of it and should soon have the wind again , as strong as before , but from the opposite direction . Meanwhile , our situation was perilous . One of the lines of our bridle had carried away , and it seemed only a matter of minutes until the other would go . We194 THE HURRICANEswung at an angle , now that the wind had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamped . Tavi and Kauka , at the oars , managed to save us half a dozen times . Farani and I bailed for our lives . Our only hope  --  and a forlorn one it was  --  seemed to be to reach , somehow , the mound of fragments heaped upon the beach . Then came the freakish chance of which I have spoken . All through the night the seas had been pouring over the northern reefs along the twenty-mile length of Manukura lagoon . This great excess of water sought what outlets it could find , with the resultthat a mighty current was setting out through the pass . This kept swinging us sidewise into the combers sweeping across the land . This clash of forces , from east and north , made a confusion of waters terrifying to see : whirlpools , eddies , crosscurrents , wave meeting wave at every conceivable angle . Tavi and Kauka were all but helpless with exhaustionwhen this chaos united for an instant , seemingly with the benevolent purpose of saving the lives of eight forlorn human beings  --  nine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water like a small pyramid leaped up of a sudden , and we were swept toward the beach . Tavi had his wits about him . He yelled to Kauka to pull in his oar and plied his own with all the strength he had left . Our line was just long enough to permit us to swing , broadside on , against the heap of coral , and the boat was set downTHE HURRICANE 195 between two boulders  --  set down gently and left stranded there ! It was a miracle , no less ! For a moment we stared at one another stupidly . Such a stroke of luck put a strain upon what sanity remained to us . Then we scrambled out in desperatehaste . Tavi and I lifted Hitia while the other men flung out the mattress and leaped after it . We had no more than gotten out of the boat when anotherwave carried it away again . The rope soon parted , and we saw the little craft that had served us so well swept at incredible speed toward the pass . The mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-sized room . Twice , during the next half-hour , huge fragments of coral came rollingand grinding across the land to crash into it , but the impacts seemed only to wedge the tighter those beneath us . We were hard put to find places of safety , for the top of the mound was no more than six feet above the reach of the sea . The mattress was flattened into a crevice so that Hitia could manage to lie upon it with her knees drawn up . Marunga and Arai crouched on either side of her , and the rest of us took what shelter we could find . Through gaps amongst the slabs of rock we could see the foaming water beneath , but the view that chilled the heart was to the north , across the drowned land . It required courage to look in that direction for more than a few seconds at a time , for the seas , lifting their backs as they ap-196 THE HURRICANEproached the reef , seemed to rise higher than the mound to which we clung . But we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they broke , and the brunt of their force was spent before they swept round our refuge and on into the lagoon . A few palms still stood , some leaning far over , their holdingground all but washed away . I counted five in which people were discernible , but who they were it was impossible to say . Both of the old purau trees that had stood near the church were gone . How long our respite from the wind lasted , I do not know . Half an hour , perhaps , although the time seemed infinitely long . In the midst of it there happened as strange an incident , I dare say , as ever took place during a hurricane . You can picture our numbed , pitiable plight . Fortunately , we were numbed in an emotional sense as well as physically . We had a dull realization of the extent of the disaster . We knew that there were few survivors exceptingourselves , but nothing of the pain of loss could come home to us then . Farani had somehow wormed himself into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and shoulders emerged . He peered toward his mother-in-law with bloodshot eyes . " Where is the child , Mother ? " he asked . " Here , " Marunga replied , glancing down at her bosom . " What is it , a boy or a girl ? " THE HURRICANE 197Marunga stared at him and then at me . " Which is it , Doctor ? " she asked . There was something truly comical in the shamefaced manner in which she spoke . Her daughter 's first child ; her own first grandchild , and she did n't know its sex ! Nor could I tell her . I must have noticed at the moment of birth , but the recollection had gone clean out of my head . It ca n't have happened often , in the history of childbirth , that the attending physician , the midwife and grandmother , the parents themselves , have been ignorant of the sex of a child a full hour after it has come into the world . But not many of humanity 's infants have chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was , perhaps , some excuse for our ignorance . Hitia , who had been lying as inert as a corpse on the sodden mattress , raised herself to a sitting positionand gazed wildly at her mother . " Do n't you know which it is ? " she cried . " You have n't got it ! It ' s dead ! It ' s dead ! You left it in the boat ! " The poor girl was herself half dead and all but out of her senses . Never shall I forget the tenderness in Marunga 's voice as she bent over her . " No , no , my daughter ! It is here , living ! " Quickly she dried her hands on her hair , fumbling in her haste to unfasten the garments over her breast . She thrust in a strong brown hand and felt her way198 THE HURRICANEwithin the wrappings covering the mite against her bosom . " A son ! You have a little son ! " she exclaimed , her face beaming . And then , in that desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any moment to drown us , we distinctly heard a faint wail . I tell you , it was something to be remembered ! That minute human sound made itself heard against the thundering tumult of the vast Pacific . " There , Hitia ! You heard him ? " Tavi half shouted , bending over his daughter . " A warrior ! A man child ! " I scarcely know how it was , but at that moment we seemed to feel a faint thrill of hope , all save Hitia , perhaps , who was lying with her head in her arms , her body shaking with hysterical sobs . The tiny voice of the hour-old child certainly had something to do with it . If the most helpless of livingcreatures could survive what we had gone through . . . Tavi , whose face was swollen almost past recognition , turned his bleared eyes toward mine , and smiled . " You ' ve a good place there , Doctor ? " he asked .

We survived , but after a further experience of a hurricane 's wrath that I shall pass over with the briefest possible mention . It was worse than that in the boat . I do n't like to think of it , even at this distance of time . We had made what preparations we could for the wind from the south , wedging ourselves amongst the boulders until we were almost a part of the mound itself . Tavi sat astride of one rock , his arms around another , bent over Hitia so that he could shield her body with his own . Arai was behind him on the same rock , with her arms around his waist . Marunga had worked her way beneath an overhanging rock that later proved a godsend in shielding her and the infant from the worst of the rain . She lay on her side well wrapped in the oilskin coat .
