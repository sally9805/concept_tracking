Some U. S. symphony orchestras change conductors almost as rapidly as women change hat styles . Not so the 48-year-old Chicago Symphony . Its first conductor , the late Theodore Thomas , lasted 14 years . When he died in 1905 , Chicagoans got a new one , a droop-mustached German named Frederick Stock . Him they have kept ever since . <P> Chicago music-lovers , remarkably constant in their devotion to Conductor Stock , are also remarkably devoted to the memory of Conductor Thomas . Every year since Conductor Thomas ' death , a memorial concert has been held in his honor . Last week dignified 66-year-old Stock ambled to his place on the stage of Chicago 's long-used Orchestra Hall to commemorate for the 34th time the death of his predecessor . Behind him sat 2,500 rapt Chicagoans , many of them oldsters who had heard their first overture played under Thomas ' energetic baton . Solemnly they listened while white-haired Stock conducted Debussy 's Berceuse hroique , Richard Strauss 's A Hero 's Life , Beethoven 's heroic Fifth Symphony . <P> Thirty-four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's viola players to succeed Thomas as the Chicago Symphony 's head man , Chicago concertgoers were skeptical . During his first year Chicago newspapers printed scathing articles about the need for a more eminent conductor . But patient , plodding Stock stuck to his guns . In the many seasons since then he has made himself a reputation as one of the topflight U. S. conductors . Genial Frederick Stock prefers , and conducts best , the works of the German romantics , but he gives his audience a more varied and balanced musical diet than any other U. S. conductor except , perhaps , Boston 's Sergei Koussevitzky .
