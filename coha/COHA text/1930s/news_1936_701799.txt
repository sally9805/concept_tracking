txt " Is this an ultimatum ? " asked the rejected lover . " It is an ultimatissimum , " replied the frigid and learned lady . Things in Europe have not yet come to that last despairing pass . Captain EDEN used significant words when he handed to the German diplomatic representative in London the findings of fact and the conclusions reached by the Locarno Powers . " This is not an ultimatum , " said the British Foreign Secretary . This means that it is not a communication which said or implied " Submit or fight . " Indeed , Berlin was at once asked to offer counter proposals , with the assurance that they would be duly considered . Thus the door is not closed on further negotiations . In reality the agreement and notification by the Locarno Powers consisted of two parts . One was the definite announcement of actual accomplished facts . Great Britain had agreed to enter into a military alliance with Belgium and France in order to resist a possible attack by Germany . Moreover , the general staffs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object of arranging joint operations to the best advantage . To these statements of what has been done , Germany is not expected to make a reply . Nothing that she could say now would alter this fixed arrangement . But the other part of the diplomatic note to Berlin requires an answer . Will the German Government agree to submit the Franco-Soviet treaty to the World Court and to abide by the decision of that tribunal ? Will Germany also assent to having a narrow strip of the Rhineland frontier policed by a joint international force ? On these two points word from Berlin is awaited in London . It can scarcely be expected to be an unqualified affirmative . But if it opens the way for further discussion , time will be left for excited spirits to calm down , and for suggestions of a satisfactory alternative course . The French Government , which now is freed of the presence of the Chamber of Deputies in Paris continually to harass it is apparently as anxious as the British to work and wait for a reasonable settlement . Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous one to the German people . They must to the last man vote approval of the dictator next Sunday . If any were thinking to remain away from the polls , they will be dragged there by the police . And when they pick up the official ballot they will find that they have no opportunity to vote against HITLER or the particular member of the Reichstag set up by him in their district . Even NAPOLEON III in his famous plebiscite , which led to his becoming Emperor , allowed the French to vote " No " if they wanted to . But no one in Germany will be permitted a negative vote on March 29 . Such a forced unanimity , which HITLER will doubtless flourish triumphantly in the face of the world as his complete vindication , will seem to everybody outside Germany to be farcical . Inside , however , the danger is that it will be taken as a fresh warrant by HITLER to say and do whatever mad thing comes into his head .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
