ON GREENSIDE ISLAND A STORY BY W. TOWNEND 4 ( NOTHING ever happens in the Isle of Dogs after eleven p.m. , " said Mr. Truscott as he and I walked along West Ferry Road in the dark . " Everyone 's in bed and asleep . " As though to prove the folly of making rash statements about the East End of London , there came into sight , a hundred or so yards distant , a heavily built , stout man who ran toward us shouting . We halted . Mr. Truscott took the pipe from his mouth and spat into the gutter . " Whatever in the world 's wrong with yon ? " he said . As the stout man drew near I was amazed to hear that the words he shouted were : " Save yerselves ! They 're on us ! Save yerselves ! " He was as one bereft of all reason , crazy with terror , and not in the least responsible for what he said . Mr. Truscott , as calm and levelheaded a chief engineer as I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of God ! " he muttered . " Look what 's following him ! " You may not believe , but what I write is the truth : the whole width of West Ferry Road , from sidewalk to sidewalk , was covered by a dark mass advancing rapidly after the running man , flowing like a dark stream of liquid , and a threat in some way or other to his safety ; for if he lingered , if he hesitated , if he slackened his speed  --  this was my impression at that instant  --  he would perish . " Save yerselves , " he yelled . " They 'll kill us . " At that particular part of West Ferry Road where Mr. Truscott and I stood I could have sworn there was no one visible save only the running man ; yet when a big young policeman ran out of the shadows and grabbed him by the arms and called to us , " Get to the side of the street , quick ! " I was not surprised . Nevertheless , though not surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was afraid without knowing why . The dark mass in which were tiny pin points of reflected light was very near , yet even now I did not grasp the significance of what I saw . Mr. Truscott who was , it seemed , as afraid as I was , explained . " Rats , " he said briefly . " See the devils ! " " Rats , " said the big young policeman , " migrating from that old warehouse by the river . They 're going to commence pulling it down to-morrow . The rats , they knew all right . " His voice broke sharply . " Chuff , you damn ' well stop it . " The heavily built , stout man who had run down the street had neither moved nor spoken since the policeman had dragged him to the doorstep where we stood . He had gazed in silence at the approaching mass , but now that the rats were actually passing us , galloping steadily and purposely , recognizable as individual rats , his restraint vanished in a fresh access of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grasp . It was as much as the three of us could do to hold him back . Had we released him he would have plunged headlong , I felt convinced , into the multitude and suffered . As it was , he raved and yelled and struck out wildly with his fists until we held his wrists , and all the while the rats went running past , thousands upon thousands of big gray London rats , intent on their journey , oblivious , it seemed , of their surroundings , of the closed shops , of the heads that appeared at the upper windows , of the four of us struggling together . " Chuff , " said the policeman , " I 've a damn ' good mind to run you in . You 're drunk . " Chuff , no longer capable of fight , sat on the doorstep . " They make me sick , " he whimpered . " I thought they 'd got me . " He raised his head and gazed at each of us in turn . " Did you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'd like to know . " " Anything what ? " said Mr. Truscott . " Was there anything going down that there street just now  --  anything out of the common , like  --  or was it just kind of imagining ? " In the light from the closed shop , in the doorway of which he sat , I could see doubt in his shrewd little eyes , doubt and fear and a vague hope . " It was n't imagining , " said Mr. Truscott dryly . " No , " said the young policeman , " what you thought you saw , Chuff , you really did see . It was n't the horrors yet . " Chuff shuddered . " Rats , " he said and rested his head upon his knee , " rats , they make me sick . " " I 've never seen so many rats in my Life before , " I said , " and I do n't suppose anyone else has either . " Chuff began to laugh . His laughter was as wild and unrestrained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never seen so many rats , he has n't , in his life before ! My God ! he has n't seen so many rats in his life before . Never inhis life before , he has n't seen so many rats ? " The policeman hauled him to his feet and shook him . " Shut up ! " be ordered . " Shut up , you crazy fool ! " The shop door opened and a small , elderly man with a bald head and spectacles and a big red mustache appeared . " That 's Chuff , ai n't it ? " he said . " Better bring him inside a minute . It 's them rats of course . " " Yes , " said Chuff in a tired voice , " and that fella there saying he never seen so many rats in his life before . Silly , ai n't it ? " " Weil , " said Mr. Truscott , " not so silly as maybe you 'd think . I 've never seen so many rats in my life either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " Chuff looked at Mr. Truscott with contempt in his eyes . " Mister , once I seen tens of thousands of rats fighting for life , murdering , screeching , tearing , tormenting rats , black and brown and gray and red : great big beasts they was , with the king of rats in charge of the lot of ' em . God ! I ca n't think of it . " He turned and tried to escape , but the policeman held him and the bald man with the red mustache and the spectacles stood to one side . " Bring him in , " he said , " and I 'll give him a cup of strong coffee . It 'll do him good . " We entered a little coffee shop which was furnished with a couple of wooden tables and high-backed benches and a counter . A small iron stove , resembling the old-fashioned bogie of the fo'c's'le , threw out a warmth which was comforting after the cold east wind of West Ferry Road . A framed picture of the Cutty Sark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the counter stood a copper tea urn and cups and saucers and a sandwich loaf and a ham and plates of rather unappetizing-looking buns and rock cakes . At the back of the stove was a gas cooker . Above the gas cooker rose shelves , laden with packets of chocolate and cans of fruit and glass bottles of pickles and pots of jam . " Sit down , Chuff , " said the man with the red mustache fiercely . " Sit down , d' you ' ear me ! " Chuff seemed to have lost all interest in what was happening . He sat with his elbows on the table and his chin resting on his fists and stared blankly into space . Mr. Truscott and I sat opposite him . The big young policeman stood by the little stove . He seemed , I thought , apprehensive . " Duty 's duty , " he said , " but if the Inspector comes along he 'll have something to say to me , being in here . You , Chuff , feeling a bit easier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man with the red mustache set a cup of coffee in front of him . " What was we talking about just now ? " Chuff asked . " The rats , " said Mr. Truscott . " Aye , so we were . " " You said you 'd seen tens of thousands of rats fighting ! " " And did n't I ? You ' eard me . I said so . " He was in dead earnest . His round pink face with the folds of fat about the chin was very serious . His small red-rimmed eyes glanced from Mr. Truscott to me and back again to Mr. Truscott . It was almost as though he suspected us of laughing at him . He rubbed his round bulbous nose with his finger and scowled . Presently he said : " You do n't believe in them there rats , do you ? " " And a rat king ? " I said . " Was there a rat king ? " " And why the hell not ? " said Chuff . " Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want a king or something , do n't they ? So do rats . So do land crabs . And they fought , under a full moon , all the rats and the land crabs . I seen ' cm . " " Where was this ? " I said . The man with the bald head and the red mustache leaned on the counter . " Get him to tell you , " he said . " It 's a good yarn . " He turned to Chuff . " Alf , tell them about the rats . " " You at sea ? " Chuff said . " I am , " said Mr. Truscott . " Chief engineer of the Kolba . " Chuff considered . " The Kolba , " he said . " That 's one of Freemantle and Stern 's old hookers . Built too narrer in the beam , all of ' em . " " What about the rats ? " I asked . Chuff frowned . " You at sea ? " " No . " " Then wait till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gentleman , not you . " Mr. Truscott laughed . " Speaks his mind , do n't he ? " " Do n't you be rude , Chuff , " said the man with the red mustache . " Get on with your story . " " Did you ever hear of the Greenside ? " Chuff said . " The Greenside o ' West Hartlepool , belonging to old Jim Chapman , a big old tub that was doing well if she managed her seven knots . " " The Greenside , " said Mr. Truscott thoughtfully . " Now let me see . Was n't the Greenside lost with all hands ten year back , about ? " " You got it wrong , " Chuff said . He drank some coffee , all the while eyeing Mr. Truscott over the rim of his cup . " You got it all wrong . Lost in nineteen nineteen she was , but not with all hands . I know for a fact . " He set down his cup and leaned across the table . " Shall I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Shall I ? Well , I will . It 's because you see in me the one mar what come off the Greenside alive . Me , Alfred Chuff . That was how I come to meet the rats and the land crabs and seen ' em fight . I did . I seen ' em with my own eyes . " " Tell us , " I said . " If I did you would n't believe me . " " We would , " I said . " Chuff , " said the policeman , " how do we know you were ever at sea at all or out of England ? " " Well , I was , and if anyone ses I was n't he 's a liar , police or no police . See ? I was bos'n aboard the Greenside o ' West Hartlepool , owned by old Jim Chapman , in nineteen nineteen , the year after the War . Captain Reynolds was skipper . Old Bob Reynolds . A man , old Bob Reynolds was . You do n't get ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Captain Reynolds what piled the Green- ? side up on that there reef . " " What reef ? " " Du n no . It 's marked on the chart , a mile or so sou ' - sou ' west o ' Greenside Island . " " Greenside Island ! " " They give it that name after the Greenside was lost there . Before it was n't called nothing . It did n't have no name . I mean , what could they call an island a mile long by half a mile wide ? Why should they call it anything ? Well , why ? No reason . " The night we struck I turned in and slept sound an hour or so and then woke sudden because the carpenter who had the lower bunk was shaking me . ' Get up , ' he sed , ' get up , bos'n , for Heaven 's sake , we 're sinking fast ! ' I did n't wait to argue or nothing . I just rolls out my bunk and was half-dressed before I knows from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was down by the stern and listed to port , we was steady and fast and not in the least like sinking . A fair panicker , that there carpenter always . I remember once in Rio him ? " The policeman who had finished his coffee interrupted . " I have n't any too much time , Chuff . I 'd be obliged if you 'd keep to the point . " " He 's like that always , " said the man with the red mustache . " Chuff , o ' man , cut all that part and come to the rats . You know , Chuff , the rats . " Chuff wrinkled his forehead . " Ah I the rats . I was forgetting , was n't I ? " He drank some coffee and said , " Them rats , eh ! I took notice of ' em first after we got the boats swung out and was standing by for orders . I ses : ' God , what 's that ! ' I trod on something what give a squeal . The moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green-side 's rats , all of ' em in their thousands coming up from the holds which was full of grain . They knew all right o' course . " " Knew what ? " said Mr. Truscott . " Knew that the ship , wedged fast as she was on that there reef , was sinking . Do n't tell me rats got no intelligence . Them rats we seen just now in West Ferry Road , them horrible slinking things running along , they knew , did n't they ? They knew that there warehouse was coming down they 'd lived in . So did the rats of the Greenside know we was going to slide off that there reef and sink . " They sat and watched us . It 's the truth . They sat on the engine-room skylights and the wireless house and the saddleback hatch . There was thousands of ' em , all watching and waiting . It give ye the creeps to see ' em . They did n't do no harm but there they was , thousands of ' em , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the hands , he ses to me , Bos'n , if we got to take to the boats , what 's it to be , men or rats ? For , ' he ses , there wo n't be no room for the lot of us . ' Ah , you may well laugh , but it were n't no laughing matter on board the old Green-side that windy night when our bow was high and dry on a coral reef and our stern in deep water . " What happened ? The rats was right . When we least expected it , the Greenside begun to slide off that there reef . Alf Chuff , he ses nothing about what other men may or may not have did at a time like that there I 'm talking about , but if you ask was there a rush for them there boats , aft ! that 's a different state of affairs altogether . There was . Yes , gents , all hands , I 'm sorry to say , made a rush for them there boats , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat where I was , on the number three hatch , reflecting on life , like , thinking hither and yon , as the saying goes , about my past and my future and my gal at home and what her mother said to me last time we met and taking a swig now and then at the bottle I 'd found where the steward had hid it under his pillow and I did n't move . " " Why not ? " Mr. Truscott asked . " I could n't tell ye . I just did n't . I sat on the hatch I did , till the water covered my waist and then I went to the lower bridge . The rats was there too : thousands and thousands of ' em , so that I had to clear them out of my way with my feet for fear I 'd tread on ' em . " The old man sat in his room . The dynamo was n't running no more and he 'd lit his oil lamp . He seemed surprised when he seen me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stay by the ship . I piled her up . Care for a drink ? ' I ses I do n't mind if I do . He poured me a glass of whisky . We drank . ' Here 's luck , ' he ses . And then he ses , ' Bos'n , if you 'll pardon my asking ' ? polite always he was ? ' if you 'll pardon my asking , is that there object a red rat setting on the settee or not ? ' Well , it was . Yes , gents , there was a red rat , a big young rat with long and handsome whiskers and little red eyes setting by himself , watching us . The biggest rat I ever seen . I ses , ' Yes , sir , that there is a rat . ' We sat and looked at the rat a long time and we drank our whisky and the Captain ses , ' I would n't have believed it . Did you hear what it said ? ' Me , I was scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat , ' ses the Captain , ' he asked me , plain as billybe-damned , how he and his mates was going to get taken off . ' " I did n't like it . It was n't in the nature o ' things a rat talking to a master mariner and a red rat at that . I ses , ' It do n't do to pay no attention to what a rat has to say , but if it 's all the same to you , Captain Reynolds , I could do with another shot o ' whisky . ' And then I felt sleepy and the last thing I hear is the old man telling me he 's got to go to the top bridge to have a look round . " When I wake it 's morning and I 'm all alone but for the rats . " " What happened to the Captain ? " I said . " You may well ask . I never seen him no more . It 's my belief he fell into the sea and was drowned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I should do . The poop and the afterdeck was under water : so was the bridgedeck : so was the fore-deck and the hatches . All I could see from where I sat was the boatdeck and the fiddley and the funnel and mainmast and the two small boats on the davits and the wireless house and the lower bridge and , when I twisted my head , the foremast and fo'c's'le head . The two lifeboats had vanished . I thought maybe they 'd set sail for Apia . Maybe they had . But they never got there . They never got nowhere . From that day to this there 's never been nary a sign of ' em . About half-a-mile to the nor ' - nor ' - east was that there island I was talking about and I knew that my one hope of staying alive if the Greenside sunk was to swim ashore . " I heard a scuffling by and by and there was the big red rat setting up on his haunches watching me . We did n't speak . We sat and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world do ye want wi ' me ? and I thought , no , I ca n't help ye . I got to look after myself . Maybe the rat spoke , maybe he did n't . I ca n't be sure . Rats ca n't speak o ' course , so it 's no use your looking at me like that . But if a rat could of spoke , gents , that there rat would of been the one to do it . And then , while I was thinking what we could do , the Greenside slid a bit more off that there reef and rolled over to port and I jumped into the sea and swam . " I was n't alone . All round me was rats , their noses out of the water . I swam and the rats swam . I wondered whether I 'd make it . I thought I 'd sink before I was halfway to the island , but I did n't sink . I swam till I found I could touch bottom and then I crawled ashore and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled ashore , half-dead as well . " Well then , there we was , me and them rats , and the next thing I remember was it was evening and the moon was coming up over the sea and so clear and bright you could see things as plain as you could in the daytime and I seen  --  what do you think I seen ? I 'm asking you , gents , what do you think I seen ? " Chuff gazed earnestly at Mr. Truscott . " You 're a seafaring man , " he said . " Guess what I seen . " " Well , what ? " said Mr. Truscott . " Crabs . Land crabs . There come crawling to'rd me where I sat on the sand the biggest , ugliest crabs you ever seen , thousands of crabs , millions of ' em . " He shuddered . " God , they was worse than the rats ! " I sat and looked at ' em . And they looked at me . And then I got to my feet and I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies , gents , I was more afraid than I ever been in my life . I took to my heels , gents , and I run . I seen a young rat killed and tore to pieces before my eyes and I thought , give them crabs a chance and that 's where you 'll be , Alf Chuff , tore to pieces and food for land crabs . I did n't wait . I just took to my ' eels and run . And where ? Why , round that there island , back to where I started from , and all I seen was land crabs and rats , scuffling and crawling and spying one another over the stones and rocks and fighting . Yes , boy , they 'd begun to fight . Me , I give it up . What chance was there for me , a human being , among all them wild animals ? No chance at all . " I climbed on top of a high rock and there I sat all night long and thought and thought . And all night long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? For food o ' course . They fought and they ate . Simple , was n't it ? " Listen , gents , you ever been on an island in the South Pacific Ocean , all by yourself with about a million land crabs and a million rats , all fighting ? You have n't , I bet . You could n't have been . That 's why you none of you know nothing , not even you . " Here Chuff nodded toward the young policeman who stood by the stove listening . " Land crabs and rats fighting , and me on top of my rock , watching ' em all night long . " When day come the fighting stopped . The land crabs , they drew off in good order into their holes and the rats , they drew off too . I was safe , I thought , till it was dark again . I sat on that rock all day , except twice I went to a spring I 'd found and got me a drink and then quick as I could climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scorched . You ever sat on a rock on a desert island all day long with about a million rats hopping around you and every now and again all setting up on their haunches and looking you over , like ? You have n't , I het . And fighting by night ? Well , I have . And that , gents , went on for two days more  --  two days and two nights , till the third day when I was half-asleep I heard a scuffling and looked and saw , setting watching me not three feet off , on the same rock as myself , the big red rat , him what I 'd seen and talked of on board the Greenside . He was licking his chops and washing his whiskers and watching me close and close , his eyes thoughtful , like , and I knew , gents , same as he 'd told me himself , he was wondering when l 'd be ripe . " " When you 'd be what ? " said the policeman . " When I 'd be ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see , and thinking a change of diet would do him good , him and his mates . He was the biggest rat that I 'd ever seen ; and I thought then and I think so now , the fiercest and wickedest and cleverest . There was the one thing to do and the one thing only , so I done it , or tried to : it was him or me , me or him and his tens of thousands of rats ; for I knew him for what he was , the king of the rats , young as he was , because of his size and his fierceness and wickedness . I made up my mind then and there I must kill him . I was desperate . Would n't any of you have been desperate too ? You would . You could n't have helped but be desperate . What did I do ? I made a grab at that rat with both hands but he was n't there . He was setting a yard away , watching me and thinking . I shifted myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I grabbed . And what did that there rat do ? He run under my hands and over my lap , and there he was setting the other side of me , still watching me , and if I never open my mouth again it 's the truth I 'm telling ye : he showed his teeth at me and he grinned . Yes , gents , he grinned , he did , that big red rat . " After that , I knew how it was . I knew soon as it come dark , instead of fighting the land crabs and eating and being ate , that there red rat and the other rats would fight me . I sat on my rock and I shivered , and the red rat he sat on the rock too and he grinned . And when I got off the rock and went to the spring and kneeled down and drank out of my cupped hands there he was watching me , him and the other rats , and I knew I was doomed . I was doomed , gents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up his mind it was time . And why did n't I die ? Would you like me to tell ye ? " Here Chuff ceased talking and looked first at the big young policeman standing in front of the stove , and then at the man with the red mustache leaning across the counter , and then at Mr. Truscott and then at me . " Would you like me to tell you why did n't I die ? " " Well , why did n't you ? " I said . " I did n't because a couple o ' hours before sundown I seen the smoke of a steamer : and I stood on that there rock and I tore off my shirt and waved it above my head and some smart young second mate on the bridge seen me through his binoculars . " Well , they seen me and they put over a boat and rowed across to the island and then would n't come near enough for me to get to them . And why not ? Because of them rats . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off and hoping for another grain ship . It 's the truth , gents : they thought , them rats did , that that there boat had come for them the same as for me . The mate in the stern of the boat , he yells at me , ' You , what 's them rats doing ? They 'll kill us . We durs n't risk it . Get down off that there rock and swim for it . ' Which I done . I jumped down off that there rock into the rats , and the big red rat he tried to stop me and I run for the shore with him after me , him and his mates and all , and I dove into the sea and I swum to the boat , and they drug me in and all the rats was screaming , ' Do n't leave us , do n't leave us ! ' Terrible it was . They drug me into the boat and there I lay half-dead and I did n't know nothing more till I woke and found I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer bound for Java . I was sick on and off a couple of months in hospital in Batavia and then I was sent home to England , D.B.S. , the one survivor but one of the Greenside . " " You said you were the only survivor , " I said . " Not me , " said Chuff . " If I 'd been that , there would n't have been no story to tell at all . " " Get on with it , Chuff , " said the policeman . " What happened after that , or is that the end ? " " Two years passed , " said Chuff , " or three . What was it now  --  two or three ? " " In another minute , " the policeman said . " the Inspector will be coming along and I 'll be for it . Chuff , finish your story and let me go . " " I remember now , " Chuff said , " it was two years and a half after I left the island that I signed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapman 's hookers but newer than the old Greenside and not so cranky . " He broke off and looked at each of us in turn and seemed all of a sudden not so sure of himself . " Now , listen , gents , to what Pm telling ye . You 'll think I 'm crazy but I 'm speaking the truth , so ' elp me . We was on the same run almost as we 'd been on that there trip when the Green'side was lost and we steered a course that would bring us dose to the island where I 'd swum from the wreck . The old man , who 'd been shipmates with Captain Reynolds , stopped the engines and told the mate to get one of the lifeboats swung out . ' Bos'n , ' he ses , ' I 'm going on board . I want you to come along . ' I went . " Well , gents , there was n't nothing more desolate under Heaven than that poor old hulk , most of her under water , and the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , with the sun shining and the sea all smooth and calm and the sea birds flying around and crying because we 'd come and disturbed ' em . We rowed across and we went on board . I could of cried . I damn ' near did cry . I sat on the wheel-house roof , with my legs dangling , same as I 'd sat the morning the ship slid off the reef , and I was sadder than I 'd ever been in my life . Why should I be alive and the others dead ? I did n't know . " The old man come out of the Captain 's room on the lower bridge , which was level with the water about , and he ses , ' No use setting there the rest of yer life , bos'n . Come on into the boat . We 're going to have a look at yer island . ' We rowed across from the wreck and I was amazed , I was , that ever I 'd swum that distance , me and the rats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it was true . " Well then as we was pulling , the old man , he ses , kind of sharp and stern , ' Way enough ! And , ' ses he , ' what in God 's name is that ? ' We rest on our oars and we turn our heads to look . My God ! I near died o ' fright . You would n't believe what we seen . You could n't . " " Get on with it , " said Mr. Truscott . " What could n't we believe ? " " There , on the edge of the sand , " said Chuff , " was an enormous rat , a monster rat , three feet long if he was an inch , with great whiskers and teeth , and a thick red coat . setting up on his haunches and waiting . You never seen nothing like him in all your life . Why , gents , he was the size of a fox , he was : the biggest and wickedest , most terrible-looking rat you ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We just set and look at him and none of us say a word . And then I knew . I knew who he was . I knew what he 'd done . I knew what had made him grow to the size he had . And I sat and I looked at him setting there onhis haunches and I felt sick at the stomach and scared . " And then he made up his mind , the king of the rats did , what he must do , and he run to the edge of the water and one of the men , he ses , By God ! he 's going to swim out to us ! ' And he was . He was going to swim out to us and climb on board , and I du n no what else he was going to do and would have done if the old man had n't pulled out his gun and shot him dead . " After that we rowed in and got his body into the boat , as big as a fox he was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between rats and land crabs , the king of the rats and a cannibal rat and the biggest rat in the world . He 'd lived and the land crabs and the rest of the rats had died . We went all over the island and there was n't another rat left nor a land crab , nothing but bones . " " And you mean , " said Mr. Truscott , " you mean that the big red rat had eaten the other rats and the crabs too ? " " He 'd eaten every last one of ' em . He 'd have eaten me , as well , if I 'd give him the chance or the old man had n't up with his gun and shot him . We took the body on board the Greenbank , and the chief engineer , who was by way of being a taxidermist , skinned him and stuffed him . And if you do n't believe I 'm telling the truth , go to the Natural History Museum and see if he ai n't there in a glass case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grccnside Island in the South Pacific . " With that Chuff rose unsteadily to his feet , nodded gravely to each of us in turn , and made for the door . " You ai n't surprised I hate rats , are ye ? " he said . " Them rats , just now , they kind of made me come over queer . Good-night , gems . Thank ye for the coffee . " The door slammed after him .
