The gentleman all in pink who soars through the young girl 's room ( Le Spectre de la Rose ) , the fantastically white-faced can-can dancer in La Boutique Fantasque , the jolly hussy of a street dancer in Le Beau Danube , the slim bluebird and her lightly-leaping partner in Aurora 's Wedding-these favorite characters of U. S. ballet fans were once more on the stage of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House last week . They were personified by Paul Petroff , Lonide Massine , Alexandra Danilova , Tatiana Riabouchinska and David Lichine of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo , starting a six-month U. S. tour . Balletomanes were pleasantly surprised to find Massine still a member of the troupe . Successful Impresario Wassily de Basil ( whose last two U. S. tours grossed more than $1,000,000 each ) had temporarily made up his differences with his matre de ballet and choreographer ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) . But Massine will join Ren Blum 's ballet next year with a new U. S. corporation , World-Art , Inc. , backed by Julius Fleischmann and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the de Basil line-up this year is Tamara Toumanova-one of the three ballerinas who at their debuts were so publicized for their beauty and tender years . She is now in Hollywood . In her absence Sono Osato , a Japanese-American trained under Adolph Bolm , one of the company 's youngest dancers ( 17 ) , is by far its most exotic looking . As a dancer , she has not yet advanced beyond petit sujet ( ranking in ballet hierarchy above a coryphe , below a grand sujet ) . Irina Baronova , now 18 , is a brilliant and imaginative artist , still addicted to lengthening her snub nose with putty , Tatiana Riabouchinska , usually superb in pale , willowy roles , last week turned flamboyant in a ballet the troupe is doing for the first time in the U. S.-Rimsky-Korsakov 's Le Coq d'Or . As the golden cock which warned silly King Dodon whenever disaster impended ( which was often ) , Riabouchinska leaped frantically , shook dazzling tail feathers against the bizarre , glaringly-colored backgrounds of Nathalie Gontcharova . With the often repetitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coq d'Or made good colorful sense , its choreography by Michel Fokine a happy blend of pantomime , burlesque , Russian boot kicks and the classic style at which the Monte Carlo troupe excels-dancing sur les pointes ( on the toes ) . <P> This week Dancer Lichine , increasingly a disciplined , powerful artist , showed his mettle as a choreographer who may be useful to Colonel de Basil when veteran Massine departs . The troupe 's three other new ballets were all done by him , performed in London during the summer . The Gods Go ABegging , music by Handel , is an old Diaghilev work , with old scenery by Bakst . With dcor by Pierre Roy , French modernist , The Amorous Lion is based on a fable by La Fontaine which begins with this couplet : Love , love , when you invade our hearts , That moment common sense departs . Lichine patterned Francesca da Rimini after an episode in Dante , just as Tchaikovsky used Dante as the basis for the tone poem which is the ballet 's music .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
