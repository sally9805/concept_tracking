txt Two key industries , chemicals and steel , Unimproved their profits showing somewhat in July over the average of the June quarter . For some of the leading chemical companies this gain from an already relatively high rate of operations Indicates that current quarter profits may approach the record 1937 level . Steel-making rate averaged 7.3% higher In July than in the preceding three months . However , due to heavy deliveries of cut-price products , earnings did not advance proportionately . A majority of steel companies were able to push their July earnings somewhat above the level of the preceding quarter . However , due to large-scale deliveries of " cut-price " products . the profits uptrend was not nearly as sharp as the rise in the national operation rate . Ingot output last month averaged 541/2% of capacity , a 7.3% gain over the 50.79% average for the June quarter Many companies curing July shipped substantial quantities of sheet and strip , products on which orders had been taken at concessions of $6 to $8 a ton . This , of course , had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry a-ill have to contend for some months to come . Automobile manufacturers and other important consumers of sheet and strip have long-term options at cut prices . Some extend to the end of September , others to the end of this year . Trade quarters now anticipate that the current level of list prices will be generally reaffirmed for the fourth quarter , although there may be some changes in discounts and extra charge o . Chemical Industry Business of the chemical industry in July improved slightly over June with indications that the August level should hold at about the same rate . Third quarter earnings therefore ought to exceed June quarter results and several companies may come close to their record 1937 showings. - The hope of the industry that its profits in the final half will be even better than first half results seems to be working out as far as can be foreseen at the moment . The alkali industry , which has been in the doldrums profitwise for the past six months , has taken a definite turn for the better due mainly to heavy demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's third quarter , therefore , is expected to be materially better than either of the first two periods of the year . when net averaged about 15 cents a share . E. I. du Pont de Nemours in the June quarter reported a net equal to about $1.06 a share from chemical operations , the best showing the company has made since the second quarter of 1937 when $1.17 a share was earned . Seasonally du Pont 's third quarter is usually as good or better than the second so with sales volume now on the upgrade , there is a good chance that the current three months ' profits should come very close to reaching former high records . du Pont 's sharp gain in net in the June quarter was due in part to large sales of rayon , cellophane and other materials going more or leas directly to the consumer . Rayon sales in the current three months will probably be larger than in the previous three months which will further tend to swell current net . Union Carbide , which reported 60 cents a share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments of ferro-alloys to the steel industry which , although still far below capacity operations , is using increasing amounts of alloys for the newer types of stainless steel . Air Reduction 's third quarter net should be somewhat better also than the 47 cents a share reported for the June quarter Hercules Powder which , next to du Pont , made the best showing for the chemical group in the second quarter with a net of 79 cents a share against 73 cents in the first quarter , should make a further moderate gain in the current three months . Monsanto Chemical in the June quarter reported 72 cents a share , a decline from the 88 cents reported for the March three months . The decline was probably due principally to unusual expenses incurred in the development of the new plastics division and installation of equipment for making the new vinyl resin for safety glass . Monsanto 's third quarter may well show a recovery to the level of the first three months .                @ @ @ @ @
