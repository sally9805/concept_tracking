Nothing so infuriates a minister named Jones as being called " Reverend Jones . " Reverend is an adjective , not a title . If a parson is not a doctor ( D.D . or Ph.D. ) , he is , like other men , a mister. * Last week the Ministerial Association of Lansing , Mich , formally resolved that " in addressing one another , or in referring to one another in speech or in writing , we discard all titles except that of mister . " Lansing 's reverend misters hoped that their friends and the press would stop infuriating them . <P> <P> *In good usage " Reverend " is not found with only a last name after it . Incorrect : Reverend Jones . Correct : the Reverend Dr. Jones ; the Reverend J. A. Jones ; the Reverend Mr. James Aloysius Jones .
