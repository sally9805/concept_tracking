txt The Chamber of Commerce of the United States put before the Ways and Means Committee today its plan for immediate and long-range revision of the tax structure . It endorsed with two reservations the program submitted to the committee last week by Secretary Morgenthau . Ellsworth C. Alvord , vice chairman of its committee on Federal finance , presented the chamber 's recommendations , which call for a flat 15 per cent normal corporation tax with a specific credit of $2,000 on small incomes . Mr. Alvord contended that with a business increase of 5 per cent , which , he said , could be expected from its enactment , the flat 15 per cent tax would have a yield equal to the $1,005,000,000 from the pres'ent 161/4 per cent tax and the undistributed-profits tax . Plans resulting from studies by both Treasury and Congressional tax experts project 22 and 18 per cent flat levies on corporations , it is understood , but modifications of other taxes bearing on corporations are a part of these plans . The Ways and Means Committee decided tonight to restrict revision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . The committee members of both parties joined in approving a motion to this effect , Chairman Doughton said . Mr. Alvord submitted his program as the means for laying the groundwork for " maximum business activity . " The phase of the program labeled " for immediate action " was : " 1 . A flat rate normal corporation tax of 15 per cent , with a specific credit of $2,000 to reduce the applicable rate on small incomes . " 2 . Outright repeal of the 21/4 per cent undistributed profits tax . " 3 . A carryover of net business losses lor three years . " 4 . Simplification of the individual capital gain provisions , eliminating the unnecessary distinction between assets held eighteen and twenty-four months and substituting a shorter holding period . " 5 . The treatment of ' long-term ' capital gains and losses of corporations as ordinary gains and losses , thus more nearly according to corporations the treatment now accorded individuals . " 6 . An annual declaration of capital stock value , beginning with the current year . " 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Elimination of double taxation by exempting all intercorporate dividends from tax and excluding corporate dividends from individual normal tax . " 9 . Remedying a few of the existing defects in the so-called technical or administrative provisions of the present law . " The " long-range " phase of the program was : " 1 . A reasonably permanent revenue system , based upon the principles above advocated  --  that is , a system the basic principles of which are to remain in force , for example , for a period of ten years . " 2 . Simplification of the present law , which can be effected in large part by the elimination of unnecessarily complicated policies and refinements . - " 3 . The reduction of individual surtaxes to the point where they will not discourage private investment and individual initiative . " 4 . A substantial reduction in the - tax upon capital gains . " ( 5 ) An effective earned income credit . " ( 6 ) A revision and simplification of the present estate tax laws , including a Substantial reduction in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the setting aside of adequate funds ( through insurance or otherwise ) , free of estate tax , for the payment of the estate tax . " ( 8 ) The repeal of the capital stock-excess profits tax system as soon as the revenue requirements permit . " ( 9 ) Itemoval of the inequities now existing in our , excise tax system . " ( 10 ) A procedure for the collection of excise taxes corresponding to the existing procedure for the collection of income taxes . " After he had read his statement , Mr. Alvord declared that he believed personally that the reduction of individual surtaxes might well be transferred from the long-range ' th the immediate program . With regard to the two reservations to Secretary Morgenthau 's plan , Mr. Alvord said that he was not certain he understood what the Secretary meant when he cited " a more equitable distribution of national income " as one of the objectives of tax policy . The other reservation , he added , dealt with the coupling of individual surtax reductions with the taxation of future issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no reve2 nue system could be devised which would yield , without confiscatory rates , more than $6,500,000,000 a year and urged that this figure be kept constantly in mind by Congress when it is charting its appropriations . Saying that it would tend toward economies , he heartily endorsed Secretary Morgenthau 's suggestion that the taxing and appropriating committees of each house sit as one body to study income and outgo . He urged balancing of the budget , but explained that he was not condemning government spending in years of depressed business . He asserted that Secretary Morgenthau was " perfectly right " in saying ' that Federal financing should not be measured on a yearly basis only ; that deficits are to be expected in lean years and surpluses in good years . " I think the Secretary of the Treasury is to be commended ' for the manner in which he has handled the finances of the country , " Mr. Alvord went on . " He has used every trick in the bag . ' But if interest rates should go up , the prob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Taking up the points of his immediate program for discussion , Mr. Alvord- said the normal tax on corporations should not exceed 15 per cent and that there should be allowances for corporations having less than $25,000 yearly income . The $2,000 specific exemption , he added ; would reduce the effective rate to 9 per cent on incomes of $5,000 ; 12 per cent on incomes of $10,000 , and 13.8 per cent on incomes of $25,000 . There was no legitimate excuse for the undistributed profits tax , he declared , adding that it produced complexities in computation of dividend paid credits which were out of proportion to the estimated $20 , - 000,000 yearly it produced . In urging that the privilege of carrying forward net operating losses be restored to the revenue system , he said : " The selection of a single year as the taxable period is admittedly arbitrary and results in great hardship to industries and particular companies in which years of profit and loss alternate . If such companies are taxed in years of profit , without allowance for prior years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tho income actually earned over the period as a whole . As compared with businesses having a stable income from year to year , they are at a severe competitive disadvantage . " While it might be desirable to repeal the capital stock and excess profits taxes , he declared , he believed it was necessary - to retain them temporarily for revenue purposes . The most serious objection to them , he added , was that they did not impose a tax on " true excess " profits . M. S. Rukeyser , economic writer for the Hearst newspapers , advocated governmental economies . The increasing cost of government had made inroads in the average American 's budget , he declared , adding : , " It seems to me that the public is in a mood for candor . It will appreciate a frank statement that public officials are not Santa Clauses . They ca n't give things and services save at a cost . When some are taxed to provide benefits for others , ? there is a mere transfer of income ? no net , increment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that a public official would gain in stature by making it clear that he recognizes that he is spending the people 's money , and that as a result he has a high sense of trusteeship . Such an official will insist on honest and efficient administration , knowing that the taxpayers are already overburdened : He will not tolerate dissipating the public 's funds in economic waste , in graft , in unnecessary overhead , in obsolete operations and in functions that can be dispensed with readily . " The Federal Treasury is an empty purse save for what the citizens contribute in taxes . "
