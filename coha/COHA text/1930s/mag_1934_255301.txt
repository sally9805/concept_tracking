In the heyday of absolutism a favorite sport of the Great Powers was partitioning Poland . Last week RFC Chairman Jesse Jones , who is something of a Great Power in U. S. business , proposed to partition a Class I railroad with 1,600 mi. of track and $100,000,000 of assets , good &; bad . <P> Minneapolis &; St. Louis , operating west and south from Minneapolis but not to St. Louis , has been in receivership for eleven years . All its mortgage bonds are in default including $2,000,000 worth held by the U. S. Government-not acquired by Mr. Jones 's RFC but by the Treasury in connection with loans from the Wartime Director General of Railroads . <P> Back interest alone amounts to $25,000,000 . Numerous attempts have been made to reorganize the decrepit carrier , the last plan calling for RFC financing . But Jesse Jones had a " thought , " which he borrowed from President Ralph Budd of Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy . <P> To his Washington office last week Mr. Jones summoned the heads of the seven major roads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. &; St. L. be cut into seven pieces , Mr. Jones suggested , each of the connecting carriers buying one piece . RFC would , if necessary , prefer to lend them the purchase price rather than try to resuscitate M. &; St. L. itself with cash direct . The seven big lines-Great Northern , Illinois Central , Rock Island , Wabash , Milwaukee , Chicago &; North Western and Burlington-seemed to like the Jones " thought . " Adjourning to Chicago , they ordered a thorough technical investigation . RFC has a $340,000,000 stake in the U. S. railroads as a whole . <P> And the M. &; St. L. partitioning was merely one more proof that Mr. Jones is no passive investor . Because RFC money is almost invariably involved , reorganization plans must satisfy Mr. Jones as well as the courts , the Interstate Commerce Commission and the security holders . Last week Cleveland 's Oris Paxton Van Sweringen dropped in to see Mr. Jones about pulling Missouri Pacific out of the courts . In referring to plans for reorganizing Chicago &; Eastern Illinois , Mr. Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortnight ago when ICCommissioner Mahaffie flatly refused to approve RFC loans to several carriers including New York , New Haven &; Hartford and Chicago &; North Western , Mr. Jones promptly told the disappointed executives that he was going to see the " Chief " about it . The ICC received a call from the White House and two other Commissioners gave the necessary approval . When the railroadmen thanked him , Mr. Jones chuckled : " Well , we do n't want you fellows to die now anyway . We 've got to help you along until Congress meets . "
