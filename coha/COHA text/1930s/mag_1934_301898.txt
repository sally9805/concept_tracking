A Mexican Indian , a onetime cowboy and an Alabama Negro who used to be a bootblack composed the bulk of the music which Conductor Leopold Stokowski brought from Philadelphia to Manhattan one night last week . The fair-haired Stokowski was proving that his orchestra gives an occasional hearing to untried native composers . <P> The Mexican Indian was Manuel Ponce who contributed Chapultepec , a suave Frenchy picture of the cypress woods which surround the castle in Mexico City where the ill-fated Maximilian once lived . The cowboy was Harl McDonald , now a teacher at the University of Pennsylvania , who meant his Santa F Trail to describe the trek of New England pioneers across the blistering desert . The McDonald pioneers were not a hardy lot and their mood , more often than not , was touched with the Russian melancholy of Tchaikovsky . <P> William Dawson 's Negro Folk Symphony had a few exciting moments when drum beats drilled out a climax in true African fashion . But for the rest Composer Dawson appeared to have forgotten his primitive background . After his shoe-shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Booker T. Washington 's Tuskegee Institute . He studied music in Kansas City , later in Chicago where Conductor Frederick Stock chose him for his first trombonist . He returned to Tuskegee in 1930 , to head the music department , direct the choir . <P> In his Negro Symphony Composer Dawson wanted to voice the struggles of his people . He used Negro folk themes but he dressed them with such fancy orchestration that they lost their force and spontaneity . Applause was more for Dawson , the Negro who had managed to have a piece played by the proud Philadelphia Orchestra , than for a symphony which was for the most part undistinguished , a conventional copy of the white man 's ways .
