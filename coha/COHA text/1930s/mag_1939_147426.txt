John Kennedy , 21 , second son of President Roosevelt 's alert Ambassador Joe , was shot by his sire from London up to Glasgow last week to help interview survivors of the sunken S. S. Athenia . He was authorized to say that the U. S. steamer Orizaba was being sent over to fetch the Athenians home . The neutral yacht Stella Polaris was also being sought from Raymond-Whitcomb Travel Service ( world tours ) . <P> But Franklin Roosevelt had just announced his decision not to furnish U. S. naval convoys to returning refugees ( see p. 9 ) and John Kennedy was abruptly taken aback to find that this subject was passionately uppermost in his interviewers ' minds . <P> " You ca n't trust the German Navy ! You ca n't trust the German Government ! " they shouted , about 100 strong , deployed in the stuffy Beresford Hotel lounge . <P> Their feelings were understandable . Fresh in their memories was the scene when the torpedo struck : oil spurting into the air from exploded tanks ; the bodies of firemen hurtling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decks ; and later , when the lifeboats were launched , passengers and crew picking their way over bodies toward the rails , slipping on oil and filth . They had been ten or twelve hours in the boats , some of them foundering . They had waited anxiously for rescue . And , when rescue was at hand , they had seen one boat swamped and most of its occupants drowned before help could reach them , another one smashed to kindling by the propeller of a rescue ship . And so they were in no mood to take No from Mr. Kennedy 's son John . <P> " A convoy is imperative ! " barked grey-haired Survivor Thomas McCubbin of Montclair , N. J. " Ninety destroyers have just been commissioned ... six billion dollars of United States Navy , and they can not do this for us ! " <P> Son John faltered : " We are still neutral and the neutrality law still holds . " <P> But a voice snapped : " Two years ago the whole Pacific Fleet was sent out for one woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is much better to be on an American boat now than on a British boat , even if it was accompanied by the whole fleet . " <P> " I do n't believe it , " shouted a woman . <P> " That goes for us ! " chorused the rest . A college girl gave young Harvardman Kennedy the ultimatum : " We definitely refuse to go without a convoy ! " <P> Back to London went John Kennedy to tell his father . <P> Meantime , the duty of Sire Kennedy and of U. S. Minister John Cudahy at Dublin was to determine and report just how the Athenia was sunk . Unshakable , unanimous belief of all hands was that a torpedo struck her just abaft amidships on the port side . Then , said Mr. Cudahy , she " was struck again , wrecking the engine room , by a projectile projected through the air . " Mr. Kennedy 's report said : " No witness heard a shell in the air ; no witness heard a shell strike the ship ... no splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one quartermaster ) : " The submarine conning tower unmarked broke surface about 800 yards on the port quarter . ... A gun or explosive signal was fired . . . . The smoke from this discharge blew down over the Athenia and a distinct smell of cordite was recognized . "
