BURNING CITY-Stephen Vincent Bent - Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2 ) . <P> In the hierarchy of contemporary U. S. poets , Stephen Vincent Bent stands somewhat ambiguously as a comparatively young ( 37 ) singer whose heavily emotional approach to national concerns is slightly preWar , like his verse forms . A singularly unpredictable performer , he has been able to turn from so broad a project as his John Brown 's Body to slapdash popular verses in the worst tradition of James Whitcomb Riley . In Burning City the contradictory aspects of his talent are laid out as if for analysis and dissection . <P> Most flattering example from the present collection deals with the four seasons of New York , Notes to Be Left in a Cornerstone . To the questioning spirit of the future the poet says that maps , photographs and statistics can not describe the " different beast " of New York , the city that awakened in the autumn , when " the shops were slices of honeycomb full of honey " and when " the boys came from far places with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of bad colds , of policemen with faces like blue meat , of " overcoatless men ; " the brief spring , the hot summers when the poor lay out on fire-escapes " and the child cried thinly and endlessly . " But Poet Bent admits he can not explain the city or its society to future cornerstone riflers , and to serious readers his apostrophe may sound a little hollow : <P> Sea-haunted , river emblemed , o the gray <P> Water at ends of streets and the boats hooting ! <P> The unbelievable , new , bright , girl moon ! <P> In his Ode to Walt Whitman , Poet Bent experiences further difficulty explaining the present to the questioning spirit from the past . When Whitman asks , " Is it well with these States ? " the poet 's troubled answer is : <P> They burn the grain in the furnace while men go hungry . <P> cists enters the novel . Mary 's husband , turning from a conservative to a radical under the pressure of economic distress , gets into a dispute over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the tithe-collector from taking away his stock . Shots are fired , mysterious figures slink through the fog , the fascists camp on the farm to protect it from the police . During this imbroglio , Mary 's high-minded lover is pushed off a wagon by a policeman . This dislodges two pieces of shrapnel left in his brain since the War , with the result that he goes blind . Mary thereupon regrets her previous highmindedness , offers herself to her lover , but his regard for her husband has deepened with his loss of sight , and it is his turn to do the rejecting . Mary , who expected nothing in the first place , does not seem particularly disappointed .
