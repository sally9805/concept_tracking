Through narrow streets of Riga one day last fortnight rushed excited Latvians to see what was going on at the old Cathedral of St. Mary . There a man half stood , half dangled , his left hand spiked to the Cathedral 's heavy oak door . Brandishing a hammer in his free hand , the man was shouting : " I want to save the world from a new world war by this crucifixion ! " Police pried the nail out with the hammer , took the man to a hospital . <P> No U. S. peace lover attempted public auto-crucifixion last week , but in Manhattan the biggest , most active anti-war machine of its kind , the Emergency Peace Campaign , received from abroad its livest spark plug . Now almost a year old ( TIME , March 16 et seq. ) , the E. P. C. announced that during January and February some 300 speakers , laymen and clergymen will talk for peace in 1,000 U. S. cities . At their head will be a lame British spinster of 60 whom many a religionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Dr. A. ( for Agnes ) Maude Royden .

Possessor of an intellect vastly superior to any Aimee Semple McPherson ( see below ) , Preacher Royden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and herself in berets , trim dark gowns . Plain , somewhat masculine in manner , far from robust since she was born with both hips dislocated , Dr. Royden worked hard putting her intensely personal messages across , retired completely exhausted after every sermon . <P> Maude Royden gave up her Guildhouse pulpit for good last month , planning to devote all her time in future to preaching Peace . She is no stranger to the U. S. Upon her second arrival , in 1927 , many a non-religious person went to hear her talk largely because bluenoses had cackled that she smokes an occasional cigaret . Last week ship newshawks did not bother to ask her about smoking . Said she :
