Promptly after his election last March Pope Pius XII tossed a lifeline to a sinking friend , once-honored General Umberto Nobile . Mussolini had busted Airman Nobile out of the service when his 1928 Polar expedition ended with the crack-up of the dirigible Italia which killed eight crew members , ended Italy 's lighter-than-aircraft dreams . In his small flat near the Tiber , where few friends dared visit him , Umberto Nobile silently endured the usual fate of Fascism 's failures-ostracism . Only honor left was his membership in the Pontifical Academy of Science , conferred by the late Pius XL <P> Not long ago Pius XI 's thoughtful successor appealed to George William Cardinal Mundelein , asked him to find good Catholic , bad Fascist Nobile a U. S. job . Few weeks later Cardinal Mundelein found one barely twelve miles southwest of his own Chicago Archdiocese . The job : head of the aeronautical engineering department of Lewis Holy Name School of Aeronautics near Lockport , Ill . Last week , lonely , greying , but still vigorous at 54 , Umberto Nobile boarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the appointment and the appointee is the institution to which he is going . It is the only Roman Catholic aviation school in the U. S. It is also free . Proud setting hawk of unique Lewis Holy Name is Founder Bishop Bernard James Sheil of Chicago , who nursed it from a fledgling ( in 1932 ) in one hangar , one building and a cow pasture to lusty , soaring adolescence . A pious local farmer donated 620 flat acres ; rich Chicago Manufacturer Frank J. Lewis financed 14 roomy buildings ( the gymnasium is a memorial to son Joseph , killed in a plane crash ) . By this year 's end , air-minded Bishop Sheil expects to have three more big runways , a 180-acre improved landing field , an approved CAA flying school rating and an Illinois State license to confer Bachelor of Science degrees on his first graduating class in 1940 . Current expense money comes partly from Holy Name 's own farm produce , partly from the coffers of the Catholic Youth Organization ( also founded by Bishop Sheil ) . <P> Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 35 get in* ( present student body numbers 93 ) . The curriculum includes technical high school and scientific college courses of four years each . High school students study conventional courses with emphasis on mechanics , little or no aeronautics . <P> For the advanced college courses , high-school graduates must take stiff competitive examinations ( about 20% , pass ) . On these picked few , Holy Name 's faculty ( non-Catholic Superintendent John Wilson , seven lay instructors , one Viatorian brother , one Carmelite priest ) lavish care not to be found in many U. S. scientific colleges or U. S. aviation schools . Although they get 250 hours ' solo , the students are prepared for careers in aeronautical engineering rather than commercial flying . <P> Tickled pink with his four juniors is Superintendent Wilson . To an aviation tycoon who tried to lure students away with lucrative jobs , Superintendent Wilson boasted : " It ca n't be done .
