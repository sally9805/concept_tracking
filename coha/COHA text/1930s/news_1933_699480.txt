txt The battle over Senate patronage is at an end . The finish of warfare over page boys ' and doorkeepers ' jobs in the Senate came this evening when Senate Leader Dunnigan certified to the State Controller a list of eighteen new appointees . The fight has been in-progress for a month and more and has retarded the work of the Senate . Eighteen occupants of the jobs , mostly political retainers of the O'Connell brothers , bosses of the Albany County Democratic organization , or Joseph J. Murphy , the Democratic leader in the adjacent coun , ty of Rensselaer , were ousted to make room for Senator Dunnigan 's appointees . All of these came from a list approved by James A. Farley , Democratic State Chairman and chairman of the Democratic National Committee . Tonight two- $3-a-day page boys are all that remain of the list of condemned jobholders . They owe their retention solely to the tender heart of the new Senate leader , who said tonight he could not muster the courage to let the two youngsters out , they seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , made the rounds of the Capitol corridors tonight . Cynical persons suggested that Leader Murphy of Troy had swapped the two places for an assigtant postmastership . Approved at Conference Here . Senator Dunnigan said tonight that all of the appointments made by him had been approved at a conference of Democratic leaders in New York City last December . Tammany Leader John F. Curry was there , so was John H. McCooey , the Democratic leader of Kings ; Edward J. Flynn , the Democratic leader of the Bronx , and Lieut . Gov . M. William Bray . Chairman Farley did not attend , . but , according to Senator Dunnigan , it was agreed that twenty places out of about 150 in the Senate organization were to go to appointees recommended by Mr. Farley . After Patrick H. O'Connell , one and perhaps the least political of the O'Connell brothers , had been elected Senate clerk in accordance with agreements reached at the conference , the O'Connells were in position to override this arrangement . On the pretext that Chairman Farley had taken a stand against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Capitol going to any county organizations except those that had supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Presidential nomination , they proceeded to retaliate by having Senate Clerk O'Connell , who under the legislative law , held the power of appointment , put in the positions allotted to Chairman Farley a group approved by the Albany County organization or by the party organization in Rensselaer . Republicans Decided Issue . It was only with the active aid of the Republicans in the Senate and Assembly that Senate Leader Dunnigan had the power of appointmei. - shifted to himself through an amendment of the legislative law which was approved by Governor Lehman yesterday . The Senate leader in pressing for this legislation did not follow his personal inclination but acted under instructions from his leader , Secretary of State Edward J. Flynn , who is in the Farley corner . Whether there will be repercussions in the Senate , where the O'Connells and Leader Murphy have it within their power to turn the Democratic majority of one into a minority , remains to be seen . The O'Connells have their Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was apparent that he was stirred up over the loss of Senate patronage , which in his case included two of the best positions of the batch , a financial clerkship and an assistant postmastership , each paying $1,500 for the session . His man in the financial clerkship , Walter B. Johnson , is Democratic leader of the city of Rensselaer and a war veteran , and his assistant postmaster , Thomas Foley , Democratic leader in the Eighth Ward of Troy . The former was replaced by an appointee from Rochester , the latter by a man from Rockland County , former political habitat of Chairman Farley . In all twelve positions were lost by the Albany organization and two by Troy . The others had been held by appointees from districts in the up-State group allied with Tammany in support of Alfred E. Smith for the Presidential nomination-at the time of the Democratic National Convention . The highest salary in any of the positions involved in the upset is $2,000 . There are two or three which pay $1,500 . Most of the places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $10.
