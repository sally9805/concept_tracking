The marketwas all lit up by flares , all kinds of shiny brightcolored stuff was for sale at booths . At a corner an old Indian and an old broadfaced woman , both of them blind and heavily pockmarked , were singing a shrill endless song in the middle of a dense group of short thickset country people , the women with black shawls over their heads , the men in white cotton suits like pajamas .

" The smoky hall and the platform were filled with swarthy men in blue denim workclothes ; in the back were a few peons in white . Many hands shook Mac 's , black eyes looked sharp into his , several men hugged him . He was given a campchair in the front row on the platform . Evidently Ricardo Perez was chairman .

The speech went big when Perez translated it and Mac felt pretty good . Then the meeting went on and on , more and more speeches and occasional songs . Mac found himselfnodding several times . The sound of the strange language made him sleepy . He barely managed to keep awake until a small band inP 101the open door of the hall broke into a tune and everybody sang and the meeting broke up .

They sat down at the end of a long table with a spotted cloth on it . The table graduallyfilled with people from the meeting , mostly young men in blue workclothes , with thin sharp faces . At the other end sat an old dark man with the big nose and broad flat cheekbones of an Indian . Perez poured Mac out two glasses of a funnytasting white drink that made his head spin . The food was very hot with pepper and chile and he choked on it a little bit . The Mexicans petted Mac like a child at his birthday party . He had to drink many glasses of beer and cognac .

Mac was carried along in a peppery haze . He sang and drank and ate and everythingbegan to lose outline . " Fellowworker marry nice girl , " said Pablo . They were standing at a bar somewhere . He made a gesture of sleeping with his two hands against his face . " Come . " They went to a dancehall .

He patted her on the cheek . They drank some beer at the bar and left . Pablo had a girl with him too . The others stayed on at the dancehall . Pablo and his girl walked round to Encarnacion 's house with them . It was a room in a little courtyard . Beyond it was a great expanse of lightcolored desert land stretching as far as you could see under a waning moon . In the distance were some tiny specks of fires . Pablo pointed at them with his full hand and whispered , " Revolucion .

Sunday afternoons Janey and Joe and Ellen and Francie had to sit in the front room and look at pictures or read books . Janey and Joe read the funnypaper together because they were the oldest and the other two were just babies and not old enough to know what was funny anyway . They could n't laugh outloud because Popper sat with the rest of The Sunday Star on his lap and usually went to sleep after dinner with the editorial section crumpled in one big blueveined hand . Tiny curds of sunlight flickering through the lace insets in the window shade would lie on his bald head and on one big red flange of his nose and on the droop of one mustache and on his speckled sundayvest and on the white starched shirtsleeves with shiny cuffs , held up above the elbow by a rubber band . Janey and Joe would sit on the same chair feeling each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting off a cannon-cracker under the captain 's stool . The little ones would see them laughing and start laughing too , " Shut up , ca n't you , " Joe would hiss at them out of the corner of his mouth . " You do n't know what we 're laughing at ? ' Once in a while , if there was no sound from Mommer who was taking her Sunday afternoon nap upstairs stretched out in the back bedroom in a faded lilac sack with frills on it , after they 'd listened for a long time to the drawnout snort that ended in a little hiss of Popper 's snores , Joe would slip off his chair and Janey would follow him without breathing into the front hall and out the front door . Once they'dp107closed it very carefully so that the knocker would n't bang , Joe would give her a slap , yell " You 're it " and run off down the hill towards M Street , and she 'd have to run after him , her heart pounding , her hands cold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brick sidewalks were icy and there were colored women out spreading cinders outside their doors when the children went to school mornings . Joe never would walk with the rest of them because they were girls , he lagged behind or ran ahead . Janey wished she could walk with him but she could n't leave her little sisters who held tight onto her hands . One winter they got in the habit of walking up the hill with a little yaller girl who lived directly across the street and whose name was Pearl . Afternoons Janey and Pearl walked home together . Pearl usually had a couple of pennies to buy bullseyes or candy bananas with at a little store on Wisconsin Avenue , and she always gave Janey half so Janey was very fond of her . One afternoon she asked Pearl to come in and they played dolls together under the big rose of sharon bush in the back yard . When Pearl had gone Mommer 's voice called from the kitchen . Mommer had her sleeves rolled up on her faded pale arms and a checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands were covered with flour . " Janey , come here , " she said . Janey knew from the cold quaver in her voice that something was wrong . " Yes , Mommer . " Janey stood in front of her mother shaking her head about so that the two stiff sandy pigtails lashed from side to side . " Stand still , child , for gracious sake . . . Jane , I want to talk to you about something . That little colored girl you brought in this afternoon . . . " Janey 's heart was dropping . She had a sick feeling and felt herself blushing , she hardly knew why . " Now , do n't misunderstand me ; I like and respect the colored people ; some of them are fine selfrespectingpeople in their place . . . But you must n't bring that little colored girl in the house again . Treating colored people kindly and with respect is one of the signs of good breeding . . . You must n't forgetthat your mother 's people were wellborn every inch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . We lived in a big house with most lovely lawns . . . but you must never associate with colored people on an equal basis . Living in this neighborhood it 's all the more important to be careful about those things ... Neither the whites nor the blacks respect those who do ... That 's all , Janey , you understand ; now run out and play , it 'll soon be time for your supper . " Janey triedp108to speak but she could n't . She stood stiff in the middle of the yard on the grating that covered the drainpipe , staring at the back fence . " Niggerlover , " yelled Joe in her ear . " Niggerlover ump-mya-mya .. . Niggerlover niggerlover ump-mya-mya . " Janey began to cry . Joe was an untalkative sandyhaired boy who could pitch a mean outcurve when he was still little . He learned to swim and dive in Rock Creek and used to say he wanted to be motorman on a streetcar when he grew up . For several years his best friend was Alec McPherson whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that Joe wanted to be a locomotive engineer . Janey used to tag around afterthe two boys whenever they 'd let her , to the carbarns at the head of Pennsylvania Avenue where they made friends with some of the conductorsand motormen who used to let them ride on the platform a couple of blocks sometimes if there was n't any inspector around , down along the canal or up Rock Creek where they caught tadpoles and fell in the water and splashed each other with mud . Summer evenings when the twilight was long after supper they played lions and tigers with other kids from the neighborhood in the long grass of some empty lots near Oak Hill Cemetery . There were long periods when there was measles or scarlet fever around and Mommer would n't let them out . Then Alec would come down and they 'd play three-o-cat in the back yard . Those were the times Janey liked best . Then the boys treated her as one of them . Summer dusk would come down on them sultry and full of lightningbugs . If Popperwas feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill to the drugstore on N Street to buy icecream , there 'd be young men in their shirtsleeves and straw hats strolling with girls who wore a stick of punk in their hair to keep off the mosquitoes , a rankness and a smell of cheap perfume from the colored families crowded on their doorsteps , laughing , talking softly with an occasional flash of teeth , rolling of a white eyeball . The dense sweaty night was scary , hummed , rumbledwith distant thunder , with junebugs , with the clatter of traffic from M Street , the air of the street dense and breathless under the thick trees ; but when she was with Alec and Joe she was n't scared , not even of drunks or big shamblefooted colored-men . When they got back Popper would smoke a cigar and they 'd sit out in the back yard and the mosquitoes ' ud eat them up and Mommer and Aunt Francine and the kids ' ud eat the icecream and Popper would just smoke a cigar and tell them stories of when he 'd been a towboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd saved the barkentine Nancy Q in distress on the Kettlebottoms in a sou'west gale . Then it 'd get time to go to bed and Alec ' ud be sent home and Janey 'd have to go to bed in the stuffy little back room on the top floor with her two little sisters in their cribs against the opposite wall . Maybe a thunderstorm would come up and she 'd lie awake staring up at the ceiling cold with fright , listening to her little sisters whimper as they slept until she heard the reassuring sound of Mommer scurrying about the house closing windows , the slam of a door , the whine of wind and rattle of rain and the thunder rolling terribly loud and near overhead like a thousand beer-trucks roaring over the bridge . Times like that she thought of going down to Joe 's room and crawling into bed with him , but for some reason she was afraid to , though sometimes she got as far as the landing . He 'd laugh at her and call her a softie . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home from the Patent Office where he worked , angry and out of sorts , and the girls would be scared of him and go about the house quiet as mice ; but Joe seemed to like to provoke him , he 'd run whistlingthrough the back hall or clatter up and down stairs making a tremendousracket with his stub-toed ironplated shoes . Then Popper would start scolding him and Joe would stand in front of him without saying a word glaring at the floor with bitter blue eyes . Janey 's insidesknotted up and froze when Popper would start up the stairs to the bathroom pushing Joe in front of him . She knew what would happen . He 'd take down the razorstrop from behind the door and put the boy 's head and shoulders under his arm and beat him . Joe would clench his teeth and flush and not say a word and when Popper was tired of beating him they 'd look at each other and Joe would be sent up to his room and Popper would come down stairs trembling all over and pretend nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard with her fists clenched whispering to herself , " I hate him ... I hate him . . . I hate him . " Once a drizzly Saturday night she stood against the fence in the dark looking up at the lighted window . She could hear Popper 's voice and Joe 's in an argument . She thought maybe she 'd fall down dead at the first thwack of the razorstrop . She could n't hear what they were saying . Then suddenly it came , the leather sound of blows and Joe stifling a gasp . She was eleven years old . Something broke loose . P 110She rushed into the kitchen with her hair all wet from the rain , " Mommer , he 's killing Joe . Stop it . " Her mother turned up a withered helpless drooping face from a pan she was scouring . " Oh , you ca n't do anything . " Janey ran upstairs and started beating on the bathroom door . " Stop it , stop it ; " her voice kept yelling . She was scared but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened ; there was Joe looking sheepish and Popper with his face all flushed and the razorstrop in his hand . " Beat me . . . it 's me that 's bad . . . I wo n't have you beating Joe like that . " She was scared . She did n't know what to do , tears stung in her eyes . Popper 's voice was unexpectedly kind : " You go straight up to bed without any supper and remember that you have enough to do to fight your own battles , Janey . " She ran up to her room and lay on the bed shaking . When she 'd gone to sleep Joe 's voice woke her up with a start . He was standing in his nightgown in the door . " Say , Janey , " he whispered . " Do n't you do that again , see . I can take care of myself , see . A girl ca n't butt in between men like that . When I get a job and make enough dough I 'll get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll shoot him dead . " Janey began to sniffle . " What you wan na cry for ; this ai n't no Johnstown flood . " She could hear him tiptoe down the stairs again in his bare feet . At highschool she took the commercial course and learned stenographyand typewriting . She was a plain thinfaced sandyhaired girl , quiet and popular with the teachers . Her fingers were quick and she picked up typing and shorthand easily . She liked to read and used to get books like The Inside of the Cup , The Battle of the Strong , The Winning of Barbara Worth out of the library . Her mother kept telling her that she 'd spoil her eyes if she read so much . When she read she used to imagine she was the heroine , that the weak brother who went to the bad but was a gentleman at core and capable of every sacrifice , like Sidney Carton in A Tale of Two Cities , was Joe and that the hero was Alec . She thought Alec was the bestlooking boy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a very white skin with a few freckles and a strong squareshouldered way of walking . After him Joe was the bestlooking and the strongest and the best baseball player anyway . Everybody said he ought to go on through highschoolP111on account of being such a good baseball player , but at the end of his first year Popper said he had three girls to support and that Joe would have to get to work ; so he got a job as a Western Union messenger . Janey was pretty proud of him in his uniform until the girls at highschool kidded her about it . Alec 's folks had promised to put him through college if he made good in highschool , so Alec worked hard . He was n't tough and dirty-talking like most of the boys Joe knew . He was always nice to Janey though he never seemed to want to be left alone with her . She pretty well admitted to herself that she had a terriblecrush on Alec . The best day of her life was the sweltering summer Sunday they all went canoeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch the night before . In the morning she added a steak she found in the icebox . There was blue haze at the end of every street of brick houses and dark summergreen trees when before anybody else was awake she and Joe crept out of the house round seven that morning . They met Alec at the corner in front of the depot . He stood waiting for them with his feet wide apart and a skillet in his hand . They all ran and caught the car that was just leaving for Cabin John 's Bridge . They had the car all to themselves like it was a private car . The car hummed over the rails past whitewashed shanties and nigger cabins along the canal , skirting hillsides where the sixfoot tall waving corn marched in ranks like soldiers . The sunlight glanced in bluewhite glare on the wavingdrooping leaves of the tassling corn ; glare , and a whirring and tinkling of grasshoppers and dryflies rose in hot smoke into the pale sky round the clattering shaking electric car . They ate sweet summerapples Joe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other round the car and flopped down on top of each other in the cornerseats ; and they laughed and giggled till they were weak . Then the car was running through woods ; they could see the trestlework of the rollercoasters of Glen Echo through the trees and they piled off the car at Cabin John 's having more fun than a barrel of monkeys . They ran down to the bridge to look up and down the river brown and dark in the white glary morning between foliage-sodden banks ; then they found the canoe that belonged to a friend of Alec 's in a house by the canal , bought some cream soda and rootbeer and some packages of neccos and started out . Alec and Joe paddled and Janey sat in the bottom with her sweater rolled round a thwart for a pillow . P 112Alec was paddling in the bow . It was sweltering hot . The sweat made the shirt cling to the hollow of his chunky back that curved with everystroke of the paddle . After a while the boys stripped to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janey 's throat tremble to watch Alec 's back and the bulging muscles of his arm as he paddled , made her feel happy and scared . She sat there in her white dimity dress , trailing her hand in the weedy browngreen water . They stopped to pick waterlilies and the white flowers of arrowhead that glistened like ice and everything smelt wet rank of the muddy roots of waterlilies . The cream soda got warm and they drank it that way and kidded each other back and forth and Alec caught a crab and covered Janey 's dress with greenslimy splashes and Janey did n't care a bit and they called Joe skipper and he loosened up and said he was going to join the navy and Alec said he 'd be a civil engineer and build a motorboatand take them all cruising and Janey was happy because they includedher when they talked just like she was a boy too . At a place belowthe Falls where there were locks in the canal they had a long portage down to the river . Janey carried the grub and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cussed under the canoe . Then they paddled across to the Virginia side and made a fire in a littlehollow among gray rusty bowlders . Joe cooked the steak and Janey unpacked the sandwiches and cookies she 'd made and nursed some murphies baking in the ashes . They roasted ears of corn too that they had swiped out of a field beside the canal . Everything turned out fine except that they had n't brought enough butter . Afterwards they sat eating cookies and drinking rootbeer quietly talking round the embers . Alec and Joe brought out pipes and she felt pretty good sitting there at the Great Falls of the Potomac with two men smoking pipes . " Geewhiz , Janey , Joe cooked that steak fine . " " When we was kids we used to ketch frogs and broil ' em up in Rock Creek . . . Remember , Alec ? " " Damned if I do n't , and Janey she was along once ; geewhiz , the fuss you kicked up then , Janey . " " I do n't like seeing you skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters then . We had packs of fun then . " " I like this better , Alec , " said Janey hesitatingly . " So do I . . . " said Alec . " Dod gast it , I wisht we had a watermelon. "  | " Maybe we 'll see some along the riverbank somewhere goin ' home . " " Jiminy crickets , what I could n't do to a watermelon , Joe . " " Mommer had a watermelon on ice , " said Janey ; " maybe there 'll be some yet when we get home . " " I do n't never want to go home , " said Joe , suddenly bitter serious . " Joe , you ought n't to talk like that . " She felt girlish and frightened . " I 'll talk how I goddam please ... Kerist , I hate the scrimpy dump . " " Joe , you ought n't to talk like that . " Janey felt she was going to cry . " Dod gast it , " said Alec . " It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ? We 'll take one more dip and then make tracks for home . " When the boys were through swimming they all went up to look at the Falls and then they started off . They went along fast in the swift stream under the steep treehung bank . The afternoon was very sultry , they went through layers of hot steamy air . Big cloudheads were pilingup in the north . It was n't fun any more for Janey . She was afraid it was going to rain . Inside she felt sick and drained out . She was afraid her period was coming on . She 'd only had the curse a few times yet and the thought of it scared her and took all the strength out of her , made her want to crawl away out of sight like an old sick mangy cat . She did n't want Joe and Alec to notice how she felt . She thought how would it be if she turned the canoe over . The boys could swim ashore all right , and she 'd drown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody 'd cry and feel so sorry about it . Purplegray murk rose steadily and drowned the white summits of the cloudheads . Everything got to be livid white and purple . The boys paddled as hard as they could . They could hear the advancing rumble of thunder . The bridge was well in sight when the wind hit them , a hot stormwind full of dust and dead leaves and bits of chaff and straw , churning the riverwater . They made the shore just in time . " Dod gast it , this is goin ' to be some storm , " said Alec ; " Janey , get under the boat . " They turned the canoe over on the pebbly shore in the lee of a big bowlder and huddledup under it . Janey sat in the middle with the waterlilies they had picked that morning all shriveled and clammy from the heat in her hand . The boys lay in their damp bathingsuits on either side of her . Alec 's towsled black hair was against her cheek . The other side of her Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lean brown feetp114and legs in their rolledup pants tucked under her dress . The smell of sweat and riverwater and the warm boysmell of Alec 's hair and shouldersmade her dizzy . When the rain came drumming on the bottom of the canoe curtaining them in with lashing white spray , she slipped her arm round Alec 's neck and let her hand rest timidly on his bare shoulder . He did n't move . The rain passed after a while . " Gee , that was n't as bad as I thought it would be , " said Alec . They were pretty wet and chilly but they felt good in the fresh rainwashed air . They put the canoe back in the waterand went on down as far as the bridge . Then they carried it back to the house they 'd gotten it from , and went to the little shelter to wait for the electric car . They were tired and sunburned and sticky . The car was packed with a damp Sunday afternoon crowd , picnickers caught by the shower at Great Falls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till she got home . Her belly was all knotted up with a cramp . When they got to Georgetown the boys still had fifty cents between them and wanted to go to a movie , but Janey ran off and left them . Her only thought was to get to bed so that she could put her face into the pillow and cry . After that Janey never cried much ; things upset her but she got a cold hard feeling all over instead . Highschool went by fast , with hot thunderstormy Washington summers in between terms , punctuated by an occasional picnic at Marshall Hall or a party at some house in the neighborhood . Joe got a job at the Adams Express . She did n't see him much as he did n't eat home any more . Alec had bought a motorcycleand although he was still in highschool Janey heard little about him . Sometimes she sat up to get a word with Joe when he came home at night . He smelt of tobacco and liquor though he never seemed to be drunk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the evenings he went out with the bunch hanging round poolroomson 4/ Street or playing craps or bowling . Sundays he played baseball in Maryland . Janey would sit up for him , but when he came she 'd ask him how things were going where he worked and he 'd say " Fine " and he 'd ask her how things were going at school and she 'd say " Fine " and then they 'd both go off to bed . Once in a while she 'd ask if he 'd seen Alec and he 'd say " Yes " with a scrap of a smile and she 'd ask how Alec was and he 'd say " Fine . " She had one friend , Alice Dick , a dark stubby girl with glasses who took all the same classes with her at highschool . Saturday afternoonsp115they 'd dress up in their best and go window-shopping down F Street way . They 'd buy a few little things , stop in for a soda and come home on the streetcar feeling they 'd had a busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a matinee at Poli 's and Janey would take Alice Dick home to supper . Alice Dick liked the Williamses and they liked her . She said it made her feel freer to spend a few hours with broadmindedpeople . Her own folks were Southern Methodists and very narrow . Her father was a clerk in the Government Printing Office and was in daily dread that his job would come under the civil serviceregulations . He was a stout shortwinded man , fond of playing practical jokes on his wife and daughter , and suffered from chronic dyspepsia . Alice Dick and Janey planned that as soon as they got through highschool they 'd get jobs and leave home . They even picked out the house where they 'd board , a greenstone house near Thomas Circle , run by a Mrs. Jenks , widow of a naval officer , who was very refined and had southern cooking and charged moderately for tableboard . One Sunday night during the spring of her last term in highschool Janey was in her room getting undressed . Francie and Ellen were still playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open window with a spicy waft of lilacs from the lilacbushes in the next yard . She had just let down her hair and was looking in the mirror imagininghow she 'd look if she was a peach and had auburn hair , when there was a knock at the door and Joe 's voice outside . There was something funny about his voice . " Come in , " she called . " I 'm just fixin ' my hair . " She first saw his face in the mirror . It was very white and the skin was drawn back tight over the cheekbones and round the mouth . " Why , what 's the matter , Joe ? " She jumped up and faced him . " It 's like this , Janet ' , " said Joe , drawling his words out painfully . " Alec was killed . He smashed up on his motorbike . I just come from the hospital . He 's dead , all right ? ' Janey seemed to be writing the words on a white pad in her mind . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from Chevy Chase . . . He 'd gone out to the ballgame to see me pitch . You oughter seen him all smashed to hell . " Janey kept trying to say something . " He was your best ... "  | " He was the best guy I 'll ever know , " Joe went on gently . " Well , that 's that , Janey . . . But I wanted to tell you I do n't want to hang round this lousy dump now that Alec 's gone . I 'm goin ' to enlist in the navy . Y o u tell the folks , see ... I do n't wan na talk to ' em . That 's it ; I 'll join the navy and see the world . " " But , Joe ... " " I 'll write you , Janey ; honest , I will . . . I 'll write you a hell of a lot . You an ' me . . . Well , goodby , Janey . " He grabbed her by the shoulders and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do was whisper . " Do be careful , Joe , " and stand there in front of the bureau in the gust of lilacs and the yelling of the kids that came through the open window . She heard Joe 's steps light quick down the stairs and heard the frontdoor shut . She turned out the light , took off her clothes in the dark , and got into bed . She lay there without crying . Graduation came and commencement and she and Alice went out to parties and even once with a big crowd on one of the moonlighttrips down the river to Indian Head on the steamboat Charles McAlister . The crowd was rougher than Janey and Alice liked . Some of the boys were drinking a good deal and there were couples kissing and hugging in every shadow ; still the moonlight was beautiful ripplingon the river and she and Janey put two chairs together and talked . There was a band and dancing , but they did n't dance on account of the rough men who stood round the dancefloor making remarks . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janey , talking very low and standing by the rail very close to Alice , told her about Alec . Alice had read about it in the paper but had n't dreamed that Janey had known him so well or felt that way about him . She began to cry and Janey felt very strong comforting her and they felt that they 'd be very close friends after that . Janey whispered that she 'd never be able to love anybody else and Alice said she did n't think she could ever love a man anyway , they all drank and smoked and talked dirty among themselves and had only one idea . In July Alice and Janey got jobs in the office of Mrs. Robinson , public stenographer in the Riggs Building , to replace girls away on their vacations . Mrs. Robinson was a small grayhaired pigeonbreasted woman with a Kentucky shriek in her voice , that made Janey think of a parrot 's . She was very precise and all the proprieties were observed in her office . " Miss Williams , " she would chirp , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Roberts 's has absolutely got to be finished today . . .

Noblesse oblige , my dear , " and the typewriters would trill and jingle and all the girls ' fingers would go like mad typingbriefs , manuscripts of undelivered speeches by lobbyists , occasionaloverflow from a newspaperman or a scientist , or prospectuses from realestate offices or patent promoters , dunning letters for dentistsand doctors . The Camera Eye ( 14 ) Sunday nights when we had fishballs and baked beans and Mr. Garfield read to us in a very beautiful reading voice and everybody was so quiet you could have heard a pin drop because he was reading The Man Without a Country and it was a very terrible story and Aaron Burr had been a very dangerous man and this poor young man had said " Damn the United States ; I never hope to hear her name again " and it was a very terrible thing to say and the grayhaired judge was so kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away to foreignlands on a frigate and the officers were kind and good and spoke in kind grave very sorry reading voices like Mr. Garfield and everything was very kind and grave and very sorry and frigates and the blue Mediterranean and islands and when I was dead I began to cry and I was afraid the other boys would see I had tears in my eyesAmerican should n't cry he should look kind and grave and very sorry when they wrapped me in the stars and stripes and brought me home on a frigate to be buried I was so sorry I never remembered whether they brought me home or buried me at sea but anyway I was wrapped in Old GloryP118the government of the United States must insist and demand that American citizens who may be taken prisoner whether by one party or the other as participants in the present insurrectionary disturbancesshall be dealt with in accordance with the broad principles of international lawSOLDIERS GUARD CONVENTIONthe Titanic left Southampton on April loth on its maiden operationis to be performed against the wishes of the New York Life according to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm George to everyone even mother and sister when we meet on the streetsI 'm going to Maxim'sWhere fun and frolic beams With all the girls I 'll chatter I 'll laugh and kiss and flatter Lolo , Dodo , Joujou .

The sea was as calm as a pond , just a gentle heave as the boat dipped up and down in the swell , an ideal night except for the bitterp119cold . In the distance the Titanic looked an enormous length , its great hulk outlined in black against the starry sky , every porthole and saloonblazing with lightASK METHODISM TO OUST TRINITYthe bride 's gown is of charmeuse satin with a chiffon veiled lace waist .

Meanwhile the machinery rattled through the vessel with a rattle and a groaning that could be heard for miles . Then with a quiet slanting diveJanet ' " But it 's so interesting , mommer , " Janey would say when her mother bewailed the fact that she had to work . " In my day it was n't considered ladylike , it was thought to be demeaning . " " But it is n't now , " Janey would say getting into a temper . Then it would be a great relief to get out of the stuffy house and the stuffy treeshaded streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down town to the moving pictures and to see the pictures of foreign countries , and the crowds on F Street and to stop in at a drugstore for a soda afterwards , before getting on the Georgetown car , and to sit up at the fountain talking about the picture they 'd seen and Olive Thomas and Charley Chaplin and John Bunny . She began to read the paper every day and to take an interest in politics . She began to feel that there was a great throbbing arclighted world somewhere outside and that only living in Georgetown where everything was so poky and oldfashioned , andP 120Mommer and Popper were so poky and oldfashioned , kept her from breaking into it . Postcards from Joe made her feel like that too . He was a sailor on the battleship Connecticut . There 'd be a picture of the waterfront at Havana or the harbor of Marseille or Villefranche or a photograph of a girl in peasant costume inside a tinsel horseshoe and a few lines hoping she was well and liked her job , never a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about himself and foreign countries but he never answered them . Still it gave her a sort of feelingof adventure to get the postcards . Whenever she saw a navy man on the street or marines from Quantico she thought of Joe and wondered how he was getting on . The sight of a gob lurching along in blue with his cap on one side took a funny twist at her heart . Sundays Alice almost always came out to Georgetown . The house was different now , Joe gone , her mother and father older and quieter , Francie and Ellen blooming out into pretty giggly highschool girls , popular with the boys in the neighborhood , going out to parties , all the time complaining because they did n't have any money to spend . Sitting at the table with them , helping Mommer with the gravy , bringing in the potatoes or the Brussels sprouts for Sunday dinner , Janey felt grownup , almost an old maid . She was on the side of her father and mother now against the sisters . Popper began to look old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to his pension . When she 'd been eight months with Mrs. Robinson she got an offerfrom Dreyfus and Carroll , the patent lawyers up on the top floor of the Riggs Building , to work for them for seventeen a week , which was five dollars more than she was getting from Mrs. Robinson . It made her feel fine . She realized now that she was good at her work and that she could support herself whatever happened . On the strength of it she went down to Woodward and Lothrop 's with Alice Dick to buy a dress . She wanted a silk grownup dress with embroideryon it . She was twentyone and was going to make seventeen dollars a week and thought she had a right to one nice dress . Alice said it ought to be a bronzy gold color to match her hair . They went in all the stores down F Street , but they could n't find anything that suited that was n't too expensive , so all they could do was buy some materials and some fashion magazines and take it home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janey still being dependent on her mother this way , p 121but there was nothing for it ; so Mrs. Williams had to make up Janey 's new dress the way she had made all her children 's dresses since they were born . Janey had never had the patience to learn to sew the way Mommer could . They bought enough material so that Alice could have one too , so Mrs. Williams had to make up two dresses . Working at Dreyfus and Carroll 's was quite different from working at Mrs. Robinson 's . There were mostly men in the office . Mr. Dreyfus was a small thinfaced man with a small black moustache and small black twinkly eyes and a touch of accent that gave him a distinguishedforeign diplomat manner . He carried yellow wash gloves and a yellow cane and had a great variety of very much tailored overcoats . He was the brains of the firm , Jerry Burnham said . Mr. Carroll was a stout redfaced man who smoked many cigars and cleared his throat a great deal and had a very oldtimey Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm 's bay window . Jerry Burnham was a wrinklefaced young man with dissipated eyes who was the firm 's adviser in technical and engineering matters . He laughed a great deal , always got into the office late , and for some reasontook a fancy to Janey and used to joke about things to her while he was dictating . She liked him , though the dissipated look under his eyes scared her off a little . She 'd have liked to have talked to him like a sister , and gotten him to stop burning the candle at both ends . Then there was an elderly accountant , Mr. Sills , a shriveled man who lived in Anacostia and never said a word to anybody . At noon he did n't go out for lunch , but sat at his desk eating a sandwich and an apple wrapped in waxed paper which he carefully folded afterwards and put back in his pocket . Then there were two fresh errandboys and a little plainfaced typist named Miss Simonds who only got twelve a week . All sorts of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in during the day and stood round in the outer officelistening to Mr. Carroll 's rich boom from behind the groundglass door . Mr. Dreyfus slipped in and out without a word , smiling faintly at his acquaintances , always in a great mysterious hurry . At lunch in the little cafeteria or at a soda-fountain Janey ' ud tell Alice all about it and Alice would look up at her admiringly . Alice always waited for her in the vestibule at one . They 'd arranged to go out then because there was less of a crowd . Neither of them ever spent more than twenty cents , so lunch did n't take them very long and they 'd haveP122time to take a turn round Lafayette Square or sometimes round the White House grounds before going back to the office . There was one Saturday night when she had to work late to finish up typing the description of an outboard motor that had to be in at the Patent Office first thing Monday morning . Everybody else had left the office . She was making out the complicated technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a postcard showing the Christ of the Andes she 'd gotten from Joe that day . All it said was : " To hell with Uncle Sam 's tin ships . Coming home soon . " It was n't signed but she knew the writing . It worried her . Jerry Burnham sat at the telephone switchboard going over the pages as she finished them . Now and then he went out to the washroom ; when he came back each time a hot breath of whisky wafted across the office . Janey was nervous . She typed till the little black letters squirmed before her eyes . She was worried about Joe . How could he be coming home before his enlistment was up ? Something must be the matter . And Jerry Burnham moving restlessly round on the telephone girl 's seat made her uncomfortable . She and Alice had talked about the danger of staying in an office alone with a man like this . Late like this and drinking , a man had just one idea . When she handed him the next to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I bet you 're tired , Miss Williams , " he said . " It 's a darned shame to keep you in like this and Saturday night too . " " It 's quite all right , Mr. Burnham , " she said icily and her fingers chirruped . " It 's the damned old baywindow 's fault . He chewed the rag so much about politics all day , nobody could get any work done . " " Well , it does n't matter now , " said Janey . " Nothing matters any more . . . . It 's almost eight o'clock . I had to pass up a date with my best girl . . . or thereabouts . I bet you passed up a date too , Miss Williams . " " I was goingto meet another girl , that 's all . " " Now I 'll tell one . . . " He laughed so easily that she found herself laughing too . When the last page was done and in the envelope , Janey got up to get her hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the mail and then you 'd better come and have a bite with me . " Going down in the elevator Janey intended to excuse herself and go home but somehow she did n't and found herself , everything aflutter inside of her , sitting coolly down with him in a French restaurant on H Street.  | " Well , what do you think of the New Freedom , Miss Williams ? " asked Jerry Burnham with a laugh after he 'd sat down . He handed her the menu . " Here 's the scorecard . . . Let your conscience be your guide . " " Why , I hardly know , Mr. Burnham . " " Well , I 'm for it , frankly . I think Wilson 's a big man ... Nothing like change anyway , the best thing in the world , do n't you think so ? Bryan 's a big bellowing blatherskite but even he represents something and even Josephus Daniels filling the navy with grapejuice . I think there 's a chance we may get back to being a democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution ; what do you think ? " He never waited for her to answer a question , he just talked and laughed all by himself . When Janey tried to tell Alice about it afterwards the things Jerry Burnham said did n't seem so funny , nor the food so good nor everythingso jolly . Alice was pretty bitter about it . " Oh , Janey , how could you go out late at night with a drunken man and to a place like that and here I was crazy anxious . . . You know a man like that has only one idea . . . I declare I think it was heartless and light . . . I would n't have thought you capable of such a thing . " " But , Alice , it was n't like that at a11 , " Janey kept saying , but Alice cried and went round looking hurt for a whole week ; so that after that Janey kept off the subject of Jerry Burnham . It was the first disagreement she 'd ever had with Alice and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends with Jerry Burnham . He seemed to like taking her out and having her listen to him talk . Even after he 'd thrown up his job at Dreyfus and Carroll , he sometimes called for her Saturday afternoons to take her to Keith 's . Janey arranged a meeting with Alice out in Rock Creek Park but it was n't much of a success . Jerry set the girls up to tea at the old stone mill . He was working for an engineering paper and writing a weekly letter for The New York Sun . He upset Alice by calling Washington a cesspool and a sink of boredom and saying he was rotting there and that most of the inhabitantswere dead from the neck up anyway . When he put them on the car to go back to Georgetown Alice said emphatically that young Burnham was not the sort of boy a respectable girl ought to know . Janey sat back happily in the seat of the open car , looking out at trees , girls in summer dresses , men in straw hats , mailboxes , storefrontsP124sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smart as a whip . . . . Gosh , I like brainy people , do n't you ? " Alice looked at her and shook her head sadly and said nothing . That same afternoon they went to the Georgetown hospital to see Popper . It was pretty horrible . Mommer and Janey and the doctor and the wardnurse knew that he had cancer of the bladder and could n't live very long but they did n't admit it even to themselves . They had just moved him into a private room where he would be more comfortable . It was costing lots of money and they 'd had to put a second mortgage on the house . They 'd already spent all Janey 's savingsthat she had in a bankaccount of her own against a rainy day . That afternoon they had to wait quite a while . When the nurse came out with a glass urinal under a towel Janey went in alone . " Hello , Popper , " she said with a forced smile . The smell of disinfectant in the room sickened her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drowsy Sundayafternoon noises , the caw of a crow , a distant sound of traffic . Popper 's face was drawn in and twisted to one side . His big moustaches looked pathetically silky and white . Janey knew that she loved him better than anybody else in the world ... His voice was feeble but fairly firm . " Janey , I 'm in drydock , girl , and I guess I 'll never . . . you know better'n I do , the sonsobitches wo n't tell me . . . Say , tell me about Joe . You hear from him , do n't you ? I wish he had n't joined the navy ; no future for a boy there without pull higher up ; but I 'm glad he went to sea , takes after me . . . I 'd been three times round the Horn in the old days before I was twenty . That was before I settled down in the towboat business , you understand .. . But I been thinkin ' here lyin ' in bed that Joe done just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old block , and I 'm glad of it . I do n't worry about him , but I wish you girls was married an ' off my hands . I 'd feel easier . I do n't trust girls nowadays with these here anklelength skirts an ' all that . " Popper 's eyes traveled all over her with a chilly feeble gleam that made her throat stiffen when she tried to speak . " I guess I can take care of myself , " she said . " You got to take care of me now . I done my best by you kids . You do n't know what life is , none of you , been shelteredand now you ship me off to die in the hospital . " " But , Popper , you said yourself you thought it would be best to go where you 'd get better care . " " I do n't like that night nurse , Janey , she handles me too rough . . . You tell ' em down at the office . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice walked alongp 125the street without saying anything . Finally Janey said , " For goodness ' sake , Alice , do n't get sulky . If you only knew how I hated it all too .. . oh , goodness , I wish ... " " What do you wish , Janey ? " " Oh , I du n no . " July was hot that summer , in the office they worked in a continual whir of electric fans , the men 's collars wilted and the girls kept themselvesoverplastered with powder ; only Mr. Dreyfus still looked cool and crisply tailored as if he 'd just stepped out of a bandbox . The last day of the month Janey was sitting a minute at her desk getting up energy to go home along the simmering streets when Jerry Burnham came in . He had his shirtsleeves rolled above the elbow and white duck pants on and carried his coat . He asked her how her father was and said he was all excited about the European news and would have to take her out to supper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car belongs to Bugs Dolan and I have n't any driver 's license , but I guess we can sneak round the Speedway and get cooled off all the same . " She tried to refuse because she ought to go home to supper and Alice was always so sulky when she went out with Jerry , but he could see that she really wanted to come and insisted . They both sat in the front seat of the Ford and dropped their coats in the back . They went once round the Speedway but the asphalt was like a griddle . The trees and the brown stagnant river stewed in late afternoon murk like meat and vegetables in a pot . The heat from the engine suffocated them . Jerry , his face red , talked incessantly about war brewing in Europe and how it would be the end of civilization and the signal for a general workingclass revolution and how he did n't care and anything that got him out of Washington , where he was drinking himself silly with his brains addled by the heat and the Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired he was of women who did n't want anything but to get money out of him or parties or marriage or some goddam thing or other and how cool and soothing it was to talk to Janey who was n't like that . It was too hot so they put off driving till later and went to the Willardto get something to eat . He insisted on going to the Willard because he said he had his pockets full of money and would just spend it anyhow and Janey was very much awed because she 'd never been in a big hotel before and felt she was n't dressed for it and said she was afraid she 'd disgrace him and he laughed and said it could n't be done . They sat in the big long gilt dining room and Jerry said it looked like a millionaire morgue and the waiter was very polite and Janey couldn'tp126find what she wanted to eat on the big bill-of-fare and took a salad . Jerry made her take a gin fizz because he said it was cooling ; it made her feel lightheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she used to tag along after Joe and Alec down to the carbarns when she was little . After supper they drove round some more and Jerry got quiet and she felt constrained and could n't think of what to say . They went way out Rhode Island Avenue and circled round back by the Old Soldiers ' Home . There was no air anywhere and the staring identical streetlights went by on either side , lighting segments of monotonous unrustling trees . Even out on the hills there was not a breath stirring . Out in the dark roads beyond the streetlamps it was better . Janey lost all sense of direction and lay back breathing in an occasional patch of freshness from a cornfield or a copse of woods . In a spot where a faint marshy dampness almost cool drifted across the road Jerry suddenly stopped the car and leaned over and kissed her . Her heart began to beat very fast . She wanted to tell him not to , but she could n't . " I did n't mean to , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Washington undermines the will . . . Or maybe I 'm in love with you , Janey . I do n't know . . . Let 's sit in the back seat where it 's cooler ? ' Weakness started in the pit of her stomach and welled up through her . As she stepped out he caught her in his arms . She let her head droop on his shoulder , her lips against his neck . His arms were burninghot round her shoulders , she could feel his ribs through his shirt pressing against her . Her head started going round in a reek of tobaccoand liquor and male sweat . His legs began pressing up to hers . She yanked herself away and got into the back seat . She was trembling . He was right after her . " No , no , " she said . He sat down beside her with his arm round her waist . " Lez have a cigarette , " he said in a shaky voice . Smoking gave her something to do , made her feel even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed side by side . " Do you mean you like me , Jerry ? " " I 'm crazy about you , kid . " " Do you mean you . . . ? " " Want to marry you ... Why the hell not ? I du n no . . . Suppose we were engaged ? " " You mean you want me to marry you ? " " If you like ... But do n't you understand the way a feller feels . . . a night like this . . . the smell of the swamp . . . God , I 'd give anything to have you . "  |p127They  'd smoked out their cigarettes . They sat a long time without saying a word . She could feel the hairs on his bare arm against her bare arm . " I 'm worried about my brother Joe . . . He 's in the navy , Jerry , and I 'm afraid he 's going to desert or something . . . I think you 'd like him . He 's a wonderful baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you feel that way towards me ? Love 's a swell thing ; goddam it , do n't you realize it 's not the way you feel towards your brother ? " He put his hand on her knee . She could feel him looking at her in the dark . He leaned over and kissed her very gently . She liked his lips gentle against hers that way . She was kissing them . She was falling through centuries of swampy night . His hot chest was against her breasts bearing her down . She would cling to him bearing her down through centuries of swampy night . Then all at once in a cold spasm she felt sick , choking for breath like drowning . She began to fight him . She got her leg up and pushed him hard in the groin with her knee . He let go of her and got out of the car . She could hear him walking up and down the road in the dark behind her . She was trembling and scared and sick . After a while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without looking at her . He was smoking a cigarette and little sparks came from it as he drove . When he got to the corner of M Street below the Williams house in Georgetown he stopped and got out and opened the door for her . She got out not knowing what to say , afraid to look at him . " I suppose you think I ought to apologize to you for being a swine , " he said . " Jerry , I 'm sorry , " she said . " I 'll be damned if I will . . . I thought we were friends . I might have known there would n't be a woman in this muck hole with a human spark in her . . . I suppose you think you ought to hold out for the wedding bells . Go ahead ; that 's your business . I can get what I want with any nigger prostitute down the street here . . . Good night . " Janey did n't say anything . He drove off . She went home and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full of morphine , in the Georgetown hospital . The papers came out every day with big headlinesabout war in Europe , Liege , Louvain , Mons. Dreyfus and Carroll 's was in a fever . Big lawsuits over munitions patents were on. p 128It began to be whispered about that the immaculate Mr. Dreyfus was an agent of the German government . Jerry came to see Janey one noon to apologize for having been so rude that night and to tell her that he had a job as a war correspondent and was leaving in a week for the front . They had a good lunch together . He talked about spies and British intrigue and pan-Slavism and the assassination of Jaures and the socialist revolution and laughed all the time and said everything was well on its way to ballyhack . She thought he was wonderful and wanted to say something about their being engaged and felt very tender towards him and scared he 'd be killed , but suddenly it was time for her to go back to the office and neither of them had brought the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and said good-bye and gave her a big kiss right there in front of everybody and ran off promising he 'd write from New York . At that moment Alice came up on her way to Mrs. Robinson 's and Janey found herself tellingher that she was engaged to be married to Jerry Burnham and that he was going to Europe to the war as a war correspondent . When her father died in early September it was a great relief to all concerned . Only , coming back from Oak Hill Cemetery all the things she 'd wanted as a girl came back to her , and the thought of Alec , and everything seemed so unhappy that she could n't stand it . Her mother was very quiet and her eyes were very red and she kept saying that she was so glad that there 'd be room on the lot for her to be buried in Oak Hill too . She 'd have hated for him to be buried in any other cemeterythan Oak Hill . It was so beautiful and all the nicest people in Georgetown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did over the house and fixed up the two top floors to rent out as apartments . That was the chance Janey had been waiting for for so long to get a place of her own and she and Alice got a room in a house on Massachusetts Avenuenear the Carnegie Library , with cooking privileges . So one Saturdayafternoon she phoned from the drugstore for a taxicab and set out with her suitcase and trunk and a pile of framed pictures from her room on the seat beside her . The pictures were two color prints of Indians by Remington , a Gibson girl , a photograph of the battleship Connecticut in the harbor of Villefranche that Joe had sent her and an enlarged photograph of her father in uniform standing at the wheel of an imaginary ship against a stormy sky furnished by a photographerin Norfolk , Va . Then there were two unframed colorprints byP 129Maxfield Parrish that she 'd bought recently and a framed snapshot of Joe in baseball clothes . The little picture of Alec she 'd wrapped among her things in her suitcase . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a crisp autumn day , the gutters were full of dry leaves . Janey felt scared and excited as if she were starting out all alone on a journey . That fall she read a great many newspapers and magazines and The Beloved Vagabond , by W. J. Locke . She began to hate the Germans that were destroying art and culture , civilization , Louvain . She waited for a letter from Jerry but a letter never came . One afternoon she was coming out of the office a little late , who should be standing in the hall by the elevator but Joe . " Hello , Janet ' , " he said . " Gee , you look like a million dollars . " She was so glad to see him she could hardly speak , could only squeeze his arm tight . " I just got paid off . . . I thought I better come up here and see the folks before I spent all my jack . . . I 'll take you out and set you up to a big feed an ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders were broader than when he left . His big hands and knotty wrists stuck out of a newlooking blue suit that was too tight for him at the waist . The sleeves were too short too . " Did you go to Georgetown ? " she asked him . " Yare . " " Did you go up to the cemetery ? " " Mommer wanted me to go , but what 's the use ? " " Poor mother , she 's so sentimental about it ... " They walked along . Joe did n't say anything . It was a hot day . Dust blew down the street . Janey said : " Joe , dear , you must tell me all about your adventures ... You must have been to some wonderful places . It 's thrilling having a brother in the navy . " " Janey , pipe down about the navy , will yer ? . . . I do n't want to hear about it . I deserted in B A , see , and shipped out east on a limey , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life too , but anything 's better than the U.S.N. " " But , Joe ... " " Ai n't nothin ' to worry about ... " " But , Joe , what happened ? " " You wo n't say a word to a livin ' soul , will you , Janey ? You see I got in a scrap with a petty officer tried to ride me too damn hard . Ip130socked him in the jaw an ' kinda mauled him , see , an ' things looked pretty bad for me , so I made tracks for the tall timber . . . . That 's all . " " Oh , Joe , and I was hoping you 'd get to be an officer . " " A gob get to be an officer . . . ? A fat chance . " She took him to the Mabillion , where Jerry had taken her . At the door Joe peered in critically . " Is this the swellest joint you know , Janey ? I got a hundred iron men in my pocket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a French restaurant . And you ought n't to spend all your money on me . " " Who the hell else do you want me to spend it on ? " Joe sat down at a table and Janey went back to ' phone Alice that she would n't be home till late . When she got back , to the table , Joe was pulling some little packages wrapped in red and greenstriped tissuepaper out of his pockets . " Oh , what 's that ? " " You open ' em , Janey . . . It 's yours . " She opened the packages . They were some lace collars and an embroidered tablecloth . " The lace is Irish and that other 's from Madeira . . . I had a Chinese vase for you too but some son of a bit . . . son of a gun snitched it on me . " " That was awful sweet of you to think of me . . . I appreciate it . " Joe fidgeted with his knife and fork . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be late for the show ... I got tickets for The Garden of Allah .. " ' When they came out of the Belasco onto Lafayette Square that was cool and quiet with a rustle of wind in the trees Joe said , " Ai n't so much ; I seen a real sandstorm once , " and Janey felt bad about her brother being so rough and uneducated . The play made her feel like when she was little , full of uneasy yearn for foreign countries and a smell of incense and dark eyes and dukes in tailcoats tossing money away on the gaming tables of Monte Carlo , monks and the mysteriouseast . If Joe was only a little better educated he 'd be able to really appreciate all the interesting ports he visited . He left her on the stoop of the house on Massachusetts Avenue . " Where are you going to stay , Joe ? " she asked . " I guess I 'll shove along back to New York an ' pick up a berth . . . . Sailoring 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean tonight ? " He nodded . " I wish I had a bed for you but I could n't very well on account of Alice . " " Naw , I doan want to hang round this dump . . . I jus ' came up to say hello . " " Well , goodnight , Joe , be sure and write . " " Goodnight , Janey , I sure will . " She watched him walk off down the street until he went out of sight in the shadows of the trees . It made her unhappy to see him go all alone down the shadowed street . It was n't quite the shambling walk of a sailor , but he lookedP 131like a working man all right . She sighed and went into the house . Alicewas waiting up for her . She showed Alice the lace and they tried on the collars and agreed that it was very pretty and quite valuable . Janey and Alice had a good time that winter . They took to smoking cigarettes and serving tea to their friends Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves as bachelorgirls . They learned to play bridge and shortened their skirts . At Christmas Janey got a hundred dollar bonus and a raise to twenty a week from Dreyfus and Carroll . She began telling Alice that she was an old stickinthemud to stay on at Mrs. Robinson 's . For herself she began to have ambitions of a business career . She was n't afraid of men any more and kidded back and forth with young clerks in the elevatorabout things that would have made her blush the year before . When Johnny Edwards or Morris Byer took her out to the movies in the evening she did n't mind having them put their arms around her , or having them kiss her once or twice while she was fumbling in her bag for her latchkey . She knew just how to catch a boy 's hand by the wrist and push it away without making any scene when he tried to get too intimate . When Alice used to talk warningly about men having just one idea , she 'd laugh and say , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little peroxide in the water when she washed her hair made it blonder and took away that mousey look . Sometimes when she was getting ready to go out in the evening she 'd put a speck of rouge on her little finger and rub it very carefully on her lips .

Ward MoorehouseHe was born in Wilmington , Delaware , on the Fourth of July . Poor Mrs. Moorehouse could hear the firecrackers popping and crackling outside the hospital all through her laborpains . And when she came to a little and they brought the baby to her she asked the nurse in a trembling husky whisper if she thought it could have a bad effect on the baby all that noise , prenatal influence you know . The nurse said the little boy ought to grow up to be very patriotic and probably president being born on the Glorious Fourth and went on to tell a long story about a woman who 'd been frightened by having a beggar stick his hand out suddenly right under her nose just before the child was born and the child had been born with six fingers , but Mrs. Moorehouse was too weak to listen and went off to sleep . Later Mr. Moorehouse came by on his way home from the depot where he worked as stationagent and they decided to call the kid John Ward afterMrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well off . Then Mr. Moorehouse went round to Healy 's to get tanked up because he was a father and because it was the Glorious Fourth and Mrs. Moorehouse went off to sleep again . Johnny grew up in Wilmington . He had two brothers , Ben and Ed , and three sisters , Myrtle , Edith and Hazel , but everybody said he was the bright boy of the family as well as the eldest . Ben and Ed were stronger and bigger than he was , but he was the marbles champion of the public school , getting considerable fame one term by a corner in agates he maneuvered with the help of a little Jewish boy named Ike Goldberg ; they managed to rent out agates to other boys for a cent a week for ten . When the Spanish War came on everybody in Wilmington was filled with martial enthusiasm , all the boys bothered their parents to buy them Rough Rider suits and played filibusters and Pawnee Indianwars and Colonel Roosevelt and Remember the Maine and the White Fleet and the Oregon steaming through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf one summer evening when Admiral Cervera 's squadron was sighted in battle formation passing through the Delaware Capes by a detachment of the state militia who immediatelyopened fire on an old colored man crabbing out in the river . Johnny ran home like Paul Revere and Mrs. Moorehouse gathered upP 139her six children and pushing two of them in a babycarriage and draggingthe other four after her , made for the railway station to find her husband . By the time they 'd decided to hop on the next train to Philadelphia news went round that the Spanish squadron was just some boats fishing for menhaden and that the militiamen were being confined in barracks for drunkenness . When the old colored man had hauled in his last crabline he sculled back to shore and exhibited to his cronies several splintery bulletholes in the side of his skiff . When Johnny graduated from highschool as head of the debating team , class orator and winner of the prize essay contest with an essay entitled " Roosevelt , the Man of the Hour , " everybody felt he ought to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was none too good , his father said , shaking his head . Poor Mrs. Moorehouse who had been sickly since the birth of her last child had taken to the hospitalto have an operation and would stay there for some time to come . The younger children had had measles , whooping cough , scarletfever and mumps all year . The amortization on the house was due and Mr. Moorehouse had not gotten the expected raise that New Year 's . So instead of getting a job as assistant freight agent or picking peaches down near Dover the way he had other summers Johnny went round Delaware , Maryland and Pennsylvania as agent for a bookdistributing firm . In September he received a congratulatory note from them saying that he was the first agent they had ever had who sold a hundred consecutive sets of Bryant 's History of the United States . On the strength of it he went out to West Philadelphia and applied for a scholarship at the U of P. He got the scholarship , passed the exams and enrolled himself as a freshman , indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first term he commuted from Wilmingtonto save the expense of a room . Saturdays and Sundays he picked up a little money taking subscriptions for Stoddard 's Led arch Everything would have gone right if his father had n't slipped oil the ice on the station steps one January morning in Johnny 's sophomore year and broken his hip . He was taken to the hospital and one co cation after another ensued . A little shyster lawyer , Ike Goldberg 's father , in fact , went to see Moorehouse , who lay with his leg in the air in a Balkan frame , and induced him to sue the railroad for a hundred thousand dollars under the employers ' liability law . ' I'lw lawyers got up witnesses to prove that Moorehouse had been drinking heavily and the doctor who had examined him testified that the 140showed traces of having used liquor the morning of the fall , so by midsummer he hobbled out of hospital on crutches , without a job and without any compensation . That was the end of Johnny 's college education . The incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his father . Mrs. Moorehouse had to write for help from her father to save the house , but his answer took so long that the bank foreclosed before it came and it would n't have done much good anyway because it was only a hundred dollars in ten dollar bills in a registered envelope and just about paid the cost of moving to a floor in a fourfamily frame house down by the Pennsylvania freightyards . Ben left highschool and got a job as assistant freightagent and Johnny went into the office of Hillyard and Miller , Real Estate . Myrtle and her mother baked pies evenings and made angelcake to send to the Woman 's Exchange and Mr. Moorehouse sat in an invalid chair in the front parlor cursing shyster lawyers and the lawcourts and the Pennsylvania Railroad . This was a bad year for Johnny Moorehouse . He was twenty and did n't drink or smoke and was keeping himself clean for the lovely girl he was going to marry , a girl in pink organdy with golden curls and a sunshade . He 'd sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenements for rent , furnished rooms , apartments , desirablelots for sale , and think of the Boer war and the Strenuous Life and prospecting for gold . From his desk he could see a section of a street of frame houses and a couple of elmtrees through a grimy windowpane . In front of the window was in summer a conical wiremesh flytrap where caught flies buzzed and sizzled , and in winter a little openface gas-stove that had a peculiar feeble whistle all its own . Behindhim , back of a groundglass screen that went part way to the ceilingMr . Hillyard and Mr. Miller sat facing each other at a big double desk , smoking cigars and fiddling with papers . Mr. Hillyard was a sallowfaced man with black hair a little too long who had been on the way to making a reputation for himself as a criminal lawyer when , through some scandal that nobody ever mentioned as it was generally agreed in Wilmington that he had lived it down , he had been disbarred . Mr. Miller was a little roundfaced man who lived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business by the fact that his father had died leaving him building lots scattered over Wilmington and the outskirts of Philadelphia and nothing else to make a living from . Johnny 's job was to sit in the outer office and bep141polite to prospective buyers , to list the properties , attend to advertising , type the firm 's letters , empty the wastebaskets and the dead flies out of the flytrap , take customers to visit apartments , houses and buildinglots and generally make himself useful and agreeable . It was on this job that he found out that he had a pair of bright blue eyes and that he could put on an engaging boyish look that people liked . Old ladies looking for houses used to ask specially to have that nice young man show them round , and business men who dropped in for a chat with Mr. Hillyard or Mr. Miller would nod their heads and look wise and say , " Bright boy , that . " He made eight dollars a week . Outside of the Strenuous Life and a lovely girl to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind dwelt on as he sat at his desk listing desirable five and sevenroom dwelling-houses , drawingroom , diningroom , kitchen and butler 's pantry , three master'sbedrooms and bath , maid 's room , water , electricity , gas , healthy location on gravelly soil in restricted residential area : He wanted to be a songwriter . He had a fair tenor voice and could carry Larboard Watch Ahoy or I Dreamed I Dwelt in Marble Halls or Through Pleasuresand Palaces Sadly I Roam very adequately . Sunday afternoons he took music lessons with Miss O'Higgins , a shriveled little Irishwoman , unmarried , of about thirtyfive , who taught him the elements of the piano and listened with rapture to his original compositions that she took down for him on musicpaper that she had all ready ruled when he came . One song that beganOh , show me the state where the peaches bloom Where maids are fair .. . It 's Delawareshe thought good enough to send to a music publisher in Philadelphia , but it came back , as did his next composition that Miss O'Higgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared she could n't take any money from him for her lessons , at least not until he was rich and had made a name for himself  --  that Marie cried over and said was as beautiful as MacDowell . It beganThe silver bay of DelawareRolls through peachblossoms to the sea And when my heart is bowed with care Its memory sweet comes back to me.  |p142Miss  O'Higgins had a little parlor with gilt chairs in it where she gave her music lessons . It was very heavily hung with lace curtains and with salmoncolored brocaded portieres she had bought at an auction . In the center was a black walnut table piled high with worn black leather albums . Sunday afternoons after the lesson was over she 'd bring out tea and cookies and cinnamon toast and Johnny would sit there sprawled in the horsehair armchair that had to have a flowered cover over it winter and summer on account of its being so worn and his eyes would be so blue and he 'd talk about things he wanted to do and poke fun at Mr. Hillyard and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her cheeks would flush and she 'd feel almost pretty and feel that after all there was n't such a terribledisparity in their ages . She supported by her music lessons an invalidmother and a father who had been a wellknown baritone and patriot in Dublin in his younger days but who had taken to drink and she was madly in love with Johnny Moorehouse . Johnny Moorehouse worked on at Hillyard and Miller 's sitting in the stuffy office , chafing when he had nothing to do until he thought he 'd go mad and run amok and kill somebody , sending songs to the music publishers that they always sent back , reading the Success Magazine , full of sick longing for the future : to be away from Wilmington and his father 's grumbling and pipesmoking and the racket his little brothers and sisters made and the smell of corned beef and cabbage and his mother 's wrinkled crushed figure and her overworkedhands . But one day he was sent down to Ocean City , Maryland , to report on some lots the firm had listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a carbuncle on his neck . He gave Johnny the returnticket and ten dollars for the trip . It was a hot July afternoon . Johnny ran home to get a bag and to change his clothes and got down to the station just in time to make the train . The ride was hot and sticky down through peachorchards and pinebarrens under a blazing slaty sky that flashed back off sandy patches in scraggly cornfields and whitewashed shacks and strips of marshwater . Johnny had taken off the jacket of his gray flannel suit and folded it on the seat beside him to keep it from getting mussed and laid his collar and tie on top of it so that they 'd be fresh when he got in , when he noticed a darkeyed girl in a ruffled pink dress and a wide white leghorn hat sitting across the aisle . She was considerablyp143older than he was and looked like the sort of fashionably dressed woman who 'd be in a parlor car rather than in a daycoach . But Johnny reflected that there was n't any parlor car on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that she was looking at him . The afternoon grew overcast and it came on to rain , big drops spatteredagainst the car windows . The girl in pink ruffles was struggling to put her window down . He jumped over and put it down for her . " Allow me , " he said . " Thanks . " She looked up and smiled into his eyes . " Oh , it 's so filthy on this horrid train . " She showed him her white gloves all smudged from the windowfastenings . He sat down again on the inside edge of his seat . She turned her full face to him . It was an irregularbrown face with ugly lines from the nose to the ends of the mouth , but her eyes set him tingling . " You wo n't think it 's too unconventionalof me if we talk , will you ? " she said , " I 'm bored to death on this horrid train , and there is n't any parlor car though the man in New York swore that there was . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Johnny , looking shy and boyish . " Worse than that . I came down from Newport on the boat last night . " The casual way she said Newport quite startled him . " I 'm going to Ocean City , " he said . " So am I. Is n't it a horrid place ? I would n't go there for a minute if it were n't for Dad . He pretends to like it . " " They say that Ocean City has a great future . . . I mean in a kind of a realestate way , " said Johnny . There was a pause . " I got on in Wilmington , " said Johnny with a smile . " A horrid place , Wilmington . . . I ca n't stand it . " " I was born and raised there . . . I suppose that 's why I like it , " said Johnny . " Oh , I did n't mean there were n't awfully nice people in Wilmington . . . lovely old families . . . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . . . I do n't want to spend all my life in Wilmington , anyway . . . Gosh , look at it rain . " It rained so hard that a culvert was washed out and the train was four hours late into Ocean City . By the time they got in they were good friends ; it had thundered and lightened and she 'd been so nervousand he 'd acted very strong and protecting and the car had filledp144up with mosquitoes and they had both been eaten up and they 'd gottenvery hungry together . The station was pitchblack and there was no porter and it took him two trips to get her bags out and even then they almost forgot her alligatorskin handbag and he had to go back into the car a third time to get it and his own suitcase . By that time an old darkey with a surrey had appeared who said he was from the Ocean House . " I hope you 're going there too , " she said . He said he was and they got in though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so many bags . There were no lights in Ocean City on account of the storm . The surreywheels ground through a deep sandbed ; now and then that sound and the clucking of the driver at his horse were drowned by the roar of the surf from the beach . The only light was from the moon continually hidden by driving clouds . The rain had stopped but the tense air felt as if another downpour would come any minute . " I certainly would have perished in the storm if it had n't been for you , " she said ; then suddenly she offered him her hand like a man : " My name 's Strang . . . Annabelle Marie Strang . . . . Is n't that a funny name ? " He took her hand . " John Moorehouse is mine . . . Glad to meet you , Miss Strang . " The palm of her hand was hot and dry . It seemed to press into his . When he let go he felt that she had expected him to hold her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now we 're introduced , Mr. Moorehouse , and everything 's quite all right .. . I certainly shall give Dad a piece of my mind . The idea of his not meeting his only daughter at the station . " In the dark hotel lobby lit by a couple of smoked oillamps he saw her , out of the corner of his eye , throw her arms round a tall white-haired man , but by the time he had scrawled John W. Moorehouse in his most forceful handwriting in the register and gotten his roomkey from the clerk , they had gone . Up in the little pine bedroom it was very hot . When he pulled up the window , the roar of the surf came in through the rusty screen mingling with the rattle of rain on the roof . He changed his collar and washed in tepid water he poured from the cracked pitcher on the washstand and went down to the diningroom to try to get something to eat . A goat-toothed waitress was just bringinghim soup when Miss Strang came in followed by the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sitting at , they came towards it and he got up and smiled . " Here he is , Dad , " she said . " And you owe him for the driver that brought us from the station . . . Mr. Morris , you must meet my father , Dr. Strang ... The name was Morris , wasn'tp145it ? " Johnny blushed . " Moorehouse , but it 's quite all right . . . . I 'm glad to meet you , sir . " Next morning Johnny got up early and went round to the office of the Ocean City Improvement and Realty Company that was in a new greenstained shingled bungalow on the freshly laidout street back of the beach . There was no one there yet so he walked round the town . It was a muggy gray day and the cottages and the frame stores and the unpainted shacks along the railroad track looked pretty desolate . Now and then he slapped a mosquito on his neck . He had on his last clean collar and he was worried for fear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalks he got sand in his shoes , and sharp beachburrs stuck to his ankles . At last he found a stout man in a white linen suit sitting on the steps of the realestate office . " Good morning , sir , " he said . " Are you Colonel Wedgewood ? " The stout man was too out of breath to answer and only nodded . He had one big silk handkerchiefstuck into his collar behind and with another was mopping his face . Johnny gave him the letter he had from his firm and stood waiting for him to say something . The fat man read the letter with puckered brows and led the way into the office . " It 's this asthma , " he gasped between great wheezing breaths . " Cuts ma wind when Ah trah to hurry . Glad to meet you , son . " Johnny hung round old Colonel Wedgewood the rest of the morning , looking blue-eyed and boyish , listening politely to stories of the Civil War and General Lee and his white horse Traveller and junketings befoa de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store to get a cake of ice for the cooler , made a little speech about the future of Ocean City as a summer resort  --  " Why , what have they got at AtlanticCity or Cape May that we have n't got here ? " roared the Colonel  --  went home with him to his bungalow for lunch , thereby missing the train he ought to have taken back to Wilmington , refused a mint julep  --  he neither drank nor smoked  --  but stood admiringly by while the Colonel concocted and drank two good stiff ones , for his asthma , used his smile and his blue eyes and his boyish shamble on the Colonel'scolored cook Mamie and by four o'clock he was laughing about the Governor of North Carolina and the Governor of South Carolina and had accepted a job with the Ocean City Improvement and Realty Company at fifteen dollars a week , with a small furnished cottage thrown in . He went back to the hotel and wrote Mr. Hillyard , inclosingthe deeds for the lots and his expense account , apologized forP146leaving the firm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family who were in great need to better himself as much as he could ; then he wrote to his mother that he was staying on in Ocean City and please to send him his clothes by express ; he wondered whether to write Miss O'Higgins , but decided not to . After all , bygoneswere bygones . When he had eaten supper he went to the desk to ask for his bill , feeling pretty nervous for fear he would n't have enough money to pay it , and was just coming out with two quarters in his pocket and his bag in his hand when he met Miss Strang . She was with a short dark man in white flannels whom she introduced as Monsieur de la Rochevillaine . He was a Frenchman but spoke good English . " I hope you 're not leaving us ; " she said . " No , ma'am , I 'm just moving down the beach to one of Colonel Wedgewood 's cottages . " The Frenchman made Johnny uneasy ; he stood smiling suave as a barber beside Miss Strang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? He 's a great crony of Dad 's . I think he 's just too boring with his white horse Traveller . " Miss Strang and the Frenchman smiled both at once as if they had some secret in common . The Frenchman stood beside her swinging easily on the balls of his feet as if he were standing beside some piece of furniturehe owned and was showing off to a friend . Johnny had a notionto paste him one right where the white flannel bulged into a pot belly . " Well , I must go , " he said . " Wo n't you come back later ? There 's going to be dancing . We 'd love to have you . " " Yes , come back by all means , " said the Frenchman . " I will if I can , " said Johnny and walked off with his suitcase in his hand , feeling sticky under the collar and sore . " Drat that Frenchman , " he said aloud . Still , there was something about the way Miss Strang looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a hot August , the mornings still , the afternoons piling up sultry into thundershowers . Except when there were clients to show about the scorched sandlots and pinebarrens laid out into streets , Johnny sat in the office alone under the twoflanged electric fan . He was dressed in white flannels and a pink tennis shirt rolled up to the elbows , drafting the lyrical description of Ocean City ( Maryland ) that was to preface the advertising booklet that was the Colonel 's pet idea : " The lifegiving surges of the broad Atlantic beat on the crystallinebeaches of Ocean City ( Maryland ) . . . the tonic breath of the pines brings relief to the asthmatic and the consumptive ... nearbyP147the sportsman 's paradise of Indian River spreads out its broad estuary teeming with ... " In the afternoon the Colonel would come in sweatingand wheezing and Johnny would read him what he had written and he 'd say , " Bully , ma boy , bully , " and suggest that it be all done over . And Johnny would look up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and start off again . It would have been a fine life except that he was in love . Evenings he could n't keep away from the Ocean House . Each time he walked up the creaking porch steps past the old ladies rocking and fanning with palmleaf fans , and went through the screen doors into the lobby he felt sure that this time he 'd find Annabelle Marie alone , but each time the Frenchman was with her as smiling and cool and potbellied as ever . They both made a fuss over Johnny and petted him like a little dog or a precocious child ; she taught him to dance the " Boston , " and the Frenchman , who it turned out was a duke or a baron or something , kept offering him drinks and cigars and scented cigarettes . Johnny was shocked to death when he found out that she smoked , but somehow it went with dukes and Newport and foreign travel and that sort of thing . She used some kind of musky perfume and the smell of it and the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feverish when he danced with her . Some nights he tried to tire out the Frenchman playing pool , but then she 'd disappear to bed and he 'd have to go off home cursing under his breath . While he undressed he could still feel a little tingle of musk in his nostrils . He was trying to make up a song : By the moonlight sea I pine for thee Annabelle Marie .. . Then it ' ud suddenly sound too damn silly and he 'd stride up and down his little porch in his pajamas , with the mosquitoes shrilling about his head and the pound of the sea and the jeer of the dryflies and katydids in his ears , cursing being young and poor and uneducatedand planning how he 'd make a big enough pile to buy out every damn Frenchman ; then he 'd be the one she 'd love and look up to and he would n't care if she did have a few damn Frenchmen for mascots if she wanted them . He 'd clench his fists and stride around the porch muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then one evening he found Annabelle Marie alone . The French/man had gone on the noon train . She seemed glad to see Johnny , but there was obviously something on her mind . She had too much powderon her face and her eyes looked red ; perhaps she 'd been crying . It was moonlight . She put her hand on his arm , " Moorehouse , walk down the beach with me , " she said . " I hate the sight of all these old hens in rockingchairs . " On the walk that led across a scraggly lawn down to the beach they met Dr. Strang . " What 's the matter with Rochevillaine , Annie ? " he said . He was a tall man with a high forehead . His lips were compressed and he looked worried . " He got a letter from his mother . . . She wo n't let him . " " He 's of age , is n't he ? " " Dad , you do n't understand the French nobility . . . The family council wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his income . " " You 'll have enough for two . . . I told him that . " " Oh , shut up about it , ca n't you ? . . . " She suddenly started to blubberlike a child . She ran past Johnny and back to the hotel , leaving Johnny and Dr. Strang facing each other on the narrow boardwalk . Dr. Strang saw Johnny for the first time . " H 'm . . . excuse us , " he said as he brushed past and walked with long strides up the walk , leaving Johnny to go down to the beach and look at the moon all by himself . But the nights that followed Annabelle Marie did walk out along the beach with him and he began to feel that perhaps she had n't loved the Frenchman so much after all . They would go far beyond the stragglingcottages and build a fire and sit side by side looking into the flame . Their hands sometimes brushed against each other as they walked ; when she 'd want to get to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull her up towards him and he always planned to pull her to him and kiss her but he had n't the nerve . One night was very warm and she suddenly suggested they go in bathing . " But we have n't our suits . " " Have n't you ever been in without ? It 's much better . . . Why , you funny boy , I can see you blushing even in the moonlight . " " Do you dare me ? " " I doubledare you . " He ran up the beach a way and pulled off his clothes and went very fast into the water . He did n't dare look and only got a glimpse out of the corner of an eye of white legs and breasts and a wave spuming white at her feet . While he was putting his clothes on again he was wondering if he wanted to get married to a girl who 'd go in swimmingwith a fellow all naked like that , anyway . He wondered if she'dp149done it with that damn Frenchman . " You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back beside the fire where she was coiling her black hair round her head . She had hairpins in her mouth and spoke through them . " Like a very nervous marble faun . . . I got my hair wet . " He had n't intended to but he suddenly pulled her to him and kissed her . She did n't seem at all put out but made herself little in his arms and put her face up to be kissed again . " Would you marry a feller like me without any money ? " " I had n't thought of it , darling , but I might . " " You 're pretty wealthy , I guess , and I have n't a cent , and I have to send home money to my folks . . . but I have prospects . " " What kind of prospects ? " She pulled his face down and ruffled his hair and kissed him . " I 'll make good in this realestate game . I swear I will . " " Will it make good , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . How old are you , Annabelle ? " " Well , I admit to twentyfour , but you must n't tell anybody , or about tonight or anything . " " Who would I be telling about it , Annabelle Marie ? " Walking home , something seemed to be on her mind because she paid no attention to anything he said . She kept humming under her breath . Another evening they were sitting on the porch of his cottage smoking cigarettes  --  he would occasionally smoke a cigarette now to keep her company  --  he asked her what it was worrying her . She put her hands on his shoulders and shook him : " Oh , Moorehouse , you 're such a fool . . . but I like it . " " But there must be something worrying you , Annabelle . . . You did n't look worried the day we came down on the train together . " " If I told you . . . Gracious , I can imagine your face . " She laughed her hard gruff laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I had the right to make you tell me . . . You ought to forget that damn Frenchman . " " Oh , you 're such a little innocent , " she said . Then she got up and walked up and down the porch . " Wo n't you sit down , Annabelle ? Do n't you like me even a little bit ? " She rubbed her hand through his hair and down across his face . " Of course I do , you little blue-eyed ninny ... But ca n't you see it 's everythingdriving me wild , all those old cats round the hotel talk about me as if I was a scarlet woman because I occasionally smoke a cigarette in my own room . . . Why , in England some of the most aristocraticwomen smoke right in public without anybody saying boo ' to them . . . And then I 'm worried about Dad ; he 's sinking too much money in realestate . I think he 's losing his mind . " P 150 " But there 's every indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Atlantic City in time . " " Now look here , ' fess up , how many lots have been sold this month ? " " Well , not so many ... But there are some important sales pending ... There 's that corporation that 's going to build the new hotel . " " Dad 'll be lucky if he gets fifty cents out on the dollar . . . and he keeps telling me how rattlebrained I am . He 's a physician and not a financial wizard and he ought to realize it . It 's all right for somebody like you who has nothing to lose and a way to make in the world to be messing around in realestate . . . As for that fat Colonel I do n't know whether he 's a fool or a crook . " " What kind of a doctor is your father ? " " Do you mean to say you never heard of Dr. Strang ? He 's the best known nose and throat specialist in Philadelphia . . . Oh , it 's so cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and ignorant . . . " she kissed him again . . . " and pure . " " I 'm not so pure , " he said quickly and looked at her hard in the eyes . Their faces began to blush looking at each other . She let her head sink slowly on his shoulder . His heart was pounding . He was dizzy with the smell of her hair and the perfume she wore . He pulled her to her feet with his arm round her shoulders . Tottering a little , her leg against his leg , the stiffnessof her corset against his ribs , her hair against his face , he pulled her through the little livingroom into the bedroom and locked the door behind them . Then he kissed her as hard as he could on the lips . She sat down on the bed and began to take off her dress , a little coolly he thought , but he 'd gone too far to pull back . When she took off her corset she flung it in the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate the beastly things . " She got up and walked towards him in her chemiseand felt for his face in the dark . " What 's the matter , darling ? " she whispered fiercely , " Are you afraid of me ? " Everything was much simpler than Johnny expected . They giggled together while they were dressing . Walking back along the beach to the Ocean House , he kept thinking : " Now she 'll have to marry me . " In September a couple of cold northeasters right after Labor Day emptied the Ocean House and the cottages . The Colonel talked biggerabout the coming boom and his advertising campaign , and drank more . Johnny took his meals with him now instead of at Mrs. Ames ' boardinghouse . The booklet was finished and approved and Johnny had made a couple of trips to Philadelphia with the text and thep151photographs to get estimates from printers . Running through Wilmingtonon the train without getting off there gave him a pleasant feeling of independence . Dr. Strang looked more and more worried and talked about protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement to his daughter , but it seemed to be understood . Annabelle 's moods were unaccountable . She kept saying she was dyingof boredom . She teased and nagged at Johnny continually . One night he woke suddenly to find her standing beside the bed . " Did I scare you ? " she said . " I could n't sleep . . . Listen to the surf . " The wind was shrilling round the cottage and a tremendous surf roared on the beach . It was almost daylight before he could get her to get out of bed and go back to the hotel . " Let ' em see me . . . I do n't care , " she said . Another time when they were walking along the beach she was taken with nausea and he had to stand waiting while she was sick behind a sanddune , then he supported her , white and trembling , back to the Ocean House . He was worried and restless . On one of his trips to Philadelphia he went round to The Public Ledger to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Saturday afternoon he sat reading the paper in the lobby of the Ocean House . There was no one else there , most of the guests had left . The hotel would close the fifteenth . Suddenly he found himself listening to a conversation . The two bellhops had come in and were talking in low voices on the bench against the wall . " Well , I got mahn awright this summer , damned if I did n't , Joe . " " I would of too if I had n't gotten sick . " " Did n't I tell you not to monkey round with that Lizzie ? Man , I b'lieve every sonofabitch in town slep ' with that jane , not excludin ' niggers . " " Say , did you . . . You know the blackeyed one ? You said you would . " Johnny froze . He held the paper rigid in front of him . The bellhop gave out a low whistle . " Hotstuff , " he said . " Jeez , what these society dames gits away with ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , not exactly . . . ' Fraid I might ketch somethin ' . But that Frenchman did . . . Jeez , he was in her room all the time . " " I know he was . I caught him once . " They laughed . " They 'd forgot to lock the door . " " Was she all neked ? " p 152 " I guess she was . . . under her kimono ... He 's cool as a cucumber and orders icewater . " " Whah did n't ye send up Mr. Greeley ? " " Hell , why should I ? Frenchman was n't a bad scout . He gave me five bucks . " " I guess she can do what she goddam pleases . Her dad about owns this dump , they tell me , him an ole Colonel Wedgewood . " " I guess that young guy in the realestate office is gettin ' it now .. . looks like he 'd marry her . " " Hell , I 'd marry her maself if a girl had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat . He wanted to get out of the lobby withouttheir seeing him . A bell rang and one of the boys ran off . He heard the other one settling himself on the bench . Maybe he was reading a magazine or something . Johnny folded up the paper quietly and walked out onto the porch . He walked down the street without seeing anything . For a while he thought he 'd go down to the station and take the first train out and throw the whole business to ballyhack , but there was the booklet to get out , and there was a chance that if the boom did come he might get in on the ground floor , and this connection with money and the Strangs ; opportunity knocks but once at a young man 's door . He went back to his cottage and locked himself in his bedroom . He stood a minute looking at himself in the glass of the bureau . The neatly parted light hair , the cleancut nose and chin ; the image blurred . He found he was crying . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he went up to Philadelphia the next time to read proof on the booklet : OCEAN CITY ( Maryland ) VACATIONLAND SUPREMEHe also took up a draft of the wedding invitations to be engraved : Dr. Alonso B. Strangannounces the marriage of his daughterAnnabelle Marieto Mr. J. Ward Moorehouseat Saint Stephen 's Protestant Episcopal Church , Germantown , Pennsylvania , on November fifteenthnineteen hundred and nine at twelve noonp153Then there was an invitation to the reception to be sent to a special list . It was to be a big wedding because Dr. Strang had so many social obligations . Annabelle decided on J. Ward Moorehouse as more distinguishedthan John W. and began to call him Ward . When they asked him about inviting his family he said his mother and father were both invalids and his brothers and sisters too little to enjoy it . He wrote his mother that he was sure she 'd understand , but that as things were and with Dad the way he was ... he was sure she 'd understand . Then one evening Annabelle told him she was going to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her eyes were suddenly scaringly cold black in his .

Dad 'll fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to get me off his hands and I 've got money in my own right , mother 's money . " " Maybe it 's all a mistake . " " How can it be ? " " How long is it since you . . . noticed ... ? " Her eyes were suddenly black and searching in his again . They stared at each other and hated each other . " Quite long enough , " she said and pulled his ear as if he were a child , and went swishing upstairs to dress . The Colonel was tickled to death about the engagementand had invited them all to dinner to celebrate it . The wedding came off in fine style and J. Ward Moorehouse found himself the center of all eyes in a wellfitting frock coat and a silk hat . People thought he was very handsome . His mother back in Wilmington let flatiron after flatiron cool while she pored over the account in the papers ; finally she took off her spectacles and foldedp154the papers carefully and laid them on the ironing board . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day from New York on the Teutonic . The crossing was so rough that only the last two days was it possible to go out on deck . Ward was sick and was taken care of by a sympatheticcockney steward who spoke of Annabelle as the " Madam " and thought she was his mother . Annabelle was a good sailor but the baby made her feel miserable and whenever she looked at herself in her handmirror she was so haggard that she would n't get out of her bunk . The stewardess suggested gin with a dash of bitters in it and it helped her over the last few days of the crossing . The night of the captain 's dinner she finally appeared in the diningroom in an eveninggown of black valenciennes and everybody thought her the bestlooking woman on the boat . Ward was in a fever for fear she 'd drink too much champagne as he had seen her put away four ponies of gin and bitters and a Martini cocktail while dressing . He had made friends with an elderly banker , Mr. Jarvis Oppenheimer and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little fast to them . The captain 's dinner went off without a hitch , however , and Annabelle and Ward found that they made a good team . The captain , who had known Dr. Strang , came and sat with them in the smokingroom afterwardsand had a glass of champagne with them and with Mr. and Mrs. Oppenheimer and they heard people asking each other who could that charming scintillating brilliant young couple be , somebodyinteresting surely , and when they went to bed after having seen the lighthouses in the Irish Sea , they felt that all the seasick days had been thoroughly worth while . Annabelle did n't like it in London where the dark streets were dismalin a continual drizzle of sleet , so they only stayed a week at the Cecil before crossing to Paris . Ward was sick again on the boat from Folkestone to Boulogne and could n't keep track of Annabelle whom he found in the dining saloon drinking brandy and soda with an Englisharmy officer when the boat reached the calm water between the long jetties of Boulogne harbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country where he did n't know the language and Annabelle spoke French very adequately and they had a firstclass compartment and a basket with a cold chicken and sandwiches in it and some sweet wine that Ward drank for the first time  --  when in Rome do as the Romans do  --  and they were quite the honeymoon couple on the train goingp155down to Paris . They drove in a cab from the station to the Hotel Wagram , with only their handbaggage because the hotel porter took care of the rest , through streets shimmering with green gaslight on wet pavements . The horse 's hoofs rang sharp on the asphalt and the rubbertired wheels of the cab spun smoothly and the streets were crowded in spite of the fact that it was a rainy winter night and there were people sitting out at little marbletop tables round little stoves in front of cafes and there were smells in the air of coffee and wine and browning butter and baking bread . Annabelle 's eyes caught all the lights ; she looked very pretty , kept nudging him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Annabelle had written to the hotel , where she had stayed before with her father , and they found a white bedroom and parlor waiting for them and a roundfaced managerwho was very elegant and very affable to bow them into it and a fire in the grate . They had a bottle of champagne and some pate de fois gras before going to bed and Ward felt like a king . She took off her traveling clothes and put on a negligee and he put on a smoking jacket that she had given him and that he had n't worn and all his bitterfeelings of the last month melted away . They sat a long time looking into the fire smoking Muratti cigarettesout of a tin box . She kept fondling his hair and rubbing her hand round his shoulders and neck . " Why are n't you more affectionate , Ward ? " she said in low gruff tones . " I 'm the sort of woman likes to be carried off her feet . . . Take care . . . You may lose me . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a woman . " " Gim me a chance , wo n't you ? . . . First thing I 'm going to get a job with some American firm or other . I think Mr. Oppenheimer 'll help me do that . I 'll start in taking French lessons right away . This 'll be a great opportunity for me . " " You funny boy . " " You do n't think I 'm goingto run after you like a poodledog , do you , without making any money of m y own ? ... Nosiree , bobby . " He got up and pulled her to her feet . " Let 's go to bed . " Ward went regularly to the Berlitz school for his French lessons and went round to see Notre Dame and Napoleon 's tomb and the Louvre with old Mr. Oppenheimer and his wife . Annabelle , who said that museums gave her a headache , spent her days shopping and havingfittings with dressmakers . There were not many American firms in Paris so the only job Ward could get , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on Gordon Bennett 's news-p 156paper , the Paris edition of The New York Herald . The job consisted of keeping track of arriving American business men , interviewing them on the beauties of Paris and on international relations . This was his meat and enabled him to make many valuable contacts . Annabelle thought it was all too boring and refused to be told anything about it . She made him put on a dress suit every evening and take her to the opera and theatres . This he was quite willing to do as it was good for his French . She went to a very famous specialist for women 's diseases who agreed that on no account should she have a baby at this time . An immediateoperation was necessary and would be a little dangerous as the baby was so far along . She did n't tell Ward and only sent word from the hospital when it was over . It was Christmas day . He went immediately to see her . He heard the details in chilly horror . He 'd gottenused to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadying effect on Annabelle . She lay looking very pale in the bed in the private sanatorium and he stood beside the bed with his fists clenched without saying anything . At length the nurse said to him that he was tiring madame and he went away . When Annabelle came back from the hospital after four or five days announcing gaily that she was fit as a fiddle and was going to the south of France , he said nothing . She got ready to go , taking it for granted that he was coming , but the day she left on the train to Nice he told her that he was going to stay on in Paris . She looked at him sharply and then said with a laugh , " You 're turning me loose , are you ? " " I have my business and you have your pleasure , " he said . " All right , young man , it 's a go . " He took her to the station and put her on the train , gave the conductor five francs to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . He 'd had enough of the smell of musk and perfume for a while . Paris was better than Wilmington but Ward did n't like it . So much leisure and the sight of so many people sitting round eating and drinking got on his nerves . He felt very homesick the day the Ocean City booklet arrived inclosed with an enthusiastic letter from Colonel Wedgewood . Things were moving at last , the Colonel said ; as for himself he was putting every cent he could scrape up , beg or borrow , into options . He even suggested that Ward send him a little money to invest for him , now that he was in a position to risk a stake on the surety of a big turnover ; risk was n't the word because the whole situation was sewed up in a bag ; nothing to do but shake the tree and letp157the fruit fall into their mouths . Ward went down the steps from the office of Morgan Harjes where he got his mail and out onto BoulevardHaussmann . The heavy coated paper felt good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked down the boulevard with the honk of horns and the ring of horse 's hoofs and the shuffle of steps in his ears , now and then reading a phrase . Why , it almost made him want to go back to Ocean City ( Maryland ) himself . A little ruddy sunlight was warming the winter gray of the streets . A smell of roastingcoffee came from somewhere ; Ward thought of the white cracklingsunlight of windswept days at home ; days that lashed you full of energy and hope ; the Strenuous Life . He had a date to lunch with Mr. Oppenheimer at a very select little restaurant down in the slums somewhere called the Tour d'Argent . When he got into a red-wheeled taximeter cab it made him feel good again that the driver understood his directions . After all it was educational , made up for those years of college he had missed . He had read through the booklet for the third time when he reached the restaurant . He got out at the restaurant and was just paying the taxi when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foot . Mr. Oppenheimer wore a gray overcoat and a gray derby of the same pearly color as his moustaches ; the other man was a steelgray individual with a thin nose and chin . When he saw them Ward decided that he must be more careful about his clothes in the future . They ate lunch for a long time and a great many courses , although the steelgray man , whose name was McGill  --  he was manager of one of Jones and Laughlin 's steel plants in Pittsburgh  --  said his stomach would n't stand anything but a chop and a baked potato and drank whisky and soda instead of wine . Mr. Oppenheimer enjoyed his food enormously and kept having long consultations about it with the head waiter . " Gentlemen , you must indulge me a little . . . this for me is a debauch , " he said . " Then , not being under the watchful eye of my wife , I can take certain liberties with my digestion . . . My wife has entered the sacred precincts of a fitting at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You , Ward , are not old enough to realize the possibilitiesof food . " Ward looked embarrassed and boyish and said he was enjoying the duck very much . " Food , " went on Mr. Oppenheimer , " is the last pleasure of an old man . " When they were sitting over Napoleon brandy in big bowlshaped glasses and cigars , Ward got up his nerve to bring out the Ocean Cityp 158(Maryland) booklet that had been burning a hole in his pocket all through lunch . He laid it on the table modestly . " I thought maybe you might like to glance at it , Mr. Oppenheimer , as . . . as something a bit novel in the advertising line . " Mr. Oppenheimer took out his glasses and adjusted them on his nose , took a sip of brandy and looked through the book with a bland smile . He closed it , let a little curling blue cigarsmoke out through his nostrils and said , " Why , Ocean City must be an earthly paradise indeed . . . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit thick ? " " But you see , sir , we 've got to make the man on the street just crazy to go there . . . There 's got to be a word to catch your eye the minute you pick it up . " Mr. McGill , who up to that time had n't looked at Ward , turned a pair of hawkgray eyes on him in a hard stare . With a heavy red hand he reached for the booklet . He read it intently right through while Mr. Oppenheimer went on to talk about the bouquet of the brandy and how you should warm the glass a little in your hand and take it in tiny sips , rather inhaling it than drinking it . Suddenly Mr. McGill brought his fist down on the table and laughed a dry quick laugh that did n't move a muscle of his face . " By gorry , that 'll get ' em , too , " he said . " I reckon it was Mark Twain said there was a sucker born every minute . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry I did n't ketch your name , young feller ; do you mind repeating it ? " " With pleasure ... It 's Moorehouse , J. Ward Moorehouse . " " Where do you work ? " " I 'm on The Paris Herald for the time being , " said Ward , blushing . " Where do you live when you 're in the States ? " " My home 's in Wilmington , Delaware , but I do n't guess I 'll go back there when we go home . I 've been offered some editorial work on The Public Ledger in Philly . " Mr. McGill took out a visiting card and wrote an address on it . " Well , if you ever think of coming to Pittsburgh , look me up . " " I 'd be delighted to see you . " " His wife , " put in Mr. Oppenheimer , " is the daughter of Dr. Strang , the Philadelphia nose and throat specialist . . . By the way , Ward , how is the dear girl ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir , " said Ward , " she writes that she 's much better . " " She 's a lovely creature ... charming ... " said Mr. Oppenheimer , draining the last sip out of his brandyglass with upcast eyes . Next day Ward got a wire from Annabelle that she was coming up to Paris . He met her at the train . She introduced a tall FrenchmanP159with a black vandyke beard , who was helping her off with her bags when Ward came up , as " Monsieur Forelle , my traveling companion . " They did n't get a chance to talk until they got into the cab together . The cab smelt musty as they had to keep the windows closed on account of the driving rain . " Well , my dear , " Annabelle said , " have you got over the pet you were in when I left ? . . . I hope you have because I have bad news for you . " " What 's the trouble ? " " Dad 's gotten himself in a mess financially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more idea of business than a cat . . . Well , that fine Ocean City boom of yours collapsed before it had started and Dad got scared and tried to unload his sandlots and naturally nobody 'd buy them . . . Then the Improvement and Realty Company went bankrupt and that precious Colonel of yours has disappeared and Dad has got himself somehow personally liable for a lot of the concern 's debts . . . . And there you are . I wired him we were coming home as soon as we could get a sailing . I 'll have to see what I can do . . . He 's helpless as a child about business . " " That wo n't make me mad . I would n't have come over here anyway if it was n't for you . " " Just all selfsacrifice , are n't you ? " " Let 's not squabble , Annabelle . " The last days in Paris Ward began to like it . They heard La Boheme at the opera and were both very much excited about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cold partridge and wine and Ward told Annabelle about how he 'd wanted to be a songwriter and about Marie O'Higgins and how he 'd started to compose a song about her and they felt very fond of each other . He kissed her again and again in the cab going home and the elevator going up to their room seemed terribly slow . They still had a thousand dollars on the letter of credit Dr. Strang had given them as a wedding present , so that Annabelle bought all sorts of clothes and hats and perfumes and Ward went to an English tailor near the Church of the Madeleine and had four suits made . The last day Ward bought her a brooch in the shape of a rooster , made of Limoges enamel and set with garnets , out of his salary from The Paris Herald . Eating lunch after their baggage had gone to the boat train they felt very tender about Paris and each other and the brooch . They sailed from Havre on the Touraine and had a completely calm pas/osage , a gray glassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ward was n't seasick . He walked round and round the firstclass every morning before Annabelle got up . He wore a Scotch tweed cap and a Scotch tweed overcoat to match , with a pair of fieldglasses slung over his shoulder , and tried to puzzle out some plan for the future . Wilmington anyway was far behind like a ship hull down on the horizon . The steamer with tugboats chugging at its sides nosed its way through the barges and tugs and carferries and red whistling ferryboatsof New York harbor against a howling icybright northwest wind . Annabelle was grouchy and said it looked horrid , but Ward felt himself full of enthusiasm when a Jewish gentleman in a checked cap pointed out the Battery , the Custom House , the Aquarium and TrinityChurch . They drove right from the dock to the ferry and ate in the redcarpeteddiningroom at the Pennsylvania Station in Jersey City . Ward had fried oysters . The friendly darkey waiter in a white coat was like home . " Home to God 's country , " Ward said , and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello to the folks . Annabelle laughed at him and they sat stiffly in the parlor car of the Philadelphia train without speaking . Dr. Strang 's affairs were in very bad shape and , as he was busy all day with his practice , Annabelle took them over completely . Her skill in handling finance surprised both Ward and her father . They lived in Dr. Strang 's big old house on Spruce Street . Ward , through a friend of Dr. Strang 's , got a job on The Public Ledger and was rarely home . When he had any spare time he listened to lectures on economics and business at the Drexel Institute . Evenings Annabelle took to going out with a young architect named Joachim Beale who was very rich and owned an automobile . Beale was a thin young man with a taste for majolica and Bourbon whisky and he called Annabelle " my Cleo-patra ? ' Ward come in one night and found them both drunk sitting with very few clothes on in Annabelle 's den in the top of the house . Dr. Strang had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the doorway with his arms folded and announced that he was through and would sue for divorce and left the house slamming thep161door behind him and went to the Y.M.C.A. for the night . Next afternoonwhen he got to the office he found a special delivery letter from Annabelle begging him to be careful what he did as any publicity would be disastrous to her father 's practice , and offering to do anything he suggested . He immediately answered it : DEAR ANNABELLE : I now realize that you have intended all along to use me only as a screen for your disgraceful and unwomanly conduct . I now understand why you prefer the company of foreigners , bohemians and such to that of ambitious young Americans . I have no desire to cause you or your father any pain or publicity , but in the first place you must refrain from degrading the name of Moorehouse while you still legally bear it and also I shall feel that when the divorce is satisfactorily arranged I shall be entitled to some compensation for the loss of time , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your fault . I am leaving tomorrow for Pittsburgh where I have a position awaitingme and work that I hope will cause me to forget you and the great pain your faithlessness has caused me . He wondered for a while how to end the letter , and finally wrote sincerely JWMand mailed it . He lay awake all night in the upper berth in the sleeper for Pittsburgh . Here he was twentythree years old and he had n't a college degreeand he did n't know any trade and he 'd given up the hope of being a songwriter . God damn it , he 'd never be valet to any society dame again . The sleeper was stuffy , the pillow kept getting in a knot under his ear , snatches of the sales talk for Bancroft 's or Bryant 's histories , . . . " Through peachorchards to the sea . . . " Mr. Hillyard 's voice addressing the jury from the depths of the realestate office in Wilmington : " Realestate , sir , is the one safe sure steady conservativeinvestment , impervious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links himself by indissoluble bonds to the growth of his city or nation . . . improve or not at his leisure and convenience and sit at home in quiet and assurance letting the riches drop in to his lap that are produced by the unavoidable and inalienable growth in wealth ofp162a mighty nation . . . " " For a young man with proper connections and if I may say so pleasing manners and a sound classical education , " Mr. Oppenheimer had said , " banking should offer a valuable field for the cultivation of the virtues of energy , diplomacy and perhaps industry .... " A hand was tugging at his bedclothes . " Pittsburgh , sah , in fortyfive minutes , " came the colored porter 's voice . Ward pulled on his trousers , noticed with dismay that they were losing their crease , dropped from the berth , stuck his feet in his shoes that were sticky from being hastily polished with inferior polish , and stumbled along the aisle past dishevelled people emerging from their bunks , to the men 's washroom . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car was unbearably stuffy and the washroom smelt of underwear and of other men 's shaving soap . Through the window he could see black hills powdered with snow , an occasional coaltipple , rows of gray shacks all alike , a riverbed scarred with minedumps and slagheaps , purple lacing of trees along the hill 's edge cut sharp against a red sun ; then against the hill , bright and red as the sun , a blob of flame from a smelter . Ward shaved , cleaned his teeth , washed his face and neck as best he could , parted his hair . His jaw and cheekbones were getting a square look that he admired . " Cleancut young executive , " he said to himself as he fastened his collarand tied his necktie . It was Annabelle had taught him the trick of wearing a necktie the same color as his eyes . As he thought of her name a faint tactile memory of her lips troubled him , of the musky perfume she used . He brushed the thought aside , started to whistle , stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went and stood on the platform . The sun was well up now , the hills were pink and black and the hollows blue where the smoke of breakfastfires collected . Everything was shacks in rows , ironworks , coaltipples . Now and then a hill threw a row of shacks or a group of furnaces up against the sky . Stragglings of darkfaced men in dark clothes stood in the slush at the crossings . Coalgrimed walls shut out the sky . The train passed through tunnels under crisscrossed bridges , through deep cuttings . " Pittsburgh Union Station , " yelled the porter . Ward put a quarter into the colored man 's hand , picked out his bag from a lot of other bags , and walked with a brisk firm step down the platform , breathing deep the cold coalsmoky air of the trainshed. p 163The Camera Eye ( 17 ) the spring you could see Halley 's Comet over the elms from the back topfloor windows of the Upper House Mr. Greenleaf said you would have to go to confirmation class and be confirmed when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skinny that you would n't be confirmed because you believed in camping and canoeing and Halley 's Comet and the Universe and the sound the rain made on the tent the night you 'd both read The Hound of the Baskervilles and you 'd hung out the steak on a tree and a hound must have smelt it because he kept circling round you and howling something terrible and you were so scared ( but you did n't say that , you do n't know what you said ) and not in church and Skinny said if you 'd never been baptized you could n't be confirmed and you went and told Mr. Greenleaf and he looked very chilly and said you 'd better not go to confirmation class any more and after that you had to go to church Sundays but you could go to either one you liked so sometimes you went to the Congregational and sometimes to the Episcopalian and the Sunday the bishop came you could n't see Halley 's Comet any more and you saw the others being confirmed and it lasted for hours because there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could hear was mumble mumble this thy child mumble mumble this thy child and you wondered if you 'd be alive next time Halley 's Comet came roundp164I was in front of the national palace when the firing began .

She hated her father , a stout redhaired man smelling of whiskers and stale pipetobacco . He worked in an office in the stockyards and came home with the stockyardsstench on his clothes and told bloody jokes about butchering sheep and steers and hogs and men . Eleanor hated smells and the sight of blood . Nights she used to dream she lived alone with her mother in a big clean white house in Oak Park in winter when there was snow on the ground and she 'd been setting a white linen tableclothwith bright white silver and she 'd set white flowers and the white meat of chicken before her mother who was a society lady in a dress of white samite , but there 'd suddenly be a tiny red speck on the table and it would grow and grow and her mother would make helplessfluttering motions with her hands and she 'd try to brush it off but it would grow a spot of blood welling into a bloody blot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nightmare smelling the stockyards and screaming . When she was sixteen in highschool she and a girl named Isabelle swore together that if a boy ever touched them they 'd kill themselves . But that fall the girl got pneumonia after scarlet fever and died . The only other person Eleanor liked was Miss Oliphant , her Englishteacher . Miss Oliphant had been born in England . Her parents had come to Chicago when she was a girl in her teens . She was a great enthusiast for the English language , tried to get her pupils to use the broad " a " and felt that she had a right to some authority in matters pertaining to English literature due to being distantly related to a certainMrs . Oliphant who 'd been an English literary lady in the middlep 166nineteenth century and had written so beautifully about Florence . So she 'd occasionally have her more promising pupils , those who seemed the children of nicer parents , to tea in her little flat where she lived all alone with a sleepy blue Persian cat and a bullfinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pithy sayings and Keats and cor cordium and how terrible it was he died so young and Tennysonand how rude he 'd been to women and about how they changed the guard at Whitehall and the grapevine Henry the Eighth planted at Hampton Court and the illfated Mary Queen of Scots . Miss Oliphant 's parents had been Catholics and had considered the Stuarts the rightful heirs to the British throne , and used to pass their wineglassesover the waterpitcher when they drank to the king . All this thrilled the boys and girls very much and particularly Eleanor and Isabelle , and Miss Oliphant used to give them high grades for their compositions and encourage them to read . Eleanor was very fond of her and very attentive in class . Just to hear Miss Oliphant pronounce a phrase like " The Great Monuments of English Prose , " or " The Little Princes in the Tower " or " St. George and Merrie England " made small chills go up and down her spine . When Isabelle died , Miss Oliphant was so lovely about it , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lycidas " in a clear crisp voice and told her to read " Adonais " when she got home , but that she could n't read it to her because she knew she 'd break down if she did . Then she talked about her best friend when she 'd been a girl who 'd been an Irish girl with red hair and a clear warm white skin like Crown Darby , my dear , and how she 'd gone to India and died of the fever , and how Miss Oliphant had never thought to survive her grief and how Crown Darby had been inventedand the inventor had spent his last penny working on the formulafor this wonderful china and had needed some gold as the last ingredient , and they had been starving to death and there had been nothing left but his wife 's wedding ring and how they kept the fire in the furnace going with their chairs and tables and at least he had producedthis wonderful china that the royal family used exclusively . It was Miss Oliphant who induced Eleanor to take courses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pictures by Rossetti and Burne-Jones and talked to Eleanor about the **25;242;TOOLONG . She made her feel that Art was something ivory white and very pure and noble and distant and sad . When her mother died of pernicious anaemia Eleanor was a thinp 167girl of eighteen , working days in a laceshop in the Loop and studying commercial art evenings at the Art Institute . After the funeral she went home and packed her belongings and moved to Moody House . She hardly ever went to see her father . He sometimes called her up on the phone but whenever she could she avoided answering . She wanted to forget all about him . In the laceshop they liked her because she was so refined and gave the place what old Mrs. Lang who owned the store called " an indefinable air of chic , " but they only paid her ten dollars a week and five of that went for rent and board . She did n't eat much , but the food was so bad in the dining hall and she hated sitting with the other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk to drink in her room and some weeks she 'd find herself without money to buy pencils and drawingpaper with and would have to go by to see her father and get a couple of dollars from him . He gave it to her gladly enough , but somehow that made her hate him more than ever . Evenings she used to sit in her little sordid cubbyhole of a room with its ugly bedspread and ugly iron bed , while a sound of hymnsingingcame up from the common hall , reading Ruskin and Pater out of the public library . Sometimes she would let the book drop on her knees and sit all evening staring at the dim reddish electriclight bulb that was all the management allowed . Whenever she asked for a raise Mrs. Lang said , " Why , you 'll be marrying soon and leaving me , dear ; a girl with your style , indefinablechic ca n't stay single long , and then you wo n't need it . " Sundays she usually took the train out to Pullman where her mother 's sister had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little woman who laid all Eleanor 's peculiarities to girlish fancies and kept a bright lookout for a suitable young man she could corral as a beau for her . Her husband , Uncle Joe , was foreman in a rolling mill . Many years in the rolling mill had made him completely deaf , but he claimed that actually in the mill he could hear what was said perfectly . If it was summer he spent Sunday hoeing his gardenpatch where he specialized in lettuce and asters . In winter or in bad weather he 'd be sitting in the front room reading The Railroad Man 's Magazine . Aunt Betty would cook an elaborate dinner from recipes out of The Ladies ' Home Journal and they 'd ask Eleanor to arrange the flowers for them on the dinnertable . After dinner Aunt Betty would wash the dishes and Eleanor would wipe them , and while the old people took theirp168nap she would sit in the front room reading the society section of The Chicago Tribune . After supper if it was fine the old people would walk down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Aunt Betty would say that it was a shocking shame for a lovely girl like her to be living all alone in the big city . Eleanor would smile a bright bitter smile and say that she was n't afraid . The cars going home would be crowded Sunday nights with young men and girls sticky and mussed up and sunburned from an outing in the country or on the dunes . Eleanor hated them and the Italian families with squalling brats that filled the air with a reek of wine and garlic and the Germans redfaced from a long afternoon 's beerdrinkingand the drunk Finn and Swedish workmen who stared at her with a blue alcoholic gleam out of wooden faces . Sometimes a man would try to start something and she 'd have to move into anothercar . Once , when the car was very crowded a curlyhaired man rubbed himself up against her suggestively . The crowd was so thick she could n't pull herself away from him . She could hardly keep from screaming out for help ; it was only that she felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over her when she finally forced her way out at her station , and she had to stop at a drugstore on the way home for a little aromatic spirits of ammonia . She rushed through the hall of Moody House and up to her room still trembling . She was nauseated and one of the other girls found her being sick in the bathroom and looked at her so queerly . She was very unhappy at times like that and thought of suicide . She had painful cramps during her monthly periods and used to have to stay in bed at least one day every month . Often she felt miserable for a whole week . One Fall day she had phoned Mrs. Lang that she was sick and would have to stay in bed . She went back up to her room and lay down on the bed and read Romola . She was reading through the completeworks of George Eliot that were in the Moody House library . When the old scrubwoman opened the door to make the bed she said , " Sick . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon she got hungry and the sheets were all rumply under her back and although she felt rather ashamed of herself for feeling able to go out when she 'd told Mrs. Lang she was too sick to move she suddenly felt she would suffocateif she stayed in her room another minute . She dressed carefully and went downstairs feeling a little furtive . " So you 're not so sick afterp169all , " said Mrs. Biggs , the matron , when she passed her in the hall . " I just felt I needed a breath of air . " " Too bad about you , " she heard Mrs. Biggs say under her breath as she went out the door . Mrs. Biggs was very suspicious of Eleanor because she was an art student . Feeling a little faint she stopped at a drugstore and had some aromaticspirits of ammonia in water . Then she took a car down to Grant Park . A tremendous northwest wind was blowing grit and papers in whirls along the lakefront . She went into the Art Institute and up into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Institute better than anything else in Chicago , better than anything else in the world , the quiet , the absence of annoying men , the smooth smell of varnish from the paintings . Except on Sundays when the crowd came and it was horrid . Today there was no one in the Stickney Room but another girl welldressed in a gray fox neckpiece and a little gray hat with a feather in it . The other girl was looking fixedly at the portrait of Manet . Eleanorwas interested ; she rather pretended to look at the Whistlers than look at them . Whenever she could she looked at the other girl . She found herself standing beside the other girl also looking at the portrait of Manet . Suddenly their eyes met . The other girl had palebrown almondshaped eyes rather far apart . " I think he 's the best painter in the world , " she said combatively as if she wanted somebody to deny it . " I think he 's a lovely painter , " said Eleanor , trying to keep her voice from trembling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not by Manet himself , that 's by Fantin-Latour , " said the other girl . " Oh , yes , of course , " said Eleanor . There was a pause . Eleanor was afraid that would be all , but the other girl said , " What other pictures do you like ? " Eleanor looked carefully at the Whistler ; then she said slowly , " I like Whistler and Corot . " " I do , too , but I like Millet best . He 's so round and warm .. . Have you ever been to Barbizon ? " " No , but I 'd love to . " There was a pause . " But I think Millet 's a little coarse , do n't you ? " Eleanor ventured . " You mean that chromo of the Angelus ? Yes , I simply loathe and despise religious feeling in a picture , do n't you ? " Eleanor did n't quite know what to say to that , so she shook her head and said , " I love Whistler so ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the window and everything looks , you know , pastelly like that . " " I have an idea , " said the other girl who had been looking at a little watch she had in her handbag . " I do n't have to be home till six . Whyp 170do n't you come and have tea with me ? I know a little place where you can get very good tea , a German pastry shop . I do n't have to be home till six and we can have a nice long chat . You wo n't think it 's unconventionalof me asking you , will you ? I like unconventionality , do n't you ? Do n't you hate Chicago ? " Yes , Eleanor did hate Chicago and conventional people and all that . They went to the pastryshop and drank tea and the girl in gray , whose name was Eveline Hutchins , took hers with lemon in it . Eleanor talked a great deal and made the other girl laugh . Her father , Eleanor found herself explaining , was a painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she was a little girl . There had been a divorceand her mother had married again , a business man connected with Armour and Company , and now her mother was dead and she had only some relatives at Lake Forest ; she studied at the Art Institute but was thinking of giving it up because the teachers did n't suit her . She thought living in Chicago was just too horrible and wanted to go East . " Why do n't you go to Florence and live with your father ? " asked Eveline Hutchins . " Well , I might some day , when my ship comes in , " said Eleanor . " Oh , well , I 'll never be rich , " said Eveline . " My father 's a clergyman ... Let 's go to Florence together , Eleanor , and call on your father . If we arrived there he could n't very well throw us out . " " I 'd love to take a trip some day ? ' " It 's time I was home . By the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at all the pictures together ? ' " I 'm afraid I 'll be busy tomorrow . " " Well , maybe you can come to supper some night . I 'll ask mother when I can have you . It 's so rare to meet a girl you can talk to . We live on Drexel Boulevard . Here 's my card . I 'll send you a postcard and you 'll promise to come , wo n't you ? " " I 'd love to , if it 's not earlier than seven . . . You see I have an occupationthat keeps me busy every afternoon except Sunday , and SundaysI usually go out to see my relatives in ... " " In Lake Forest ? " " Yes ... When I 'm in town I live at a sort of Y.W.C.A. place , Moody House ; it 's plebeian but convenient . . . I 'll write down the address on this card . " The card was of Mrs. Lang 's , " Imported Laces and HandEmbroideredFabrics . " She wrote her address on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eveline . " That 's lovely ; " she said , " I 'll drop you a card this very night and you 'll promise to come , wo n't you ? " Eleanor saw her onto the streetcar and started to walk slowly along the street . She had forgotten all about feeling sick , but now that the other girl had gone she felt let down and shabbily dressed and lonely picking her way through the windy evening bustle of the streets . Eleanor made several friends through Eveline Hutchins . The first time she went to the Hutchinses she was too awed to notice much , but later she felt freer with them , particularly as she discovered that they all thought her an interesting girl and very refined . The 're were Dr. and Mrs. Hutchins and two daughters and a son away at college . Dr. Hutchins was a Unitarian minister and very broadminded and Mrs. Hutchins did watercolors of flowers that were declared to show great talent . The elder daughter , Grace , had been at school in the East , at Vassar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , the son was taking postgraduate Greek at Harvard and Eveline was taking the most interesting courses right there at Northwestern . Dr. Hutchins was a softvoiced man with a large smooth pinkish face and large smooth white deadlooking hands . The Hutchinses were all planning to go abroad next year which would be Dr. Hutchins ' sabbatical . Eleanor had never heard talk like that before and it thrilled her . Then one evening Eveline took her to Mrs. Shuster 's . " You must n't say anything about Mrs. Shuster at home , will you ? " said Eveline as they were coming down from the Elevated . " Mr. Shuster is an art dealer and my father thinks they 're a little too Bohemian . . . It 's just because Annie Shuster came to our house one night and smoked all through dinner . . . . I said we 'd go to the concert at the Auditorium . " Eleanor had made herself a new dress , a very simple white dress , with a little green on it , not exactly an evening dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion , and when Annie Shuster , a dumpy little redhaired woman with a bouncy manner of walking and talking helped them off with their wraps in the hall she exclaimed how pretty it was . " Why , yes , it 's lovely , " said Eveline . " In fact , you 're looking pretty as a peach tonight , Eleanor . " " I bet that dress was n't made in this town . . . Looks like Paris to me , " said Mrs. Shuster . Eleanorsmiled deprecatingly and blushed a little and looked handsomer than ever . P 172There were a great many people packed into two small rooms and cigarette smoke and coffeecups and smell of some kind of punch . Mr. Shuster was a whitehaired grayfaced man with a head too large for his body and a tired manner . He talked like an Englishman . There were several young men standing round him ; one of them Eleanor had known casually when she had studied at the Art Institute . His name was Eric Egstrom and she had always liked him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache . She could see that Mr. Shuster thought a lot of him . Eveline took her around and introduced her to everybody and asked everybody questions that seemed sometimesdisconcerting . Men and women both smoked and talked about books and pictures and about people Eleanor had never heard of . She looked around and did n't say much and noticed the Greek silhouettes on the orange lampshades and the pictures on the walls which looked very odd indeed and the two rows of yellowbacked French books on the shelves and felt that she might learn a great deal there . They went away early because Eveline had to go by the Auditorium to see what the program at the concert was for fear she might be asked about it , and Eric and another young man took them home . After they 'd left Eveline at her house they asked Eleanor where she lived and she hated to say Moody House because it was in such a horridlooking street , so she made them walk with her to an Elevated station and ran up the steps quickly and would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go home alone as late as it was . Many of Mrs. Lang 's customers thought Eleanor was French , on account of her dark hair , her thin oval face and her transparent skin . In fact , one day when a Mrs. McCormick that Mrs. Lang suspected might be one of " the " McCormicks asked after that lovely French girl who waited on her before , Mrs. Lang got an idea . Eleanor would have to be French from now on ; so she bought her twenty tickets at the Berlitz School and said she could have the hour off in the morning between nine and ten if she would go and take French lessons there . So all through December and January Eleanor studied French three times a week with an old man in a smelly alpaca jacket and began to slip a phrase in now and then as unconcernedly as she could when she was talking to the customers , and when there was anybody in the shop Mrs. Lang always called her " Mademoiselle . " She worked hard and borrowed yellowbacked books from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon she knewp 173more French than Eveline did who had had a French governess when she was little . One day at the Berlitz School she found she had a new teacher . The old man had pneumonia and she had a young Frenchmaninstead . He was a thin young man with a sharp blueshaved chin and large brown eyes with long lashes . Eleanor liked him at once , his thin aristocratic hands and his aloof manner . After half an hour they had forgotten all about the lesson and were talking English . He spoke English with a funny accent but fluently . She particularly liked the throaty way he pronounced " r . " Next time she was all tingling going up the stairs to see if it would be the same young man . It was . He told her that the old man had died . She felt she ought to be sorry but she was n't . The young man noticed how she felt and screwed his face up into a funny half laughing , half crying expression and said , " Vae victis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and how he hated the conventional bourgeoislife there and how he 'd come to America because it was the land of youth and the future and skyscrapers and the Twentieth Century Limited and how beautiful he thought Chicago was . Eleanor had never heard anyone talk like that and told him he must have gone through Ireland and kissed the blarney stone . Then he looked very aggrieved and said , " Mademoiselle , c'est la pure verite , " and she said she believed him absolutely and how interesting it was to meet him and how she must introduce him to her friend Eveline Hutchins . Then he went on to tell her how he 'd lived in New Orleans and how he 'd come as a steward on a French Line boat and how he 'd worked as dishwasher and busboy and played the piano in cabarets and worse places than that and how much he loved Negroes and how he was a painter and wanted so much to get a studio and paint but that he had n't the money yet . Eleanor was a little chilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when he said he was interested in art she felt she really would have to introduce him to Eveline and she felt very bold and unconventional when she asked him to meet them at the Art Institute Sunday afternoon . After all if they decided against it they would n't have to go . Eveline was thrilled to death but they got Eric Egstrom to come along too , on account of Frenchmen having such a bad reputation . The Frenchman was very late and they began to be afraid he was n't coming or that they 'd missed him in the crowd but at last Eleanor saw him coming up the big staircase . His name was Maurice Millet  --  no , p 174no relation of the painter 's  --  and he shocked them all very much by refusing to look at any paintings in the Art Institute and saying that he thought it ought to be burned down and used a lot of words like cubism and futurism that Eleanor had never heard before . But she could see at once that he had made a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung on his every word and all through tea neither of them paid any attention to Eleanor . Eveline invited Maurice to the house and they all went to supper to Drexel Boulevard where Maurice was very polite to Dr. and Mrs. Hutchins , and on to the Shusters afterwards . They left the Shusters together and Maurice said that the Shusters were impossible and had very bad paintings on their walls , " Tout ca c'est affreusement pompier , " he said . Eleanor was puzzled but Eveline and Eric said that they understood perfectly that he meant they knew as little about art as a firemen 's convention , and they laughed a great deal . The next time she saw Eveline , Eveline confessed that she was madly in love with Maurice and they both cried a good deal and decided that after all their beautiful friendship could stand even that . It was up in Eveline 's room at Drexel Boulevard . On the mantel was a portrait Eveline was trying to do of him in pastels from memory . They sat side by side on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked solemnly about each other and Eleanor told about how she felt about men ; Eveline did n't feel quite that way but nothing could ever break up their beautiful friendship and they 'd always tell each other everything . About that time Eric Egstrom got a job in the interior decorating department at Marshall Field 's that paid him fifty a week . He got a fine studio with a northlight in an alley off North Clark Street and Maurice went to live with him there . The girls were there a great deal and they had many friends in and tea in glasses Russian style and sometimes a little Virginia Dare wine , so they did n't have to go to the Shusters any more . Eleanor was always trying to get in a word alone with Eveline ; and the fact that Maurice did n't like Eveline the way Eveline liked him made Eveline very unhappy , but Maurice and Eric seemed to be thoroughly happy . They slept in the same bed and were always together . Eleanor used to wonder about them sometimes but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . They all went to the opera together and to concerts and art exhibitions  --  it was Eveline or Eric who usually bought the tickets and paid whenp 175they ate in restaurants  --  and Eleanor had a better time those few months than she 'd ever had in her life before . She never went out to Pullman any more and she and Eveline talked about getting a studio together when the Hutchinses came back from their trip abroad . The thought that every day brought June nearer and that then she would lose Eveline and have to face the horrid gritty dusty sweaty Chicago Summer alone made Eleanor a little miserable sometimes , but Eric was trying to get her a job in his department at Marshall Field 's , and she and Eveline were following a course of lectures on interior decoratingat the University evenings , and that gave her something to look forward to . Maurice painted the loveliest pictures in pale buffs and violets of longfaced boys with big luminous eyes and long lashes , and longfaced girls that looked like boys , and Russian wolfhounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a few girders or a white skyscraper and a big puff of white clouds and Eveline and Eleanor thought it was such a shame that he had to go on teaching at the Berlitz School . The day before Eveline sailed for Europe they had a little party at Egstrom 's place . Maurice 's pictures were around the walls and they were all glad and sorry and excited and tittered a great deal . Then Egstrom came in with the news that he had told his boss about Eleanor and how she knew French and had studied art and was so goodlooking and everything and Mr. Spotmann had said to bring her around at noon tomorrow , and that the job , if she could hold it down , would pay at least twentyfive a week . There had been an old lady in to see Maurice 's paintings and she was thinking of buying one ; they all felt very gay and drank quite a lot of wine , so that in the end when it was time for goodbyes it was Eveline who felt lonesome at going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being left behindas she had expected . When Eleanor walked back along the platform from seeing the Hutchinses all off for New York the next evening , and their bags all labelledfor the steamship Baltic and their eyes all bright with the excitement of going East and going abroad and the smell of coalsrnoke and the clang of engine bells and scurry of feet , she walked with her fists clenched and her sharppointed nails dug into the palms of her hands , saying to herself over and over again : " I 'll be going , too ; it 's only a question of time ; I 'll be going , too . " P 176The Camera Eye ( 18 ) she was a very fashionable lady and adored bullterriers and had a gentleman friend who was famous for his resemblance to King Edwardshe was a very fashionable lady and there were white lilies in the hall No my dear I ca n't bear the scent of them in the room and the bullterriers bit the tradespeople and the little newsy No my dear they never bit nice people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went coaching in a fourinhand and the man in the back blew a long horn and that 's where Dick Whittington stood with his cat and the bells there were hampers full of luncheon and she had gray eyes and was very kind to her friend 's little boy though she loathed simply loathed most children and her gentleman friend who was famous for his resemblance to King Edward could n't bear them or the bullterriers and she kept asking Why do you call him that ? and you thought of Dick Whittington and the big bells of Bow , three times Lord Mayor of London and looked into her gray eyes and said Maybe because I called him that the first time I saw him and I did n't like her and I did n't like the bullterriers and I did n't like the fourinhand but I wished Dick Whittington three times Lord Mayor of London boomed the big bells of Bow and I wished Dick WhittingtonI wished I was home but I had n't any home and the man in the back blew a long hornEleanor StoddardWorking at Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . At Mrs. Lang 's she had only one boss but in the big store she seemed to have everybody in the department over her . Still she was so refined and cold and had such a bright definite little way of talking that although people did n't like her much , she got along well . Even Mrs. Potter and Mr. Spotmann , the department heads , were a little afraid of her . News got around that she was a society girl and did n't really have to earn a living at all . She was very sympathetic withp 177the customers about their problems of homemaking and had a little humble-condescending way with Mrs. Potter and admired her clothes , so that at the end of a month Mrs. Potter said to Mr. Spotmann , " I think we have quite a find in the Stoddard girl , " and Mr. Spotmann without opening his white trap of an old woman 's mouth said , " I 've thought so all along . " When Eleanor stepped out on Randolph one sunny afternoon with her first week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had such a sharp little smile on her thin lips that a couple of people turned to look at her as she walked along ducking her head into the gusty wind to keep her hat from being blown off . She turned down Michigan Avenue towards the Auditorium looking at the bright shop windows and the verypale blue sky and the piles of dovegray fluffy clouds over the lake and the white blobs of steam from the locomotives . She went into the deep amberlit lobby of the Auditorium Annex , sat down all by herself at a wicker table in the corner of the lounge and sat there a long while all by herself drinking a cup of tea and eating buttered toast , ordering the waiter about with a crisp little refined monied voice . Then she went to Moody House , packed her things and moved to the Eleanor Club , where she got a room for seven-fifty with board . But the room was n't much better and everything still had the gray smell of a charitable institution , so the next week she moved again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got room and board for fifteen a week . As that only left her a balance of three-fifty  --  it had turned out that the job only paid twenty , which actually only meant eighteen-fifty when insurance was taken off  --  she had to go to see her father again . She so impressed him with her rise in the world and the chances of a raise that he promised her five a week , although he was only making twenty himself and was planning to marry again , to a Mrs. O'Toole , a widow with five children who kept a boardinghouseout Elsdon way . Eleanor refused to go to see her future stepmother , and made her father promise to send her the money in a moneyorder each week , as he could n't expect her to go all the way out to Elsdon to get it . When she left him she kissed him on the forehead and made him feel quite happy . All the time she was telling herself that this was the very last time . Then she went back to the Hotel Ivanhoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the comfortable brass bed looking round at her little room with its white woodwork and its pale yellow wallpaper with darker satiny stripes and the lace curtains in the window and the heavy hangings . There was a crack in the plaster of the ceiling and the carpet was worn , but the hotel was very refined , she could see that , full of old couples living on small incomes and the help were very elderlyand polite and she felt at home for the first time in her life . When Eveline Hutchins came back from Europe the next Spring wearing a broad hat with a plume on it , full of talk of the Salon des Tuileries and the Rue de la Paix and museums and art exhibitions and the opera , she found Eleanor a changed girl . She looked older than she was , dressed quietly and fashionably , had a new bitter sharp way of talking . She was thoroughly established in the interior decorating department at Marshall Field 's and expected a raise any day , but she would n't talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Art Institute and spent a great deal of time with an old maiden lady who also lived at the Ivanhoe who was reputed to be very rich and very stingy , a Miss Eliza Perkins . The first Sunday she was back Eleanor had Eveline to tea at the hoteland they sat in the stuffy lounge talking in refined whispers with the old lady . Eveline asked about Eric and Maurice , and Eleanor supposedthat they were all right , but had n't seen them much since Eric had lost his job at Marshall Field 's . He was n't turning out so well as she had hoped , she said . He and Maurice had taken to drinking a great deal and going round with questionable companions , and Eleanorrarely got a chance to see them . She had dinner every evening with Miss Perkins and Miss Perkins thought a great deal of her and bought her clothes and took her with her driving in the park and sometimes to the theater when there was something really worth while on , Minnie Maddern Fiske or Guy Bates Post in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy saloon keeper and had been played false in her youth by a young lawyer whom she had trusted to invest some money for her and whom she had fallen in love with . He had run away with another girl and a number of cash certificates . Just how much she had left Eleanor had n't been able to find out , but as she always took the best seats at the theater and liked going to dinner at expensive hotels and restaurants and hired a carriageby the half day whenever she wanted one , she gathered that she must still be well off . P 179After they had left Miss Perkins to go to the Hutchinses for supper , Eveline said : " Well , I declare  --  I do n't see what you see in that .. . that little old maid . . . And here I was just bursting to tell you a millionthings and to ask you a million questions . . . I think it was mean of you . " " I 'm very devoted to her , Eveline . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . " " Oh , of course I am , dear , but , gracious , I ca n't make you out . " " Well , you wo n't have to see her again , though I could tell by her manner that she thought you were lovely . " Walking from the Elevated station to the Hutchinses it was more like old times again . Eleanor told about the hard feelings that were growing between Mr. Spotmann and Mrs. Potter and how they both wanted her to be on their side , and made Eveline laugh , and Eveline confessed that on the Kroonland coming back she had fallen very much in love with a man from Salt Lake City , such a relief after all those foreigners , and Eleanor teased her about it and said he was probably a Mormon and Eveline laughed and said , No , he was a judge , and admitted that he was married already . " You see , " said Eleanor , " of course he 's a Mormon . " But Eveline said that she knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd marry him in a minute . Then Eleanor said she did n't believe in divorce and if they had n't gottento the door they would have started quarrelling . That winter she did n't see much of Eveline . Eveline had many beaux and went out a great deal to parties and Eleanor used to read about her on the society page Sunday mornings . She was very busy and often too tired at night even to go to the theater with Miss Perkins . The row between Mrs. Potter and Mr. Spotmann had come to a head and the management had moved Mrs. Potter to another departmentand she had let herself plunk into an old Spanish chair and had broken down and cried right in front of the customers and Eleanorhad had to take her to the dressing room and borrow smellingsalts for her and help her do up her peroxide hair into the big pompadour again and consoled her by saying that she would probablylike it much better over in the other building anyway . After that Mr. Spotmann was very goodnatured for several months . He occasionallytook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little joke that they laughed about together about Mrs. Potter 's pompadour wobbling when she 'd cried in front of the customers . He sent EleanorP 180out on many little errands to wealthy homes , and the customers liked her because she was so refined and sympathetic and the other employeesin the department hated her and nicknamed her " teacher 's pet . " Mr. Spotmann even said that he 'd try to get her a percentage on commissions and talked often about giving her that raise to twentyfivea week . Then one day Eleanor got home late to supper and the old clerk at the hotel told her that Miss Perkins had been stricken with heartfailure while eating steak and kidney pie for lunch and had died right in the hotel dining room and that the body had been removed to the Irving Funeral Chapel and asked her if she knew any of her relativesthat should be notified . Eleanor knew nothing except that her financial business was handled by the Corn Exchange Bank and that she thought that she had nieces in Mound City , but did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay for the removalof the body and the doctor and a week 's unpaid hotel bill and said that all her things would be held under seal until some qualified person appeared to claim them . He seemed to think Miss Perkins had died especially to spite the hotel management . Eleanor went up to her room and locked the door and threw herself on the bed and cried a little , because she 'd been fond of Miss Perkins . Then a thought crept into her mind that made her heart beat fast . Suppose Miss Perkins had left her a fortune in her will . Things like that happened . Young men who opened church pews , coachman who picked up a handbag ; old ladies were always leaving their fortunes to people like that . She could see it in headlines MARSHALL FIELD EMPLOYEE INHERITSMILLION . She could n't sleep all night and in the morning she found the managerof the hotel and offered to do anything she could . She called up Mr. Spotmann and coaxed him to give her the day off , explaining that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called up the Corn Exchange Bank and talked to a Mr. Smith who had been in charge of the Perkins estate . He assured her that the bank would do everything in its power to protect the heirs and the residuary legatees and said that the will was in Miss Perkins 's safe deposit box and that he was sure everything was in proper legal form . Eleanor had nothing to do all day , so she got hold of Eveline forp 181lunch and afterwards they went to Keith 's together . She felt it was n't just proper to go to the theater with her old friend still lying at the undertaker 's , but she was so nervous and hysterical she had to do something to take her mind off this horrible shock . Eveline was very sympathetic and they felt closer than they had since the Hutchinses had gone abroad . Eleanor did n't say anything about her hopes . At the funeral there were only Eleanor and the Irish chambermaid at the hotel , an old woman who sniffled and crossed herself a great deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mound City relatives . Eleanor wore black and the undertaker came up to her and said , " Excuse me , miss , but I ca n't refrain from remarkinghow lovely you look , just like a Bermuda lily . " It was n't as bad as she had expected and afterwards Eleanor and Mr. Smith and Mr. Sullivan , the representative of the law firm who had charge of the interests of the relatives , were quite jolly together coming out of the crematorium . It was a sparkling October day and everybody agreed that October was the best month in the year and that the minister had read the funeralservice very beautifully . Mr. Smith asked Eleanor would n't she eat lunch with them as she was mentioned in the will , and Eleanor 's heart almost stopped beating and she cast down her eyes and said she 'd be very pleased . They all got into a taxi . Mr. Sullivan said it was pleasant to roll away from the funeral chapel and such gloomy thoughts . They went to lunch at de Yonghe 's and Eleanor made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel and what a scurry everybody had been in , but when they handed her the menu said that she could n't eat a thing . Still when she saw the planked whitefish she said that she 'd take just a little to pick to pieces on her plate . It turned out that the windy October air had made them all hungry and the long ride in the taxi . Eleanor enjoyed her lunch very much and after the whitefish she ate a little Waldorf salad and then a peach melba . The gentlemen asked her whether she would mind if they smoked cigars and Mr. Smith put on a rakish look and said would she have a cigarette and she blushed and said no , she never smoked and Mr. Sullivan said he 'd never respect a woman who smoked and Mr. Smith said some of the girls of the best families in Chicago smoked and as for himself he did n't see the harm in it if they did n't make chimneys of themselves . After lunch they walked across the street and went upp 182in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in big leather chairs and Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Smith put on solemn faces and Mr. Smith cleared his throat and began to read the will . Eleanor could n't make it out at first and Mr. Smith had to explain to her that the bulk of the fortune of three million dollars was left to the FlorenceCrittenton home for wayward girls , but that the sum of one thousand dollars each was to the three nieces in Mound City and that a handsome diamond brooch in the form of a locomotive was left to Eleanor Stoddard and , " If you call at the Corn Exchange Bank some time tomorrow , Miss Stoddard , " said Mr. Smith , " I shall be very glad to deliver it to you . " Eleanor burst out crying . They both were very sympathetic and so touched that Miss Stoddard should be so touched by the remembrance of her old friend . As she left the office , promising to call for the brooch tomorrow , Mr. Sullivan was just saying in the friendliest voice , " Mr. Smith , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interests of the Mound City Perkinses , " and Mr. Smith said in the friendliestvoice , " I suppose so , Mr. Sullivan , but I do n't see that you can get very far with it . It 's an ironclad , copper-riveted document if I do say so as should n't , because I drew it up myself . " So next day at eight Eleanor was on her way down to Marshall Field 's again and there she stayed for several years . She got the raise and the percentages on commissions and she and Mr. Spotmann got to be quite thick , but he never tried to make love to her and their relations were always formal ; that was a relief to Eleanor because she kept hearing stories about floorwalkers and department heads forcingtheir attentions on the young girl employees and Mr. Elwood of the furniture department had been discharged for that very reason , when it came out that little Lizzie Dukes was going to have a baby , but perhaps that had n't been all Mr. Elwood 's fault as Lizzie Dukes did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ; anyway it seemed to Eleanor as if she 'd spend the rest of her life furnishing other people 's new drawingrooms and dining rooms , matching curtains and samplesof upholstery and wallpaper , smoothing down indignant women customers who 'd been sent an oriental china dog instead of an inlaid teak teatable or who even after they 'd chosen it themselves were n't satisfied with the pattern on that cretonne . She found Eveline Hutchins waiting for her one evening when thep183store closed . Eveline was n't crying but was deathly pale . She said she had n't had anything to eat for two days and would n't Eleanor have some tea with her over at the Sherman House or anywhere . They went to the Auditorium Annex and sat in the lounge and orderedtea and cinnamon toast and then Eveline told her that she 'd broken off her engagement with Dirk McArthur and that she 'd decidednot to kill herself but to go to work . " I 'll never fall in love with anybody again , that 's all , but I 've got to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , Eleanor ; you know you never get a chance to show what you can do ; you 're just wasting your ability . " Eleanor said that she hated it like poison but what was she to do ? " Why not do what we 've been talking about all these years . . . Oh , people make me so mad , they never will have any nerve or do anythingthat 's fun or interesting . . . I bet you if we started a decorating business we 'd have lots of orders . Sally Emerson 'll give us her new house to decorate and then everybody else 'll just have to have us to be in the swim ... I do n't think people really want to live in the horrible stuffy places they live in ; it 's just that they do n't know any better ? ' Eleanor lifted her teacup and drank several little sips . She looked at her little white carefully manicured hand with pointed nails holding the teacup . Then she said , " But where 'd we get the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start on . " " Dad 'll let us have something , I think , and maybe Sally Emerson might ; she 's an awfully good sport and then our first commission 'll launch us . . . Oh , do come on , Eleanor ; it 'll be such fun " " Hutchins and Stoddard , Interior Decorating , " ' said Eleanor , puttingdown her teacup , " or maybe Miss Hutchins and Miss Stoddard ' ; why , my dear , I think it 's a grand idea ! " " Do n't you think just Eleanor Stoddard and Eveline Hutchins ' would be better ? " " Oh , well , we can decide on the name when we hire a studio and have put it in the telephone book . Why do n't we put it this way , Eveline dear . . . if you can get your friend Mrs. Emerson to give us the decorating of her new house , we 'll go in for it , if not we 'll wait until we have a genuine order to start off on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll run right out and see her now . " Eveline had a high color now . She got to her feet and leaned over Eleanor and kissed her . " Oh , Eleanor , you 're a darling . " " Wait a minute , we have n't paid for our tea , " said Eleanor.  |p184The  next month the office was unbearable , and the customers ' complaints and leaving the Ivanhoe in a hurry every morning and being polite to Mr. Spotmann and thinking up little jokes to make him laugh . Her room at the Ivanhoe seemed small and sordid and the smell of cooking that came up through the window and the greasesmell of the old elevator . Several days she called up that she was sick and then found that she could n't stay in her room and roamed about the city going to shops and moving pictureshows and then gettingsuddenly dead tired and having to come home in a taxi that she could n't afford . She even went back to the Art Institute once in a while , but she knew all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them any more . Then at last Eveline got Mrs. Philip Paine Emerson to feeling that her new house could n't do without a novel note in the diningroom and they got her up an estimate much less than any of the established decorators was asking , and Eleanor had the pleasure of watching Mr. Spotmann 's astonished face when she refused to stay even with a raise to forty a week and said that she had a commission with a friend to decorate the new Paine Emerson mansionin Lake Forest . " Well , my dear , " said Mr. Spotmann , snapping his square white mouth , " if you want to commit suicide of your career I wo n't be the one to stop you . You can leave right this minute if you want to . Of course you forfeit the Christmas bonus ? ' Eleanor 's heart beat fast . She looked at the gray light that came through the office , and the yellow cardcatalogue case and the letters on a file and the little samples danglingfrom them . In the outer office Ella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . Eleanor sniffed the lifeless air that smelt of chintz and furniturevarnish and steamheat and people'sbreath and then she said , " All right , Mr. Spotmann , I will . " It took her all day to get her pay and to collect the insurance money due her and she had a long wrangle with a cashier about the amount , so that it was late afternoon before she stepped out into the driving snow of the streets and went into a drugstore to call up Eveline . Eveline had already rented two floors of an old Victorian house off Chicago Avenue , and they were busy all winter decorating the office and showrooms downstairs and the apartment upstairs where they were going to live , and doing Sally Emerson 's diningroom . They got a colored maid named Amelia who was a very good cook although she drank a little , and they had cigarettes and cocktails at the end of thep185afternoon and little dinners with wine , and found a downattheheels French dressmaker to make them evening gowns to wear when they went out with Sally Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know a lot of really interesting people . By Spring when they finally got a check for five hundred dollars out of Philip Paine Emerson they were a thousand dollars in the hole , but they were living the way they liked . The diningroom was considered a little extreme , but some peopleliked it , and a few more orders came . They made many friends and started going round with artists again and with special writers on The Daily News and The American who took them out to dinner in foreign restaurants that were very smoky and where they talked a great deal about modern French painting and the Middle West and going to New York . They went to the Armory Show and had a photograph of Brancusi 's Golden Bird over the desk in the office and copies of the Little Review and Poetry among the files of letters from clients and unpaid bills from wholesalers . Eleanor went out a great deal with Tom Custis who was an elderly redfaced man , fond of music and chorusgirls and drinking , who belonged to all the clubs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a box at the opera and a Stevens-Duryea and nothing to do except go to tailors and visit specialists and occasionally blackballa Jew or a newcomer applying for membership in some club he belonged to . The Armours had bought out his father 's meatpacking concern when he was still a college athlete and he had n't done a stroke of work since . He claimed to be thoroughly sick of social life and enjoyed taking an interest in the girls ' decorating business . He kept in close touch with Wall Street and would occasionally turn over to Eleanor a couple of shares that he was trading in . If they rose it was her gain , if they fell it was his loss . He had a wife in a private sanitariumand he and Eleanor decided they 'd be just friends . Sometimes he was a little too affectionate coming home in a taxicab in the evening , but Eleanor would scold him and he 'd be very contrite the next day , and send her great boxes of white flowers . Eveline had several beaux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never had any money and ate and drank everything in the house when they came to dinner . One of them , Freddy Seargeant , was an actor and producer temporarily stranded in Chicago . He had friends in the Shubert office and his great ambition was to put on a pantomime like Reinhardt 's Sumurun , only based on Maya Indianp 186stories . He had a lot of photographs of Maya ruins , and Eleanor and Eveline began to design costumes for it and settings . They hoped to get Tom Custis or the Paine Emersons to put up money for a productionin Chicago . The main trouble was with the music . A young pianist whom Tom Custis had sent to Paris to study began to write it and came and played it one night . They had quite a party for him . Sally Emerson came and a lot of fashionable people , but Tom Custis drank too many cocktails to be able to hear a note and Amelia the cook got drunk and spoiled the dinner and Eveline told the young pianist that his music sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When everybody had gone Freddy Seargeant and Eveline and Eleanor roamed around the ravaged apartment feeling very bad indeed . Freddy Seargeant twisted his black hair , slightly splotched with gray , in his long hands and said he was going to kill himself , and Eleanor and Eveline quarrelledviolently . " But it did sound like movingpicture music and , after all , why should n't it ? " Eveline kept saying . Then Freddy Seargeant got his hat and went out saying , " You women are making life a hell for me , " and Eveline burst out crying and got hysterical and Eleanor had to send for a doctor . The next day they scraped up fifty dollars to send Freddy back to New York , and Eveline went back to live at the house on Drexel Boulevard , leaving Eleanor to carry on the decorating business all alone . Next Spring Eleanor and Eveline sold for five hundred some chandeliersthat they had picked up in a junk shop on the west side for twentyfive dollars and were just writing out checks for their more pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRODUCTION RETURN OF THE NATIVE WILL YOU DO SCENERY COSTUMES HUNDREDFIFTY A WEEK EACH MUST COME ON NEW YORK IMMEDIATELYMUST HAVE YOU WIRE IMMEDIATELY HOTEL DES ARTISTES CENTRAL PARK SOUTH FREDDY " Eleanor , we 've got to do it , " said Eveline , taking a cigarette out of her handbag and walking round the room puffing at it furiously . " It 'll be a rush , but let 's make the Twentieth Century this afternoon . " " It 's about noon now , " said Eleanor in a trembly voice . Without answeringEveline went to the phone and called up the Pullman office. p 187That evening they sat in their section looking out of the window at the steelworks of Indiana Harbor , the big cement works belching puttycolored smoke , the flaring furnaces of Gary disappearing in smokeswirling winter dusk .

He dug himself a fortune out of guano , became a power on the West Coast , juggled figures , railroads , armies , the politics of the local caciques and politicos ; they were all chips in a huge pokergame . Behind a big hand he heaped up the dollars . He financed the unbelievable Andean railroads . ) When Tomas Guardia got to be dictator of Costa Rica he wrote to Don Enrique to build him a railroad ; Meiggs was busy in the Andes , a $75,000 contract was hardly worth his while , so he sent for his nephew Minor Keith . They did n't let grass grow under their feet in that family : at sixteen Minor Keith had been on his own , selling collars and ties in a clothingstore . After that he was a lumber surveyor and ran a lumber business.  |p191When  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Minor down to make money out of it . Minor Keith started raising cattle on Padre Island and seining for fish , but cattle and fish did n't turn over money fast enoughso he bought hogs and chopped up the steers and boiled themeat and fed it to the hogs and chopped up the fish and fed it to thehogs , but hogs did n't turn over money fast enough , so he was glad to be off to Limon . Limon was one of the worst pestholes on the Caribbean , even the Indians died there of malaria , yellow jack , dysentery . Keith went back up to New Orleans on the steamer John G. Meiggs to hire workers to build the railroad . He offered a dollar a day and grub and hired seven hundred men . Some of them had been down before in the filibustering days of William Walker . Of that bunch about twentyfive came out alive . The rest left their whiskyscalded carcases to rot in the swamps . On another load he shipped down fifteen hundred ; they all died to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hole ; the railroad had nothing to haul . Keith made them plant bananas so that the railroad might have something to haul , to market the bananas he had to go into the shippingbusiness ; this was the beginning of the Caribbean fruittrade . All the while the workers died of whisky , malaria , yellow jack , dysentery . Minor Keith 's three brothers died . Minor Keith did n't die . He built railroads , opened retail stores up and down the coast in Bluefields , Belize , Limon , bought and sold rubber , vanilla , tortoise/shell , sarsaparilla , anything he could buy cheap he bought , anything he could sell dear he sold . In 1898 in cooperation with the Boston Fruit Company he formed the United Fruit Company that has since become one of the most powerful industrial units in the world . In 1912 he incorporated the International Railroads of Central America ; all of it built out of bananas ; in Europe and the United States people had started to eat ba-nanas , so they cut down the jungles through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul the bananas , and every year more steamboats of the Great White Fleet steamed north loaded with bananas , and that is the history of the American empire in the Caribbean , and the Panama canal and the future Nicaragua canal and the marines and the battleships and the bayonets . Why that uneasy look under the eyes , in the picture of Minor C. Keith the pioneer of the fruit trade , the railroad builder , in all the picturesthe newspapers carried of him when he died ?

Ward MoorehouseIn Pittsburgh Ward Moorehouse got a job as a reporter on The Times Dispatch and spent six months writing up Italian weddings , localconventions of Elks , obscure deaths , murders and suicides among Lithuanians , Albanians , Croats , Poles , the difficulties over naturalizationpapers of Greek restaurant keepers , dinners of the Sons of Italy . He lived in a big red frame house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mrs. Cook , a crotchety old woman from Belfast who had been forced to take lodgers since her husband , who had been a foreman in one of the Homestead mills , had been crushed by a crane dropping a load of pigiron over him . She made Ward his breakfasts and his Sunday dinners and stood over him while he was eating them alone in the stuffy furniture-crowded diningroom telling him about her youth in the north of Ireland and the treachery of papists and the virtues of the defunct Mr. Cook . It was a bad time for Ward . He had no friends in Pittsburgh and he had colds and sore throats all through the cold grimy sleety winter . He hated the newspaper office and the inclines and the overcast skies and the breakneck wooden stairs he was always scrambling up and down , and the smell of poverty and cabbage and children and washingin the rattletrap tenements where he was always seeking out Mrs. Piretti whose husband had been killed in a rumpus in a saloon on LocustStreet or Sam Burkovich who 'd been elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sudsy hands whose child had been slashed by a degenerate . He never got home to thep194house before three or four in the morning and by the time he had breakfasted round noon there never seemed to be any time to do anything before he had to call up the office for assignments again . When he had first gotten to Pittsburgh he had called to see Mr. McGill , whom he 'd met with Jarvis Oppenheimer in Paris . Mr. McGill rememberedhim and took down his address and told him to keep in touch because he hoped to find an opening for him in the new informationbureau that was being organized by the Chamber of Commerce , but the weeks went by and he got no word from Mr. McGill . He got an occasional dry note from Annabelle Marie about legal technicalities ; she would divorce him charging nonsupport , desertion and cruelty . All he had to do was to refuse to go to Philadelphia when the papers were served on him . The perfume on the blue notepaper raised a faint rancor of desire for women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his career . The worst time was his weekly day off . Often he 'd stay all day sprawled on the bed , too depressed to go out into the black slush of the streets . He sent to correspondence schools for courses in journalismand advertising and even for a course in the care of fruit trees on the impulse to throw up everything and go West and get a job on a ranch or something ; but he felt too listless to follow them and the littlebooklets accumulated week by week on the table in his room . Nothing seemed to be leading anywhere . He 'd go over and over again his whole course of action since he 'd left Wilmington that day on the train to go down to Ocean City . He must have made a mistake somewherebut he could n't see where . He took to playing solitaire , but he could n't even keep his mind on that . He 'd forget the cards and sit at the table with a gingerbread-colored velveteen cloth on it , looking past the pot of dusty artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink bow off a candybox , down into the broad street where trolleycars went by continually scraping round the curve and where the arclights coming on in the midafternoon murk shimmereda little in the black ice of the gutters . He thought a lot about the old days at Wilmington and Marie O'Higgins and his piano lessonsand fishing in an old skiff along the Delaware when he 'd been a kid ; he 'd get so nervous that he 'd have to go out and would go and drink a hot chocolate at the sodafountain on the next corner and then go down town to a cheap movie or vaudeville show . He took toP195smoking three stogies a day , one after each meal . It gave him somethinghe could vaguely look forward to . He called once or twice to see Mr. McGill at his office in the Frick Building . Each time he was away on a business trip . He 'd have a little chat with the girl at the desk while waiting and then go away reluctantly , saying , " Oh , yes , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He must have forgotten the appointment , " to cover his embarrassment when he had to go away . He was loath to leave the brightly lit office anteroom , with its great shiny mahogany chairs with lions ' heads on the arms and the tables with lions ' claws for feet and the chirrup of typewriters from behind partitions , and telephone bells ringing and welldressed clerks and executives bustling in and out . Down at the newspaper office it was noisy with clanging presses and smelt sour of printer 's ink and moist rolls of paper and sweating copyboys running round in green eyeshades . And not to know any really nice people , never to get an assignment that was n't connected with working peopleor foreigners or criminals ; he hated it . One day in the Spring he went to the Schenley to interview a visitingtravel lecturer . He felt good about it as he hoped to wheedle a bylineout of the city editor . He was picking his way through the lobby crowded by the arrival of a state convention of Kiwanians when he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. McGill in a casual tone as if he 'd been seeing him all along , " I 'm glad I ran into you . Those fools at the office mislaid your address . Have you a minute to spare ? " " Yes , indeed , Mr. McGill , " said Ward . " I have an appointment to see a man but he can wait . " " Never make a man wait if you have an appointment with him , " said Mr. McGill . " Well , this is n't a business appointment , " said Ward , looking up into Mr. McGill 's face with his boyish blue-eyed smile . " He wo n't mind waiting a minute . " They went into the writing room and sat down on a tapestried sofa . Mr. McGill explained that he had just been appointed temporarygeneral manager to reorganize the Bessemer Metallic Furnishingsand Products Company that handled a big line of byproducts of the Homestead Mills . He was looking for an ambitious and energetic man to handle the advertising and promotion . " I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think you 're the man . " Ward looked at the floor . " Of course that would mean giving up my present work . " " What 's that ? " " Newspaper work . " " Oh , dropp196that ; there 's no future in that . . . We 'd have to make someone else nominal advertising manager for reasons we wo n't go into now .. . but you 'll be the actual executive . What kind of a salary would you expect ? " Ward looked Mr. McGill in the eyes , the blood stopped in his ears while he heard his own voice saying casually : " How about a hundred a week ? " Mr. McGill stroked his moustache and smiled . " Well , we 'll thrash that out later , " he said , getting to his feet . " I think I can advise you strongly to give up your present work ... I 'll call up Mr. Bateman about it . . . so that he 'll understand why we 're taking you away from him . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your resigningsuddenly . . . never want hard feelings . . . Come down and see me tomorrow at ten . You know the office in the Frick Building . " " I think I 've got some valuable ideas about advertising , Mr. McGill . It 's the work I 'm most interested in doing , " said Ward . Mr. McGill was n't looking at him any more . He nodded and went off . Ward went on up to interview his lecturer , afraid to let himself feel too jubilantyet . The next day was his last in a newspaper office . He accepted a salaryof seventyfive with a promise of a raise as soon as returns warrantedit , took a room and bath at the Schenley , had an office of his own in the Frick Building where he sat at a desk with a young man named Oliver Taylor who was a nephew of one of the directors who was being worked up through the organization . Oliver Taylor was a firstrate tennis player and belonged to all the clubs and was only too glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Moorehouse had been abroad and had had his clothes made in Englandhe put him up at the Sewickley Country Club and took him out with him for drinks after officehours . Little by little Moorehouse got to know people and to be invited out as an eligible bachelor . He started to play golf with an instructor on a small course over in Alleghenywhere he hoped nobody he knew would go . When he could play a fair game he went over to Sewickley to try it out . One Sunday afternoon Oliver Taylor went with him and pointed out all the big executives of the steel mills and the mining properties and the oil industry out on the links on a Sunday afternoon , making ribald remarks about each one that Ward tittered at a little bit , but that seemed to him in very bad taste . It was a sunny May afternoonp 197and he could smell locustblossoms on the breeze off the fat lands along the Ohio , and there were the sharp whang of the golfballs and the flutter of bright dresses on the lawn round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the safe talk of business men coming on the sunny breeze that still had a little scorch of furnacesmoke in it . It was hard to keep the men he was introduced to from seeing how good he felt . The rest of the time he did nothing but work . He got his stenographer , Miss Rodgers , a plainfaced spinster who knew the metal productsbusiness inside out from having worked fifteen years in Pittsburghoffices , to get him books on the industry that he read at his hotel in the evenings , so that at executive conferences he astonished them by his knowledge of the processes and products of the industry . His mind was full of augerbits , canthooks , mauls , sashweights , axes , hatchets , monkeywrenches ; sometimes in the lunch hour he 'd stop in to a hardware store on the pretext of buying a few brads or tacks and talk to the storekeeper . He read Crowds Jr and various books on psychology , tried to imagine himself a hardware merchant or the executiveof Hammacher Schlemmer or some other big hardware house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory would be appealing to him . Shaving while his bath was running in the morning he would see long processions of andirons , grates , furnace fittings , pumps , sausagegrinders , drills , calipers , vises , casters , drawerpulls pass between his face and the mirror and wonder how they could be made attractive to the retail trade . He was shaving himself with a Gillette ; why was he shaving with a Gillette instead of some other kind of razor ? " Bessemer " was a good name , smelt of money and mighty rolling mills and great executives stepping out of limousines . The thing to do was to interest the hardware buyer , to make him feel a part of something mighty and strong , he would think as he picked out a necktie . " Bessemer , " he 'd say to himself as he ate breakfast . Why should our cotterpins appeal more than any other cotterpins , he 'd ask himself as he stepped on the streetcar . Jolting in the straphanging crowd on the way downtown , staring at the headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ironcouplings and malleable elbows and unions and bushings and nipples and pipecaps would jostle in his head . " Bessemer . " When he asked for a raise he got it , to $125 . At a country club dance he met a blond girl who danced very well.  |p198Her  name was Gertrude Staple and she was the only daughter of old Horace Staple who was director of several corporations , and was reputedto own a big slice of Standard Oil stock . Gertrude was engaged to Oliver Taylor , though they did nothing but quarrel when they were together , so she confided to Ward while they were sitting out a dance . Ward 's dress suit fitted well and he looked much younger than most of the men at the dance . Gertrude said that the men in Pittsburgh had no allure . Ward talked about Paris and she said that she was bored to tears and would rather live in Nome , Alaska , than in Pittsburgh . She was awfully pleased that he knew Paris and he talked about the Tour d'Argent and the Hotel Wagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't a car , because he noticed that she was making it easy for him to ask her to let him take her home . But next day he sent her some flowers with a little note in French that he thought would make her laugh . The next Saturday afternoon he went to an automobile school to take lessons in driving a car , and strolled past the Stutz sales agency to see what kind of terms he could get to buy a roadster on . One day Oliver Taylor came into the office with a funny smile on his face and said , " Ward , Gertrude 's got a crush on you . She ca n't talk about anything else . . . Go ahead ; I do n't give a damn . She 's too goddam much trouble for me to handle . She tires me out in a half an hour . " " It 's probably just because she does n't know me , " said Ward , blushinga little . " Too bad her old man wo n't let her marry anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it , though . " " I have n't got the time for that stuff , " said Ward . " It do n't leave me time for anything else , " said Taylor . " Well , so long . . . You hold down the fort ; I 've got a luncheon date with a swell girl . . . she 's a warm baby an ' she 's dancing in the Red Mill , ' first row , third from the left . " He winked , and slapped Ward on the back and went off . The next time that Ward went to call at the big house of the Staples that lay back from the trees he went in a red Stutz roadster that he 'd taken out on trial . He handled it well enough , although he turned in too quickly at the drive and slaughtered some tulips in a flowerbed . Gertrude saw him from the library window and kidded him about it . He said he was a rotten driver , always had been and always would be . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an appletreeP199back of the house and he wondered all the time he was talking to her whether he ought to tell her about his divorce . He told her about his unhappy life with Annabelle Strang . She was very sympathetic . She knew of Dr. Strang . " And I was hoping you were just an adventurer ... from plowboy to president , you know . . . that sort of thing . " " But I am , " he said and they both laughed and he could see that she was really crazy about him . That night they met at a dance and walked down to the end of the conservatory where it was very steamy among the orchids , and he kissed her and told her that she looked like a pale yellow orchid . After that they always sneaked off whenever they got a chance . She had a way of going limp suddenly in his arms under his kisses that made him sure that she loved him . But when he got home after those eveningshe 'd be too nervous and excited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting a woman to sleep with , and cursing himself out . Often he 'd take a cold bath and tell himself he must attend to business and not worry about those things or let a girl get under his skin that way . The streets in the lower part of town were full of prostitutes , but he was afraid of catching a disease or being blackmailed . Then one night after a party Taylor took him to a house that he said was thoroughly reliable where he met a pretty dark Polish girl who could n't have been more than eighteen , but he did n't go there very often as it cost fifty dollars , and he was always nervous when he was in the place for fear there 'd be a police raid and he 'd have blackmailto pay . One Sunday afternoon Gertrude told him that her mother had scolded her for being seen about with him so much on account of his having a wife in Philadelphia . The notice of the decree had come the morning before . Ward was in high spirits and told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at the free organ recital in CarnegieInstitute , a good place to meet because nobody who was anybody ever went there . " Come over to the Schenley and I 'll show you the decree . " The music had started . She shook her head , but patted his hand that lay on the plush seat beside her knee . They went out in the middle of the number . The music got on their nerves . They stood talking a long while in the vestibule . Gertrude looked miserable and haggard . She said she was in wretched health and that her father and mother would never consent to her marrying a man who did n't have as much income as she did and she wished she was a poor stenographer orp 200telephone girl that could do as she liked and that she loved him very much and would always love him and thought she 'd take to drink or dope or something because life was just too terrible . Ward was very cold and kept his jaw set square and said that she could n't really care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the end and that if they met they 'd be good friends . He drove her out Highland Avenue in the Stutz that was n't paid for yet and showed her the house he 'd lived in when he first came to Pittsburgh and talked of going out West and starting an advertising business of his own and finally left her at a friend 's house in Highland Park where she 'd told her chauffeur to pick her up at six . He went back to the Schenley and had a cup of black coffee sent up to his room and felt very bitter and settled down to work on some copy he was getting out , saying , " To hell with the bitch ; " all the time under his breath . He did n't worry much about Gertrude in the months that followed because a strike came on at Homestead and there were strikers killed by the mine guards and certain writers from New York and Chicago who were sentimentalists began to take a good deal of space in the press with articles flaying the steel industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the progressives in Congress were making a howl , and it was rumored that people wanting to make politics out of it were calling for a congressional investigation . Mr. McGill and Ward had dinner together all alone at the Schenley to talk about the situation , and Ward said that what was necessary was an entirely new line in the publicity of the industry . It was the business of the industry to educate the public by carefully planned publicity extending over a term of years . Mr. McGill was very much impressed and said he 'd talk around at directors ' meetings about the feasibility of founding a joint information bureau for the entire industry . Ward said he felt he ought to be at the head of it , because he was just wastinghis time at the Bessemer Products ; that had all simmered down to a routine job that anybody could take care of . He talked of going to Chicago and starting an advertising agency of his own . Mr. McGill smiled and stroked his steelgray mustache and said , " Not so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet and on my honor you wo n't regret it , " and Ward said that he was willing , but here he 'd been in Pittsburgh five years and where was he getting ? The information bureau was founded , and Ward was put in chargeP201of the actual work at $10,000 a year and began to play stocks a little with his surplus money , but there were several men over him earning larger salaries who did n't do anything but get in his way , and he was very restless . He felt he ought to be married and have an establishmentof his own . He had many contacts in different branches of the casting and steel and oil industries , and felt he ought to entertain . Giving dinners at the Fort Pitt or the Schenley was expensive and somehow did n't seem solid . Then one morning he opened his newspaper to find that Horace Staple had died of angina pectoris the day before while going up in the elevator of the Carnegie Building , and that Gertrude and her mother were prostrated at their palatial residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , although it would make him late at the office , and wrote Gertrude a note : DEAREST GERTRUDE : In this terrible moment of grief , allow me to remind you that I think of you constantly . Let me know at once if I can be of any use to you in any way . In the valley of the shadow of death we must realize that the Great Giver to whom we owe all love and wealth and all affection around the jocund fireside is also the Grim Reaper .. . After staring at the words , chewing the end of the pen a minute , he decided that it was a bit thick about the Grim Reaper and copied the note out again leaving out the last sentence , signed it " Your Devoted Ward , " and sent it out to Sewickley by special messenger . At noon he was just leaving for lunch when the office boy told him there was a lady on his phone . It was Gertrude . Her voice was trembly but she did n't seem too terribly upset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night somewhere where they would n't be seen because the house and everything gave her the creeps and that she 'd go mad if she heard any more condolences . He told her to meet him in the lobby of the Fort Pitt and he 'd run her out to some little place where they could be quiet and talk . That evening there was an icy driving wind . The sky had been leaden all day with inky clouds driving out of the northwest . She was so muffled up in furs that he did n't recognize her when she came into the lobby . She held out her hand to him and said , " Let 's get out of here , " as soon as she came up to him . He said he knew a littlep 202roadhouse on the way to McKeesport but thought the drive would be too cold for her in his open roadster . She said , " Let 's go ; do let 's . . . I love a blizzard . " When she got into the car she said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ward ? " and he said , " God , Gertrude , I am ; but are you glad to see me ? " And then she said , " Do n't I look glad ? " Then he started to mumble something about her father , but she said , " Please let 's not talk about that . " The wind was howling behind them all the way up the Monongahelavalley , with occasional lashing flurries of snow . Tipples and bessemer furnaces and tall ranks of chimneys stood out inky black against a low woolly sky that caught all the glare of flaming metal and red slag and the white of arcs and of locomotive headlights . At one crossing they almost ran into a train of coalcars . Her hand tightened on his arm when the car skidded as he put on the brakes . " That was a narrow squeak , " he said through clenched teeth . " I do n't care . I do n't care about anything tonight , " she said . He had to get out to crank the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right if we do n't freeze to death , " he said . When he 'd clambered back into the car she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek . " Do you still want to marry me ? I love you , Ward . " The motor raced as he turned and kissed her hard on the mouth the way he 'd kissed Annabelle that day in the cottage at Ocean City . " Of course I do , dear , " he said . The roadhouse was kept by a French couple , and Ward talked French to them and ordered a chicken dinner and red wine and hot whisky toddies to warm them up while they were waiting . There was no one else in the roadhouse and he had a table placed right in front of the gaslogs at the end of a pink and yellow diningroom , dimly lit , a long ghostly series of empty tables and long windows blocked with snow . Through dinner he told Gertrude about his plans to form an agency of his own and said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could make it the biggest in the country , especially with this new unexploited angle of the relations between capital and labor . " Why , I 'll be able to help you a lot with capital and advice and all sorts of things , once we 're married , " she said , looking at him with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes . " Of course you can , Gertrude . " She drank a great deal during dinner and wanted more hot whiskiesafterwards , and he kissed her a great deal and ran his hand up herp 203leg . She did n't seem to care what she did and kissed him right in front of the roadhouse keeper . When they went out to get in the car to go home the wind was blowing sixty miles an hour and the snow had blotted out the road and Ward said it would be suicide to try to drive to Pittsburgh a night like that and the roadhouse keeper said that he had a room all ready for them and that monsieur et madame would be mad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their faces all the way . At that Gertrude had a moment of panic and said she 'd rather kill herself than stay . Then she suddenly crumpled up in Ward 's arms sobbing hysterically , " I want to stay , I want to stay , I love you so . " They called up the Staple house and talked to the nightnurse who said that Mrs. Staple was resting more easily , that she 'd been given an opiate and was sleeping quietly as a child , and Gertrude told her that when her mother woke to tell her she was spending the night with her friend Jane English and that she 'd be home as soon as the blizzard let them get a car on the road . Then she called up Jane English and told her that she was distracted with grief and had taken a room at the Fort Pitt to be alone . And if her mother called to tell her she was asleep . Then they called up the Fort Pitt and reserved a room in her name . Then they went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved her very much and she seemed to have done this sort of thing before because the first thing she said was : " We do n't want to make this a shotgun wedding , do we , darling ? " Six months later they were married , and Ward resigned his position with the information bureau . He 'd had a streak of luck on the Street and decided to take a year off for a honeymoon in Europe . It turned out that the Staple fortune was all left to Mrs. Staple in trust and that Gertrude would only have an annuity of fifteen thousand until her mother died , but they were planning to meet the old lady at Carlsbad and hoped to coax some capital out of her for the new advertising agency . They sailed in the bridal suite on the Deutschland to Plymouth and had a fine passage and Ward was only seasick one day .

Ward MoorehouseWhen Ward came back from his second honeymoon abroad he was thirtytwo , but he looked older . He had the capital and the connections and felt that the big moment had come . The war talk in July had decided him to cut short his trip . In London he 'd picked up a young man named Edgar Robbins who was in Europe for InternationalNews . Edgar Robbins drank too much and was a fool about the women , but Ward and Gertrude took him around with them everywhereand confided in each other that they wanted to straighten him out . Then one day Robbins took Ward aside and said that he had syphilis and would have to follow the straight and narrow . Ward thought the matter over a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was going to open as soon as he got home . They told Gertrude it was liver trouble and she scolded him like a child when he took a drink and on the boat back to America they felt he was completelydevoted to both of them . Ward did n't have to write any copy after that and could put in all his time organizing the business . Old Mrs. Staple had been induced to put fifty thousand dollars into the firm . Ward rented an office at 100 Fifth Avenue , fitted it up with Chineseporcelain vases and cloisonne ashtrays from Vantine 's and had a tigerskin rug in his private office . He served tea in the English style every afternoon and put himself in the telephone book as J. Wardp 210Moorehouse , Public Relations Counsel . While Robbins was drafting the literature to be sent out , Ward went to Pittsburgh and Chicago and Bethlehem and Philadelphia to reestablish contacts . In Philadelphia he was walking into the lobby of the Bellevue Stratford when he met Annabelle Marie . She greeted him amiably and said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dinner together , talking about old times . " You certainly have improved , " Annabelle Marie kept saying . Ward could see that she regrettedthe divorce a little but he felt he could n't say the same for her . The lines on her face had deepened and she did n't finish her sentences , and had a parrot screech to her voice . She was tremendously made up and he wondered if she took drugs . She was busy divorcing Beale who she said had turned homosexual on her . Ward said dryly that he had married again and was very happy . " Who would n't be with the Staple fortune back of them ? " she said . Her little air of ownership irritated Ward and he excused himself right after dinner , saying he had work to do . Annabelle looked at him through halfclosed eyes with her head to one side , said " I wish you luck , " and went up in the hotel elevator in a shrill cackle of laughter . Next day he took the Pennsylvania to Chicago , traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Morton , his English valet , went with him . He had his dinner in the drawing room with Miss Rosenthal , a sallowfaced girl , shrewd and plain , who he felt was devoted to his interests . She had been with him in Pittsburgh with BessemerProducts . When the coffee had been cleared away and Morton had poured them each out a swallow of brandy that Miss Rosenthal giggled over a great deal declaring it would go to her head , he started to dictate . The train rumbled and lurched and now and then he could smell coalsmoke and the hot steamygreasy body of the engine up ahead , hot shiny steel charging through the dark Appalachians . He had to talk loudly to be heard . The rumble of the train made the cords of his voice vibrate . He forgot everything in his own words .. . American industry like a steamengine , like a highpower locomotive on a great express train charging through the night of old individualisticmethods . . . . What does a steamengine require ? Cooperation , coordination of the inventor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these highpower products possible . . . Coordinationof capital , the storedup energy of the race in the form of credit intelligently directed . . . labor , the prosperous contented Americanp 211working man to whom the unprecedented possibilities of capital collectedin great corporations had given the full dinnerpail , cheap motortransport , insurance , short working hours . . . a measure of comfortand prosperity unequaled before or since in the tragic procession of recorded history or in the known regions of the habitable globe . But he had to stop dictating because he found he 'd lost his voice . He sent Miss Rosenthal to bed and went to bed himself , but he could n't sleep ; words , ideas , plans , stockquotations kept unrolling in endless tickertape in his head . Next afternoon at the LaSalle he had a call from Judge Bowie C. Planet . Ward sat waiting for him to come up , looking out at the very pale blue Lake Michigan sky . In his hand he had a little filing card on which was written : Planet , Bowie C . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small copper lead interests . . . . Anaconda ? unlucky oil speculator . . . member one-horse lawfirm Planet and Wilson , Springfield , Illinois . " All right , Miss Rosenthal , " he said when there was a knock at the door . She went off into the other room with the filing card . Morton opened the door to let in a roundfaced man with a black felt hat and a cigar . " Hello , judge , " Ward said , getting to his feet and holding out his hand . " How 's everything ? Wo n't you sit down ? " Judge Planet advanced slowly into the room . He had a curious rolling gait as if his feet hurt him . They shook hands , and Judge Planet found himself sittingfacing the steelbright light that came through the big windows back of Moorehouse 's desk . " Wo n't you have a cup of tea , sir ? " asked Morton , who advanced slowly with a tray glittering with silver teathings . The judge was so surprised that he let the long ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself he was sober drop off on his bulging vest . The judge 's face remained round and bland . It was the face of a mucker from which all the lines of muckerdom had been carefully massaged away . The judge found himself sipping a cup of lukewarm tea with milk in it . " Clears the head , judge , clears the head , " said Ward , whose cup was cooling untasted before him . Judge Planet puffed silently on his cigar  | " Well , sir , " he said , " I 'm very glad to see you . " At that moment Morton announced Mr. Barrow , a skinny man with popeyes and a big adamsapple above a stringy necktie . He had a nervous manner of speaking and smoked too many cigarettes . He had the look of being stained with nicotine all over , face , fingers , teeth yellow . On Ward 's desk there was another little filing card that read : Barrow , G. H. , labor connections , reformer type . Once sec . Bro. locomotive engineers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the card over . After he 'd shaken hands with Mr. Barrow , placed him facing the light and encumbered him with a cup of tea , he began to talk . " Capital and labor , " he began in a slow careful voice as if dictating , " as you must have noticed , gentlemen , in the course of your varied and useful careers , capital and labor , those two great forces of our nationallife neither of which can exist without the other are growing further and further apart ; any cursory glance at the newspapers will tell you that . Well , it has occurred to me that one reason for this unfortunatestate of affairs has been the lack of any private agency that might fairly present the situation to the public . The lack of properly distributed information is the cause of most of the misunderstandingsin this world . . . The great leaders of American capital , as you probably realize , Mr. Barrow , are firm believers in fairplay and democracyand are only too anxious to give the worker his share of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so in fairness to the public and the investor . After all , the public is the investor whom we all aim to serve . " " Sometimes , " said Mr. Barrow , " but hardly ... " " Perhaps you gentlemen would have a whisky and soda . " Morton stood sleekhaired between them with a tray on which were decanters , tall glasses full of ice and some open splits of Apollinaris . " I do n't mind if I do , " said Judge Planet . Morton padded out , leaving them each with a clinking glass . Outsidethe sky was beginning to glow with evening a little . The air was winecolored in the room . The glasses made things chattier . The judge chewed on the end of a fresh cigar . " Now , let 's see if I 'm getting you right , Mr. Moorehouse . You feel that with your connections with advertising and big business youp213want to open up a new field in the shape of an agency to peaceably and in a friendly fashion settle labor disputes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure that organized labor would cooperate in such a movement , " said G. H. Barrow , leaning forward on the edge of his chair . " If only they could be sure that . . . well , that ... " " That they were n't getting the wool pulled over their eyes , " said the judge , laughing . " Exactly . " " Well , gentlemen , I 'm going to put my cards right down on the table . The great motto upon which I have built up my business has always been cooperation . " " I certainly agree with you there , " said the judge , laughing again and slapping his knee . " The difficult question is how to bring about that happy state . " " Well , the first step is to establish contact . . . Right at this moment under our very eyes we see friendly contact being established . " " I must admit , " said G. H. Barrow with an uneasy laugh , " I never expected to be drinking a highball with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The judge slapped his fat thigh . " You mean on account of the Coloradotrouble ... ? You need n't be afraid . I wo n't eat you , Mr. Barrow ... But , frankly , Mr. Moorehouse , this does n't seem to me to be just the time to launch your little project . " " This war in Europe . . . " began G. H. Barrow . " Is America 's great opportunity . . . You know the proverb about when thieves fall out . . . Just at present I admit we find ourselves in a moment of doubt and despair , but as soon as American business recoversfrom the first shock and begins to pull itself together ... Why , gentlemen , I just came back from Europe ; my wife and I sailed the day Great Britain declared war . . . I can tell you it was a narrow squeak ... Of one thing I can assure you with comparative certainty , whoever wins , Europe will be economically ruined . This war is America'sgreat opportunity . The very fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who will be benefited outside of the munitionsmakers , " said G. H. Barrow . Ward talked a long time , and then looked at his watch , that lay on the desk before him , and got to his feet . " Gentlemen , I 'm afraid you 'll have to excuse me . I have just time to dress for dinner ? ' Morton wasP 214already standing beside the desk with their hats . It had gotten dark in the room . " Lights , please , Morton , " snapped Ward . As they went out Judge Planet said , " Well , it 's been a very pleasant chat , Mr. Moorehouse , but I 'm afraid your schemes are a little idealistic . " " I 've rarely heard a business man speak with such sympathy and understandingof the labor situation , " said G. H. Barrow . " I only voice the sentiments of my clients , " said Ward as he bowed them out . Next day he spoke at a Rotary Club luncheon on " Labor Troubles : A Way Out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel banquet hall full of smells of food and cigarettes , and scurrying waiters . He spread the food a little round his plate with a fork , answering when he was spokento , joking a little with Judge Planet , who sat opposite him , trying to formulate sentences out of the haze of phrases in his mind . At last it was time for him to get to his feet . He stood at the end of the long table with a cigar in his hand , looking at the two rows of heavyjowled faces turned towards him . " When I was a boy down along the Delaware . . . " He stopped . A tremendous clatter of dishes was coming from behind the swinging doors through which waiters were still scuttling with trays . The man who had gone to the door to make them keep quiet came stealthily back . You could hear his shoes creak across the parquet floor . Men leaned forward along the table . Ward started off again . He was going on now ; he hardly knew what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The tension relaxed . " American business has been slow to take advantage of the possibilities of modern publicity . . . educationof the public and of employers and employees , all equally servantsof the public . . . Cooperation . . . stockownership giving the employee an interest in the industry . . . avoiding the grave dangers of socialism and demagoguery and worse . . . It is in such a situation that the public relations counsel can step in in a quiet manly way and say , Look here , men , let 's talk this over eye to eye . . . But his main importanceis in times of industrial peace . . . when two men are sore and just about to hit one another is no time to preach public service to them . . . The time for an educational campaign and an oral crusade that will drive home to the rank and file of the mighty colossus of American up-to-date industry is right now , today .
