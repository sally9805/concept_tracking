( See Cover ) <P> One evening last week Attorney General Frank Murphy arrived at the Green Inn , a comfortable shingled seaside hotel at Narragansett , R. I. With him were his chauffeur , his secretary , Eleanor Bumgardner , and his legal assistant , Edward G. Kemp . They registered , were assigned rooms and started up to them . It was then that the night clerk noted that Frank Murphy was so exhausted that it seemed for a moment he might not make the one-flight climb upstairs . <P> Next morning Frank Murphy was up at 8 a. m. , breakfasted in his room ( No. 12 ) on one ascetic glass of orange juice , then went out on the veranda to work diligently over mail and official-looking reports . Occasionally he would go inside , make long telephone calls . He had a portable radio which he tuned to catch all news reports , and he carried it with him when he went to the beach at n : 30 . There he stood for 15 minutes , knee-deep on the hissing shingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged in , swam past the breakers , churned up &; down parallel to the beach for 45 minutes , ably swimming side stroke , breast stroke , Australian crawl . Then he went to lunch ( fruit only ) at the moderately swank Dunes Club , then back to the beach to sun on a mattress , read ( Grapes of Wrath ) through dark glasses , listen to radio newscasts , until 5 o'clock . He swam for an hour again before returning to the Green Inn to dine on vegetables. - <P> This was the Attorney General 's recuperative schedule for five days , varied only when he ate his vegetable dinner at the Dunes instead of the Green . Several eager Narragansetters invited the rufous gentleman , whose eyebrows rival John Lewis ' and Jack Garner 's for density and concentration , to break bread , but he politely declined them all . U. S. District Attorney J. Howard McGrath from Providence was his guest two evenings at the Dunes . Otherwise he kept alone .

He felt he had conscientiously obeyed the orders of his Chief , who had firmly told him : " Frank , I want you to get out of town Washington . . . . " But he could not relax entirely , for of all the top men in the U. S. Government , not excepting even the President , none was engaged upon tasks more pressing and important than Frank Murphy . <P> Cop 's Job . The functions of the Attorney General 's office are three : i ) It pays off heavy political debts ( even more liberally than the Post Office ) with assistant attorney generalships , U. S. judgeships , - district attorneyships. 2 ) It advises Congress on the constitutionality of pending legislation and defends the constitutionality of that legislation when passed . 3 ) It enforces the laws of the land .
