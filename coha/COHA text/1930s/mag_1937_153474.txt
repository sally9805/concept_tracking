Crusty but popular President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud , 76 , described himself as " a worn out old cart " when his followers recently insisted that he stand for reelection . Last week the Electoral Assembly of 300 passed over the " Old Cart " and by just one vote failed to elect Jurist Kaarlo Stahlberg who was the Finnish Republic 's first elected President in 1919-25 and today is supposed to stand for drawing Finland into closer relations with the Soviet Union . On the second ballot , Agrarian Party Leader Kyosti Kallio , the only man who has been uninterruptedly elected a Finnish Legislator since 1907 , who has been twelve times Speaker of the Diet and who since last October has been Premier , was elected President . Significance : no Finnish political change .
