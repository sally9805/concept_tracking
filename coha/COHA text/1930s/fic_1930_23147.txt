RUIN A STORY BY CORDON ARTHT.7R SMITH W E HAD been discussing crime and punishment and the difficulty which both man and nature have experienced in making the punishment fit the crime . My companion , Paul de Maubray , sociologist , psychologist , and a graceful writer of occasional strays of fiction , had maintained stoutly throughout the half hour we had sat in the smoke-stained cafe near the Sacr6 Coeur that neither man nor nature has devised punishments in any way appropriate to the crimes which both man and nature have devised . " Crime and punishment ! " he exclaimed . " What should be their relation ? Or again , take service and reward . The line between a crime and a service is so tenuous that only too often we punish a service or reward a crime . We men , makers of laws and administrators of justice , in our impudence pretend to be able to distinguish between a good deed and a bad one ! I tell you , my young friend , that we can not . " " Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are not , " he agreed , " and for that reason they should not pretend to judge . If you will look behind you , across the room , you will see facing us a disreputable old friend of mine whom long ago men pretended to judge . What he did they called a crime , and they punished him accordingly ; but Lam not at all sure that what he did was not a noble , a supremely geuerous act . Lookat him , my friend , and observe how he has been rewarded . " I glanced across the room in the direction that Paul de Maubray indicated . 1 saw , hunched over the marble Lop of a square table , as unprepossessing a remnant of a man as I ever remember to have seem It was impossible to guess at his age  --  he might , I thought , have seen through those red eyes of his a century go by . His hair ( if he owned a hat he had removed it ) was white and long and thin and lifeless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast a glance at his clothes and averted my eyes . I must have shuddered a little as I did so , for Paul de Maubray said maliciously , " You do not like my friend , eh ? You condemn him already ; you prefer not to contemplate him ? " " What is the use ? " I returned . " One knows that such creatures exist . Is not that enough ? " " No , " answered Paul , " that is by no means enough ; and if you were not so sensitive a young flower you would have seen for yourself what I shall now point out to you . Look at his forehead and look at his hands . Study them carefully , my friend , you who pretend to be interested in your fellow-men . " Reluctantly I returned my gaze once more to the creature at the opposite table ; and almost immediately I saw what Paul had meant me to see  --  a fine , high brow , a student 's brow , a brow that would have graced an academician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but long and shapely and nervous . There was no denying those hands  --  they belonged either to an aristocrat or to an artist or to both . Artists  --  I use the word of course in the inclusive sense  --  are as a rule aristocrats marked with something far more indelible than a title . " Well , " queried Paul in his lazily scornful voice , " what do you see now ? " " Who is he ? " I asked meekly . " Who is he ? Why , he is a suicide . He is a person who has killed himself in every way that a man can kill himself except that rather sordid and vulgar way of taking his own life . Nevertheless , his life is gone . I will ask him over to tell you about it . It will cost you perhaps half a bottle of cognac , but it is not impossible that you might make one of your so delightful little newspaper sketches out of what he has to say . " My friend instructed a waiter to ask Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join us in a petit verre . Jerome Hubertot -- I noted the name but at the time it signified nothing to me  --  roused himself with a start from his lethargy , turned his reddish eyes toward us inquiringly , recognized Paul and , with a nod and a grunt , started the process of disentangling his legs from those of the table . When he had done so he crossed over to us , heavily , painfully , like a man walking through deep mud . Paul motioned him to a seat , introduced me , and called for cognac . " My very young friend here , " said Paul , " is anxious to hear from you the story you told me some nights ago . I , myself , shall not be vexed to hear it a second time . My young friend is an ambitious journalist . " " Then , " said Jerome Hubertot , " your young friend is a young fool . He would do better to become an ambitious horse-doctor . " " Yes , yes , " said Paul quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why ; but my young friend does not know why and he is eager to hear . So tell him . " " Very well , " agreed Jerome Hubertot , " I will tell him . " He poured himself a petit verre of cognac , threw back his unkempt head , and swallowed the liquor at a gulp ; then he said , " Oh ! " licked his bearded lips and began . " It happened , all this , " he said , " about thirty years ago . That was before you were born , young man , I 've no doubt . It began here in Paris and here in Paris it will end . The drama , you perceive , can boast of at least one of the three classical unities  --  the unity of place . " Thirty years ago I was thirty years old . That is a good age to be , is it not , young man ? Yes , I agree . At thirty all should be splendid with the world -- -the apprentice days are over and the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one , either ; coming nearer and nearer every day , almost within one 's grasp . Fame , at that age , seems beautiful and imminent  --  as beautiful as a beautiful woman and almost as tangible . One says , ' If I am not famous to-morrow I shall be famous at any rate not later than next week . ' One is so very sure of oneself . " Well , that was my condition . I had a job as assistant dramatic critic on L'Eclaireur which , at that time , was the most influential morning paper in Prance . I was second to the great Colin Martel , the satanic old man who made or killed every play that he reviewed during the last ten years of his Tile . Monsieur de Maubray remembers him , even if you do not . " With some it has been a question whether L'Eclaireur made Martel the power that he was in things dramatic or whether Martel made L'Eclaireur . In any case their authority , their supremacy were indisputable . If Bernhardt or Rijane had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was because Colin Martel had devastated the play in his review . " You see what I mean ? You see what my position was at the age of thirty ? Second to Martel and waiting to step into his shoes ! And Martel was seventy-eight , so I had reason to believe his shoes would soon be vacant . " Now I want you to understand that I did not spend my days and my nights gloating over my opportunities . On the contrary , I strove in every manner possible to fit myself for the opportunity when it should come . I studied  --  bon dieu , how I studied ! I read the classics and the moderns until I knew them by heart ; I pored over Sainte-Beuve and Brunetiere until I was certain that the critical methods of both were unsound . And I took to pieces and put together again every review that my master , Colin Martel , ever wrote . I even learned English , so that I might read what that Irishman , Shaw , was saying at the time . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . In short , I did everything in my power to make myself worthy of the eminent position to which any day I expected to be called . " But when one is thirty and in Paris and June comes around in due time , as June always will , it is difficult to remain always serious , always a plodder , a student , a monk . My connection with the theater had provided me with many acquaintances among the profession  --  many acquaintances and even a friend or two . I had , however , as a rule striven to avoid entanglements of a serious nature with the women of the stage , for such things are detrimental to the career of a dramatic critic , and , as I have tried to make clear , my career was more precious to me than anything else in life . More precious , I thought , than any woman was or could be . Imbecile ! " The old fellow rapped the table so sharply that I started , and the glasses tinkled against their saucers . " Imbecile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbecile , and excusable only because at that time I had yet to meet Itoxane Renoir . Roxane Renoir ! Does the name say anything to you , monsieur ? " And he turned to me with an expression half hopeful and half hopeless . I felt that he would have likedme to remember Roxane Renoir , but despaired of my doing so . Forced to be truthful , I shook my head . " I fear not , " I said . " I must have been in my cradle at that time . " " Of course  --  evidently . Your friend , Monsieur de Maubray , remembers her , however . Doubtless he could tell you of her better than I. I find it difficult , somehow  --  perhaps because I loved her so much . One can not describe accurately the fire that consumes one or the wind that carries one away . I was the ash in the fire , the leaf in the wind . " But no matter . Let me sketch her for you as well as I can . You have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Well , that was a little her style . The long , oval face with the hair parted in the middle and drawn down , smoothly undulating , over her ears to form a knot that lay , dark , lustrous , and heavy , low against her white neck . Her hair was as black as a pool on a starless night . Her eyes were as black as her hair , God pity me ! " She was very slender . Very slender , " he repeated musingly , " but then she was very young . There was Spanish blood in her somewhere  --  somehow I have forgotten , but it is of no importance except that she held herself like a Spaniard . You know what I mean  --  erect , chin up , head back . You have seen ' Carmencita , ' no doubt , in the Luxembourg , by that American , Sargent ? Well , that is how she held herself . " So , now , there you have her to the best of my ability , but of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not seen her in those days can imagine her ; and even I , at times , find that her picture is blurred  --  even I who have held her in my arms . " He ceased abruptly , reached for his glass of cognac , found it empty , and glanced inquiringly at me . I told the waiter to bring the bottle . I filled our three glasses , Jerome Hubertot sighed and sipped . Then he resumed . RUIN 175 " Roxane Renoir , when I met her , was filling a small and absurd part in a revue . Oh , the usual sort of thing . The demure young girl from the provinces whose most naive remarks can be interpreted in the most Rabelaisian way . We French have a passion for obscenity in the guise of innocence . " Roxane invested the part with all the art and charm which was hers and which Paris was later to recognize . I devoted a eulogistic paragraph to her in my review of the piece  --  for that was the sort of drama assigned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would not soil his hands with it . " I was presented to her a day or so afterward at a restaurant . She thanked me for my favorable notice and asked me to come to see her in her apartment in the rue de la Faisanderie . I went . " I do n't remember what we talked of at first but toward the end of my visit we talked , as was inevitable , of love . Every woman will turn the conversation to that topic as soon as she decently can . Sometimes before she decently can . " But I , myself , was in no way reluctant . There was something about Roxane Renoir in those days that made men light-headed  --  the passion under her demureness , perhaps , latent but discernible , like the quick color that came and went beneath the whiteness of her skin . One does not stop to analyze these things at the time . Once one has touched one 's Iips to the cup one closes one 's eyes , drains it , and becomes drunk without questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From that day forward I loved her . I thought that she loved me . She said so , but what man can be certain ? As between an actress and a critic , ours was a highly respectable love , for we determined to marry . That , I suppose , was my idea . You will accuse me of being maudlin , but the plain fact is that anything short of marriage would have seemed to me a tarnishing of my lovefor her . I had set her above and apart . I had put her , virginal , in a niche as something worshipful . In my heart I had sanctified her . All this , of course , was very wrong of me , very mistaken , very inexperienced . One makes such mistakes at thirty  --  and before and after . " Another mistake that I made was in giving her time to think and , incidentally , time to make a name for herself in her profession . That last led to catastrophe for me , as I might , perhaps , have foreseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mood , no condition , to foresee anything except Roxane and myself , united , climbing , in a roseate mist and surrounded by plump cupids , a sort of lazulite staircase to delight . A sort of Christmas-card picture , you see . So I helped Roxane to become famous . A critic  --  even an assistant critic  --  can help a great deal if his paper carries authority . " But Roxane Renoir had it in her to become , alone and unaided by me , a great comedienne . She graduated rapidly from small parts to important parts , from vulgar farce to less vulgar comedy and thence to high comedy . Within a year and a half she had received an offer from the famous Lucien Bergs to play opposite him in his next piece . " I shall not soon forget the day she told me of that offer . It was in her apartment  --  still , mark you , the one in the rue de la Faisanderie ; for although her salary had increased she was ever of a thrifty nature . Peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose she broke the wonderful news to me  --  to me who had struggled and schemed as arduously as she for her success ? How do you suppose she told me ? With rapturous arms about my neck and in the intervals of a rain of kisses ? With tears of gratitude and in a voice broken with emotion ? You might think so , my friend , but you would be wrong . As you grow older you will learn that people take their successes merely as their due : it is their failures that arc always the fault of somebody else . " Yes , precisely . On that day Roxane greeted me with what I perceived to be an unusual coolness . She was completely polite , but also , completely formal . " ' Sit down , Jerome , ' she said . ' There 's something I must tell you about . ' " I sat down , wondering what the calamity might be , whether her old mother had died suddenly down in Provence or her Pekingese had been run over in the Bois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Bergs was here this morning , ' she said quite calmly . ' He wants me for his next piece  --  to play the leading woman . ' " I leaped from my seat and ran to her with my arms outstretched . Pride and delight and triumph caught me up and swept me away . I experienced all the emotions , all the raptures that she should have experienced ; I was filled with the glow that fills one who , having fought his fight and run his race , sees victory at last . " I ran to her , I say , and started to fling my arms about her . And then  --  well , and then she pushed me away with a shrill , petulant cry . It was as if she were thrusting aside some awkward , over-affectionate dog that had pawed his eager body up to lick her face . " ' No , no , ' she cried , get away ! Go back to your seat . We must discuss this calmly . ' " In a daze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too affectionate dog desists when he has been slapped on the nose . " ' We must discuss this calmly , ' she repeated . ' It means a great deal to both of us . It changes a great deal for both of us . ' " I was silent . I did not even then know what she meant . ' You see , ' she continued in a hard , cool voice such as she might have employed to dismiss her cook ? ' you see that if I accept this offer , my poor friend , I can not possibly marry you . It would be out of the question . Bergs would not tolerate a married woman forhis leading lady . You know that as well as I. ' " I suppose I did know it as well as she , but I had not thought of it as soon as she . Bergs , as you may remember , selected his leading women with an eye to marrying them himself if they proved satisfactory . He had already married and divorced three at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wives but no mistresses ; a delightful and a faithful husband until a wife ceased to please him and then a ruthless , cynical brute until he was rid of her and seeking another . And he was the outstanding genius of his day among the younger actors and dramatists . There is not the least doubt in the world of that , and even the women who have been his wives admit it gladly . " That was Bergs . That was the man who had offered Roxane the most coveted position in the dramatic world of Paris  --  the position of his leading woman . " ' I do hope , ' said Roxane , ' that you will see the situation as I do . It is the opportunity of my lifetime , and you must certainly understand that I should be an idiot to allow anything like  --  well , like sentiment to stand in the way . You would be the first to advise me not to , would n't you , my friend ? ' " A h , the cool , calculating impudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should be the first to advise her to poison me if I should chance to stand in the way of her ambition . Her next speech was perhaps even more heartless . " ' It is sad , is it not , ' she observed without a touch of real sadness in her voice ? it is sad , is it not , that always in order to reach the great heights in any line of endeavor one has to turn one 's back on so many of the pleasant little things in life ? Alas , Jerome , to achieve , one must sacrifice . I shall endeavor to give you up bravely but you will always have a place in my heart . You know how I shall suffer ! ' " Oh , I knew well enough then just how much she would suffer ; and I saw red and 1 told her I knew . At that moment I hated her so intensely that I desired to kill her . I do not pretend to be one of your strong , silent men who scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their fists in anger . No , I am from the Midi originally , where the blood runs hot and violent and men say whatever comes into their heads . " I said a great deal to Roxane . I did more , I took her by the shoulders and I shook her back and forth until her white teeth clicked and her black eyes bulged out like huge black agate marbles . And then I released her and began to wreck her apartment . With one superb gesture of my arm I swept everything from the mantelpiece  --  horrible little Dresden shepherdesses and lambs and cupids and whatnots , a gilded Louis XVI clock that I had always despised , a pair of grinning china cats . By that time she was on her knees , wringing her hands and displaying for the first time true emotion . She was more distressed , I noted savagely , at the loss of her hideous ornaments than she had been at the loss of me . " When I had devastated enough I bowed to her where she still knelt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you or speak to you as long as I live . You are the most contemptible woman alive , and I sincerely hope you fail in everything you may undertake . ' " Then I turned on my heels and stalked out , forgetting my hat , as of course one does on those grandiose occasions . " Once more Jerome Hubertot paused and once more regarded his empty glass . I filled it in silence from the bottle . " The good cognac ! " he murmured . One at least can trust it . It keeps its promises for it will always make one drunk in the end . Do I bore you , young man ? " " No , " I assured him , " on the con-trary ? " " Good , " he said . " In that case continue . But before I continue it is necessary that I tell you more about Lucien Bergs and especially about his father , the illustrious Felix Bergs . " As I have said , Lucien Bergs was a genius , a many-sided genius , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directed them . His father , Felix Bergs , was , as you should know , also a genius but without Lucien 's versatility . Felix was a magnificent dramatic actor  --  a better actor than his son , granting that a role suited his rather limited talents . He was essentially a tragedian , a player of serious parts . " Now Lucien , his son , strangely enough , was essentially a comedian . Not a vulgar , slapstick comedian , but an infinitely subtle comedian , the master of a thousand nuances , a man who could bring tears to your eyes while you were still laughing , who could make you laugh while you wept . A. truly great man . " All that is common knowledge . But what you must especially remember about Lucien Bergs is that he worshipped his father . I mean it almost literally  --  he worshipped his father . Quick beyond the normal to lay his finger on defects in his own acting and in that of others , he was totally unable to see a flaw in anything his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has applauded Felix Bergs , but the applause of the world has been tepid in comparison to that of his son . Well , you may put this father-worship to the credit side of Lucien Bergs ' character if you care to . I am willing , for I bear him no grudge . He never knowingly did me a wrong . All I insist upon is that you fully comprehend this dominant trait in his make-up . It is important . " Now , let me see , where was I ? Oh , yes , exactly . I had stalked out of Roxane 's apartment , forgetting my hat and , of course , far too proud and angry to return to get it . So , hatless , I paced the streets of Paris that night . I do n't remember where I went , but I know that I lingered breathlessly at the bridges over the Seine . I believe I even went so far as to climb up on one of the parapets . Suicide ? Yes , indeed , T contemplated suicide ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I shall come to that . " I found myself , eventually , sitting on a bench in the Champs-Elysees . It was a night of tired stars and a thin , sick moon . It was a hot , stifling night . I saw a young fellow go by with his arm about a girl and I saw him lean down to kiss her and I laughed at him aloud . IL must have been a bitter and a horrible laugh , for the man turned to glare at me , and the girl gave a little cry and clung to him the closer . Then they hurried away into the shadows of the chestnut trees . " When I reached my room it was dawn . I threw myself on my bed , fully clad , and I slept until evening . I awoke with a dull ache somewhere within me , but T was sane . The fire of my fury had burned itself out , leaving me cold and weak and as gray as ashes . I was no longer in a rage with Roxane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average womankind , but , rather , lowered my opinion of average womankind to her level . I had become , you see , a misogynist overnight . That was young of me , was it not ? Yes , very , but it proved a healing and a comfortable philosophy . " Convinced that all women were disloyal and self-seeking , I ceased almost . to suffer . I threw myself into my work with a sort of vindictive energy . I had enough money to pay my rent but I worked as hard as a man works who is in fear of eviction . And , since Colin Martel , my master , was aging rapidly , important opportunities for reviewing began to come my way . I was permitted to sign my name to my critiques now , and my name was attracting attention . I was quoted . ' Jerome Huber-tot , who so ably substitutes for Colin Martel in L'Eclaireur , ' and so on . You know the sort of thing . Fame was onmy threshold , a long-awaited mistress tapping at my door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his new piece at his own theater . It was called , I remember , Pourquoi Pleurer ? ' On the opening night , Colin Martel , being , as was often now the case , confined to his bed , I was sent to review it . " It was a typical Bergs comedy , deftly constructed , full of easy , informal dialogue , tinged with a philosophy that harked back to Epicurus , and truer to life than life itself . There was , as always with Bergs ' comedies , an undertone of pathos , of tragedy even , that lay beneath all the wit and the sparkle . Bergs , the actor , was an adept at interpreting this subtle insinuation of Bergs , the dramatist . It remained to be seen if Roxane Renoir , his new leading woman , was as adequate as had been her predecessors . " She was more than adequate , she was superb . " I gave her a tremendous write-up in my column in L'Eclaireur the next morning . It was so eulogistic that Colin Martel when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My young friend , ' he said with his tired old ? an 's smile , ' this Roxane Renoir must be very beautiful , and you a very susceptible youth . One raves like that on occasions about Bernhardt , but not , I think , about a little person called Renoir . Superlatives should not be exhausted too early , for the demand far exceeds the supply , and the day may come when you will find that you have none left to bestow on a Duse ? ' " ' Master , ' I said , ' there is no one now alive who can play comedy as well as Roxane Renoir , except possibly Mod-jeska ! " ' Bon ( lieu ! ' he sighed , ' have you never heard of a woman called Rejane ? ' and he closed his skeptical old eyes and dismissed me with a wave of his hand . " The piece , Pourquoi Pleurer ? ' ran successfully through the season , and after a month Lucien Bergs married Roxane . He was , as I have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created little comment in Paris . As for me , I had by now acquired a fine , protective callousness and I received the news with a shrug of the shoulders . " I can state , I think truthfully , that of far more interest to me was the rumor that edged its way into the world of the theater to the effect that Felix Bergs was engaged in writing a play for his son , Lucien , and his daughter-in-law , Roxane Renoir . This , if correct , was important and interesting , for old Felix Bergs , hitherto content with his undisputed position as the great , classic French tragedian , had never before tried his hand at play-writing . Unlike his son , who could do and did do everything , Felix kept his activities in the narrow and sure path which for decades he had trodden so majestically and admirably . Polyeucte , Brittanicus , Hernani , Ruy Blas , and of course , ( Fxlipus Rex  --  those were his roles , there lay his proven ability , and until now he had appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially announced that Felix Bergs ' play was nearly completed and that it would be produced by his son as soon as the run of Pourquoi Pleurer ? ' should terminate . The run did not terminate until the spring of the following year , but in the meantime you may be sure that we heard many whispers concerning the defects of the new piece . Those things get about quickly . " As I look back on it now , knowing the truth , it seems to me unbelievable that a man of Lucien Bergs ' fine intelligence should have considered the production of ' Les Poupe'es , ' as the play was called , for an instant . I can attribute his stupendous lack of judgment to but one thing , a thing I have dwelt on , you will remember  --  his blind love and admiration for his father . That must have been it , for there is no other possible explanation . " From what I have been able to gather since , I can put together the picture , bit by bit , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather vain , rather pompous old man working day and night on his precious manuscript , locking himself in where no profane eyes may see him , writing , erasing , rewriting , revising , convinced that he is producing a masterpiece whereas in truth he is producing nothing but the most abysmal drivel . Oh , yes , I can see him , mildly triumphant as he jots down what he considers a brilliant bit of dialogue , licking his lips with satisfaction , anticipating his son 's gratitude . That would be it , you see : his son would be grateful , would soar to success on this superb play provided for him by his father . He was fond of his son , you may be sure , fond of him but by no means convinced that he was a great artist . He would have laughed at the suggestion that his son was in many ways greater than he . " And so he sits in his study , penning puerilities , hanging platitudes on a hackneyed plot , contriving long , bombastic speeches a la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the piece is to be a comedy  --  treating , in short , the most monstrous piece of modern theatrical writing that has ever been produced on a stage in Paris . " And then what ? Why , then , when it is finished he invites his son and his daughter-in-law in to dine with him , and after the liqueurs he reads his work aloud . " Can you visualize the scene as I can ? Can you hear the old fellow declaiming his banal lines in that splendid voice of his , his enunciation perfect , his diction exquisite  --  all in the grand classic tradition of the Comedic Fran-'raise ? Can you hear him , can you see him ? And his son , Lucien , what of him ? Why , his son , Lucien , the most understanding of modern dramatists , the subtlest , the most polished artist alive , the keenest judge , the shrewdest wit  --  why , his son , Lucien , sits and listens , and because it is his father who has written it and his father who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindly and thinks he can do no wrong , Lucien , I say , pronounces the work a masterpiece . " He embraces his father at the conclusion , he wrings the old fellow 's hands , there are tears of emotion and of admiration in his eyes , and he turns to Roxane Renoir , who is sitting silent in her bewilderment , and says , We have been permitted to be the first to hear the finest comedy written in the French language since Moli  --  re wrote " Tartuft . " ' " And old Bergs , by now unbelievably superior , says , ' I never thought very much of Moli  --  re . ' " Poor Roxane is not certain she is not dreaming . She has enough respect for her own critical judgment to know that Las Toupees ' is beneath contempt . She is not blinded , you understand , by a too great love for Felix Bergs . She wonders if Lucien , whose opinions she has always trusted implicitly , is merely feigning his admiration , striving to spare his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows his cue . She even goes farther than he and asserts that the comedy surpasses anything that Moliere ever dreamed of doing . " Then , when adulation has been exhausted , the three of them set to work forthwith to select a suitable cast  --  the greatest cast ever assembled . " That , as I have since gathered , is about what happened . What a situation ! What a predicament for Roxane who , alone of the three , could see clearly , without prejudice , as an audience sees  --  for Roxane , who saw clearly that the play was abominable ! " One can understand her stupefaction when , later , she realized that her husband was sincere in his admiration of his father 's work and sincere in his determination to produce it . She saw stark failure ahead  --  worse than failure , she saw ridicule . Once or twice she summoned her courage  --  it required infinite courage  --  to suggest that the play might be improved , to hint at a few weaknesses . Lucien 's answer was as decisive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the alteration of a single word . Would you tamper with a masterpiece ? ' " So , perforce , she desisted . A cast was chosen ; rehearsals began ; and with the beginning of rehearsals something of the truth commenced to leak out . " At this point Jerome Hubertot paused and , without comment , helped himself from the bottle of cognac . He was not drunk as far as 1 could tell , but he was keyed up , nervously excited by his own narrative . It was quite evident that he was rushing along now to his climax and needed cognac to steady him . " The play , " he resumed , " was advertised to open in October  --  October the twelfth , to be exact . I happen to remember the date , for it was the day of my death . There were others dying about that time , too . On the ninth of October  --  that was a Friday  --  my master , Cohn Martel , ceased to criticize in this world and went himself to be criticized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I trust that his life 's play met with a favorable reception ; I know that it deserved it . " As I had every right to expect , the management of L'Eclaireur promoted me to the position Martel had left vacant . I had earned it . Among the flattering things the managing editor said to me there was one note of warning , ' You are young , Hubertot , and enthusiastic . Neither of these is inexcusable , but bear in mind that L'Eciairear is not young nor has it ever , in reviewing transient and ephemeral successes , permitted itself to be overenthusiastic . And so , my young friend , be generous but do not squander your superlatives on mediocrity . ' " I thanked him and pledged myself to conservation . How could I know that in a very brief time I should deliberately break my pledge ? " I have told you of the death of Cohn Martel on a Friday ; I have not yet told you that on Saturday the word was passed that Felix Bergs was about to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or two at most . And the opening night of his play was set for Monday . People wondered if he would live until it should be born . " He had talked of the piece freely with his friends , and we all knew that he considered it the crowning achievement of a career which he would have been the first to admit was already a glorious one . His conceit was incredible and , in a way , pathetic because it was so utterly without foundation . And it was pathetic , too , because Felix Bergs was a very sick old man and his brain a very sick old brain . ? " The newspapers kept us informed of his condition  --  Saturday , he was very low , Sunday morning a shade better , Sunday evening very low again . It was admitted that the one thing that was keeping him alive was his invincible determination not to die before he should witness , if only from his sickbed , the triumph of Les Poupces . ' " On Monday afternoon I was in my study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les Romanesques , ' by a youngster called Rostand , when my doorbell jangled violently . My elderly servant having gone out to buy provisions , I answered the ring myself . I saw , standing on my threshold , the last person on earth whom I expected to see . Ma , yes , you have divined it  --  I saw Roxane Renoir . " She was greatly agitated , embarrassed , distressed . That much was evident at a glance . As for laic , I have no exact recollection of what my emotions were . On the surface , I feel sure that I appeared calm . I asked her politely to come in  --  as politely and as coolly as a doctor inviting a patient into his consulting room . " She came in , trembling , and sat down in my large , comfortable leather chair . When she lifted her veil  --  women wore veils in those days  --  I discerned traces of tears about those amazing black eyes of hers . I was surprised at this , for I had never remembered her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I began formally , to what am I indebted ? ' " No , no , Jerome , ' she broke in , ' it is useless if we are to talk like that to each other . I have come to ask you to render me a service  --  a service so great that I can not ask it of you unless you are a friend . ' " I bit my lip in anger at her cool impudence . I hated her again . I saw that she was very beautiful  --  more beautiful even than before . I found her very desirable . I hated her again . I loved her again . I saw that she was very beautiful . " ' What possible reason , ' I said angrily , ' can you have to believe that I am your friend , that I would render you a service ? ' " ' The only reason I have , ' she answered quietly , ' is that you once loved me . ' " I did , ' I admitted ? ' once . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her lips quivered into an uncertain little smile . Nothing is more stimulating to a woman than a man 's admission that he has loved her , even if only in the dead past . " What do you want me to do ? ' I demanded abruptly . " Then she told me . Felix Bergs was dying  --  would now be dead except that he refused to go before the public should acclaim his play as a masterpiece . The play , as of course I knew , opened that evening . It was execrable . Everyone but Lucien Bergs knew it to be execrable , and Lucien was blinded by father-worship . The critics would tear it to pieces and trample on it . They would be truthful and merciless . " ' Felix Bergs , ' she concluded , will not be well enough , naturally , to attend the performance in person , but we shall be forced to show him the reviews in to-morrow 's papers ; and the reviews will kill him  --  kill him miserably and wretchedly like so many knife-thrusts through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . Even then I did not grasp the stupendous folly that was in her mind . " ' All this , ' I said , ' is unfortunate . I am sorry for Felix Bergs ; all of us critics are sorry for him . He was in his way a great actor , but the cobbler should stick to his last . ' ' He is dying , ' she said , as though that explained everything , excused everything . ' It is a pity he should die broken-hearted . ' " ' A great many of us , ' I said a little bitterly , die , I fear , broken-hearted . ' " Yes , ' she agreed , ' but in this case you can prevent it . ' " I stared . I was very obtuse . " In what way ? ' I asked . " She hesitated a space , scrutinizing me , weighing me , I suppose . Then she said , If a paper carrying the authority , say , of L'Eclaireur , should print a eulogistic review to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one review and withhold the others and he would die  --  well , as happily as any man can die . ' " I saw then all at once what she meant . She meant merely that I should betray my employers , renounce my integrity as a critic , violate the codes and traditions of my profession , toss my honor like a rotten fruit into the gutter , and deliberately kill my career with my own hands ! And why ? Why , because I had once loved her and , if you please , because she wished to ease the death agony of a pompous old fool ! " I am surprised now that I refrained from striking her . She must have seen the desire to do so in my face , but she did not cower or draw back . Instead , she continued speaking calmly and evenly . " I am not asking you to do a reasonable thing , Jerome , ' she said . I am asking you to do something so unreasonable that if you do it I shall know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . ' " I laughed . ' If that is all , ' I said , I can easily satisfy you . I despise you . ' " She shook her head slowly . No , ' she said , you do not . And you will do what I ask . And if you do I shall leave Lucien Bergs to-morrow and come to you . He will divorce me and we can be married . I have never ceased loving you , Jerome . ' " I made some inarticulate noise compounded of rage and incredulity . I was on my feet in front of her , over her . She was in my big leather armchair , looking up at me with questioning eyes , a tentative , uncertain smile at the corners of her lips . " I thought I could be happy without you , ' she murmured . I was so utterly wrong ! ' " ' You lie ! ' I cried , and with that she was in my arms and I was kissing her brutally . " When some trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow and led her , unresisting , to the door . Get out , ' I said briefly . ' You have done enough damage . ' " She went without a word , but the smile on her lips was no longer uncertain . " I will not attempt to picture for you the agony I underwent during those next hours . The worst agony imaginable is probably the agony of indecision . You will say I should not have hesitated for an instant , that I should have thrust from me at once the thought of betraying my newspaper for the sake of a woman who I had every reason to believe was treacherous , self-centered , and worthless . You will say all that , perhaps ; but if you do it will be because you have no adequate conception of the power of passion . " Every reasonable argument that presented itself was arrayed , of course , against Roxane . But when a man contemplates doing an unreasonable thing , it is pitiful to see how little weight reason bears . Passion , I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if it were not so , how peaceful life would be  --  and how dull ! " The hour approached when I must go to the theater , and I had not yet come to a decision . At least , I told myself that I had not come to a decision . Looking back on it. , I believe that at the bottom of my heart  --  my heart , mind you , not my head  --  I was convinced I should do what Roxane had asked of me . At any rate it was what I eventually did do . " The play was even more contemptible than I had been led to expect . There was hissing and booing at the end of the first act , and only the personal popularity of Lucien Bergs and Roxane prevented , I am sure , an angry outbreak on the part of the disgusted audience . During the intermissions my fellow-critics talked openly of their intention of killing the piece . In other circumstances I should have been as violent as any of them ; but , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , Felix Bergs , lay on his deathbed . " They laughed . ' lla ! ' they said , Listen to Hubertot . He is advocating leniency and all the time he is filling his fountain pen with vitriol . His review will doubtless be the most scathing of the lot . ' " I bore it as long as I could and then , frenzied , I flew from the theater . I was sweating as if I had been wrestling with the devil , as indeed I had . " In the coolness of the October night I made one last valiant effort to collect my wits . One by one I marshalled the arguments against what I feared I was going to do . Honor , duty , self-respect , the esteem of my fellow-men , my reputation both public and private , my career , my friendships , my ? position in the social and in the artistic worlds  --  all these I threw into action like so many battalions . They should have been invincible but they were not ; and why ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-pervading , was my passion for Roxane Renoir , a little girl with large black eyes ! " At half-past eleven I went calmly to my desk in the office of L'Eclaireur , and there , without addressing a word to anybody , without comment or apology of any sort , I wrote the most eulogistic review of ' Les Poupees ' of which I was capable . " I stooped to no half-way measures : I praised the piece as no French comedy had been praised by L'Eclaireur since the days of Alfred de Musset . I asserted that it was a splendid climax to the glorious career of its author ; that it would assure him a high place among the immortals who had written for the French stage . " Then I went home and locked myself in and shivered and wept all through the night . I had committed suicide , you see , and I was weeping at my own grave . " Old Hubertot paused here to pass his hand vaguely over his forehead and there ensued an uneasy silence . The catastrophe that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for his appearance of extreme age , for his blurred , reddened eyes , for his garments of a tramp , for his utter aimlessness , for his cognac . " You can guess the rest , " he said wearily . " I received my dismissal from L'Eclaireur . It was brutally brief and to the point and it offered me no opportunity to explain if , indeed , I had cared to do so . My fellow-critics were in an uproar . I had , it seems , disgraced their calling . Henceforth I was to be shunned like a leper . My friends , as I had foreseen , promptly turned their backs on me as though it was they whom I had injured and not myself , as though I had committed murder and not suicide . " And that night Roxane left Lucien Bergs and came to me . I had doubted her but I had been wrong to doubt her . She was faithful to her promise . She was and is . " Unexpectedly Hubertot broke into an ironical laugh . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot in a cathedral . " A little joke of the devil 's , " be explained . " It seems that old Felix Bergs died before he could read my splendid notice of his play in L'Eclaireur . In spite of his determination his body was not strong enough to last through the night . And so I committed suicide , after all , to no purpose . Life is compounded of such little accidents . " I said just now that T had committed suicide to no purpose ; but I hasten to retract that statement , for if I lost everything else I gained Roxane . Bergs divorced her without delay  --  he was thoroughly conversant by now with that technic  --  and she and I were married . " As he said this he turned his head to face the street door through which a woman had entered . Following his gaze , I saw a slovenly , frowzy creature advancing in the direction of our table . She wore a shawl about her fat shoulders , and on top of her disreputable black hair swayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had once been bright red , seemed to cling precariously , as if insufficiently fastened , about her broad hips . A cheerful , easy-going smile was almost lost in the fat folds of her painted cheeks . Hubertot , at sight of her , got unsteadily to his feet . " There is my wife , " he said ? " there is Roxane . " And he added so low that I scarcely heard him , " Is she not beautiful ? " I regarded him in amazement , and in amazement I saw that he was wholly sincere . When Roxane had good-naturedly led old Hubertot by the arm from the caf ? , Paul de Maubray turned to me . " Well , " he said , " you sec ? That man sacrificed everything in the world that he valued most highly for that  --  that woman . In a way it was a noble , generous act , and yet witness how he has been punished . A tramp , a derelict , friendless , penniless , and a social outcast . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his cognac . " I shook my head meditatively . " You are wrong , " I said at length . " You are very wrong . Did you not see the glow in his eyes when he murmured , ' Is she not beautiful ? ' I did , and I swear to you that that man has far more to live for than his cognac . He sacrificed everything for the love of a woman , and he still loves her ; and the miracle of it is that in his blind old eyes she is still beautiful . That man , I tell you , has not been punished  --  he has been rewarded . " Paul de Maubray smiled lazily . " Young man , " he said , " you are more observant than I thought . "
