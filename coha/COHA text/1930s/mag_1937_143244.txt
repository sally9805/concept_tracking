Three days out from Liverpool last week on the small British liner Reina del Pacifico , slowly plowing its way south toward Bermuda and a South American cruise , most of the passengers were just finishing a hearty dinner . In London at the same instant most of the political bigwigs of Britain were finishing an even heartier one , the annual Lord Mayor 's banquet . Too ill to eat his own was the Reina 's most distinguished passenger , James Ramsay MacDonald . At 8:45 he quietly died of heart failure at the age of 71 . <P> Few men living have been more beloved by their friends or maligned by their acquaintances than Ramsay MacDonald . A sentimental Lowland Scot who loved to write sad verses for his friends , * he was a founder of the British Labor Party , the first person to bring it to a position of importance in British affairs , three times Prime Minister of Great Britain and an intimate personal friend of King George V. Yet " traitor " was a word hurled at him over &; over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly against British entry in the World War in 1914 he was ostracized as a traitor to the nation for years . Because he felt it necessary to abandon the principles of the old Labor Party in forming his coalition cabinet or ' ' National Government " in 1931 , Ramsay MacDonald was called a traitor by most of British organized labor . <P> Failing eyesight and mental depression broke his health . The Crown , anxious to honor him , offered him an earldom last May , but Scot MacDonald turned it down lest it crimp the political chances of his son Malcolm who. as Secretary of State for the Dominions , hustled back from the Brussels Conference last week to arrange his father 's funeral . Because doctors worried greatly over Scot MacDonald 's increasing melancholia , he was sent on the Reina del Pacifico cruise with his youngest daughter , Sheila , for companion . With his body still at sea . the British Government proffered him the honor of a Westminster Abbey burial . This the MacDonald family politely refused . For years Ramsay MacDonald had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more beloved wife , Margaret Ethel , who died in 1911 . <P> " In Lossiemouth are both my heart and my hearth , " said he . " A Lossie loon boy was I born , and a Lossie loon shall I die . " <P> <P> *Example , dedicated to the Chicago-born late wife of Sir John Lavery , portraitist : <P> What is this evil spell <P> That so constrains us , making you wistful , holding me morose ? <P> Will never more the quiet sunshine cheer us at the day 's close ? <P> Here let us sit and watch <P> The sunlit waters <P> Lapping the silver strand beneath our feet , <P> And know beneath the tranquil skies of evening <P> Life , once more sweet .
