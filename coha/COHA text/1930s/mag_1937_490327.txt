ONE of the things that happened during 1936 was that photographs were taken of a large proportion of the population of New York by the camera snapshot men on the Avenue . It is extraordinary to think of the existence of this fairly coinplete library of negatives , recording the full-face view of residents and visitors . We ourself have been snapped at least a dozen times . Properly catalogued , such a collection of photos should prove invaluable to the police . AT the turn of the year , our thoughts up and down America . A farmer sends us a piece of pork meat from Maine . It arrives fresh and good . A lady from Washington stops by for a minute , talks in low tones of the depression of 1940 , as though it had already happened . In the mail arrives a picture of a covered bridge in Lexington , Virginia , where we once saw a circus depart by night , the camels as big as Brontosauruses . In Coral Gables , where workers are indolent and rarely bother to strike at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot sun underneath a big parasol which says " Unfair to Organized Labor . " IN the restaurant we overheard them . Their tickets all bought , their bags packed , their skis and togs all in or was no snow in Idaho . No snow in the St. Moritz of America . A predicament . A quandary . The Union Pacific 's face very red . What to do ? Where to go ? The Stork Club ? Twenty-one ? T-rs hard to remember consciously much about a year just gone by . One reads the summaries in the papers , of course , but we mean the events of one 's own life . A few ill-assorted things come hack , the mind roving backward trying to pick up threads . These we remember : A newsreel shot of some Italian couples getting married in wholesale lots ( the brides being kissed , giggling ) to win prizes offered by Mussolini , who is impatient to receive the homage of the yet unborn . Fog , deep as a well , and the starting out in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible fishing grounds . Pigeons on a fall day , swimming like ducks in a drinking trough in the Park Zoo , and our pride in making an original discovery in the realm of natural history , and the ill temper of certain other pigeons that had n't learned to swim . A windy night in June , the Rockettes outdoors in the Rockefeller Plaza restaurant , dancing in the gale . A voice on the radio , slowly , painfully beginning , " At long last ... " The expressive hands of Vincent Price , manipulating a shaving brush . A morning outside a hospital on the Potomac , and the inflection in the voice of someone dying . The tear-drenched voices Of people on the Good Will Court radio hour , giving the simple facts of their illegitimacies , their destitution , their bewilderments . A little boy leading a cow , trotting fast to keep ahead , on his face a look of unutterable joy tinged with apprehension . A midsummer night alone in a New York house , gaped at by shrouded furniture . Nothing of note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , it would have been the year when we changed the way of doing our hair . THE three major events in the field of education of the year were the scrapping of algebra and Latin in Paulsboro , N. J. , in favor of courses in household relationships and installment buying ; the inauguration of a class in auto driving in a Chicago school ; and the publication by the Columbia University Press of a book describing a revolutionary method of Contract bidding that rejects the current overemphasis on high cards and recognizes the controlling importance of distribution . F all the persons we met and saw ?  - -  1 during 1936 , one stands alone . He is a fellow who now and then comes twirling through our block , whistling loud and banging on a drum . The drum is strapped on his back ; on it are mounted cymbals , operated by a string attached to the man 's right ankle . He has an open face , which the pucker of the whistle exaggerates . To make the cymbals clash he has to stamp his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , half dogtrot , but always in circles lest he pass out of the zone of his own influence and lose cash customers . His tunes are as fancy as his rig ; they seem to be his own composition  --  errant , vigorous airs , happy , beginning nowhere , ending nowhere , a trifle daffy , like his crazy gait . The arrival of this person is a moment of sudden madness in the sober street  --  the round face , the bright eye , the crash of cymbals , his whole body in a sort of musical conniption . He is the only pure minstrel we know , a man who by embroiling himself in a gay tangle of orchestral duties has achieved a sort of insane simplicity , rare in the world at this moment . Fun After Hours IKE most New York office build- ings , the R.C.A. Building at Rockefeller Center has a set of rules planned to keep unauthorized persons from snooping around . This is a story which involves a Mr. Jones and three of the R.C.A. rules : ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a pass from a tenant . ( b ) Any tenant who has stayed in his office until after hours must sign a ledger before the night staff will let him out . ( c ) Nobody is allowed to enter the building after hours unless he identifies himself to the starter and receives from hint a pass , which is to he handed over to the elevator operator . Very well , then . This Mr. Jones had remained in his office until ten-thirty one evening . He then started out , carrying with him two packages , which had been delivered to him that day . When he reached the main floor , the night elevator starter demanded a pass for the packages . Mr. Jones said darn is , he had forgotten to write himself a pass , and that he would do it then and there if the starter would give him the proper blank and a pencil . The starter said not at all ; Mr. Jones would have to go back to his own office and use one of the blanks that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only mildly annoying , but it rapidly became alarming when Mr. Jones entered the elevator and the operator refused to take him up without a pass from the starter . Mr. Jones then went back to the starter , who said coldly that he could n't possibly issue him a pass to get in , because he had n't yet signed out . " Then let me sign out , " said Mr. J. " Not until I have a pass for those packages , " the starter answered grimly . We 'd like to he able to report that Mr. Jones is still marooned in the lobby of the R.C.A. Building , but the truth is that the starter finally relented and gave him a pass permitting him to go hack upstairs and write himself a pass to get out . Altogether , it did n't take more than three-quarters of an hour . PaNda 's Arrival WE got up early the day the baby giant panda arrived in town , and went over to Grand Central to meet it . It arrived thirty minutes late , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were a lot f reporters around , and a lot of cameramen . " Where 's the panda ? " they yelled at a Red Cap . " What ? " he said , looking frightened . We pushed our way along the platform , and finally found the baby giant panda in Car 439 , with his captress , Mrs. William H. Harkness . The three of us spent an JANUARY 2 , 1937 agreeable five minutes together before the rest of the press found its way to Car 439 . The baby giant panda is a female , and weighs something under twelve pounds . Her fur felt rough and woolly ( Mrs. Harkness let us pat her ) . The panda is brown underneath , and has brown legs ; there is a saddle of black fur on her shoulders , and black rings around her eyes . Her name is Su Lin , which means " Little Bit of Loveliness , " and suits her exactly . Mrs. Harkness feeds her on Klim , which is milk , powdered and spelled backward . The panda was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China . Wee had barely time to jot down this information before the reporters descended on the baby giant panda and her mistress . There was a lot of shouting and muttering , and somebody took a flashlight photo . The panda started to cry , making a noise something like a doll held upside down . Mrs. Harkness wrapped her in a bath towel , and took her over to the Biltmore , followed by porters , newspapermen , friends who had come to meet Mrs. Harkness , and us . She engaged Room 833 at the Biltmore , and everybody went right upstairs with her and the panda ; four elevator loads . The first thing Mrs. Harkness did was open all the windows ; baby giant pandas , it seems , need lots of fresh air . A Biltmore waiter brought up some hot water , and Mrs. Harkness fixed the panda some Kim , adding syrup and cod-liver oil . The panda drank it from a nursing bottle . All the lady reporters coned . The Post man tried to pat the panda on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand away . " People have colds . " The Post man looked sheepish . Dr. I ) itmnrs meanwhile had called up , asking permission to come around and pay his respects to the panda . It got colder and colder in Room 833 . The panda nuzzled against Mrs. Harkness and chortled . The reporters asked Mrs. Harkness questions about pandas , without getting anywhere . " Nobody knows " seems to he the stock answer to questions about pandas . Nobody has ever had a panda before . It finally got so cold that we had to leave . Out in the corridor , we found the Biltmore Boor clerk huddled in a corner . A bellboy went by , bearing hampers and cans of Miro . " Blew me right out of my chair , " the floor clerk said to the bellboy , referring to the trade wind from Room 833 . " From Africa , " the bellboy said . " Only one in the world . Do n't you read the papers ? " " Blew me right out of my chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the whole story of how New York welcomed the baby giant panda . Conversation ARATHER large woman and a very small boy were waiting in front of the elevators in Blooming &le's; one day last week . " If I were you , " the woman was heard to say , in the impersonal , reasonable tones of the amateur child psychologist , " if I were you and anybody told me I was a smart boy , I 'd say , ' No , I 'm not . ' " The small boy , evidently recalled from the contemplation of fairly important matters , looked up and said , " What 's that ? " " I said , " she told him , " that if I were you , and anybody said to me  --  like that lady did just now  --  that I was a smart boy , I 'd say , ' No , I 'm not . ' " " Why would you ? " the boy asked , reasonably . " Because , " the large woman said , making her point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , and Edgar can read two . " " Oh , Edgar ! " the small boy said , his tone implying that he was sick and tired of Edgar . Then , modulating to gentle reproof , he added , " Anyway , you ought to be thankful I can read one book . " Stentor NOW that the debutante-party season is right at its height , one of the busiest men in town is Robert Hamlett . If you get around much to such affairs , you know Robert Hamlett , though maybe not by name ; he 's the tall , husky , red-faced man who announces the guests . Hamlett feels that unless he is present to attend to this detail , a party is bound to fall a little short of perfection , and we do n't know but that he 's right . He 's the only professional announcer we ever heard of ; certainly the only one who brings to his work twenty-five-odd years of practice . During the deb-party season , between Thanksgiving and mid-February , he 'll announce at fifty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year round with weddings , receptions , dinner and supper parties , and whatnot . When two parties come on the same date , there 's an easy way of telling which is the more important : Hamlett goes to the better one , and sends an assistant , an unemployed butler , to the lesser . His fee is ten dollars . The Ritz-Carlton and the Pierre ( " The twin Meccas of &Fluparties,"; says Hamlett ) always engage him for their big doings , and so do social secretaries like Juliana Cutting and the firm of Mrs. Tappin &; Mrs. Tew , Inc . Hamlett always announces the Junior Assemblies at the Ritz . That 's his favorite job . The fellow lives on Staten Island , of all places-2712 Amboy Road , New Dorp . His wife runs a beauty parlor , and he sells used cars on commission for a New Dorp firm , but that 's just a side line . Announcing is his real lifework . He stumbled into it by accident , as so many people do stumble into their lifework . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , worked for ten years as a dining-car waiter on the Canadian Pacific , and then , when he got married , came here to work for Sherry 's . He was sent out , as one of the waiters , to a big reception in Rye , and when the regular announcer somehow failed to appear , he stepped into the breach . The very first time he bent down over a guest , said , " May I have your name , please ? , " and bellowed it out to the receiving line , something clicked ; he knew that he had been intended for an announcer . People have complained to us that though Hamlett is a familiar figure to them , they do n't seem to he a familiar figure to him . He says that he knows hundreds and hundreds of regular partygoers by sight , but always asks names anyway , just to be sure . It 's a further policy with him never to ask a guest to repeat his name . " The more exotically polysyllabic a name , the louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , when I announced Prince Iyesato Tokugawa at the Japanese Consul 's party in 1934 , the effect was terrific  --  the Prince himself had to laugh ! " Hamlett has nothing but scorn for parties that try to skimp along without an announcer . " The announcer is an indispensable functionary who enables parties to progress with greater celerity , " he says sternly . We asked him , for no particular reason , what he thought of Society , and he said , " Society sets a high standard of manners  --  if not of morals . " It does n't say much for Society 's manners , though , that Hamlett has so often been harassed by rattled folk who try to shake hands with him that he was driven to write a verse about it : When you come to greet your hostess bland , Please do not oiler me your hand . Op WHAT with " 20th Century Sport-ing Club " and " Professional Basketball Every Sunday Night New York Whirlwinds vs . America 's Lead-ing Teams , " there was barely room on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an announce-ment of the evening 's double bill of opera . It was reduced CO : " CAv AND PAG TONIGHT . " Professional W arbirds MAYBE you have read some of the recent newspaper stories about American fliers going over to Spain to fight in the revolution on a salary-pluscommission basis . If you have , you may have wondered , as we did , just how they were recruited ; whether hired through some sort of employment agency , or just approached in bars by small , dark men with black mustaches . Well , it all turns out to be rather on the Richard Harding Davis side . A friend of ours who is pretty higl ; up in free-lance aviation circles was approached , and told us all about it at lunch the other day . He said he got a telephone call at his club from an old friend , an aviator named Charlie . Charlie said that there was a fellow in town who wanted to get hold of him , and gave him a number to call . He called the number and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding him out cautiously , made an appointment with him at the Spanish consulate . Quite a number of Spanish agents showed up at the consulate to dicker with our friend , he said . Nobody spoke English very well , so our man obligingly spoke broken English , which everybody seemed to understand much better than unbroken . The proposition was , to put it briefly , that the Loyalist government was willing to pay him $5,0110 for organizing a fighting squadron of American fliers ( Franchot Tone , Cary Grant , Wallace Beery , and Clark Gable ) . Furthermore , if he went over himself , he was to receive $2,000 a month in salary , with a bonus of $1,000 for every Rebel plane he brought down . If he or any of his men were brought down , there was to be a consolation prize of $2,000 . The Loyalist agents gave him a day to think about this , making another appointment , this time at a big midtown hotel ( we 're sorry to be so mysterious , but we promised not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told them that he had decided not to take them up on their offer . One factor in his decision was the fact that Bert Acosta , Commander Byrd 's mad co-pilot , now flying for the Loyalist government , had such an agreement , but Acosta 's lawyer , who was to receive his salary , has n't yet seen a cent of it . As nearly as our informant could guess , there are about ten Americans now flying in Spain , all of them for the Loyalists . The Rebels hired mostly Italian and German aviators . The only other New Yorker besides Acosta is Eddie Schneider , a Flushing boy , who used to he manager of the Jersey City Airport . Five Americans , named Bell , Allison , Koch , Lance , and Dahl , sailed December 9th on the Normandie , to go to work at a salary rumored to he $350 weekly . It is n't true , as the newspapers reported , that they received their first month 's salary in advance , as the Normandie sailed ; they got just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stay-at-home aviators had to chip in to give them pocket money . Lots of people here think it 's a fifty-fifty chance that an American consul will have to pay their passage hack . As far as our investigations went , none of the pilots of the big passenger lines went over there . They make between $100 and $2011 a week , it was pointed out to us , and nobody shoots them . Chemist ONE of those very fussy ladies who do their own shopping was in an East Side grocery the other day , and asked for some coffee . " And he sure , " she told the clerk , " that it 's very coarsely ground . " After he had ground it for her , she looked at it doubtfully and said , " Are you sure that 's as coarse as you can get it ? It looks pretty powdery on top . " " Oh , you ca n't help that , lady , " he explained . " That 's just the caffeine . " Campus Ghost WITH the mid-terms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about a young man we interviewed this week . As you will understand , he prefers anonymity , and here we 'll just call him Mr. Smith . He has developed the curious specialty of ghost --  writing students ' term papers , theses , and such things for them  --  an adaptation of political and business methods to the campus that seemed startling to us . He will write on any subject . " All I need to know , " his prospectus states , " is the name of the course , the subject of the theme , the desired grade , and a tentative reading list , if you have one . " When necessary , Mr. Smith will make deliveries within two days . The specifying of the grades is , of course , a precaution , so that a fellow who 's been getting " C " s all term wo n't startle the prof by suddenly turning in an " A " theme . In " C " cases , Mr. Smith writes clown to his clients ' level , splitting a few infinitives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been at his job a couple of years now , discreetly circularizing Eastern colleges from an address on Amsterdam Avenue , and has made quite a go of it ; took in around $6,000 last year . We first got wind of Mr. Smith when an undergraduate friend of ours sent us one of the circulars . They 're headed " Every Man Today Has a Ghost . " We investigated him at once . Mr. Smith turned out to be a thin , pale young man wearing glasses ( you 'd say " Student ! " as soon as you saw him ) and his lair is a ground-floor Hat near Columbia . The university library is frequently useful . He 's Michigan ' 31 , and has a B.A. , an M.A. , and two years ' work on a Ph.D . at Yale . The secret of his success , he told us , is " supremacy of the Ego . You 've got to feel you can write any assignment , regardless . " His prices vary . " New " subjects  --  ones he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15 to $20 or more , depending on the amount of research necessary . Assignments in college courses run fairly true to form , however , and by now Mr. Smith has covered most of them , so usually he has only to rehash something he 's already written , and send it on . In such cases his fee is only $5 or $10 . In spite of frequent and inevitable duplication , no client of his has ever been caught . He once did seven essays on " The Murals of Paolo Veronese " for men in the same class at one of the colleges ; he held his breath , but they alt got by . He claims to have mastered six prose styles  --  from " C minus " to " A , " presumably . College authorities here and there have heard of Mr. Smith , but seem unable to figure out what to do . The president of Smith College wrote him , rather helplessly , asking him , as a gentleman , to lay off of Northampton . He ignored that , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York police onto him . All they could do was to compel him to register his business , which he did  --  as a typewriting agency . Recently , the federal district attorney got after him , threatening fraud proceedings . No one knows how such a case would turn out , but it has him worried ; although , as he says , what would they do about most of our public figures , from Presidents down ? He plans to quit soon now , anyway ; wants to write a novel . That worries him , too , a little . Writing themes is one thing , a novel another ; he 's afraid that all his six styles may be , as he told us , " emotionally immature . "
