' 0 . so long as John L. Lewis was its " dictator " and unless Communist officials in C. I. 0 . unions were repudiated and expelled . A resolution bristling with personal attacks on Mr. Lewis as a " Caesar " and on . Sidney Hillman. of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers as a " Machiavelli " of the C. I. 0. , was adopted tonight with one dissenting vote , that of R. M. Burr of the Ann Arbor Central Labor Council . The report was approved after Daniel J. Tobin , president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , had threatened to leave the federation because- he felt that the recriminations in the report did not hold open the door to peace . Mr. Tobin made a long speech appealing for a sinking of personalities ; - and in an address that was equally impassioned , President William Green blamed the breakdown of the peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his address by asking the delegates if they would " surrender unconditionally " to Mr. Lewis 's demands , Mr. Tobin returned to the platform and denounced this version as " ridiculous " and as " humbug , " saying that no such demand had been made by the C. I. 0 . leader . Many Abstain From . Voting After the cross-fire with Mr Green Mr. Tobin walked toward his seat and was on his way up the aisle when the vote was taken . Many delegates remained in their seats and abstained from voting and only Mr. Burr stood up to oppose the resolution . The report of the resolutions committee , of which Matthew Woll is chairman and John P. Frey secretary , appeai'Rd to the rank and file of the C. I. 0 . over the heads of - its leaders , and asserted that , with the exception of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , headed by David Dubinsky , the C. I. 0 . affiliates were torn with dissension and rife with communism . At the morning session , the convention adopted a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing nine amendments to the Wagner act Theboard was severely taken to task for " infringing " on the authority of the Department of Labor 's conciliation service by acting as mediator in industrial disputes , a task which is not delegated to it under the Wagner act . The resolution suggested that , " if necessary , Congress be asked to specifically provide against - appropriations " to the NLRB being used for mediation . The committee also obtained adoption of a resolution that President that the peace parleys last ter broke down because " It was possible to satisfy the a.mbis of the one man who dominates " d dictates to the C. I. 0 . " Assertthat the paramount question s " the power and the arrogance the overwhelming pride of one n , " it continued : " Confronted ' with such an issue , ere is no solution until the adhers that man deprive him of his hority or until he voluntarily ps aside . He seems not likely o step aside , but there are signs Atifir the other possibility may maigvialize.

Continued From rage One Green ask each candidate for the Senate to declare his intentions for or against confirmation of Donald Wakefield Smith , whose reappointment to the NLRB was opposed by the federation . The officers were directed to " leave no stone unturned " to prevent his confirmation . In opposing the language of the resolutions committee 's report on the C. I. 0 . , Mr. Tobin said he had received 2,000 telegrams praising him for his peace speech last week . He agreed with the conclusion of the report authorizing resumption of peace conferences , but he opposed the five pages of recrimination which preceded the peace suggestion . " That sort of thing spoils the hope of reconciliation , " Mr. Tobin declared . " Calling men betrayers , dictators and Judases will not help . That will not get you anywhere . That 's just personal feeling . I can hate as strongly as any man in this organization , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who elected me . " It was in this connection that he threatened that the teamsters ' union could get along very well without either the A. F. of L. or the C. I. 0 . He urged that the report be returned to the committee for elimination of the bitter sections . " I want to be helpful , but if you or the other side refuse to permit us to build , we will build our own house , the teamsters ' union , " Mr. Tobin added . Mr. Tobin said that " leaving the door open " for peace meetings was a " grand phrase , " but he felt that something further was required , an " honorable overture " for resumption of negotiations . Otherwise , he tween the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . , Joseph Jones , frat delegate from the British T Union Congress , had written cently to President Roosevelt fering to use his personal effor bring peace . In reply , said Green , the British visitor was to see Presidential Secretary vin . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n arranged and he concluded President Roosevelt did not thi an opportune time to mediate , " Mr. Green . Then , continued Mr. Green , Mr. Jones and Ebby Edward the British Miners Federation , came from Canada , had lunc with John L. Lewis and his ciates on Sept. 27 , hoping to ate the labor dispute . Accordi g-these two men , Mr. Green said , neither during the luncheon nor afterward did they have a chance to discuss their hope for mediation . Mr. Green then read the request made last week by President Roosevelt , who expressed the hope that the convention would " leave open every possible door of access to peace . " " Mr. President of the United States , " continued Mr. Green , " your request ' has been and will be complied with . The door is open and will be kept open . " Edward Fiore , president of the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union , who withdrew a unity proposal because he said it had not been passed by his union 's convention , read to the delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal said : " Resolved , that this convention recommends the reopening of peace negotiations with the proposal that and saturated with the virus of communism that its kiss is called the kiss of death , its approval a warrant of death , " it added . The one exception , according to the report , was the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , which had " refused to submit to dictation , " and it was felt that this union would decline to enter the C. I. 0 . convention next month . " We must never foreclose an honorable peace designed to result in a united trade union movement under the banners of the A. F. of L. , " it concluded . " We therefore recommend that this convention authorize the executive council to continue to carry on the battle and at the same time stand ready to respond to any genuine appeal for peace or any honorable and sincere opportunity to reunite the labor movement . " In its report on the NLRB the resolutions committee proposed nine amendments to be presented to Congress . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conform to that which is in the Railway Labor Act , so that it will be obligatory on the board to grant a craft or class the right to select its bargaining representative by majority vote . The power of the board to invalidate contracts must be definitely curtailed . "
