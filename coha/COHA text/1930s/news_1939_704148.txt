txt Faced TT a threat of unprecedented wafare in the American entertainment industry unless immediate action was taken to assure the Associated Actors and Artistes of America that its jurisdictional rights over the theatrical , screen and entertainment industry were affirmed , the executive council of the American Federation of Labor today designated a subcommittee to confer at once with the disputants and to report tomorrow . Matthew Woll of the Photo Engravers Union and Thomas A. Ricket of the United Garment Workers , and possibly Daniel J. Tobin of the teamsters , if he found he could do so , were named to meet tonight with spokesmen for the Four A 's , the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes and the American Federation of Actors . Late tonight it was said that apparently no progress toward a settlement had been made by the committee . New Strike Step Slated Unless the report is satisfactory and the Four A 's is upheld in its jurisdictional rights and the stagehands union is ordered to revoke the charter it issued to the A. F. A. after the latter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken toward calling a strike of motion picture actors at a meeting in Hollywood Sunday night . This was made clear today shortly after the influx of stage and screen stars by airplane and railroad . They spoke militantly on their arrival and they increased their fire when they appeared at a five-and-a-half hour session of the ruling executives of the A. F. of L. on whom they served several ultimatums . Frank Gillmore , veteran actor and president of the Four A 's , bluntly demanded that the executive council instruct President William Green , " who has already taken a position against this international , " that he notify the A. F. of L. affiliates that the American Federation of Actors was no longer affiliated with the A. F. of L. Court Action Threatened His second " demand " was that the executive council void " the alleged charter " Issued by the I. A. T. S. E. to the A. F. A. Unless this action of the stagehands ? characterized by Mr. Gillmore as " one of the most bare-faced jurisdictional raids that I ever heard of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take court action . When the long and hectic session was over Mr. Green summed up the events of the afternoon for reporters . Reporting the explanation made by the stagehands for granting a charter to actors , although he said the stagehands had never asked for authority to issue char. ters to actors , Mr. Green said that the justification offered was that the union of " grips " and " property men " had all through the years felt that they should have jurisdiction over all the men and women engaged in the theatrical and motion picture industry . Further justification for its action in taking over a group of actors was offered in the explanation that the I. A. T. S. E. had helped the Screen Actors Guild win recognition and a contract , and so the men who worked behind the scenery believed they could , according to Mr. Green , " organize the movie industry from top to bottom . " Browne and Whitehead Silent George F. Browne , president of the stagehands union , and Ralph Whitehead , who has placed himself under Mr. Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , preferring to have Mr. Green give an outline of their case . Spokesmen for the opposing groups were less reticent and gave out summaries of their arguments . These consisted of explanations ' by Mr. Gillmore , by President Lawrence Tibbett of the American Build of Musical Actors , Ralph Morgan , president of the Screen Actors Guild , and Kenneth ThomIon , executive secretary of the Screen Actors Guild . These men were represented tolight as being astonished at the lemand , made formally at the ex ; cutive council meeting by the tagehands union for the first time that it have jurisdiction over all actors and performers . Mr. Browne sat with the executive council , of which he is a member . He asked one question . His side was presented by Harry Holmden , vice president of his union ; W. P. Raoul and James Brennan . Tibbett Defends Four A 's Mr. Tibbett , who is chief of one of the four A 's eleven affiliates , told the council that his organization wished to remain in the A. F. of L. , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He defended the right of the four A 's to discipline an affiliate . After asserti. -f that the stagehands had " raided " his organization 's jurisdiction , he demanded that the council " make your decision here and now . " He consented to the appointment of a committee only if it were to begin conferring at once and remained in continuous session and reached an understanding by tomorrow , at which time the council must make a decision one way or the other . In contrast to the twenty-hourhour ultimatum served on the council , Sophie Tucker and Harry Richman , who have remained loyal to Mr. Whitehead in his switch to the stagehands ' union , insisted that they had done nothing to merit a cnarge of " treason " being placed against them by the four A 's . Mr. Green , who reported their arguments to the press , said that these two performers felt aggrieved that they had not been offered a chance to defend themselves . The impression of observers here is that if the four A 's fails to win its point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A. F. of L. and apply for a charter in the Congress of Industrial Organizations . No outright threat of this nature was made today , but indications were that some of the leaders of the actors are seriously considering such a move . Explaining the defense offered by Mr. Whitehead , Mn . Green said that the suspended A. F. A. secretary had said that the financial transactions , covering diversion of accounts from one fund to another , had in no way impaired the union 's resources , that an accountant who examined the union books has found no shortage . " Mr. Whitehead said that he and his associates had refused to appear before the Four A 's trial board because it consisted of men who had made the charges and who were to prosecute the case , " continued Mr. Green . " He said these men found him guilty , suspended his union 's charter and then he applied to the stage hands for a charter . He charged that the other side had acted in bad faith , had been influenced by feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recounting the defense offered by the stage hands for chartering the A. F. A. , which includes variety actors , night club and circus performers , Mr. Green said that the backstage organization had read to the council a statement by the Screen Actors Guild commending it for aid in winning union recognition and a contract from the producers . Aid to Screen Actors Recited " Mr. Holmden said that his union had put its entire organization into the fight for the screen actors who had been unable to get any concessions , " declared Mr. Green . " He said they had made the fight their fight and had threatened to withdraw their members from the studios if the producers did not give the screen actors a closed shop . " The screen actors admitted that they had been aided by the stage hands in the past , and that they in turn had aided them . " Although Mr. Thomson went into a long history of the jurisdiction over actors claimed by the four A 's , Mr. Green maintained to the reporters that last June Mr. Gillmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been specifically defined and suggesting that it should be redefined . In closing the council meeting today Mr. Green made a plea for " tolerance " and for a serious attempt to negotiate an agreement . He felt that the punishment meted out to Miss Tucker and Mr. Richman " did not fit the crime " as " they have committed no drastic offense . " Crowds Greet Celebrities The visiting Hollywood movie stars and actors from the legitimate stage were surrounded by crowds from the moment the first contingent swooped in by air . Wayne Morris was mauled as eager collectors fought for his autograph . A great shout went up when Mischa Auer stepped out of the plane and Mr. Morgan looked solemn as he waved to the waiting throng . Miriam Hopkins , in a white suit , posed for the photographers . Jean Muir , in a black dress , was cheered as she walked to the waiting automobile . Mr. Tibbett laughed and signed his name to cards and slips of paper pushed toward him . Edward Arnold laughed heartily as the crowd nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort , with sirens screaming , was rushed to the Traymore Hotel for a conference . Shortly after 1 o'clock this afternoon the second group of actors and actresses arrived from New York by train . They , too , under police escort , were conveyed in taxicabs to the hotel where a crowd had gathered . Their entrance evoked a chorus of cheers and further demands for autographs . The performers went through the same routine when they left their hotel shortly before 2 o'clock for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel , where the executive council of the A. F. of L. held its meeting . The RitzCarlton had been surrounded by a crowd of several hundred , mainly young people , from 11 o'clock . A great roar went up as the delegation , again under police escort , drove up to a side entrance . The press of people was so great that police had to force their way through before a narrow lane could be opened for the Hollywood players and their associates . In this group Tallulah Bankhead was noticeable and she waved to the throng as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hours this afternoon to get a glimpse of their favorites who were closeted with the council .
