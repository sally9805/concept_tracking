IMPASSIONED PYGMIES-Keith Winter - Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> In the parlor game of ' " Consequences , " unlikely characters are confronted with each other ; their cross-purposed dialog and action are sometimes funny . As a serious literary trick , Plato used the same device ; so did Walter Savage Landor , British Novelist Keith Winter 's latest book is based on this " consequential " ' scheme . Suppose that D. H. Lawrence , surrounded by sycophants , went to Mallorca to die . Suppose Noel Coward , vacationing , became his neighbor . What would happen ? On this lively supposition Author Winter has written a tale that is blurbed as another South Wind but is more like Somerset Maugham 's spiteful Cakes and Ale . <P> Mallorca is called Miramar , Lawrence is Marius , Coward is Andrew Jordan . Marius has two sons , one of whom despises his father and can think of nothing but his future career as a great trapeze artist ; the other , Saul , has left home several years ago but is coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Marseilles Saul meets Andrew Jordan , a " brilliantly second-rate , " phenomenally successful playwright . In their very first conversation Andrew 's shiny sophistication crumples before the hypnotic sincerity of Saul ; by the time they reach Miramar Andrew is in a dither to do something first-rate and make Saul admire him . <P> Meantime Marius ' household pursues its usual temperamental tenor . The five disciples hate each other , scribble notes for their forthcoming biographies ( they all know Marius is dying ) , try to maneuver the sick man into tte -- tte walks . Lewis , " deeply insincere , " has more than one earmark of J. Middleton Murry , one of Lawrence 's biographers . Others are Robert , a timid soul ; his wife Hilda , who married him because Marius suggested it but who nurses a platonic passion for the Master ; Mark , a bully ; Johnny , a poet who is not a gentleman and is very self-conscious about it . Marius ' bovine wife , Helga , feeds them all , pays little attention to their twitterings or shrieks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young married couple , Lilly and Simon , who seem at first happily married . But Lilly , it rapidly turns out , is a schizophrenic : she splits up into three personalities , most potent of them being a nymphomaniac who frightens poor Simon to the edge of insanity . <P> Marius and Andrew meet but find each other uninteresting . Saul 's catalytic presence throws everyone into frenzied activity . The disciples intrigue more furiously than ever ; Simon looks paler every day ; Andrew sits up till all hours writing " a really sincere " play . Saul falls in love with Lilly but casts her out when he finds what she is up to . The dying Marius , in a last effort to get away from his disciples and his own failure , gets Saul to promise he will take him to Africa . Andrew , unable to write a sincere play without being dull , drowns himself . <P> As a satirical portrait of Noel Coward , Impassioned Pygmies is first-rate . As a caricature of Lawrence 's biographers it is catty but acute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fair .
