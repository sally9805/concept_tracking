THE SCENE : A back-drop on which is painted a warm sun , a clean simple landscape of brown earth , one green tree , one flying bird , one brook , one cloud , one skyscraper . Three grammar-school desks . Blackboard . Map . The BOY comes sullenly to his desk , seeming to be talking to himself . The TEACHER is a young girl . The PRINCIPAL is an old man who is dozing in a chair . THE TEACHER Now , John , if a farmer has seven apples , and he gives away three apples , how many apples remain ? THE BOY What kind of apples ? THE TEACHER Any kind . Now , if the farmer has seven , and gives away three , how many remain ? THE BOY What color are the apples ? Who is the farmer ?

( The TEACHER takes the BOY by the ear to the OLD MAN. ) p. 3 THE BOY Who is the farmer ? What color are the apples ? THE TEACHER Mr. Smith , this boy will not answer my question . THE PRINCIPAL What is the question , Mary ? THE TEACHER If a farmer has seven apples , and he gives away three apples , how many apples remain ? THE PRINCIPAL What kind of apples , Mary ? THE TEACHER Why , it does n't say what kind , Mr. Smith . It says seven apples , and gives away three . THE PRINCIPAL Who is the farmer , Mary ? I never heard of a farmer who would give away three apples . THE TEACHER I do n't know . THE PRINCIPAL Well , Mary , you can hardly blame the boy for wanting to know who the farmer is . Are the apples wormy ? THE TEACHER I do n't know , Mr. Smith . But the answer is four . THE PRINCIPAL I hardly agree , Mary . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not a question of how many . My God , what 's the world coming to ? Here , boy , you ask the teacher a question . ( He goes away . ) There is a moment of silence . The subway itself is silent . Then it begins to rattle again . The BOY tries to speak but ca n't . His voice is heard as a whisper , greatly magnified , from the darkness , over a microphone . p. 4 THE BOY 'S VOICE If you have seven , and you give away three : seven and three . Fifty-five , sixty : sixty-five , seventy : seventy-five , eighty : one thousand , two thousand , three thousand , four thousand , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten .

Three , four , five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this manner , a clock ticks loudly , the brightness of the sun increases , the subway roars , and he stands staring at the YOUNG GIRL , who is supposed to teach him about the world , and living in it . When the whispering ends , the clock stops , and the subway quiets down . THE BOY I do n't know what to ask . Can you tell me what is a street ? THE TEACHER Nothing . THE BOY Can you tell me why everything in the world is many things ? THE TEACHER I do n't know . THE BOY Can you tell me why everything changes every minute and is always the same ? Why the apples grow and rot and grow again and rot again and grow again , years and years of apples growing , people living , streets traveling around and around the world ? ( The TEACHER gestures . ) The Subway roars , the sun grows very dim . A light falls on the turnstile . The BOY turns to go . p. 5 THE BOY Can you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a father , brothers , sisters , and the whole world full of people ? Can you tell me who I am ? HE drops a nickel and passes beyond the turnstile . The scene begins to fade . Back to the subway train again . The BOY is seated among the people , staring at everything. @x The Dreamer : A CRIPPLE . He is a small man with an immense deformed chest and short legs . THE SCENE : A back-drop on which is painted an abstract city over which a trapeze swings and makes shadows . The city is full of large staring eyes . The stage is a dance floor . This is the event : The CRIPPLE walks to the Center of the dance floor and in the dim light casts away his deformity , casting away his coat . He lifts himself out of his crooked body and stands tall and free . A slow sentimental waltz . A WOMAN walks to him from the darkness . They dance . THE CITY AND THE WORLD stare and speak : one word : over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music changes louder and swifter . The music ceases and the LADY goes away . The light increases . The CRIPPLE casts away all of his clothes . He is now an acrobat , one whose body is precise in time and motion . THE WORLD says:Look . Look . Still , the CRIPPLE is not pleased . He beckons to the sky and a trapeze falls . He swings on the trapeze . He leaps to the stage , walks on his hands , tumbles . He is showing the world , performing the body of man alive in time and space . He returns to the trapeze : but now it will not swing , and he begins to lose his strength . p. 7 THE WORLD Look . Look . He sets the trapeze into motion , then leaps , off-stage , and falls . Crash and confusion : subway : THE WORLD saying : Look . Look . The stage is empty for a moment .

THE SCENE : Portion of an office , with a desk and a typewriter . The back-drop is an empty movie screen . The Event:The GIRL is at the desk , typing . The CLERK brings her some papers , moving automatically , and goes away without even noticing her . The GIRL stares at the screen , sighs , and begins to type again . The CLERK returns with more papers and this time notices her . It is like a discovery . He is amazed , almost stunned . This beautiful girl , here . In the same place . He would like to speak to her , but can not do so . Staring at her his feeling is articulated : THE VOICE Mary . I love you , Mary . I love you because you are here with me , because you are so small and sad , because you work so hard , because you want so much of fourteen dollars a week , because you are alone . Mary , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank and buy you clothes and a big automobile for each of us , and we will drive to California together .

Mary , we will walk in the sun together . We will run together , Mary . At the river we will take off our clothes and swim together . p. 9 THE GIRL Well , what are you waiting for ? THE BOY Nothing . ( He goes away . ) The GIRL begins to type again .

Flashes of each , all silent , while the GIRL types and stares . THE GIRL Ah . Ah . ( She stands , and begins walking around desk ) Oh , Clark . Oh , Gary . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light increases . The GIRL sits at her desk . The CLERK returns . He stands over the GIRL timidly .

Ah , baby , love me and I will steal money enough to buy you everything you want . Please do n't cry . You 're not alone any more , baby . I love you . He touches her shoulder gently .

I 've got sixty dollars in the bank and I 'm afraid I 'll do something crazy . What the hell are we doing here ? We 're here in the Spring and in the Summer and in the Fall and in the Winter , and outside is the whole blooming world . Why do we have to stay here when there are so many other places ?

He is reading a Yiddish newspaper . Others : A small JEWISH BOY of nine or ten , and his SISTER , several years older . The event is this : The old JEW speaks in Yiddish to these children . The idea is this : Through the dignity of his speech , to capture the passion and fortitude of the Jew in the world . And the tragic humor . During his speech , he laughs . It is hearty laughter , but it is heavy with grief . The scene is this : A portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is painted a vast and angry head of Moses , and a world with closed doors . The entire spisode is accompanied by Jewish music . There is singing , sometimes a male and a female voice together , sometimes a chorus of voices . The music varies as the mood of the OLD MAN varies . The CHILDREN kiss his hand . The old and the new . The wisdom and experience and fortitude of the old . The eagerness and innocence of the young . OLD JEW speaks with rage and fury . The CHILDREN cling to him . There is a sound of multitudes walking . p. 14 The sound of many people walking begins with only one person walking , then two , then three , and so on until it is a multitude ; with Jewish music .

A number of the guests have already arrived when the episode begins . They are talking swiftly , holding glasses . Throughout the episode they talk . They say anything and everything and they say everything in the same way , so that NONE of it means anything . I 'm not going to put down their actual words because it is n't worth it . They talk about literature , painting , sculpture , music , drama , government , religion , writers , poets , painters , sculptors , composers , actors , actresses , movies , politicians , private experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is intelligible , although some words are . THE BUTLER ( I guess they call them butlers . I 'm not sure .

A wink . ) This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he found Berlin and he says he found Berlin fascinating . Then he begins to play the piano. ) p. 18 THE BUTLER ( To the LADY ) All the guests have arrived , Madam . I guess the bogus Count arrived earlier in the evening , through a window . THE LADY Very good , John . You may stand by the door and watch . Please try to seem delighted . THE BUTLER ( A wit ) I am delighted , Madam . Look . ( He makes a delighted face . ) See ?
