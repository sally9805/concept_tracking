From Hankow headquarters of Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek last week correspondents received information which threw a revealing light upon Soviet aid to China in the past ten months . At one time a " majority " of all pilots flying for China were Soviet pilots , flying mostly Soviet planes . The Chinese claimed last week that they have been bartering tea with Moscow in exchange for bombers , that the transaction has been " completed . " <P> No further Soviet planes were being delivered now , according to Hankow officials . China 's fighting pilots are now about half Chinese , half Russian , with more Chinese pilots rapidly training under Soviet instructors . <P> The always nondescript Chinese air force , consisting chiefly of planes built in the Soviet Union , the U. S. , Italy and Britain , was further unstandardized last week by the addition of several German light bombers and a squadron of French pursuit planes . The Generalissimo has disbanded , dismissed the U. S. , French and other foreign free-lance pilots of the famed Chinese Fourteenth Bombardment Squadron , today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
