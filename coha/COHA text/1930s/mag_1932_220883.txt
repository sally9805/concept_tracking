Beaming with paternal pride , two elderly gentlemen entered a room in Manhattan 's Roosevelt Hotel one day last week to greet two young men and to listen appreciatively to what the young men had to say . The juniors were Lieut. - Commander Thomas G. V. Settle , U. S. N. , winner of the James Gordon Bennett Trophy in this year 's International Balloon Races in Switzerland ( TIME , Oct. 10 ) ; and Ward Tunte Van Orman who finished second . They had just returned from Europe via Graf Zeppelin and South America . <P> The oldsters were retired Broker Alan Ramsay Hawley , a round-faced , grey-haired gentleman who won the International in 1910 ; and famed old Aeronaut-Poet Augustus Post , an arresting figure of lordly carriage , with grey trowel beard , curling mustaches and somewhat rambling speech . He was Mr. Hawley 's co-pilot on the 1910 flight in which they made an unofficial distance record which has never been surpassed-1,172 mi . Other oldtimers. proud of their kinship in the venerable clan of ballooning , came to congratulate Settle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilfred Bushnell , a portly , moon-faced Navy officer ; and Roland J. Blair who , like Pilot Van Orman , works for Goodyear-Zeppelin Corp . ) There was white-shocked Capt . Horace B. Wild , 61 , who 40 years ago exhibited two ' chute-jumping goats and later ( 1905 ) became the dare-devil aeronaut of Chicago 's " White City " amusement park . His eyes are still red and watery from a 1910 crash which all but cost him his sight . With him was Roy Knabenshue who barnstormed for years with Capt . Wild in their dangerous little " rubber cows " ( small dirigibles ) .
