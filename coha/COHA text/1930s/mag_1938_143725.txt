In Hamburg last week the Nazi judge of non-Aryan Shipowner Arnold Bernstein ( TIME , Nov. 29 , et ante ) made sure that the Fatherland will secure possession of the Red Star and Arnold Bernstein Lines ( Garage Ships ) . At the end of a complex trial the court fined him $400,000 , sentenced him to two and a half years in jail . <P> In the dock Prisoner Bernstein had confessed to many technical sins of omission &; commission , such as can scarcely be avoided by anyone doing big business through the Fatherland 's bewildering network of foreign exchange restrictions . The State had demanded a fine of $1,800,000 and imprisonment for five years . Hence <P> Nazis were proud that " Bernstein got off easily , " proud of his trial . <P> " The word ' Jew ' probably has not been used once during this trial , " declared the court proudly . " Herr Bernstein did not stand in the dock as a Jew but simply as a businessman who had broken German law . " <P> His most heinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect conspired to pile up in Manhattan a secret fund of some $100.000 which otherwise would have gone partly to other U. S. creditors , partly to Germany in taxes . " This Bernstein did , " snorted the judge , " for purely egotistical purposes ! "
