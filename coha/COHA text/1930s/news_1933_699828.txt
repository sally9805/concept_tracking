txt Will Rogers Would End Tax Exemption in Bonds To Use Editor of The Ncto York Times : SANTA - MONICA , Cal. , June Now we went off gold . That is you had a government bond , and it said they would pay you in gold , now they wo n't . Well you can alabi the situation , but that is repudiation . But they claim it was necessary , and we needed the money . Now if they can do that in an emergency , why - 'ca n't they pass another one to do away with the exemption on all tax-exempt bonds ? There would be more jus-t -- tics in that , for everybody bought ' em just to evade the tax . In. other words , we knew we were buying a stolen car when we bought it . But that 's why we bought it . When you repudiate all taxexempt bonds you only beat ' em out 3 or 4 per cent , but when you repudiated the gold it will take years to find out what you beat him out of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
