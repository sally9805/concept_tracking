Natives of the northern mountains of India believe that cholera is a six-handed demon with no feet . Therefore it can not leave its habitat in India 's lowlands until some traveling hillsman comes along , upon whom it can lay its many clutches . Actually the cause of cholera is a microbe shaped like a comma , which enters the body only through the mouth , infests the digestive tract , irritates the bowels to such extent that they extract and eject quarts of fluid from the body . A victim of cholera may die-shriveled and cold from dehydration , uremia and toxemia-within four or five days of exposure to infection . <P> Primitive and scientific explanations aside , by last week 16,500 inhabitants of the northwestern mountains of India had died in a cholera epidemic . Frantic sanitarians had vaccinated 600,000 persons , doused thousands of wells with germicidal potassium permanganate to halt an epidemic which began the end of April . Nonetheless , the epidemic has spread northwesterly into Afghanistan . <P> This worries the sanitarians of the Western World .

S. as late as 1911 , and the disease has been kept out of the country since only by close medical inspection of every sailor and traveler who enters a U. S. port .
