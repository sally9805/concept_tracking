Like dogs whipped for something they did not understand , 60 kinky-haired Wakamba tribesmen huddled on the floor of the Nairobi Railway Institute fortnight ago and gazed hopefully at the judge sitting behind a deal table on the stage . The Railway Institute can be used as a theatre . It has an orchestra pit , folding chairs and well-equipped fly gallery . Seldom had the professional hunters , coffee growers and tradesmen who crowded the back of the hall witnessed such a drama . <P> The 60 Wakambas had beaten an old woman to death . For this British justice demanded the death penalty . Their defense was childishly simple : The old woman was a witch , well known in the district . She had cast a spell over the senior wife of the Chief , a wife for whom he had paid many cows , and the expensive wife had sickened . Therefore the witch was dragged to the sick woman 's hut and ordered to remove the spell . <P> " Bwana , " cried the spokesman , " she only removed half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men of the village took sticks , chased the witch and beat her to death , which is the accepted punishment for witches in East Africa . For this the white man 's government was demanding their death . Sixty Chicago policemen sentenced to death for shooting a racketeer could not have been more puzzled . Standing in an unblinking row the tribesmen heard the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Kenya sentence them all to be hanged by the neck until dead . The Chief Justice understood Africa as well as the law . Privately he recommended them to the Governor 's clemency.
