The Duke of Windsor 's only sister Princess Mary , the Princess Royal of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , arrived in Austria with her husband the Earl of Harewood last week , first member of the British Royal Family to visit Edward VIII since his abdication . The Baldwin Cabinet , as London newspapers printed last week , intervened recently to prevent the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent from going to Vienna . On the platform was Edward , as the Princess Royal 's train rolled in . Her favorite brother ever since they both had to pose in bothersome robes and coronets as budding regalites ( see cut ) , she greeted him as the English do when they are too overwhelmed with emotion to manage more than a shy triviality . Said Mary to Edward : " Well , you do look fit . " The onetime King-Emperor , apparently on the verge of tears , could say nothing at first as he and the Princess Royal gripped hands , while Lord Harewood discreetly fell into conversation with photographers . By next day Edward VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assiduously through the miles-long corridors of the late Emperor Franz Josef 's Schonbrunn Palace . In its theatre a party of giggling girls began-throwing kisses at the Duke of Windsor and he spent some time blowing kisses back at them with a curious two-finger gesture . There was no scrap of evidence , plenty of rumor that the Princess Royal and Harewood , who was recently appointed an Aide de Camp to new King George , had come to discuss the Duke of Windsor 's finances . Bills for debts he contracted as King are being rapidly settled in London , the biggest check being $600,000 to Cartier , but beyond that nothing has been done about the $125,000 per annum which the Duke continues to expect to receive , either from Parliament or from his family . Drawled the Duke to the Princess : " If the worst comes to the worst I can always pick up a living showing people around Schnbrunn ; I know it so well . "                    @
