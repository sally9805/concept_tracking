Wound up in Zurich this week was a ten-day international aviation meet which offered a fine chance to the nations of Europe to show how they were getting along with human and mechanical preparations for the ' ' War in the Air . " Military planes and pilots held the stage and Germany , at least , took full advantage of the occasion , competing in all events which she thought she could win , avoiding others . She won the meet hands down , taking first places in the speed , climbing &; diving , and solo Alpine circuit races in the new Messerschmidt pursuit planes with which she has decided to replace her Heinkels . Germany also won the Alpine circuit races for three-plane patrols and multimotor bombers . Captain Michy of France won the altitude contest in a Mureaux-113 by climbing 10,000 metres ( 32,800 ft. ) in 20 min. 6 sec . <P> The Alpine circuit was a dangerous 352-mi. triangle crossing a 3,000-ft. range to Thun , thence over the 13,000-ft . Jungfrau to Bellinzona , the last lap over 11,000-ft . Scheerhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it in 58 min. 52.7 sec. of flying time and the Czechs , flying not quite up-to-date Avias were second in little over an hour . Their elapsed time , however , was less than that of the Germans . Meet crowds showed a tendency to cheer the Czechs , jeer the Germans . <P> Most hair-raising escape from death was that of Germany 's baldish , grinning Major-General Ernst Udet , Germany 's No. 1 stunt flier whose stunts include flicking a handkerchief off the ground with his wingtip and who apparently bears a charmed life . After the War , in which he brought down 62 Allied planes , Udet was forced to bail out more than once , on one occasion barely managing to kick himself free of the falling wreckage of his plane in time to open his parachute . Few hours after last week 's accident , which occurred while Udet was competing in the Alpine circuit for solo pursuit planes , the German stunter nonchalantly described it to New York Times Correspondent Clarence K. Streit , who reported it thus : " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blinding flash . His three-blade metal propeller became entangled in the cable supporting the trolley , and the monoplane whirled around . The tail flew off , but General Udet 's luck remained . The cable was mounted on pulleys and counterweights , which allowed it to run out with the plane . The cable stood the shock of the 950-h.p. machine moving at 100 miles per hour . It held the remains of the plane , checked its speed , and , relatively speaking , eased it to the ground . With a scratch on his left arm the German ace stepped out of the wreck .
