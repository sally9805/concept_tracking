Frederick Doell of the German Consulate climbed the subway steps into the chill , clear Brooklyn afternoon , trudged eight blocks to a quiet , dead-end street , turned off at the second house in a row of five brick-and-frame cottages . <P> Mr. Doell mounted the porch steps , rang the bell . Nobody answered . The front shades were drawn . He rapped sharply on the glass door-panels ; still no answer . <P> Mr. Doell walked round to the back of the house , hastily turned his back on a Jewish cemetery which faces the rear door , and rapped again . The door key was on the outside , the door unlocked . Mr. Doell went in . It was 1 p. m . <P> The house was quiet . Mr. Doell went through the carefully furnished rooms on the lower floor . Without pausing to admire the objets d'art from the Orient and the Near East , Mr. Doell mounted the stairs . Through the open door of a bedroom he noted a rumpled bed , a blue bathrobe flung carelessly over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom slippers . He peeked into a study packed with books , filing cabinets , a globe . On the floor an Assyrian water pipe , two-thirds-filled , caught his eye . <P> Mr. Doell went to the back of the house , entered the master bedroom . On a three-quarter-size bed , on top of the covers , lay the man he had come to see : Dr. Walter Engelberg , 42 , secretary of the Consulate . Dr. Engelberg was dressed in an old-fashioned white nightgown , his hands folded peacefully across his chest , the fingers extended . His head had been smashed by three blows . Obliterated were two sabre scars , marks of duels . He had been dead 24 hours . <P> That was why quiet , efficient Dr. Engelberg had not reported for work . Mr. Doell called the police . Headlines exploded : Was this an international political crime ? <P> On the chance that it might be , police photographed everything in sight , prepared to make meticulous reports to the German Embassy in Washington , moved through the six rooms foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many on nudism . There were scores of photographs of naked men , many middleaged . Neighbors had noted that no women went to see black-haired , squat Dr. Engelberg ; that his servants were men , his numerous visitors were men . <P> In the bathroom , police found ten bloody fingerprints of a man 's hand ; in the front room , bloody handprints on a nightshirt hung on the doorknob . In the garage , near 18 heavy packing cases , was a pile of 100 used light bulbs . Prize clue , the police considered , was the size-11 bedroom slippers . They set a policewoman translator at the Doctor 's desk , soon had a list of eight suspects . At week 's end they were hunting a heavily muscled young third-rate prize fighter called " Swede , " had traced him to a Florida-bound bus . All the paraphernalia of an international murder mystery surrounded the case : only the motive was missing . <P> Almost as if it wanted the case closed quickly , Berlin sent word that " authorized sources " considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The murder . . . will be traced to the jealousy of his dearest Roehm mate .
