txt Code for News Photographers . Your editorial on the rights of privacy of citizens as against the photographer is welcome . The pages of the newspapers which pander to curiosity about personal affairs are filled with photographs which obviously must have been obtained in violation of the rights of privacy . A code of decency for photographers was suggested in your editorial . Everything , however , should not be left to them to decide . As a start , why can not the proper authorities rule at once that no photographer is to be permitted in a hospital to take pictures of the wounded and the dying ? We see too often the results of what complacent doctors and nurses in second-rate institutions ( perhaps desirous of publicity ) permit in this respect . And can not cemeteries refuse to allow photographers to take pictures of the bereaved at the grave ? By all means have the photographers adopt a code ; but let the public dictate part of that code .
