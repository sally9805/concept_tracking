Filed in Cleveland 's probate court last week was an estimate of the estate of Oris Paxton Van Sweringen , elder of the legendary bachelor brothers whose joint holdings in real estate and 23,000 miles of railroads before Depression were worth $100,000,000 . The value of the estate was placed at some $700,000 , most of it in life insurance . <P> Brother Mantis James Van Sweringen , who died last year , left only $3,067.85 . <P> In fortune if not in fame the Van Sweringens at the time of their deaths were just about where they started 20 years ago when they stepped from real estate into railroading . <P> Surviving " O. P. " and " M. J. " Van Sweringen is another Van Sweringen who is known in Cleveland as the " forgotten brother " - Herbert C. Van Sweringen . <P> Now 68 , he was never associated with his younger brothers except in their early real-estate days . The only member of a family of five children who ever married , he continued in real estate until 1925 , when he retired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house their brothers originally built in their swank Shaker Heights development , were taken care of in " O. P. 's " will . <P> The real heirs of the Van Sweringen empire were the two septuagenarian Midwest industrialists who backed the brothers last year when they bought back control of their vast rail and real-estate properties at public auction in Manhattan ( TIME , Oct. 7 , 1935 ) . These backers were George Alexander Ball , 74 , Muncie ( Ind. ) fruit-jar tycoon and George Ashley Tomlinson , 70 , Great Lakes ship operator . The two George A. 's together put up $3,121,000 to buy the key collateral pledged by the Van Sweringens for defaulted loans from a J. P. Morgan &; Co. banking group , setting up a concern called Midamerica Corp . as a new super-holding company for the Van Sweringens . What the Brothers Van Sweringen got was a 10-year option on a controlling block of Midamerica common stock , together with the right to vote it in the meantime . <P> With no other investment except their native resourcefulness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the most spectacular comeback of their generation . Under the arrangement with their backers , however , they could not bequeath this potentiality in their last will &; testament . Control of Midamerica reverted to Messrs . Ball &; Tomlinson-principally Mr. Ball . Since neither of these gentlemen cared to cope with the discouragingly complex Van Sweringen corporate setup , they had to find a successor to Brother Oris Paxton . <P> Last week they found him in the person of Herbert Fitzpatrick , vice-president &; general counsel of Chesapeake &; Ohio Ry.
