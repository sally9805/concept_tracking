Top praise in the cinema industry are the annual awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &; Sciences . At the Academy 's Annual Banquet last week , where some 1,200 guests included practically every real and fake celebrity in the business , the Academy bestowed its most publicized prize-that for the best U. S. performance of the year by an actress-upon a young woman who a year and a half ago was unknown in the U. S. and had never appeared in the cinema anywhere . She was MGM 's Luise Rainer . The role for which she was rewarded-Anna Held in The Great Ziegfeld-was the second of her cinema career . In addition to giving the best performance of the year in The Great Ziegfeld , Luise Rainer ( rhymes with " shiner " ) gave highly distinguished ones in her first picture , Escapade , in which , newly arrived from Vienna , she became a star overnight when Myrna Loy refused to play the lead , and in The Good Earth , released too late for consideration last week .
