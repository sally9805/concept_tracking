THE WEDDING-Grace Lumpkin-Furman ( $2.50 ) . <P> Five years ago proletarian novels appeared , if not quite as frequently as the strikes they celebrated , at least more frequently than they have since . Leader of this radical literary movement was Grace Lumpkin , whose To Make My Bread was one of the first U. S. proletarian novels as well as one of the best . Last week she published her third novel , a slight , simple story of a Southern wedding , which is as far from the subject of her first book as a picket line is from a pulpit . The Wedding is an interesting novel in its own right . But it is more interesting as an indication of how the proletarian novelists are developing , of what they find when they leave the union halls and look at things on the other side of the tracks . <P> Story of The Wedding is just the wedding . Jennie Middleton of Lexington on the Santee River is going to marry Dr. Gregg , a newcomer to the sleepy Southern town which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time is 1909 . The night before the ceremony they quarrel ; Jennie says she wo n't marry a man who has sworn at her ; mother , father and the doctor 's friend act as peacemakers ; the Confederate veterans assemble to take part in the ceremony ; the minister refuses to have Confederate flags in the church ; the groom begins to drink ; when the time comes Jennie goes to the altar , just as everyone knew she would . <P> What makes The Wedding an original and provocative piece of work is Grace Lumpkin 's attitude toward the ceremony . <P> Jennie 's pathetic , irritating , irrational and commonplace little rebellion is not merely an outbreak of Southern emotionalism . It is , rather , the last stand of her independence . All society , exemplified by aunts , veterans , parents and brothers , seems to be forcing her into a complicated ritual which has nothing to do with her relations with the doctor . As a result all the trappings-the flags , costumes , bridesmaids-seem as quaint and unreal as an anthropologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jennie surrenders , but only after she has discovered , by making eyes at the best man , that there is more than one way of getting her way , that conforming to society 's demands may not mean so much after all .
