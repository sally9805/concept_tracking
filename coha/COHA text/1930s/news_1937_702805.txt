txt The United States Government wants two things ' understood which a lot of folks apparently live misunder-stood : 1 ? It is not looking for women to go to Alaska . 2 ? It has no Virgin Island houses to rent to mainlanders for $5 50 a month . The situation  --  and if you 'd see the letters you 'd realize there is one  --  developed in the wake of two sprightly bulletins from the Department of the Interior . The first announced there are twoand-a-half times as many white men as women in the nation 's vast northern territory . The second explained three low-cost housing projects had been opened on the Virgin Islands with rents ranging from $3 to $6.40 a month . The ink had hardly dried on the items before reaction began . " I am ready to leave for Alaska at once , " wrote a New Jersey woman , " please send fare and the route . " " We are three girls , " read another letter , " how do you think a tea room would go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enclosed find slip . Kindly write me about it as I would like a little home . P. S. ? Is it $5.50 a month and how do you reach it ? " And from Brooklyn : " I am very much interested . Can you tell me about hotel and restaurant possibilities or give me some work as I am a cook . P. S ? If there is no employment in the hotels , what kind of work is there besides ? " Facts are : There are still 21ii times as many white men as women in Alaska , and , if you established residence and live for two years on the islands , you can rent a house If there are any to rent . But do n't write the Goveinment Its office workers are tired of corresponding on the subjects .
