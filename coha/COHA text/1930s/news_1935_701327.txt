txt The Ethiopian Situation . LONDON  --  Italy was reported yesterday to have proposed the ceding of part of Ethiopia to avert war . She also asked a further zone of Italian influence . Foreign Secretary Hoare is to announce the British stand in the controversy in the House of Commons today . ADDIS ABABA  --  Ethiopia demanded a meeting of the League Council to avert the threatened Italian invasion . Further , she asked that neutral nations lift their bans on the exports of arms to her . Britain is expected to lift her ban . GENEVA  --  The League is unlikely to act quickly , lest an open break with Italy be provoked . BASLE ? It was reported that Premier Mussolini was preparing to foment a revolt among Ethiopian feudal lords by bribing them with silver . Italian Proposal Reported . 13y ** T. ISIRCIAASS ... Special Carole to Tao Siam Woo . Trams LONDON , July ** proposals for settling the Italo-Ethopian quarrel are under consideration in London tonight . They are generally attributed to Dino Grand ' , the Italian Ambassador . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of Ethopia as an independent nation . In outline the new proposals are : That Italy should receive in the hinterland between Eritrea and Italian Somaliland and the original provinces of Abyssinia , a zone in which she would exercise political control . That behind this zone should be a further zone of Italian influence formally recognized by Ethiopia , roughly Analogous to the Italian sphere of influence outlined in the Franco-Italian-British treaty of 1906 . That in this latter zone Italy should have a free hand to put the country in order , especially supervising the suppression of slavery . Three Apportioned Ethiopa . The treaty of 1906 is the famous document in which Britain , France and Italy apportioned to themselves spheres of economic influence in Ethiopa while recognizing Ethiopian Independence . The treaty has been regarded as an indication of the ultimate partition of the country among the covetous aspirants . If Italy now takes over her share it is not difficult to imagine how long the others will refrain . The British Cabinet met today and while nobody but its members is supposed to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the European situation and the problem of Ethiopia occupied its attention to the exclusion of almost everything else . There is substantial ground for believing that Sir ' Samuel Hoare , the new Foreign Minister , outlined to his colleagues certain principles of British policy in Europe that he will incorporate in his speech to the House of Commons tomorrow when it stages its full dress debate on foreign affairs . It will be Sir Samuel 's maiden speech in his new capacity as the head of British external policy and important for that reason wholly apart from the critical situation that has evoked this debate . There is further reason for believing that his speech will not be a mere statement of the course of current events . It is extremely probable that with the Cabinet 's consent Sir Samuel intends to make a thoroughgoing declaration of British policy , the frankness and directness of which may surprise some of those awaiting it . It will probably cover not only the Ethiopian situation , but also the recent Anglo-German naval accord and the consequences arising from it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hoped soon to initiate . In quarters that are likely to be able to forecast the official atti- tude in these matters no disavowal or criticism of the naval accord is expected for the excellent reason that the government is still convinced that it should be classed as a British success , since it commits Germany to respect British predominance on the seas . However , if Sir Samuel defends either the method of its negotiation or its precipitate effectuation some of his colleagues ' will be surprised . If he indicates these are not likely to provide a precedent for future negotiations it will be only in accord with the general official sentiment . In harmony with recent utterances of his chief , Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , Sir Samuel is also expected to insist upon future collaboration with France as the foundation of British European policy . It is the Ethiopian problem and Great Britain 's attitude toward it , however , that most interest the House of Commons . It is extremely probable that Sir Samuel 's speech will reveal this attitude , framed on realistic lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith by sitting upon sharp nails is understood not to commend itself to this government , nor does it consider this the proper moment for a ceremonial dance before the ark of the League of Nations covenant . It is more probable that Sir Samuel will picture the covenant as a mechanical contraption for use in the service of peace and , as such , adaptable to current necessities . In other words , the role of a solitary knight errant defending the Ethiopian damosel in distress does not appeal to this government as practical and Sir Samuel is not expected to adopt it . The idea is , rather , that if there is unanimity at Geneva about Ethiopia , well and good ; Great Britain will share in it . But there will be no Anglo-Italian clash over the Ethiopians , whatever happens . Peaceful Solution Still Sought . Officially , Great Britain has not abandoned hope of a peaceful solution of the Ethiopian difficulties , no matter what private convictions on the point may be . The latest efforts are understood to be directed toward bringing about consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour to persuade Italy to adopt some compromise instead of further antagonizing World opinion . The efforts are being associated with the presence in London of Joseph A. Avenol , Secretary General of the League of Nations . However , the practical difficulties to be overcome in carrying out such a scheme are fully realized . Nevertheless time presses  --  and this is where the British find themselves confronted with a difficulty of their own creation  --  because when the League provided for the Scheveningen Arbitration Commission the British insisted that if it broke down the League Council should set a definite date for reassembling to deal with the matter . That date was set for July 25 . If it is kept anything may happen . The conversations with Mr. Avenol are understood to concern this particular factor and the reasons for the Council not meeting are interesting . Such a meeting is being characterized as " inadvisable , " " unwise " and " not helpful " if not downright harmful . It is pretty certain the Council will not keep its date , whatever reason may ultimately be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
