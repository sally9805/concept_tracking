" Well , what ? " " You run by me here , " said Dennis . " Why ? " " You want me to show you , doncha ? " " Uh huh ! " " Well , just run by me here . Get over there by the stove and run by me , " said Dennis . Bob went back by the stove and ran forward . Dennis put out his foot . Bob was spilled on the floor , landing on his face . He cried . " That 's a dirty trick , " he said , getting up , still crying . Dennis laughed . Bob went out to the kitchen , crying and rubbing his eyes with his sleeve . " Ma , Denny tripped me and hurt me , " he said to his mother . " Shut up and stop bawling , " Lizz said . " He tripped me , " Bob sobbed . Lizz glared at him and grabbed the stove poker . Bob dodged past her and got between the kitchen stove and the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get out of there , you shyster ! " " Well , I did n't do nothing , " said Bob . " Get out of there and let me get at you , falling and cryinglike a bunch of pisspots ! " Lizz screamed . Bob did n't answer . He stood there , alert and watchful . His mother shook the poker at him . " Come here to me or I 'll lay the poker over your head ! " " I did n't do nothing . It was Denny , " Bob said . " Get the hell out of here and stop bothering me so I can do some work around this dirty kitchen . If any more of you come crying to me , I 'll split your heads with the poker . Get out of here before I lose my patience , " Lizz yelled at him . Bob ran out of the kitchen . She sighed , and went to the dirty dishes in the sink.  | DANNY and Bill lay on the parlor floor of the cottage , the soles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . They had a clear aim at the back wall in the dining room and they were shooting at a tin plate which they had placed on the couch by that wall . The little kids were out playing in the back yard , and Mama was in the kitchen . Danny and Bill were pretending that they were with the American Army in Mexico , fighting the Mexicans . They were somewhere in a desert , and the army was advancing , to go all the way to Mexico City , and then the Mexicans would all be conquered . They were a company of American infantry , but they were outnumbered five to one by greaser soldiers and bandits . They were being attacked and fighting for their lives , and if they were beaten it would be bad for the whole American Army . And if they were captured , they 'd be tortured , because Mexicans were bandits , and they were n't civilized , and they 'd torture American soldiers . Danny cocked his BB gun and pulled the trigger . He did n't hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pretended a Mexican was killed . Bill shot . They heard the resounding note as the BB smacked the tin . " One less greaser . Another Mexican hit the dust , Dan , " Bill said , smiling . " Yeah , but you 're not supposed to call me Dan . I 'm Buck , " said Danny . " That 's right , Buck , " Bill said . " Now watch them , Snake . They 're creeping along on the desert , and there 's some of the greasers behind that mound of 202 NO STAR IS LOSTp202sand there . Watch out for ' em . Tricky bastards , they are , " Danny said . They pumped BB 's into the wall without a hit . " We 're losing our aim . Better shoot straight , watch ' em close . Ca n't waste our ammunition , Buck , " Bill said . " We got to hold out . I hope Crabeye Pete got through to the colonel and brings us reinforcements and more bullets , " said Dan . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got to stick here and watch ' em close , and when you shoot , Buck , shoot straight , " said Bill . Bill looked through the sight on his gun , aimed very carefully , held his gun steadily and pulled the trigger . They heard the resounding ring of the BB 's striking the target . " That dirty Mexican 'll never kill another American soldier , Buck , " Bill said . " That 's the way to shoot , Snake , " said Danny , wishing that he could do as well as Bill . Danny looked carefully through the sight on his gun . He tried to make himself hold his gun unwaveringly . He aimed . He had it this time . His hands wavered and he lost the target . He aimed again . While he tried to get his aim straight , Bill made another hit . Four for Bill . None for him . Danny quickly pulled the trigger , hoping for a chance hit . He missed . " I got four notches more in my belt now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't shootin ' like you did when we was in the Philippines , fighting them damn greasy Filipinos , " Bill said . Danny aimed . " That 's the stuff , Buck , " said Bill , hearing Danny 's next shot resound against the target . " That greaser 's dead as a doornail . I hit him square , " said Danny proudly . He sat up , his pocketful of BB 's rattling . Bill grabbed his arm . " Those bastards are all around , Buck , and they play musicp203with their Mausers , if they get a shot at you . Lay low there , Buck , " Bill said . Danny ducked down and stretched out on the dirty carpet again . He aimed and missed another shot . Bill and he kept on shooting steadily . There were two more hits , making seven in all . Danny 's mind was full of a vision of Mexico . He had seen things about Mexico in the movies , and pictures in the papers and in a copy of the National Geographic magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around him , full of Mexicans with big hats , greasy , cruel faces and mustaches , and himself with this small company of American soldiers in khaki that had to fight against odds like Custer for Uncle Sam and Old Glory that had never fallen in defeat . He liked this game ; he aimed again , hitting the pan for the second time . If he shot the BB gun long enough , he 'd learn how to aim and shoot . But he could n't shoot as well as Bill . He could n't do anything , it seemed , as well as Bill could . They shot . Bill was shooting a lot of Mexicans in this game . Anotherone for him . " I hope the rescuers come before it gets dark . We 'll have a hell of a time at night here , Buck , in the desert with greasers all around us , " Bill said as they reloaded their guns . Lying on the carpet and again shooting , Danny seemed to freeze with fright . He was not Danny O'Neill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trying to hit a tin plate . He was an American soldier in the Mexican sands , and the afternoon was passing , and he and the soldiers with him were fighting for their lives , and if reinforcements did n't come by night , they might all be massacred like Custer 's soldiersin Custer 's Last Stand . But if a soldier died for his country , he would n't go to Hell . He 'd been told that in a catechism lesson . That was martyrdom . He shot , trembling . He was going to be killed by the Mexicans . Bill yawned and suddenly stood up . " Hey , they 'll get you , " Danny said.  | " I 'm tired of this . I done enough of it . Let 's quit . It 's more fun shootin ' pigeons with the guns , " Bill said . Danny relaxed from his fright and got up . " But say , Dan , it would be fun , would n't it , if it was real instead of playing like we done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " said Danny . " Well , maybe we 'll go to war to fight the Germans or the French in this war in Europe , and I 'll be big enough to go , " Bill said . " But you might get killed , " said Danny . " I 'm always lucky , " said Bill . Danny sat down on the couch , holding his BB gun between his legs . " You know , Dan , this is good practice . I never thought about it before , but this gives me an eye , and the next time there 's a fight with the niggers I 'll drag this out if I 'm around . It 'll be handy , and the target practice do n't hurt me none , " said Bill . " And maybe if I 'm here , I 'll have my gun and shoot the niggers , too , " said Danny . " There was a fight this week . Our kid brother Denny was in it , and Mama raised hell , and so did Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or he 'd kick hell out of him , " said Bill . " But we might knock their eyes out with BB 's , " said Danny , " They all carry razors . If they got a white kid alone in a dark alley in their neighborhood , think they 'd care if they slit his throat ? Remember the time when we was still living down at Twenty-fifth and La Salle , and we was going to Mother 's , and walked over to take the el at Twenty-sixth ' Street ? The gang of nigger kids tried to get you just as you was walking up the elevated steps after me , " Bill said . " And the nigger kid that grabbed me , he grabbed my wrist and told me to come along with him , " said Danny . " Anything might 've happened to us , only for that whitep205telephone man standing there that told them to cut it out , " said Bill . " That was a close shave , " said Danny . " None of the kids around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger ai n't like he was part of the human race . That 's why they always go over and fight them by the viaduct . But now they are n't fighting them . There 's lots of cops in the neighborhood because of the fight with the Saint Marthakids . But there 's gon na be more fights , do n't worry , " Bill said . " Jesus Mary and Joseph ! " Lizz suddenly exclaimed from the dining room . " What 's the matter , Mama ? " Danny asked , surprised both by her sudden exclamation and the tone of voice in which she had uttered it . They saw their mother examining the wall against which they had just been shooting . " We should n't have shot in the wall , " said Danny . " Mama 'll get over it . She goes up in the air and then gets over it , " Bill said . " What were you two doing ? " " We were playing with our BB guns , " said Danny . " We did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look at what you did to the wall . You shot it all over , and the wallpaper was bad enough without your having to rip it worse , " Lizz said . " Gee , I did n't think of that , did you , Dan ? " Bill said . " Me , no , " said Danny earnestly . Carrying their guns , they went to examine the wall . They saw that BB 's were lodged in the wall quite thickly near the pan , and that the wallpaper was torn in many spots . " I do n't care so much . It ai n't my house . But maybe your father wo n't like it . He takes a pride in his home , your father does , " Lizz said.  | " Gee , we did n't think we were doing anything wrong , did we , Bill ? " Danny said . " No ! You know , Ma , it just never came to us that we 'd hurt the wall , " Bill said . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , because I did n't want you gettin ' into trouble on the street with your guns for fear a cop would grab you , " said Liz/ . They examined the dented wall with continued amazement . " These guns got power , ai n't they ? " Bill exclaimed . " They 'll hurt if they hit you , " said Danny . " You be careful with them guns . They 'll put somebody 's eye out if you ai n't , " said Lizz . They still looked amazed at what they had done to the wall . " Come out and have a sandwich before you go to the ball game . It was nice of your uncle to send you the money for it , too , " Lizz said , going back to the kitchen . They followed her . " The Cubs got the Sox going , two games to one , " said Bill as he and Danny sat at the kitchen table with raisinbreadcheese sandwiches and cups of tea before them , the tea whitened by thick , condensed milk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Danny . " We 'll see about that . And the Braves are three to nothing . Nobody but a real National League fan ever expected that , " said Bill . " The Athletics might come back , " said Danny . " Bushwah , " said Bill . " Son , why did n't you bring your little sister Margaret down with you ? " asked Lizz . " Aunty Margaret was home this morning , and Little Margaretwanted to stay with her , " said Danny.  | " She did ? Why ? What 's your aunt saying to her to turn her against your mother ? " asked Lizz . " Nothing . Little Margaret wanted to stay , and Aunty Margaretsaid she did n't trust me taking her on the street car , " said Danny . " She did , did she ? " Lizz said , frowning . " But , Ma , if Dan 's going to stay all night , there wouldn'tbe room for her to stay , too , would there ? " Bill said . " There 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Little Margaret likes school , she says , " said Danny . " Girls always like school better than guys do , " said Bill . " I do n't see why they did n't send her to the Sisters ' school , " Lizz said . " They were afraid that it was too far and would be too far for her to go in winter when it 's cold . They said next year when she 's bigger they would , " said Danny . Lizz poured herself a cup of tea and sat down at the table with her two boys . " Your father would have liked it if your sister was here tonight , too . He gets paid and he 's bringing home a nice supper , " Lizz said . The three of them sat at the table in silence . Lizz looked at her boys , her eyes going from one face to the other and back again . " Your aunt ai n't drinking again then , is she , Son ? " Lizz asked Danny , and Danny shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silence . " Where 's Uncle Al now ? " asked Lizz . " I do n't know . He 's away , but I do n't know where . " " They did n't tell you not to tell me where he is , did they ? " she asked , watching his face closely as she spoke . " No . I do n't know , Mama , " said Danny . " When you go home , if I call you up , will you find outp208and tell me , and not tell your grandmother and aunt ? " asked Lizz . " No , I wo n't tell them , " Danny said . " I want to write and ask him to help me . Those ones up there guard him and wo n't let him give me anything , " Lizz said . Again there was silence . Lizz saw that they had finished their tea and sandwiches . " Here , let me get you more , " she said , getting up . " We 'll have to be going soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches . " Yeah . But we 'll get seats , all right , " said Bill . " Gee , I 'm sorry the season 's over , " said Danny . " Next year 's another year , and the Cubs 'll cop it , " said Bill . They sat waiting for the food . Lizz served them , and again sat down to her tea . Bill and Danny poured several full spoons of condensed milk into the tea . " What time will you boys be home ? " asked Lizz . " We 'll be home early . The game starts earlier than in summer , " said Bill . " Be home before your father is here , " said Lizz , taking a sip of tea . " We will , " they said together . " If you get back in time , I want to run across the street to confession this afternoon , " Lizz said . " We 'll try , Ma , " said Bill . After finishing , they got up in silence . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiss your mother goodbye , " she said . They both kissed her casually and left , happy at the prospect of seeing the city series game between the Cubs and White Sox.  | It WAS Saturday . There was no school on Saturday , and all the kids liked Saturday because there was n't . On Friday , kids would tell each other that tomorrow was Saturday and they 'd all be glad about it . They liked that because they could play all day . His brother Danny had come down to see them , and was going to stay all night . Bill and Danny had gone to the baseball game . Uncle Al took care of Danny , and Danny wore clean waists , and Mama always said that her son Daniel had the best of care at the O'Flaherty 's . Dennis wanted to go to the ball game with them , but they would n't take him . It was no fun having big brothers . It was only fun having little brothers . You could tell them what to do , and if they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick in the pants and make them do it . You could treat your little brothers the way your big brothers treated you . Dennis and Bob left the yard to go out . Arty followed them , but they shagged him back . " Go on , get back . You 're too small , " Dennis said to Arty . " Arty go bye-bye , " Arty yelled , following them through the front gate . Dennis got sore . He told Catherine to take care of Arty and keep him from following them . They led Arty by the hand back into the yard . " Take Arty bye-bye , " Arty exclaimed . " Where you going ? " Catherine asked them while sitting in the dirt in the yard and digging with an old fork . " Mind your own business , " Dennis said , acting important . " I 'll tell Papa , " said Catherine.  | " Go ahead and see what you get , " Dennis said to her , thinking she was just a little tattletale anyway . They left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dennis liked to do this , to go away from home and the yard , and walk and play around the neighborhood . " Denny , buy some candy , " Bob said , tagging along beside him . " I ai n't got no money , " Dennis said . " I want some candy , " Bob said . " So do I , " Dennis said . Walking along , they saw all different kinds of people on Wentworth Avenue , and there were lots of stores . Bill went to the store for Mama . Dennis did too , sometimes , but not so much . He did n't like to be made to go to the store . When he got bigger , he 'd be made go to the store a lot . Bill went down to the store at Twenty-fifth Street twice a week and came back with a box of groceries . He brought home animal crackers . Catherine always got a box of animal crackers for herself . If Bill got only one box of animal crackers , she took them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody . " Look , Denny , " Bob said , running to a bakery window . They looked at a luscious chocolate cake in the window , and then at a cocoanut cake beside it . Near the cakes were charlotte russes and sugar buns . Their eyes roved back and forth and then were fastened on cupcakes , rich with vanilla and chocolate frosting . " Gee ! " Bob wistfully exclaimed . " When I 'm a man , I 'll be rich and buy windows full of cakes like that every day , " Dennis said . With wanting eyes still riveted on the contents of the window , they stood there . Bob suddenly looked up at Dennis . " Will I get some of ' em ? " he asked . " Maybe I 'll give you some , and maybe I wo n't , " Dennis said . Bob 's face grew sad . He gazed at his bigger brother , hisp211eyes seeming almost to expand . He could say nothing . He could do nothing but look up sadly . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It depends on what you do . " " What ? " Bob asked hopefully . " I 'll see . If you do what I want , when I grow up and be-. come rich and buy cakes every day maybe I 'll give you some , " Dennis said . " I will , " said Bob . " Promise , " Dennis commanded . " Uh huh ! " " You 'll do anything I tell you to ? " asked Dennis . Bob shook his head up and down . " You 'll do anything I say ? " Dennis asked . " Honest , I will , " Bob said , meaning it . " Now , do n't forget . You promised me . Onct you do n't , you 're gon na be out of luck . You get that ? " " What you want ? " Bob asked . " Come on , let 's get a move on , " Dennis said , turning from the window and grabbing Bob 's arm . Bob pulled back . Dennis walked on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bakery window . " Hey , you said you 'd do what I said , " Dennis said curtly . " Yeah , " Bob said , turning from the window . " I told you to come on , " Dennis said . " Yes , " Bob said . " Well , come on , " Dennis said . Bob followed his brother along the sidewalk . " Whenever I tell you to do something , you got ta do it . Do n't look in windows , " Dennis said . " Let 's play I 'm Papa , " Dennis said . " And whom am I ? Bill ? " asked Bob . " No , you 're my horse , " Dennis said . " What do I do ? " asked Bob.  | " I 'm driving you and you pull my wagon . When I say giddyap , you run . When I say whoa , you stop , " Dennis said . " Then if I do , can we play I 'm Papa and you 're my horse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you got ta do what I tell you to do . I 'm Papa . You say I 'm Papa , " Dennis said . " I 'm Papa , " Bob said obediently . " You ai n't . I 'm Papa . Tell me I 'm Papa , " Dennis said . " You 're Papa . " " And who are you ? " " I 'm your horse . " " Who am I ? " asked Dennis . " Papa . " " Who are you ? " " You 're Papa 's horse , " said Bob . " Who 's Papa 's horse ? " Dennis quickly asked . " I 'm Papa 's horse . " " You said I was . Do n't do it again . Now , who are you ? " " I 'm Papa 's horse . " " All right , get ahead of me and stand there , " said Dennis . Bob obeyed . " Giddyap ! " Dennis called . Bob ran and Dennis ran behind him , pretending he was holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every few feet . He was Papa on the seat of an express wagon , and he was driving it just like a man , just like Papa . " Whoa ! " Dennis yelled . Bob halted . " Now , let 's play something else , " Bob said . " Shut up ! You 're a horse . Horses ca n't talk , " Dennis said . Bob stood facing his brother , waiting for him to say something . " Turn around and wait like you was a horse , " Dennis said . Bob obeyed . Dennis pretended that he was delivering apackage . He ran up to a dry-goods-store window , stood therea minute , looking into the window but not observing thep213miscellaneous contents . He turned around , came back to where he pretended the express wagon was and went through the motions of climbing up onto the seat . There he was now , seated on the seat , snapping his whip , just like Papa would do . " Giddyap ! " he called . Bob ran . Dennis , older and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on , slapping his buttocks as Bob zigzagged in and out and around the groups of people walking along . " Run straight ! " Dennis commanded . Bob tried to run straight , except when he had to dodge around somebody . " Giddyap ! " Bob tried to run faster , still trailed by his brother . " Whoa ! " Bob ran on over four sidewalk squares . " Whoa ! " Dennis said angrily . " I 'm stopping to play I 'm going into a saloon to get a glass of beer . A horse just waits , stands still . Do n't you move a speck , now , " Dennis said . Bob stood in the center of the dusty sidewalk . Dennis went over close to the dirty window of an unlet store with iron fronting below the window . He made believe he was in a saloon , and went through the motions of drinking a glass of beer . He stood there and pretended he was drinking another and talking with a man beside him . " Denny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . " Dennis pretended to finish his glass of beer . Then he pretended to wipe his lips . He ran a few steps and imagined again that he was climbing up onto the wagon . " Giddyap ! " Bob ran along the sidewalk . Dennis followed , slapping Bob 's buttocks continually.  | " You ca n't do this , " Dennis said , and he showed what hr meant by holding air in his mouth until his cheeks were blown and puffed out ; then he let the air out , making a slight blowing noise . " Do it again , " Bob said . Dennis did , deliberately making more noise as he let out his breath this time . " I can too do it , " Bob said . " You ca n't , either , " Dennis said . " I can too . " Bob imitated Dennis . " There , " he said . " That was n't right , " Dennis said . " It was too . " Was not . " " Why ? " asked Bob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't what I did , because you 're too young and do n't know how it was , " Dennis said . " I 'll show you , " Bob said . " Go ahead , " Dennis said . Bob repeated , imitating Dennis more obviously , making more noise with the emission of air . " I told you you could n't do it , " Dennis said . " I did too do it , " Bob said . " When you 're old enough to go to school and fight niggers , you wo n't be so dumb like you are now , " Dennis said . " I ai n't that . " " What ? " " Dumb . " " You are . " " I 'm not . " " You ca n't catch me , " said Dennis . " You got longer legs than I got , " said Bob.  | " Catch me . Dare you , " Dennis said . " I ca n't . I ai n't got long legs like you got . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He and Bob stood facing each other for a moment . Dennis dodged beside Bob and ran about six yards away . Bob looked at him . Dennis faced Bob , jumping up and down , ready to dodge and spring away again if Bob came after him . " Come on , you baby , catch me , " Dennis challenged . " Catch me , " Bob said , suddenly running in the opposite direction , pumping his legs as he ran , trying to make himself go as fast as he could , determined not to be caught . Bob lost his balance . He staggered . Just as he did , Dennis came upon him with a shriek . Bob fell . He started to bawl . " Aw , what 's the matter now ? " Dennis asked . Bob still bawled . " What yuh cryin ' for , yuh baby ? You ai n't hurt , " Dennis said , standing over Bob . " I ai n't cryin ' , " Bob sobbed . " You 're bawling like you was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right knee , and still crying , Bob got up . " If you fell and hurt your knee , you 'd cry , too . I seen you cry when you fell down , " Bob said , the tears streaming down his dirty face . " You 're a liar , " Dennis said . Bob looked at his knee . His black stocking was torn andthe flesh was bruised , with blood and dirt in the cut . " Come on . The next time you 'll know better not to falldown , " Dennis said , walking ahead . Bob sniffled , wiped his eyes , and walked on after Dennis . " Where we going ? " Bob asked , walking northward along Wentworth Avenue with Dennis . " This way , " Dennis said . " Why ? "  | " If we 're gon na walk , we got to go some way , " Dennis said . " Why do n't we walk that way ? " Bob asked , turning to point his left arm in the other direction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They walked along without talking . Wentworth Avenue was filled with a Saturday afternoon crowd . The greenpaintedstreet cars clanged by , and there was a steady flow of horse-drawn vehicles and automobiles . Dennis and Bob wove zigzag through workingmen going to the stores or standing in front of and emerging from saloons , drunken men , kids like themselves , girls with doll buggies and real baby buggies , women marketing , fat women , women in shabby clothes carrying bundles , carrying babies , dragging along young children who were just able to walk , women standing on street corners gossiping , old peasant mothers and grandmothers with shawls covering their gray heads . A drunk almost fell in front of them . Dennis began staggering , and Bob imitated him , Dennis ' actions a burlesque of the drunken man 's , Bob 's a burlesque of Dennis ' . " Hey , you ! " a man called , running out of a store . The two boys stopped and gaped at a fat man in a dirty white apron , thinking he was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob drew back several paces . " Your mother owes me a dollar and forty-three cents , " the man said in self-righteous anger . Both boys looked at the man . " I want my money from your mother , " the man said , and passers-by stopped to watch him . He began waving his arms and talking to strangers . " She sends this one and I give her credit . She never pays me . " " Now you said a mouthful , Smitty , " a young fellow in the crowd said . " That 's not honest . I give credit , I do n't get my money . How am I going to run my business ? " the storekeeper asked  | " Are you going to wait on me or not ? " a stout woman in a frayed brown overcoat said , coming up to the man . " Huh ? " he asked , and the crowd laughed .

The woman in the brown coat folded her arms and frowned at him . " Look ! " she said , taking a crumpled dollar bill out of a small pocketbook . " Do you want to wait on me , or do you want to yell at little babies ? " " Yes , Mrs. Black . I wanted to ask this boy for my dollar and forty-three cents . Ah , these Irish , " he said . He turned to Dennis . " Tell your mama to pay me or I 'll get the police after you . " " Hey , get a soapbox , " a wit in the crowd said , drawing laughter . " Come , Mrs. Black . You 're good , you pay your bills , " the man said , going back to his store . Dennis slipped through the crowd , and Bob followed him . " What was the matter ? " " Mama owes him money , " said Dennis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na get Papa after him , " Dennis said . " Can Papa lick him ? " " Papa can lick everybody but God , " Dennis said . " Why can he ? " " Do n't ask me questions , " said Dennis . Dennis held his right foot in his hand , and hopped . Bob did also and lost his balance . He fell down . He jumped up . He followed Dennis . He strolled over to a dry-goods-store window . Dennis followed him . " You do n't want to look in here , " Dennis said , standing beside Bob while Bob continued to stare at the array ofp218cheap goods , yards and bolts of bright calico and other stuff , handkerchiefs , baby things , overalls , blue and black men 's shirts , pins and needles , buttons , hooks and eyes , lacy stuff of various sorts , all of it crowded into the window .

" he called . Dennis strolled on . " Denny ? " Bob called . " Hurry up ! " Dennis yelled back , his voice shrill , its echo suddenly drowned out by the rumbling of a passing street car . " I 'm coming , " Bob called . " Did you get your eyes full ? " Dennis asked . " I wanted to look at the window , " Bob said . " What 'd you see ? " " Things , " said Bob . " What things ?

" What do yuh want now ? " " What would happen if Arty swallowed all the pins and needles I saw in the window ? " Denny did n't answer .

" Gee , that 's funny . " " Hey , " said Dennis . " What ? " " Mama said Papa gets paid today and we get meat for supper , " Dennis said . " Gee ! " exclaimed Bob . " When Papa gets paid , we get meat to eat , " said Dennis . " I like meat , " said Bob . " Who do n't ? " " I do , " said Bob . " I heard Mama tell Papa to bring meat home for supper and he said he would . I heard them talking about meat this morning , " Dennis said . " Goody , " Bob said . " I wish Papa got paid every day , " said Dennis . " Why ? " " Because if he did , we 'd get meat for supper every night , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go askin ' questions again , " Dennis said . " Well , why ? " asked Bob . " Because Papa brings home meat when he gets paid , " Dennis said . " Gee ! " exclaimed Bob . " Listen ! " said Dennis . " What ? " asked Bob . " You watch yourself . Do n't grab too much meat . Pa gets sore if you grab too much meat and do n't let everybody else get any . He beat me up with his razor strap because I did it last time he brought meat home on payday , " said Dennis . W y ? " . " Because he wants everybody to eat meat , and not you , you hog , to eat all of it . He gets sore . Once he beat Bill because Bill ate too much meat . Papa said he 'd show Bill doing that , not leavin ' any meat for anybody else . So you just do n't grab all the meat Pa brings home tonight . It hurts when Pa gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wo n't , " Bob said . " If you do , do n't say I did n't tell you , " Dennis said . They walked on in silence . Each seemed to have become suddenly absorbed in his own boy 's thoughts , and there was a faraway expression on both of their dirty faces . Dennis began to walk pigeon-toed . Bob imitated him . Dennis then made himself walk bowlegged , and so did Bob . They laughed , and started wiggling from side to side as they walked on , liking it when people on the street looked at them . Bob picked up a piece of tin foil and put it in his pocket . " Gim me half , " said Dennis . " No . Because I 'll have to tear it if I do , and it wo n't be so big , " said Bob . " All right ! Keep it ! " Dennis said . " It 's the same color as money , " Bob said , feeling the tin foil in his pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ? " Dennis asked  | " Buy candy and cakes . What else could you do ? " Bob asked . " I do n't know , maybe see a nickel show , " said Dennis . " Why ai n't it money ? " Bob asked . " ' Cause it ai n't , " Dennis said . " If it ai n't money , what is it ? " asked Bob . " It ai n't money , " said Dennis . " What is it ? " " Silver that comes with candy and tobacco like the tobacco Pa gets to chew and smokes sometimes , " said Dennis . " I wish it was money , " said Bob . " Me , too . " " We could buy lots of cakes and candy then , " said Bob . They walked on , Bob holding the tin foil in his pocket . He suddenly walked outside of a lamppost at the edge of the curb . Dennis went over near the stores and began touching store windows . Bob did likewise . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along every store window . They passed a group of girls who were playing hopscotch on marked-off squares on the sidewalk . They stopped touching windows , and Bob walked on , dragging his feet , making a scraping sound with each step . " Bum ! Bum ! Bum ! Bumb ! " Dennis began muttering over and over again . Still dragging his feet , Bob imitated him . " You got to do everything I do ? " Dennis asked . Bob did n't answer . But he ceased making bum-bum sounds . He darted ahead of Dennis , turned around , walked backward until he bumped into a lamppost . " Thought you were smart , " Dennis said , laughing . " It did n't hurt me , " Bob said . Bob pointed his finger at Dennis and yelled , " Bang ! Bang ! " " Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! " Dennis yelled , pointing his finger at Bob . Dennis chased Bob , and both of them kept yelling , " Bang , Bang . "  | " Is this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bob asked . " Uh huh ! " Dennis muttered . They stood in front of a motion-picture theater on Wentworthnear Forty-third Street . There was a ticket booth , and a narrow stretch of tile behind the booth . There were several doors . On either side of ' the booth there were photographs advertising the features for the day . They went to one of the boards to look at the pictures . " What does it say ? " Bob asked . " I ca n't read all the words , " Dennis said . " I know what it is , " Bob said , pointing to a picture of a United States marine who stood before a petty officer on board a warship with the sea in the background . " What ? " asked Dennis . " He 's a sailor , " Bob said proudly . " The pictures must be about ships and sailors , " Dennis said . " Denny , why do moving pictures move ? " asked Bob . " I donno . They move , " Dennis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funny , " Bob said . " I can spell out all these letters , " Dennis said , pointing at the board . " Do it , " Bob said . " All right . THE , The MAR I N E. I do n't know what that means but it must be some kind of a sailor , " Dennis said . " I want to see the nickel show , " Bob said . " Ask the man to let us in , " Dennis said . " You ask him . You 're bigger , " Bob said . " You do it . You 're littler than me . Maybe he 'll let us in if the littler one of us asks him , " Dennis said . Bob went to the ticket booth and reached his hand up , trying to look over the counter . " Tickets , Sonny ? " asked the man in the booth.  | " I want two tickets , " Bob said . " That 's a dime , Sonny , " the man said , handing out two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and handed them to him . " I told you you 'd get ' em , " Dennis said . " What 's the idea ? " the man from the ticket booth asked , suddenly standing over them and grabbing both boys by the scruffs of their necks . " I wanted tickets to see the nickel show , " Bob said . " Where 's your money ? " " Here , " Bob said , digging into his pocket and handing the man his tin foil . " You kids better run along . You got to have a nickel each to see the show , " he said . They looked at him , scared . He released them . They walked away . " I had the tickets , " Bob said . " We did n't see no show , " Dennis said . " If we got in the nickel show we 'd a seen ships and sailors , " Bob said as they walked along slowly . " Uh huh ! " Dennis said wistfully . " I like to see cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sailors . " " I like to see moving pictures , " Dennis said . " Papa gets paid tonight . Maybe he 'll give us nickels to see the nickel show , " Bob said . " You ask him , " Dennis said . " I asked for the tickets . Your turn now , " Bob said . " If you ask , I 'll let you go with me , " Dennis said . " You always make me do things , " Bob said . " I 'm gon na take you , ai n't I ? " " I ai n't no baby . I know my way here alone , " Bob said . " All right . If that 's the way you feel about it , I shouldworry . Ony do n't ask me to let you play with me any more , " Dennis said.  | " Let 's play cowboy and Indian , Denny , " Bob said . He ran down the street and bang-banged as he pointed hisfinger . Dennis followed him in a galloping trot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall down , you 're dead . " Bob fell down . Dennis stood over him with his finger pointed at Bob . " You 're dead now . " Bob got up . He stared at a passing horse and wagon . " If that was Papa , we 'd get a ride , " Dennis said . " It ai n't Papa , " Bob said . " I wish it was . Maybe he 'd let me drive his horse , " Dennis said . " I 'm going to be like Papa and drive a horse when I 'm a man , " said Bob . " Me , too , " Dennis said . They walked on . It was getting toward dusk , and the street was noisy with the sounds of traffic . They walked on , touchingwindows , Dennis first and Bob behind him.  | THE kerosene lamps were lit , and their odor pervaded the entire house . " Jim , we have our whole family here except my Little Margaret , " Lizz said with joy while Jim stood over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night with us ? " Jim asked . " Of course he is . He 's my son , he came to see his mother and father today , he did , " Lizz said . " I 'm glad he did , " Jim said . " He 'll never forget who his mother and father are , " Lizz said . " I hope to God not . Not if I got any say in it , " Jim said . Jim seemed preoccupied . He bent over the stove and turned over the hamburger balls . He suddenly jerked his head back so as not to get hit by the flying grease which began popping out of the pan . " They went to the ball game today , and when they came home I sent them to confession . They can watch the little ones while you and I go tonight , " Lizz said . " You did n't give them any money , did you ? " Jim asked . " Poor as we are , where in the name of God would I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating them like the sons of a rich man ? My brother sent his nephew the money , " Lizz said . " It 's not that I begrudge them anything . There 's too many things we need now for us to be letting them waste money , what with another mouth we 'll have to be feeding next spring , " Jim said.  | " We know that somehow our Daddy Long Legs will provide , and God will help him , " Lizz said . " It seems a long time ago , do n't it , Lizz , old girl , since we got that money when Bill broke his leg . But it did n't last long . Damn it , I 'd wanted to get your teeth fixed with that money , and we never managed it , " Jim said . " The time will come for that , " Lizz said . " Well , we got to save our nickels now . We got to pinch ' em , " Jim said . " Say you , I 'll have you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't say you were , " Jim said . " Ah well , Daddy , the Lord always provides for His own , " Lizz said . " Yeh , " Jim said wearily . He watched the frying hamburgers , and Lizz set the table . The kids in the other rooms were noisy . " Hey , you kids , come on and eat , " Jim called from the kitchen doorway . " Papa , we got meat tonight ? " Dennis asked , coming in first . " Yeah , come and eat . Your mother and I ca n't wait all night for you . We got to go over to church , " Jim said . The others followed , Arty tagging after Catherine . Danny came in after Bill , shy . " You came down to see your folks , did n't you ? " Jim said to Danny . " Yes , Papa , " Danny said , still shy . " Well , you 're always welcome at your father and mother 's . After all , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , " Jim said , noticing that Danny was so much better dressed than any of the other children . Jim glanced at the table . The kids were all seating them/selves , and Lizz was putting the little fellow in his high chair . He saw that Danny had n't sat down yet . " Sit down . Make yourself at home . Do n't act like a stranger at your father 's table , " Jim said . " I am , " Danny said meekly . He sat down beside Bill . Jim saw how all of his kids except Danny were so eager to eat , sniffing the smell of the meat . His eyes fell on Catherine . Her face was dirty and she sat looking intently at Bill and Danny , shifting her attention from one to the other . He saw that she was tightly clenching her fork . It was always hard for a father to know what was inside the heads of his kids , and particularly of a girl . He watched Bill . Bill was leaning slightly forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table and sat down opposite Lizz , with the kids lined up on either side , Little Arty in the high chair on Lizz 's left . " Listen , you kids . There is n't too much to go around here . Do n't be grabbing more than your share . If I catch any one of you doing that , cheating a brother or sister , I 'll tend to the one that does , " Jim said . Lizz got up and went to the stove to serve , Jim reaching over to hand her the plates one by one . She gave him the first plate of hamburger , putting two balls and several large spoonfulsof carrots on it . She began serving the kids . She put two meat balls on Danny 's plate , and gave the others only one . She took half a hamburger for herself and put a few bites of it on Arty 's plate . " Why do you give him more than his brothers and sister ? They do n't get meat every day , " Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Guest , hell , he 's our kid , " Jim said . " I got too much to eat . I do n't want two of these , " Danny said quickly , with a defensive note of apology in his voice . " Yes , you do , " Lizz said . The other children already were eating voraciously , except for Arty , who was struggling with his food.  | " Take one back . If there 's any left , they 'll divide it equal and equal , " Jim said . " Please , Mama , take one back . I ca n't eat this much , " Danny said , handing his plate down to his mother . She reluctantly took it and pushed one meat ball back into the frying pan . Then she handed the plate back to Danny , who was pale and nervous . He began eating slowly . They were all silent , as they ate ravenously . In no time the kids had cleaned their plates . Bob picked his plate up to lick it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn . Put your plate down , " Lizz said sharply . He set down his plate , passed an anxious glance at his mother and then at his father . Jim 's lips compressed for a moment . " Ma , I want more meat , " Dennis said . " We 're going to have meat tomorrow , and more of it than tonight . Fill up on bread and carrots for tonight and be thankful for what you got , " Jim said . Dennis looked disappointed . He ate the carrots his mother had given him , and a large slice of bread that was spread thickly with oleomargarine . He reached for another slice of bread , while Lizz was dishing second helpings of carrots to the other children . He began smearing oleomargarine all over the bread . " Do n't take it all . You got others here waiting for some of it , " Jim said with authority . His voice produced a sudden state of tension at the table , and it was manifested by the silence and the concerned expressionson the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug away at his food , pushing and fighting it , spilling bits over the board , getting his face greasy . The kids sat waiting , even breathing with a slight irregularity . " Jim , the Lord will always provide , " Lizz said . " I know , Lizz . And , God , I 'm not begrudging . But when there 's only so much food and so many mouths to feed , one ca n't let one have it all . They 're the same flesh and blood herep229and they got to be one for all and all for one . This is a family , and it 's got to learn to stick together now , " Jim said . " The poor children are hungry . Here , Dennis , let Mama butter your bread for you , " she said . Jim 's face sank . He shrugged his shoulders in a gesture of helplessness as he watched Lizz coating Dennis ' bread with chunks of oleomargarine and then covering the oleomargarine with sugar . " I want to have the kids eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to get too much and the others nothing , " Jim said . " This is our family , not the war in Europe , " Lizz said . " When you got only so much , one ca n't have everything , " Jim said . They continued eating . Lizz gave Jim another meat ball , which he guiltily and shyly ate . " Papa , can Denny and I go to the nickel show tomorrow ? " Bob suddenly asked . " No ! " Jim said , flaring into sudden anger . " I do n't want to go . I did n't tell you to ask Papa . Pa , I do n't wan na go to the nickel show , " Dennis said . " You do too . You told me to ask Papa , " Bob said . " I did n't ! " Dennis said . " I do n't care who wants to . There is n't the money for you kids to be going to shows . You ought to be glad to get something to eat . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your mother here never gets to go anywhere , " Jim said . " Danny and Bill went to the ball game , " Bob said , " Your uncle gave them the money , that 's why they went , my Bobby-boy , " Lizz said . " Why does n't Uncle Al give some money to me ? " Bob asked . " If you do n't ask too many questions , you wo n't get yourself in trouble , " Jim said , looking at Bob.  | " Why ? " asked Bob , and again the children were thrown into a tense state of fear and apprehension . " Because your father told you that if you do n't ask too damn many questions , you wo n't get into trouble . Now , keep still and finish your supper ! " Jim said as he dug his fork into what remained of his meat ball , conveyed it to his mouth , and chewed grimly . They finished supper in silence , eating Ward 's cake and drinking tea . Jim got up from the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window on the street , the houses , sidewalk , paving blocks , all flooded with moonlight . " Your father is in a temper tonight and you kids must n't make him angry or he might put the razor strap to you , " Lizz said . " I did n't say nothin ' . It was them , " Catherine said . " I did n't do nothin ' , " Dennis said . " You kids keep your mouths shut and stop scrapping or we 'll all get it in the neck . Shut up ! " Bill said . " Mither ! Fither ! Down , Mither ! " Arty exclaimed . " Catherine , let your brother down , " Lizz said . " Oh gee ! " Catherine said . " Do what you 're told , " Lizz said sternly . Catherine took Arty from his high chair , sighing because he was heavy . Arty ran bowleggedly to his father in the front , exclaiming : " Fither ! Fither ! Fither ! " " Now , you kids be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed and go over to church , " Lizz said , starting to carry the supper dishes to the sink . Bill and Danny sat close to the lamp at the dining-room table , playing the world series between the Braves and Athleticswith the Steel 's game . Arty yawned on the floor , holding a piece of cardboard . Catherine sat next to Bob on the couch with her chin cupped in her hands . Both of them were silent.  |p231Dennis  sat at the table , removed from his older brothers , doing simple examples in arithmetic . Jim and Lizz were in the darkened parlor , talking in low voices . " But what do you do with the money ? " Jim said , a puzzled quality in his voice . " Merciful God ! " Lizz exclaimed . " Never mind that . Ca n't you answer a simple question ? " Jim asked . " With all these little mouths to feed ! Merciful God , what do I do with what he brings home ? " Lizz exclaimed , flinging her arms above her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brooding back and forth across the parlor . " We got to live within our means , " Jim said . " We do , " Lizz said . " Then why do we owe bills to every damn storekeeper in the hull neighborhood ? I was coming home tonight and a Jew on Wentworth Avenue ran out of a store and collared me . He said , Mr. O'Neill ! ' I looks at him , wondering what the hell does he want ? I felt like taking a punch at him . And he says to me that my wife owes him three dollars . For Christ sake , I want to know where the money goes ! Down a sewer ? Where ? We do n't have meat hardly twice a week . Where in the name of Jumping Jupiter does the money go ? " Jim said . Lizz sighed . Jim stood in the center of the room , his long arms hanging at his sides . " Ah ! " she exclaimed . She sighed again . " I only wish to God I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you stay home and take care of this regiment and make ends meet on a pauper 's wages . " " I guess if it was that way we would n't be any better off , or any worse off , either , " Jim said gloomily . " We got to pray and ask the Lord for everything to get better and our cross to be lightened , " Lizz said.  | " Pray , hell ! We need money . A man 's pocketbook is his best friend , " Jim said . " Oh , do n't I know it ! " Lizz said . " Well , old girl , our pocketbooks are n't such good friends , " Jim said . He pulled a plug of tobacco out of his pocket , bit into it , chewed with his cheek puffed out . Little Arty came into the parlor . Jim turned and picked up his youngest child . " Ah , you little beggar , " Jim said tenderly . " He 's Mama 's Angel Child , " Lizz said . Jim walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . Bob and Catherine came to the stove dividing the two rooms and watched . " When they all grow up , we 'll be better off , " Lizz said . " Sure , and when we 're dead we 'll be better off , " Jim said . " Look at them watch their daddy , " Lizz said , pointing atBob and Catherine ; they smiled . " Lizz , the little beggar is asleep . Come on , put him to bed , and I 'll get the others in bed and we 'll go , " Jim said . Lizz arose . " Give him to me . He sleeps like an angel , Jim , " Lizz said , and Jim gently gave Arty to the mother . " Papa , rock me to sleep tonight ? " Catherine said . " Come on , " Jim said . He picked up Catherine , carried her with him to the rocking chair , and rocked slowly , while the dice rattled on the Steel 's board . " I love my Papa , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim said . " I am , " Catherine said . " What are you going to be when you 're a big girl ? " Jim asked her . " Papa 's girl . Papa 's big girl , " Catherine said . " Ah , you 're a deep little one , " Jim said ; he kissed her onp233the forehead . She snuggled against him , and he stroked her hair . " Jim , come on . Let 's get ready to go , " Lizz said . " She 's asleep , too , " Jim said . " No , I 'm not , " Catherine said . " Well , you ought to be . Come on and go to bed . Your father 's going to church . Come on , Bobby , you too , " said Jim . " We ought to hurry , Jim , " said Lizz . " All right , " said Jim . " You should go to confession more often . You have n't gone since you made your Easter Duty , " Lizz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? " said Jim , carrying Catherineto the bedroom.  |p234DANNY  and Bill lay at the head of the bed , and Bob was at the foot . Dennis was sleeping on the dining-room couch , with a blanket and an old coat thrown over him . There was n't much room in the bed . Bill tossed a lot in his sleep and kept pulling the covers off everyone without knowingwhat he was doing . If you pulled them back , you might wake him up , and he would be sort of half asleep and half awake , and when he was woke up and got like that , he was just as liable as not to swing on you , and you might get cracked in the jaw . Bob was tossing and moving around at the foot of the bed , too . Danny was n't used to sleeping like this . He did n't like it , sleeping here all night at Mama 's and Papa 's . There was no room in the bed . He did n't like the darkness . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room was very different from the smell of the bedroom where he slept at home . The smell here was musty , and it made him feel dirty . He did n't know what made the smell except the bed and the dirty sheets and blankets , and it was musty . The sheets were stiff , and he did n't like the blankets touching him . He did n't get the same feeling out of the sheets and the bed that he got at home . He always liked the clean sheets , with the bed made , sinking in , the soft feeling of the mattress , the clean sheets over him and the warm blanket . And no smells in the bedroom . Here , the smell and the bed and everything made him feel dirty . And he was itching . He reached down and scratched his knees . There was no light in the house and everyone else was asleep . He wantedp235to go to sleep and he could n't . He did n't want to be here . Why was he ? Itchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scratched it . He hated to be itchy this way . He wanted to go home to Mother 's and stay there , and he belonged there and did n't belong here . You were supposed to belong where your mother and father were , but he just did n't feel that way . Papa had got mad at supper , too . He was afraid of Papa . He 'd been afraid that Papa was going to sock him . Papa hurt a kid when he took a poke at him , and he hurt , too , when he beat your can off with his razor strap . Uncle Al did n't use a razor strap to sharpen his razor . He used what was called a safety razor . A safety razor cost more money . But Papa was poor and Uncle Al was n't . He just could n't think of Uncle Al being as poor as Papa was . Why was he so itchy ? He was getting itchy all over , and bites like mosquito bites were coming up on his legs , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching something . Mother was always afraid of letting him come down to Mama 's because she was afraid he was going to catch something . When he left the house this morning , Mother had said to him : " Son , be careful . Be careful you do n't catch anything . You never got the whooping cough because I took good care of you , and do n't catch anything down there . " Once Mother had told Mama she did n't want him going to Mama 's because she did n't want her grandson catching things at Mama 's and Mama got sore as blazes and raised hell and shouted . He remembered that Mama said to Mother : " Say you , my house is clean and we 're clean . I 'll have you know that . " Would n't he ever stop itching and getting these bites , and would n't he ever get to sleep tonight ? He never knew what to say when he was talking to Papa . He never knew but what Papa might get sore any minute . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to talk to Uncle Al , even though it was sometimes hard to talk to Uncle Al . One of thep236differences between talking with Papa and talking with UncleAl was that he knew some of the things , at least more of the things , that would make Uncle Al sore than he did the things that would make Papa sore . And why could n't he go to sleep ? He scratched his legs again , and it felt as if he had scratched a bite until it was bleeding . In summer at home , mosquitoes did that , but never in winter . It must be bedbugs they had . Mother never had bedbugs . Sometimes she and Aunty Margaretgot afraid about bedbugs and they looked at the mattressor they called a man in and he shot funny-smelling poison on the mattress . Danny turned to the wall . He wished that it was morning . He wished that it was tomorrow and he was back home . He would have to go home tomorrow because he had to be at school on Monday . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why was he here ? He did n't want to be here , sleeping in this old bed , in this room full of smells , with bedbugs or something biting him , with it being so dark , with everything smelling a way he did n't like it to smell . He scratched his legs again . He twisted , and wanted to yell out because of all the bites on his legs . And now his left wrist . He scratched it . He wanted to twist and yell about it , and he did n't dare . Bill had gone to sleep a long time ago , and everybody else in the house was asleep , and if he yelled out he 'd wake the house up , and if he twisted and moved around too much in bed , he 'd wake Bill . He could n't sleep in this bed , with all the bites he got . Bill did n't seem to get bites . So here he was , still awake in the dark house . He smothered a groan and scratched his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what might n't happen . But he did n't think anything was going to happen . Like once when he was here , he heard Mama and Papa talking about robbers , and he remembered that Papa said that they need never fear or worry about a burglar breaking into their house , because burglars did n't go breaking into poor men 's houses . He did n't like itp237here , that was all , and he wanted to get out of here as fast as he could . They had all told him how when he was little , after staying at Mother 's when Little Margaret was born , he was brought back home to Papa and Mama , and in the middle of the night he cried like bloody murder and Papa had had to take him back to Mother 's . But he did n't remember much about it , only himself being carried on a street car by Papa , with lights in the street car and people whose faces he could n't remember , and himself crying and crying and afraid . It made him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was dreaming and he suddenly woke up and did n't know where he was , heard noises , was afraid of things , and he did n't know what he was really afraid of . He wiped a tear from his eyes . He was crying . But he could n't let himself cry out loud . If he did and woke Papa up , Papa would get sore as all hell at him and maybe give him a clout , and Bill might laugh at him , and he would be showing himself off like a bawl baby . He sniffled . He did n't know what it was that made him cry and feel like this . He guessed it was very late . He guessed it was late , but it was n't late enough for him , because he wanted it to be morning , tomorrow , and he wanted it to be later than tomorrow morningbecause he wanted to be back home at Mother 's . He had been sorry to see the Sox lose , and now the Cubs were ahead of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped that they 'd win tomorrow . And he wished he could be there to see them win . And after the game , he and Bill had gone to confession . Did Bill make bad confessions ? He had gone to church today with Bill , afraid of what kind of a priest he would get , trying to make himself face what he had to face . He had knelt in church , examining his conscience . He had looked at the altar , watched the altar light burning , seen the statues , but not very clearly because of his eyes and the darkness of the church . He 'd knelt there , and Bill had been beside him , and he had asked himself was Bill afraid ? Would Bill tell about that fifty dollars ? If Bill did , the priestp238might make Bill tell and then they would know about him . Even if you could n't pay back money you had stolen , you might have to tell the person it was stolen from . He 'd knelt there , trying to make himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this world alongside of what you would get if you died and went to Hell and burned there forever and forever . He had gone to confession to Father Nolan , and he had gone in there telling himself that he had to go ahead and tell it all , and tell all about the dirty dins on his soul ever since he made his First Holy Communion . Waiting for his turn , he could hardly breathe , he had been so afraid , because he had to tell that , and he had to tell that he had had dirty thoughts . But he could n't think about dirty thoughts now because it might make him have thoughts in his 0 mind that were sinful and he was receiving Holy Communion in the morning . And his soul was dirty with sin , worse than this bed . Why was n't he just a little kid like Arty , not yet reached the age of reason so he could n't have any sins yet , and he could start all over again when he reached the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go to sleep . He ought to try and say a good Act of Contrition . First , he had to be sorry . He was sorry . He gazed upward in the darkness . He closed his eyes . He lifted his hands outside the blanket which was now only half covering him because Bill had pulled it away in his sleep . He had to be sorry . He was sorry . God , please keep him to be truly and really sorry . O my God ! I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee . . When he prayed , he had to keep God in his mind . He tried to hold before him the picture of God on His throne in Heaven . God was sitting on His throne . There were the angels around Him , and the Blessed Virgin , and Jesus on His right , but Jesus would n't just be naked except for a cloth around Him and have His side and hands and feet pierced and the thorns on His head . Jesus would be like ap239king in robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of God , but he could n't see the Holy Ghost in his mind because he did n't know what the Holy Ghost really looked like . Now he had to keep God in his mind , and say his Act of Contrition and be really sorry.my God ! I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee , and I detest all nay sins .. . He did . He detested his sins . He hated his sins . He hated his sins , and what he had gotten with them , the ice-cream sodasrt and , yes , even the ball games he had seen . But he had to keep God in his mind and pray.my God . . . Monday at school he would see Hortense Audrey and Virginia Doyle . Every day at school he saw them . He wanted to speak to them , and he never seemed to be able to get himself to . It was going to happen . He was going to speak to them . This year , one of them was going to be his girl . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Again he scratched himself on the legs . Bill was tossing around again . He hated to sleep with Bill in this bed , because Bill kept turning and taking up so much room all of the time . And Bob was making some sound in his sleep , as if he was talking to somebody or to himself . He wanted to go home to Mother 's . He wanted to go home to Mother 's . He wanted to go home to Mother 's . And he could n't go to sleep in this darn bed . If he could go to sleep the time would go fast . Every night when he went to sleep , he seemed no sooner to have gone to bed than he was asleep and awake again and it was morning . He wanted to go to sleep to make the time pass faster , because then it would n't seem so long until morning , and morning was going to make it nearer the time he was going home . And he would n't smell the room , either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear because the door of the bedroom where Papa and Mama and Catherine and Artyp240all slept was closed . Uncle Al snored . He did n't like the sound of snoring . And people always laughed at snoring , like in the movies when you saw a fat man snoring . It was always funny in a picture when John Bunny snored . It made everybody in the nickel show laugh . He was never going to be caught like this again where he had to stay here all night . Every time he did , he did n't like it when he got to bed and could n't sleep , or when he did get to sleep and and woke up suddenly in the middle of , the night and lay there in the darkness and could n't get back to sleep and was afraid , and wanted to cry and was afraid to cry . He sniffled again . He scratched himself . He curled up against the wall and lay there . Danny O'Neill was dead . There was a street . It was dark , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who walked on it looked like undertakers in a nickel show , and they did n't say a word . They walked along , and just to see them made him afraid . And Danny O'Neill was dead . There was Mother . She was walking along the street , wearing a black shawl , and she stopped , and God suddenly was talking to her . God was wearing a red robe , and he had a golden crown on His head , and His beard was long and white . Danny O'Neill is dead , God said to Mother . Where did he go ? I sent him to Hell . Never again will he hurt My feelings by his sins . Burn him up ! Burn him within an inch of his life . I gave him clean waists every day , paid good money to the nigger washwoman to wash them , and sent him to school to the holy nuns . Burn him up , Mother said to God . He is burning up . When I made him , I made him a Cath/olic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . I took him away . I do n't want him , Mother said , and still the men who to eked like undertakers in a nickel show walked back and forth , never saying a word . Burn him up good and plenty , Mother said to God . God disappeared , aid Mother stood on the street shaking her fist , and the men walked by and did n't look at her . You 'll rue the day you sinned now , and it serves you right , she said , still shaking her fist . The street was getting darker like it was night coming . You little devil , you broke the heart of God with bad confessions . And Mother was gone and he knew it was the last time he ever would see her and he knew that Danny O'Neill was dead . Danny O'Neill was dead , and there he was in Hell , with the red-hot flames licking and leaping all around him , and the red devils were jumping in and out of the flames at him , cuing like Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pitchforks , yelling like wild Indians in a Nickel show . Lemme alone , Danny whined . Get down in the fire and use good diction , a red devil with horns and the voice of Uncle Al told him . Danny looked over the leaping flames and he saw the bars of a cage , and he knew that the cage was the cage of Hell . He could see people looking through the bars of Hell , lookMgjust like the people watching the animals in the Lincoln Park Zoo . I wan na go home , Danny whined . Hell is your home , the Devil Himself said , jumping over the flames and standing in front of him . The book of his sins , another red devil said , leaping over the flames and handing a black book to the Devil Himself . Danny looked at them with begging eyes . The Devil Him/self grinned and opened the black book . The people outside pressed closely against the bars of Hell . A black angel suddenly stood at the left of the Devil Himself and Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black angel I put on your left side when you were born . Here is the black book of your sins he kept when you were alive and committing sins because my black angel told you to . Because of the sins in this black book , you 're mine now . You 're mine now . Red devils came out of the flames and did an Indian dance around him and the people watched from outside the bars of Hell , thinking how terrible Danny O'Neill was . You 're mine now . You 'll burn here . Stick a pitchfork into him , the Devil Himself said , and a red angel came forward . Danny felt a sting on his legs . He felt that they were swelling on him . He touched his legs and they seemed to be swelling on him so that he could n't move them . And the Devil Himself opened the black pages of the black book and held it before Danny 's eyes , and there , in big , black letters , Danny read the word SIN on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared a white angel in white robes , with golden wings and the face of a girl . He saw a white book in the hands of the white angel . You 're worse than the White Sox , Danny 's black angel said , looking up at the white angel with scorn . Danny watched the white angel fly around and around in the darkness over the flames , and he saw that the white angel was sad and crying . He knew that the white angel was his guardian angel , and that the white book was his guardian angel 's book of good deeds , and there was not one good deed of his written in it . You never listened to me when I spoke to your conscience , Danny 's guardian angel said with deep regret , and the tears of the guardian angel fell like rain , dropping on him . Let me out of here . I 'll listen . I 'll be good . I 'll never makep243bad confessions , Danny yelled and pleaded , surrounded by all the fires of Hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain in a show . When I capture a soul , it never gets away from me , the Devil Himself said . Go back and be a guardian angel to the White Sox , Danny'sblack angel yelled up ' to his white angel who still flew overhead , crying , shedding tears that fell like a rainfall into all the raging fires of Hell . I wan na go home , Danny sobbed , trembling in mortal fear . Oh , come all ye faithful , Danny O'Neill is dead . Oh , come all ye faithful , His soul belongs to the Devil Himself . All the devils in Hell sang , dancing around Danny , who looked on one side , and then another , seeing only dancing devils and the raging fires of Hell . Take him to the oven , the Devil Himself said . Devils marched on all sides of him like soldiers of a conqueringarmy , and they carried pitchforks , baseball bats , and BB guns . The souls of the damned were all over Hell , and each soul looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bonfires , and they were weeping the bitter tears of the damned , crying because they were burningand because they would never see the sight of Almighty God . Devils stuck pitchforks into them , and the souls cried out for mercy and there was no mercy . Danny saw them end heard them and the red devils marched him through the darkness and the red fires of Hell . Down there is the furnace where we burn souls dirty with the sin of a sacrilege , the Devil Himself said . Danny looked down , down , down through a funnel of darkness , and he saw the opened doors of a furnace withp244red-hot coals inside . He saw little red devils heaping more coals into the furnace . A great thirst overcame him , and his lips became parched and blistered . His legs began swelling again . Somewhere beyond the flames there were voices coming out of the darkness , and he knew that he 'd heard these voices before , but he did n't know whose voices they were . Danny O'Neill is dead and burning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made bad confessions and received the Blessed Sacrament when he was n't in the state of grace . He 'll never see God . He 's gone to Hell . He 's in the power of the Devil in Hell . Danny O'Neill is dead . Danny O'Neill is burning in Hell . His legs were swelling . He wanted a drink of water . He was falling , falling , falling , down through darkness , down into a bottomless pit of fire , sinking and falling . On all sides he saw faces like skeletons pop out of the wall of darkness to wail and shed the tears of the damned . And he was falling , falling , falling , and he knew that he was going to fall foreverand forever down into the pits of the fires of Hell , and above him was only blackness , and he heard voices sayingover and over again : Danny O'Neill is dead and in the power of the Devil Himself . It was all blackness . There were no fires . He was n't falling , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parched , and he felt as if he was nowhere , facing something terrible . He remembered hearing that he was dead , and he knew that he had just had something horrible happen to him . He scratched his legs . It had only been a dream . He knew where he was . He was at Mama 's . Bill was beside him . It was still night . He shuddered , hearing a creak in the boards . He was thirsty , but he knew it must be after twelve o'clock and he could n't drinkp245because he was going to Communion in the morning . He was being bitten again . He scratched some more , feeling blood on his legs . He lay against the wall , shuddering , closing his eyes to keep the blackness out . When would the morning come ? When would he go home ? He sobbed , while everyone else in the house slept peacefully.  | I 'LL fix your breakfast now , Jim , " Lizz said when they both got home after having attended eight o'clock mass and received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jim said ; he wore a black , single-breasted suit in which he looked awkward and ungainly . With his rough , leathery face and his large and bony hands , from one of which the little finger was missing , in his Sunday best he looked as much the workman as he did in his work clothes . " Ma , I got to go to nine o'clock mass now , " Dennis said . " Go with your brothers , " Lizz said . " They ca n't sit with me . I got to sit with my class , " Dennis said . Bob came out of the front bedroom . He looked nervously at Dennis . " Say , Jim , I ca n't for the life of me make out why Mrs. Connerty went to eight o'clock mass this morning , " Lizz said . " Lizz , get that blatherskite out of your mind , " Jim said . " She always goes to ten o'clock mass and tries to act and cut herself out like she was one of the ladies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you ever see the beat of that ? " Lizz said , laughing . " I believe in minding my own business . When we met her and her husband in front of church , I just said good morning , " Jim said . " William , are you and Danny ready ? You know you have to receive , " Lizz said.  | " Uh huh , " Bill answered , coming out of the bedroom in his brown Sunday suit , the sleeves a trifle too small . " Mama , I ca n't receive Holy Communion this morning , " Danny said . " Why ? You went to confession yesterday , " Lizz said . " When I got up this morning , I was awful thirsty . Before I remembered that I had to fast , I went to the kitchen and got some water , and I just started swallowing it when I remembered . I only swallowed one mouthful , but that 's not allowed if you 're to receive Holy Communion , " said Danny . Dennis and Bob seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making signs to Bob . Catherine and Arty were in the parlor , Arty running about the room , Catherine looking at her father while she sat on the floor . " You did n't do it on purpose and the Lord will overlook it . He will today because I want all of my family who can to receive . You can receive . When you two come home , I 'll give you a nice breakfast . Come , Dennis , and your mother will give you a cup of coffee to hold you until you get back from mass , " Lizz said . " I ai n't hungry , Ma , " Dennis said ; he seemed to be getting increasingly nervous . Bob shot a worried look at him . " Well , old woman , you can give me some coffee . I wo n't refuse , " Jim said . I le walked out to the kitchen . Dennis followed and stood near the back door , watching his father . Bob went to the kitchen door and stood there , pale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always sat . " Look out Papa , there 's glue on the chair , " Dennis yelled , d be darted out of the house and over the fence . Lizz saw m running across the street . Bob tried to run out but fell wn . Jim saw the glue on his chair . He went after Bob uirkly and grabbed him . " You dirty little ingrates ! " he said , his voice throbbing . Bill and Danny stood surprised and petrified.  | " Did you do it ? " Jim asked Bob , his anger almost uncontrollable . Bob whimpered . " Answer me ! Did you ? " " Dennis told me to , " Bob whimpered . " Why did n't you two stop them from doing that ? " Jim said in rage to Bill and Danny while he held Bob , who was shuddering and trembling in his grasp . " We did n't see them . ' We were in the front with Dolly and Arty , and they must have done it then , " said Bill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , and it would ruin the only decent suit the poor man has . I knew it , I knew it . He learned that trick from the Connertys , " Lizz said . " I 'll teach you to be disrespectful of your father , I 'm goddamned if I do n't . You wo n't be able to sit on any damn chair , glue or not , " Jim said . " Papa , I wo n't do it again , " Bob said whimperingly . " Lizz , get me my razor strap . I 'll teach these goddam little ingrates a lesson they 'll never forget , " Jim said , pale with anger . " Jim , it 's not their fault . I know one of the Connerty boys put them up to it . The Connertys are wild ones , " Lizz said . " Shut up ! Get me my razor strap , " Jim said , still holding Bob tightly . " I just received Our Lord , " Lizz said , folding her arms . " Bill , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim said . Bill obeyed in great haste . Jim cuffed Bob on the ear , and Bob let out a yell . " Shut up ! " Jim said . He took the razor strap from Bill . He let down Bob 's breeches , and set Bob over his knee on the dining-room couch . He used all the force of his arm in hitting , and he beat Bob 's buttocks until they were red ; Bob screamed loudlyp249as he underwent the punishment . Bill and Danny watched , both of them pale , Danny 's lips quivering slightly . " Goddamn you , I do n't care how old you are , you 'll learn to respect your father , " Jim said , raising his voice . " Jim , for the sake of Mary , you 'll k411 the boy , " Lizz said . " Get the hell out of here , woman ! " Jim said , and again brought down the strap forcibly on Bob 's bare behind . Bob let out a heart-rending shriek . Jim dropped the strap on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he looked down at the boy sobbing on the floor . " If I ever catch you doing anything like that to me again , you 're going to get three times as much . Do you hear me ? " Bob cried , his head buried on the floor . Jim reached down and pulled the boy around , looked at him . " You hear me ! " " Yes , Papa , " Bob said timidly , still sobbing . " You boys better go so you 're not late for mass , " Lizz said , and Bill and Danny started to leave by the back door . " Listen , you two ! " Jim said . They turned around to face their father . " When your brother comes out of church , catch him and bring him right home to me . If he gets away from you , you 'll both get what that little one got . I 'm a reception committee waitin ' for him , and he 's not going to forget the warm receptionI 'll give him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his left hand , the one on which the little finger was missing . " Get him when he comes out of church and bring him right home . " " All right , Pa , " Bill said . Bob still lay on the floor , sobbing , holding his reddened buttocks . " Now you 'll be good , " Catherine said , standing over him . Bob did n't answer . He continued sobbing . " Do n't cwy , " Arty said , touching Bob 's hair.  | " It 's your fault . You 're their mother . What in hell do you teach them ? " Jim said , gesturing dramatically before Lizz in the kitchen . " Blessed Saint Joseph ! " Lizz exclaimed . " Oh forget the saints for once , " Jim said . " Say you , I 'm a mother , and I just come from the altar rail of my God , and I wo n't let you talk to me like that , " Lizz said . " You 're with them all day . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some manners ? Trying to pull a stunt like that on their father ! " Jim said . " They do n't get that from me or from my family , " Lizz said . " I do n't give a good goddamn where they get it . Why do n't you teach them something ? " Jim said . " Say , it ai n't my fault . Do n't you blame me . You can'tblame me , " Lizz said . " All I ask of them is a little respect . Goddamn it , I work my ass off for you and them , and on Sunday they put glue on my chair and would ruin the only suit of clothes I got . Now is n't it one hell of a pass we 're comin ' to ! " Jim said . " Do n't yell at me about it , " Lizz said . " You 're their mother . " " And you 're their father . And if it was n't for their father , they would n't be here . Talking like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way , " Lizz said with selfpity . " Well , who the hell is going to teach them manners if their mother do n't ? " Jim yelled . " Say , everything good in them comes from me . What you saw this morning is their father in them . It 's from you they take it , you and the influence of the Connertys . I never did want to move in a neighborhood with neighbors like them , and you made me , " Lizz said.  | " Shut up , for Christ sake ! " " Goddamn you , do n't you tell me to shut up after I returnfrom the holy altar rail . Do n't you say that to me ! I 'll not let you talk that way to me , you big bully , " Lizz said . " Look at her , talking like she 's nuts , " Jim said . " I do , do I ? Say you , if it was n't for me you 'd be nothing now but a damn old booze-fighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd still be one if it was n't for me , " she said . " I would n't be any worse off if I was , " he said . " What am I ? A drudge , a slave . Look at me , and another coming , and not a tooth in my head that does n't ache , " Lizz said . " Goddamn it , quit bellyaching . You do n't have it any harder than I do , " Jim said . " Only for my marrying you , I 'd be living the life of Riley with my mother and my family , " said Lizz . " Yes , and I 'd be a free man without kids trying to turn me into a vaudeville show , " Jim said . " They 're yours , and when the shoe fits , you got to wear it , " Lizz said . " I tell you , I 'm givin ' you fair warning to shut up ! " Jim said , shaking his right index finger at Lizz . " I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get the police after you . I 'll turn you in to the Humane Society . I 'll have that holy man across the street , Father Corbett , after you . I lit me , and I swear I 'll go to the archbishop , " Lizz said . " I 'm telling you for the last time , shut up ! " " Bully ! Brute ! You reformed booze-fighter ! " Lizz said . " Why , goddamn you ! " Jim said , his voice tense . He took a step toward Lizz . She picked up the bread knifeand waved it . " Doddamn ! " Arty said . Both parents looked at their little son . He looked back at them with large liquid brown eyes , smiling . He put his left thumb in his mouth . Jim relaxed.  | " I 'm sorry , Lizz , " he said , bending down and picking up his boy . " Sit down and I 'll give you your breakfast . And do n't sit on that glue . We got to take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove . Carrying Arty in his arms , he went to the kitchen table and sat down . " We got to teach you better words than that , you cute little beggar , " Jim said , and he smiled . " Fither , shursh , " Arty said , pointing through the window at Saint Martha 's across the street . Jim played with Arty , and Catherine came out , sat at the table , and watched her father intently while Lizz prepared breakfast . " Jesus , we sure get paper on the floor here , do n't we ? " Jim said , seeing the paper stacked and piled under the dining-room table as he came into the room , wearing his work clothes . " Well , Jim , I always think this . When the children are playing , I think to myself that if they got their health , it 's good , and the paper they throw on the floor do n't hurt the floor , not this floor full of slivers . You could n't hurt a floor in this dump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The floor 's sometimes so covered with papers that we ca n't even see it , " Jim said . " Our Lord was born in a stable . It is n't what the outside looks like . It 's what the inside looks like . If your soul is clean , that counts more than if your house is . Many there are in the world with clean houses and dirty souls . And this morning , the souls in this house are clean . This morning , everyone who 's old enough to in my house received the Body and Blood of our Blessed Lord , " Lizz said , her voice rising in pride as she drew to the end of her declamation.  | " Well , it is n't necessary to have a dirty house in order to have a clean soul , " Jim said . " The children are playing in the yard now . I 'm going to give them all a bath , " Lizz said . " Denny and Bob still sulking because of the whipping they got ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lizz said . " I did n't want to whip Denny . But after tanning his brother it would n't have been fair . By the time he came home from mass , I was n't so sore as I was when I found the glue on the chair . But mind me , Lizz , if they ever pull a stunt like that again , God help them ! God help them ! I 'm going to bring them up right , by God , if I have to put the strap to them every damn day of the year . Spare the rod and spoil the child ? Not Jim O'Neill , " Jim said . Jim began sweeping the carpet . " Mercy , the dust ! " Lizz exclaimed . " It 's got to be raised a little , Lizz , if we want to get rid of it , " Jim said . " If those people of mine were any good and had any kindnessin their bones , they 'd hire a nigger to help me out , me with all these little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nobody to rely on in this world but one 's self . Forget the damn O'Flahertys for this Sunday at least . Let 's have a happy Sunday with our family without any intrusionof the O'Flahertys . We nearly spoiled it once already this morning , and let 's not go doin ' it again , " Jim said . " I did n't spoil it , " said Lizz . " I know it , " Jim said cursorily , still sweeping . " I 'm heating kettles of water for the children 's bath , " Lizz said , turning back into the kitchen . Jim worked on , sweeping the dust into a corner , his nostrilsirritated by it . He bent down and pulled papers from under the table , stacks of them torn and cut up , and dropped them into a wooden box he was using for waste . He thoughtp254that if the kids did n't tear up every newspaper he brought home , they could be saved and sold . Every little penny counted in this house , particularly when there was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suspenders in the papers , and held them up . He smiled . Things in this house were liable to be any place . And what was there that a regiment of kids could n't get into ? All kids were pretty much the same when they were young ones . They got into anything and everything . That was kids . But damn it , there was one thing they would n't do in his house . They would n't make a fool out of their father . They were n't going to play Katzenjammer kids on him . He swept the dust and dirt from under the table , thinking to himself that he 'd bet even fellowslike Al O'Flaherty and Dinny Gorman had been like other kids in their own kid days . Sure , they were . He swept under the table again . He moved the couch from the wall , and in doing it he saw the many punctures from BB 's . What kids could n't think of to do ! Well , as long as they did no harm , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do dirty 1 things to themselves , what the hell ! A few BB 's shot into the wall of an old shack like this . Funny , he was calling this cottage an old shack already . When he 'd found it and moved here from La Salle Street , he did n't call it an old shack . Well , it was an improvement over that other place . It was the best place they had been able to live in yet . But there were degreesin shacks and dumps as there were in everything in this world . And there sure were degrees of improvement ahead for the O'Neills . Would he ever be able to give his family a decent living , and his kids a chance to get ahead in life ? The dust almost choked him as he swept it from under the couch . Finishing his sweeping , he brushed the piles of dust into a large piece of cardboard which he used as a dustpanand dropped it on top of the newspapers in the wooden box . He put the sticks of furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed a hundred per cent better , clean . Now ,  |p255if  the table were cleaned off and the trash on it put away , that 'd be another improvement . " Lizz , " he called . " Yes , Papa , " Lizz replied . " Bring me a damp cloth , " he said . He picked the trash off the table and dumped it on the couch . " Here , Jim , " she said , coming in with a damp rag . " I 'm gon na fix this house up spick and span for once , " he said , taking the rag from her . " Oh , Jim , you work hard and you 're a ruptured man . Do n't do too much on your off day . I 'll fix it up next week . You need your rest , " she said . " That 's all right . I 'll get it in tiptop shape this morning , cook dinner , and then rest this afternoon , " he said . He wiped off the oilcloth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , my , it 's going to look nice , " Lizz said as she noticed him glancing around the room . " Now , if we can only keep this clean and a little bit in order , " Jim said . " We 're going to , " she said . She went to him , embraced and kissed him . " My rabbit , we 're going to make a home that 'll make us happy , and that 's more than many with plenty in their pocketbooks can say , " he said with feeling , holding her in his arms . He kissed her again . After sorting out the odds and ends on the table , Danny and Bill got out the Steel 's game Danny had brought with him . " You won as the Braves last night in our world 's series , but I 'm going to beat you in the city series now . The Cubs might win today and clean up , but I do n't think they will ,  |p256but  I 'm going to win our city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched , " Bill said . " You boys want a cup of coffee before I give the little ones their bath ? " Lizz asked . Both of them nodded their heads affirmatively . " Come out in the kitchen and have it there , " she said . They followed her to the kitchen and sat down , noticing that the tub , filled with cold water , was set up for the baths . And that steaming kettles of water were on the stove . " Now , after you drink your coffee and go back to play your game , do n't make any dirt . Your father is cleaning house , " Lizz said , setting cups of coffee before them . " Do we got to use the lineups that have been used in the city series or can we put in the lineups we want to ? " asked Danny . " I 'm making my own lineup and pitching Jimmy Lavenderin the first game , " Bill said . " Then I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him in the game , " Danny said . " It do n't matter what lineup you got . Watch those dice speak for me , " Bill said . " Catherine ! Catherine ! " Lizz called from the steps leadingdown to the yard . " Yes , Mama ? " " Come on in for your bath and bring your baby brother , " Lizz called . " Ca n't I play a little longer ? " " I told you come on . If you do n't , I 'll drag you in , " Lizz yelled . " Hello , kids , " Jim said , coming out to the kitchen . " Hello , Pa , " they said together , and just as they did , Arty toddled in , followed by Lizz who had Catherine 's hand . " You come when I call you , " Lizz said.  | " Arty splashes too much water . I do n't want to get in the tub with him , " Catherine said . " Take your clothes off now and get your bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and began taking off her dress . " When you kids finish your coffee , I want you to help your old man some more . You can pick things up in the bedrooms . For once , this house is gon na be clean as a whistle , " Jim said . Danny and Bill exclaimed hasty looks of disappointment . " Jim , Danny-boy is our guest , and we ca n't put him to work , " Lizz said , pouring kettles of hot water into the washtub . Catherine stood up , pulled off her soiled underclothes , and stood naked . Danny and Bill cast sidelong glances at her . But she was too young for them to see what girls and women looked like . " Here , let me put you in the tub , " Lizz said . She bent down and picked up Catherine . " My , but you 're getting heavy . Now , stay there and do n't splash . Is the water warm enough ? " " Uh huh , " Catherine exclaimed , standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Jim , we should n't make our guest work , " Lizz said , going over to Arty and setting him down on her lap in order to undress him . " Mama , I can help . I help at home sometimes , " Danny said to avert any anger from his father , and Jim frowned when he used the word home . Lizz looked up while Arty squirmed in her lap . " What ? They put my son to work up there when they get a nigger woman in to wash ? Oh , when I see them I 'll give them a piece of my mind , " Lizz said , holding Arty more firmly so that he could n't squirm out of her lap . " A little work wo n't hurt any kid . When I was Bill 's age ,  |p258I  was doin ' a damn sight harder work than I hope he 'll ever have to do in his hull life , " Jim said . " I 'll put a stop to them making my son work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can do things in that place on Prairie Avenue , he can pick up a few things in his father 's house , " Jim said . Lizz carried Arty to the tub and set him in it . He splashed water immediately . " Mama , I tol ' you he 'd splash me , " Catherine protested . " A little water wo n't hurt you . Now , stand still while I put some soap on him . Oh , Mama 's Angel Child gets a bath , and he likes his bath , " Lizz said . " Wawa . Wawa , " Arty exclaimed , splashing his hand down in the water . " Have a cup of coffee , Jim , " Lizz said as she soaped Arty . " I think I will , " Jim said ; he went to the stove and poured out a cup , carried it to the table , and sat down with Danny and Bill . " Wawa ! Wawa ! Wawa ! " Arty exclaimed , gay and laughing , splashing while Lizz continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wawa ! " Arty said , laughing at his sister . " Goodness , the way he can get dirt on him , " said Lizz . " Well , all kids do , " Jim said absent-mindedly as he stirred his coffee . " Jim , do you know that Gertrude O'Reilley does n't have to lift a finger out at Joe 's ? Not a finger does that little girl lift . Do n't be nervous . I 'll soap you as soon as I finish with him . He 's harder to wash than you , Catherine . No , Jim , not a finger does she lift . Now , I 'll try and soap you . Here , Arty , hold this little piece of soap and do n't eat it . " Lizz began to soap Catherine , who stood still as the operation was performed . " They 're going to make a lady out of her . But I fix them . Whenever I see Mary or Martha , I fix them . I just pitch in and tell them about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them a thing or two . There , now , Catherine , you 're going tcVie clean , you little angel . " Lizz went on washing Catherine , and then began to rinse both children , pouring water over their little shoulders . " Bill , you can help keep the house clean from now on , ca n't you ? " Jim said . " Sure , Pa , " Bill said . " I got the hull place fixed up now except the bedrooms . I want to get them fixed up and I 'm going over the mattresses to get some of those damn bedbugs . I want to see that papers are n't left on the floor . That 's going to be your job from now on . Do n't let me find papers on the floor when I come home from work , " Jim said . Bill nodded his head . " Now , you stay there a minute , Catherine , Mama 's princess , and I 'll dry Arty and dress him , and then fix you up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair ? " asked Catherine . " You 're not going out , and you 'll get it dirty playing , " Lizz said . " I want a ribbon in my hair , " Catherine said , her voice betraying deep disappointment . " All right , then , " Lizz said , drying Arty as he stood on a chair . " Wibbon ! " Arty exclaimed and laughed , and Jim looked over at him , and saw his thin little body , with the ribs noticeable , his pale face , his large , laughing brown eyes . Jim turned to the older boys . Catherine watched her father , her hands playing in soapy water . " Well , I suppose you heard the same sermon in church we heard , " Jim said to Bill and Danny to make conversation . " It was about the Blessed Sacrament , " Danny said . " I noticed there was no sermon about the collection plate this week , " Jim said . " Jim , that 's no way to talk , " Lizz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jim said genially.  | " The Church says you must contribute to the support of your pastor , " Lizz said , still rubbing Arty with the towel . " Shursh ! " Arty exclaimed . " And that 's a point of Christian Doctrine that 's never neglected , " Jim said with an ironic smile . " Mama , I 'm getting cold . I want to get dried , " Catherine said . " Hold your horses . I got this Indian , " Lizz said as she started pinning a clean diaper on Arty . When she had it pinned on , she looked at Jim and said : " You should n't talk disrespectfully of the Church in front of your boys , and doing that right after we 've all received Communion , that 's not right . " " I 'm as good a Catholic as the next man , Lizz . I 'm just helping the Church out by telling about Christian Doctrine , " Jim said . " I never heard the like of it . A father talking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just teasing you , Lizz , " Jim smiled , finishing his cup of coffee . " That 's no matter for lightness , " Lizz said . She stood Arty on the chair and put the old red dress he had been wearing back on him . She held him up . " Look , Papa , is n't your precious clean now ? He 's so pretty . Look at his eyes . He has the eyes of an angel . Take him a minute , " Lizz said . Jim held out his arms . " Fither ! " Arty exclaimed as Jim took him . Lizz took Catherine out of the water , stood her on a chair , and began to dry her . " I 'll be gettin ' back to finish cleanin ' , and then I 'm gon na cook these kids the best dinner they ever had . Today they 're gon na have enough to eat , " Jim said . " I 'll have this precious fixed up in a minute . Hold Arty until I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want him getting into things right after his bath , " Lizz said.  | " Tither , sisser clean , " Arty said , pointing at Catherine . She smiled as Lizz continued rubbing the towel over her . " Pa , wan na play Steel 's with us this afternoon ? " Bill asked . " Sure , " Jim answered . Wearing a narrow blue ribbon around her head , Catherine sat on the couch with Arty . " You be good now and do n't get dirty , " Catherine said , while out in the kitchen Lizz was washing Bob , and Dennis sat on a chair awaiting his turn . Jim took the kerosene lamp off the table and went to the front bedroom . " The first thing we got to do is to air this room out , " he said without looking behind him where Danny and Bill stood in the doorway waiting , looking in at the small stale-smelling room , with the disarranged bed , the old blankets , the large dresser with rows of drawers , its top cluttered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim , you poor man , you did enough . Leave the bedrooms be and I 'll take care of ' em . You need a little rest on your off day . " " I started it and I want to finish it , " he said . " Mama , Bob 's calling . He wants his bath finished , " Catherinecalled . Lizz went back to the kitchen . Jim took the bedding to the parlor . " What do you want us to do to help , Pa ? " Bill asked . " Pick the things off the floor in the closet , take everything on the floor out , and lay it in the parlor here , " Jim said . The boys obeyed , picking up old rags , shoes , odds and ends that lay on the floor and in the closet beside the dresser . Jim moved the bed , and swept energetically . The older boys sat in the parlor , waiting for further instructions , while the sound of voices , Bob 's , Dennis ' , Lizz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard mingling together in the kitchen . " Bill , bring me that piece of cardboard I use for a dustpan , " Jim called . Bill obeyed . Jim swept the dirt onto the cardboard . " Now bring me that wooden box full of dirt and papers from the dining room , " he said . Bill did , and Jim dumped the dirt and dust into the box . " Now , you and Danny put the things back neatly , and then close the door so that there is n't a draft in the house , " Jim said . They obeyed , slowly setting back shoes and boxes . Jim went to the other bedroom , swept and aired it , and had the boys pick things up . He came out smiling when he had finished . " Now , I 'll see about bugs in the bedding and mattresses , " he said . He went to the kitchen where Lizz was giving Dennis his bath , and got a can of kerosene . He bent down over the mattress , looking slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said , catching a big fat bug , squeezing it between his fingers , its blood smearing them . He wiped his fingers on an old rag beside him and went on slowly looking , putting kerosene on the seams of the mattress . " Jim ! Jim ! " Lizz called excitedly from the dining room . Jim looked up , surprised , concerned because of the hurriednote in her voice . He saw her by the dining-room window . " What ? " he asked . " Come here ! Quick ! Hurry up , Jim , " Lizz said . Jim hastened to Lizz . " Look ! " Lizz said , pointing . Across the street , Mrs. Connerty , in her Sunday getup , was seen passing with a large woman who wore a brown coat . " That 's why she went to early mass . She 's going out some place with Father Corbett 's housekeeper . They 're thick as thieves , the two of them are , " Lizz said.  | " What the hell do I care ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be interested . I wonder who 's cooking dinner for the Connertys and the poor priests . That housekeeper is n't a woman to be taking care of a saint like Father Corbett . And she thick as thieves with the Connerty one , " said Lizz . Mrs. Connerty and the other woman passed out of sight . Jim went back to look for bedbugs in the mattresses , and Lizz returned to the kitchen . Jim put the mattresses and bedding in the back yard to give them a good airing , and then came into the kitchen and put on an apron to start cooking the Sunday dinner . He whistled as he started his preparations . Dennis came out and watched him . " Papa has an apron on , " Dennis said as Jim tied up the roast . " Yeh , the old man is housemaid today , " Jim said . Dennis , Bob and Catherine watched him with wide-eyed interest and absorption . While he prepared the meat for the oven , the dice could be heard rattling on the game board in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put the peas and potatoes on , " Lizz said . " All we got to do now is baste the roast now and then and keep our eyes on it , " Jim said , after putting the roast in the oven . " Papa , when we gon na have dinner ? " asked Dennis . " Time enough . And you 're gon na have a dinner today that you wo n't forget . Danny , here , is gon na eat as good a dinner , too , as he ever gets at the O'Flahertys , " Jim said proudly . " All he and Bill think of is that baseball game of theirs they 're playing , " Lizz said . " Yeh , it 's like a bug that bit them . Well , it do n't do them any harm . Keeps them from having mischievous thoughts , " Jim said.  | " Papa , I 'm hungry , too , " Catherine said . " You 're all gon na get enough to eat today , " Jim said . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lizz said , smiling . " Say , damn it , Lizz , the next time we get our hands on any money , we got to get your teeth fixed , " Jim said , noticing them when she smiled . " There 'll be time enough for that , " Lizz said . " I always said that we should have had it done that time when we got the money from Bill 's leg , " Jim said . " Jim , the Lord has given us our health . With our health and a little food for our mouths , we should n't complain , " Lizz said . " Mama , will we eat now ? I 'm hungry , " Bob said . " You kids go and play a little bit . But keep the house clean . And I 'll call you soon as your dinner is ready , " Jim said , smiling.  | DANNY awakened suddenly , and for a moment he hung between sleep and waking . He could n't remember what he had been dreaming . All that remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river running through the darkness of the bedroom , flowing out of him into the darkmess , and back from the darkness into him . He sat up in bed . It was Aunt Peg . She was drunk again . She was screaming atthe top of her lungs . There she went again , letting out anotheryell . He closed his eyes . It seemed as if her yelling hurt is ears . Now , after her last scream had died down , thereas complete silence in the apartment . There was an elevatedain , and again , nothing . Again she yelled . It was not a word , st a loud , awful noise . He was sure the police would be com-g here if she kept it up . " I do n't want to live , " Margaret said in a loud , drunken Dice from the back of the apartment . Mother said something to Aunt Peg , but he did n't hear hat it was . Then Aunt Peg talked in a lower voice , and it unded like she was crying and mumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping she would n't make any more ise . He covered his head with the sheet and blankets , but he ill heard her going on in that low mumbling and crying , d now and then he heard Mother 's voice , but he could n't take out what it was she said . He wanted to get it all out of is mind and go to sleep . He had troubles enough of his own. coming home from school today , he 'd had a fight with Les rkes , and he 'd quit because Les was beating him up . Tomorrowthey would say to him that he 'd been licked . He hadp268troubles enough of his own and he did n't want to stay awake until all hours of the night because of Aunt Peg . Why did n't she go to bed ? He wished Uncle Al was home , but Uncle Al had gone away on the road last week after being home for Christmas and New Year 's . Maybe if Uncle Al was home , she would n't make such a racket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would sometimes even curse him at the top of her voice . He tried to think of baseball to get himself to sleep . The White Sox would have Eddie Collins next year , and he was the greatest second baseman in the game . With Eddie Collins , they might win the pennant . He wished the season was already started . Gee , if Hal Chase was still with them instead of being in the Federal League ! What an infield they 'd have , Chase , Collins , Buck Weaver , and they could use Bobby Roth at third . He dozed off and it seemed that he had hardly been asleep for a minute or a jiffy when her loud voice woke him up again . She was yellingat Mother , and Mother was telling her to go to bed and not make such a holy show of herself . " Ah , they would n't let a daughter in the old country do what you 're doing . They 'd flay you black and blue . They were n't the people for fooling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been drinking beer , because look how much worse it always was when both of them were drunk than it was with only one of them soused . " Do n't be giving me any more of your ignorant Irish lip , " Aunt Margaret said . " Ah , but we Irish may be poor and ignorant , but I 'll have you know we 're decent , we 're decent people . " " Yes , and your decency turns your daughters into whores . To hell with your kind of decency , you old hypocrite . Just like your filthy daughter , Lizz O'Neill . She goes to church and prays to the Lord and comes home and backbites every-body . " He was afraid that Aunt Peg might start hitting Mother.  |p269He  wished he was big enough to be able to stop Aunt Peg from hitting Mother when Aunt Peg was drunk . " Now you take your beads out and pray . Well , pray and be damned ! The Lord will never hear your prayers , " Aunt Margaret said . " Hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thee , blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now  --  nd at the hour of our death . Amen ! " Mother prayed loudly . He heard her coming down the hallway . Aunt Peg went into the parlor . She was quiet in there . Maybe she was getting tired and would go to sleep . He heard her crying . He lay in bed , hearing her sobs for a long while , and again he dozed off into sleep . It seemed suddenly as if there were a wind that cried like somebody he knew , a wind that cried like a voice . And , gee , he was a man . He was a man so big he could almost touch thefling . And there was Mother , and she seemed to be so little , and she was looking up at him . To see her he had to benddown . My grandson is bigger than Jack the Giant Killer and he ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then saw her dancing a jig around him . Gee , he did n't know how he grew up to be so big in such hurry . He used to be a little kid and was licked in school y Les Parkes , and now look how big he was , and who could  --  k him now ? And he was on this street and he did n't know w he had gotten here . It was n't Prairie Avenue . It was a : vet he 'd never been on before , but still in front of him as the convent of The Little Sisters of the Good Shepherd at used to be on Prairie , and right next to it was the WillardTheater that used to be on Fifty-first and Calumet . Andand Mother were walking down this street , and everybody s getting out of his way , and suddenly a mad dog Tas comingat them , barking wildly , and the wind that cried like ap270voice of somebody he knew got louder and louder , and he picked up the mad dog and threw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struggling in the dark . " Take your hands off me , " Aunt Peg cried . " You wo n't be wakin ' up me grandson , the little angel ! " Mother said . He cried . They stopped scuffling and bent over him . " What 's the matter , Son ? " Mother tenderly asked him . " Little Brother , are you sad like your poor aunty ? " Aunt Margaret asked in a thick voice , and then she bent down and kissed him , her breath almost making him sick because of the bourbon odor ; it was bourbon because he knew what bourbonsmelled like and he hated the smell . " Let me alone , " he protested . " Do n't turn on your poor unhappy aunt like the rest of them , Little Brother , " Aunt Margaret said . He turned his head to the wall . " Ca n't you see that the poor child is sleepy and wants his rest ? Let him be , " Mother said . " Do n't you dare turn him against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you dare turn him against me , you witch , ' ; , , Aunt Peg said . " The shame of Mary , the Blessed Mother of God , be on you that you would do this to the child at night , " Mother said . " I want to sleep , " Danny said whiningly . " All right ! Never speak to me , you little brat ! Never look at me ! Never ask me for nickels for candy ! Never ask me again to sweat over a hot stove cooking meals for you ! You little brat ! " Aunt Margaret said , and then she staggered out of the room.  |p271MARGARET  felt that she was going crazy . She did n't know what she was going to do . She did n't care what she did . She was turned into stone inside . She was stone . She had becomestone in her heart . She had no more feeling . She had nothing to feel . She turned over and faced the wall . The light hurt her eyes . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . It was when she got up that she was weak . Her head ached . It was full of nerves , and it seemed that each one of the nerves ached and twitched . Her tongue felt thick and was coated as if there were an untasty foreign substance in her mouth . She would never drink again . The price she was paying this morn-g was too high . Never again . Everything in life had a price . It had to be paid . And she was the best payer of prices she knew of . Thinking of this , her sleepy face broke into a wide grin . But she could n't joke with herself now . All she wanted to do was sleep . She tried to imagine her-I as a stone dropped into the cold , icy waters of the lake . t went to the bottom and stayed there , feeling nothing . She anted to die . She wanted to be dropped into Lake Michian , into the cold , icy waters , like a stone that would sink d never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold , snowy , icy out as she cut to make her end . No sun out . Just an awful day this inter . With a real blizzard . She could see herself tramping rough the snow . Not a soul on the streets . Walking throughsnow , wet , cold , chilled , walking through the snow top272the lake . Not a soul around to see her tragic , pitiful end . Jumping into the lake , drowning , alone with herself at the last miserable hour of the most miserable life that any woman ever lived . She felt so , so , so like a stone that she did n't even care if she lived or died . Black was the world . Heavy the cross . Miser able the road . Oh , God Almighty , why did you give a poor weak woman such a cross to bear ? But God would . God was a man . He made it a world for men . A man could take a woman 's all , take her body and soul , and then he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find another woman . Why should Lorry do this to her ? What did another woman have that she did n't ? She had a figure . She had a body . She had a soul . She had a mind . She had experience . She knew how to take a man and make him like it , make him crazy for it . Could another do this better ? What ? Why ? How ? She was intelligent . There was not a better business woman among the cashiers at the hotel . What mistakes she made , these were made because of her sadness and her worries , the heaviness that lay on her heart . She was interesting . She was handsome . She was n't old , only twenty-seven going on twenty-eight . That was n't old . That was the best time of a woman 's life so far as a man should be concerned . Unless a man wanted something young and dumb , a virgin who did n't know a thing ! What did a man want something like that for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he had . She lived for Lorry . She lived for him alone . He was such a man . So handsome ! So upright ! So fine ! He was like a boy . He was not just like her lover . He was her lover , and he was like her son . She lived for him . He owned her , every inch of her , body and soul . And what did he do ? Threw her away like a dishrag . It was n't right . It was n't fair . It was n't decent . It was n't the honorable thing to do . He had no right to do that . Not to her . Look what she 'd done for him . Only for her , his life would have been ruined . Supposep273she had told Brophy , sold information about Lorry to Brophy three years ago when Brophy and Lorry had been fighting and there had been that scandal ? What would you be today , I ask you , Lorry Robinson , if had done that ? Where would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected you ? And this was what she got for being honorable . Oh , piss on honor ! What good had it done her ? It had only made her ross the heavier . She was through . She was turned into stone . cr heart was cold as ice . Ice ! Well , if that was the kind of a man he was , good riddance to bad rubbish . She had been made a fool of . Here she had en a poor , trusting girl . She had believed in him . He had Id her he loved her , and ah , fool that she was , she 'd believed on . Dirty lies ! All the lies he had told her . When business as better , she need n't worry . When the scandal and investigationblew over , he 'd divorce his wife and come to her . She would be Mrs. Robinson . He 'd take her to Europe . Lies ! The s of a man . And she had been so trusting . Well , Margaret ' Flaherty had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her again . She wished she could sleep . And she could n't because of The goddamn elevated trains always going by . She 'd told Al cy had to move . But Al did n't care . He was another man . The men were alike . They owned the world . They treated men like dogs . Al did n't care . He was away . He could go bed early when he was home , get up early , get out . He n't have the elevated trains and their goddamn noise mak-g him a nervous wreck because he could n't sleep . He did n't re . No man cared as long as he had his comfort . That wasI a man wanted . Men were all alike . They were all selfish . If she could only see Lorry , talk to him . If she could go to him and say , Lorry , why did you do this to me ? If she could only put her arms around him again , kiss him , pet him , make m forget the worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , show him again her charms , comfort him , letp274him see her charms and have her beautiful body , then she would keep him . He 'd come back to her . He 'd come to his senses . Something just must have come over him . Oh , God , please let her sleep ! Oh , why had she drunk last night ? But she 'd had to because she 'd been so sad . There was that buzzing inside of her . She 'd gone around and around and around in her head . All of her inside had throbbed . She 'd had to . Hers was the penalty of a poor , trusting , unhappy girl . So now she was sick . She was sick in body , sick in heart , sick in soul . Margaret O'Flaherty was a poor , sick , useless thing , thrown away like garbage by the man she loved and adored . Ah , who would ever have dreamed that such was to be her fate , that such was to be the cross she 'd carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his senses ! He 'd see then and know that she was better for him than any other woman . No woman could love him the way she could . There was n't a woman on earth who could satisfy him the way she could . There was n't a woman on earth who could be as tender to him as she could . She 'd go through Hell for him . She 'd walk on the hottest coals . She 'd work herself to the bone . She 'd slave for him . Because she loved him as no other woman could . Why did n't he see that ? What had she said ? What had she done ? She must see him , bring him back to his senses . She must tell him , Lorry , you 're making a big mistake , a big mistake , and you 'll regret it all of your living days . Lorry , just think of what you 're doing . Lorry , do n't think of what you 're doing to me . Me , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need me , Lorry . I know you do . Oh , Lorry , I know you so well . I know how you need me . Think ! Come to your senses ! If she could only see him and tell him this , then he 'd come to his senses . Then he would n't throw her away like garbage . Oh God ! That goddamned elevated ! They 'd have to move , before next May if they could break the lease , and if not , then on May first . Al should have somep275consideration for her . She had to work harder than he did , d he did n't have her nerves . He had no nerves . All that he ad was his own selfishness and a bad temper . She jammed her head , face down , into the pillow . Oh God ! " I got a bite of lunch for the little ones and got them off ck to their lessons . Do you want your breakfast , Peg ? " Mrs. ' Flaherty said as Margaret , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just a cup of coffee , Mother . I 'll get it myself , " Margaret swered dully . " Let me get it for you . You must n't be feeling so good ay after last night , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " I 'm sorry , Mother . Mother , you must have patience with these days . I 'm not myself , " Peg said . " Did you hear from that man ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty asked , ting a cup of black coffee down before Margaret . " Mother , I never want to speak of him again , not as long I live , not as long as I live , " Peg said bitterly . " You do n't say ! " Mrs. O'Flaherty exclaimed . Margaret put sugar in the coffee . She yawned , rubbed her chead , and sat looking miserably into the black coffee . " I saw him yesterday , " she suddenly said . " You do n't say ? Did he get you drinking ? " Mrs. O'Flatheryasked . " I le did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way as last night . I saw him on the street with some whore . whore ! I know it . Some goddamn filthy whore , that 's all . was with her . And only yesterday morning , did n't I call hotel and get the message from the desk that he was n't tered ? Oh , Mother , I did n't know what I was doing . Ion my way home from work . I was feeling good becausecw I was going to be off today and be able to get a littlep276rest . And I saw him . Mother , you do n't know what it did to me . " " The black Protestant . What kind of a hat did the chippy wear ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Oh , Mother , I do n't know ! I do n't know ! I ca n't talk about it , " Margaret said melodramatically and with great weariness ; she stirred her coffee . " Ah , but let him come to this door . Peg , tell him to come here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock him down the stairs , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , gesticulating energeticallyas she spoke . Margaret did n't answer . She sat brooding over her coffee . " Ah , and well do n't I know it ! You can never place , word of trust in a Protestant . Is n't that what I said all me livelong days ? Is n't that what me mother before me said to me in the old country when I was running the bush with the backside sticking half out of me dress ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . She poured herself a cup of coffee , carried it to the table , and sat down opposite her daughter . " And so he gave you the gate , did he ? I always said there was no good in that one . Peg , I once heard tell of an Orangemannamed Robinson and there was n't an honest bone in his body . Ah , yes , I said it time after time , time after time . There 's no good in that devil of a Protestant , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it to me . But I 'm all right now . It just struck so , just as if the sidewalk fell away from under me when I was walking on it . Mother , I could have turned into stone right there on the street , " Margaret said . " Like Lot 's wife turned into a pillar of salt . Ah , Peg , you should have spit in his face and stuck your hatpin in the eyes of that chippy , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . Remaining silent , Margaret sipped her coffee . She sat staringvacantly past her mother . She got up and went to herp277droom . Mrs. O'Flaherty sipped coffee , too , nodding her ad gravely from side to side . Margaret returned with a cigarette in her mouth . " Ah , Peg , but I 'm the one to deal with the likes of a chippy d the likes of a black Protestant . Ah , but I 'm the one for em , and , I tell you , I 'd have fixed them ! Ah , but I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Mother ! I have enough worries now . Just for-t it , " Margaret said nervously . " Forget it ! In a pig 's eye , I will ! Chat ? Let a chippy take man away from you and forget it ? I 'm not the one for fortting . Peg , I never forget . I never forgive one that 's doneething to me . Not me , me mother 's daughter , " Mrs. ' Flaherty said . " You 're a hard woman , are n't you , Mother ? " Peg said . " Indeed I am ! " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , hastily getting to r feet . " See these veins in me arm ! " she said , pulling up her ve and extending her right arm . " There 's iron in them . come from a hard country ! Indeed I am a hard woman ! " said , standing in the center of the kitchen , her small fistsung , her bony wrists prominent as she waved her arms . " I guess your daughter is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argaret said , going to the stove , getting warm coffee , and n returning to the table with it . Mrs. O'Flaherty sat down again . " The likes of me is n't found every day . Ah , but I should ve seen him . With a chippy , was he ! With a chippy ! " " Please , Mother , I 'm brokenhearted . You 'll drive mezy with that talk . I got to forget him . Please stop it . Don'tme ! " Margaret said . " Sure , my angel , I 'm not nagging you . Sure , and do n't I w you 're sad ? Ah , but if your father had ever done that me when poor Pa was alive , Lord have mercy on the poorman 's soul ! Ah , but he knew better . If he had looked at an-P278other woman , I 'd have ripped the eyes right out of her head and stuck my thumb in his eyes . I 'd have blinded him just as sure as the day is long , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. O'Flaherty fumbled in her apron pocket and drew out her pipe and a package of Tip-Top tobacco . She filled the pipe , lit it , sat with her right hand clasping the corncob as she puffed out clouds of smoke . " And poor Little Brother and Little Margaret . I did n't let them sleep , either . I 'm so sorry , " said Peg . " He took his skates to school with him , and he 's going skating . I 'm going down to see Lizz and her little ones , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Mother , you got to promise me , on your word of honor , that you 'll not mention a word of this to her , " Peg said . " Sure , and tell me what in the name of the Holy Ghost I would be wanting to breathe a word of it to her for ? " " You wo n't , will you , Mother ? " " Sure , I wo n't breathe a word of it to a soul . Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gossip , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . Margaret sat with her chin cupped in her hands . " Poor Brother , and poor Little Margaret . I 'm so sorry I woke them up last night . But , Mother , when I came home I was out of my mind . It was n't from liquor . It was from grief , " Margaret said . " Peg , that man will burn in the fires of Hell . May the curse of God be on him ! " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . Margaret jumped to her feet and left the kitchen . She walked up and down the hallway , wringing her hands , sighingto herself . Up and down , silent , up and down she paced . " Well , it serves you right , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , watching her daughter . P279Margaret went to the phone , called a number , and dropped a lead slug in the box . When there was a response from the of her end of the connection , she said : " Room clerk , please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact than it was in actual seconds . She heard a hello through he receiver . " Is Mr. L. R. Robinson registered ? " she asked in a formal and disguised voice . A wave of sadness and disappointment swelled through her when she received a negative reply . " Thank you . " She hung up the receiver . She paced back and forth along the hallway . What was she going to do to get hold of herself ? She was n't ping to drink today . The more she drank , the more she postponedgetting a grip on herself . It was only a way of delayingthe day when she would be whole again , when her heart and soul would be healthy , recovered from the wounds they d suffered . She paced the floor of her room , the hall , the parlor , asking herself what could she do , how could she quiet c nerves that were hopping , jumping , twitching , inside of r ? Oh , God , why was she not a cow like her sister , Lizz ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor dear Mother , meant well , but she did n't understand . Poor dear Mother , was such a darling , but she was a greenhorn . What did she pow of things like these , sufferings such as these that her daughter was undergoing ? Cod had taken her sister Louise before Louise , poor , sick , clear , lovely girl , should know such terrible pain and sorrow . Why had n't God also taken her ? Everything in life seemedP280planned so that she , Margaret O'Flaherty , would know the hardest road . Ah , Christ , He was not the only one who had trodden a road of rocks with a heavy cross on His shoulders . A wooden cross on one 's shoulders , that was not the heaviest cross . The heaviest cross of all was the cross of broken love that a woman carried on her heart . Why was she living ? Why did she let herself go on living ? Why did she bear this sorrow ? Why did n't she just end it all , once and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she committed suicide . After what she had suffered in this world , God would not condemn her . God was not that kind of a God . Thinking of God just as a punisher , that was just the ignorance of a greenhorn like poor dear Mother , of a fool like foolish , dirty , ignorant Lizz . God was good , and He was all love . What would Lorry say if he heard that she had killed herself ? Would he know why ? No , he could n't . He could n't becauseno man could know what a woman suffered , what price she paid in the blood of her soul and her heart . No man could know , not even Lorry . No man ! It was like a buzzing inside of her . She was going around and around inside . Lorry , why did you do it to me ? Why ? Oh , why ? It must all be a misunderstanding . If only she could see him . Maybe if she saw him alone and talked turkey to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She would see him . He would kiss her . She would let him . She would ask him , Lorry , did you mean that kiss , or did you kiss me just because you always do when we meet and you did n't want to make me feel bad ? What would he answer ? Would he say , My Peg , why do you ask me that ? You know what I think of you . Would he try to wheedle her ? Would he try to beguile her into smiling ? No , he would n't succeed if that was to be his game.  |p281Lorry  , do n't play with my heart , she would tell him . Do n't try to fool me , Lorry . You have to tell me . I do n't ask anythingbut the truth . I do n't ask anything but to know just how you feel . Do n't you love me any more ? Do n't you want me any more ? Tell me ! Tell me , Lorry ! Lorry ! She would n't let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All she wanted was the truth . Only the truth . Lorry , I am woman enough to face the truth , she would say . Lorry , she would say , Lorry , if you 're tired of me , tell me . I 'll go out of your life . I 'll never put myself on you . I 'll never be a burden . I 'll never bother you . Lorry , I live for you . I love you so much and so dearly that I only want your happiness . If I can no longer make you happy , I 'll step aside and let you be free of me , from any burden of me for the woman who can make you happy . She would talk to him like that . And she would mean every word of it . Yes , every word of it . Jesus Christ , she would n't for one minute be a burden to a man . She did n't want to . She just wanted to know . She just wanted to know if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , or what it was . Could it be that Lorry was jealous of her , and he was not seeing her and seeing other women because of jealousy ? God , there would be this buzzing , this going around and around in her head until she saw him . She had to see him . She had to talk to him . If she could only see him , talk to him , then , then if he said he was through with her , that would be all . She would brace up . He would never again have to hear from her . If she knew , then , then she 'd kill herself beforeshe 'd ever burden him . The trouble was that she did n't know . She could n't be sure . That was why she was like this , in such a state of twitching nerves . She got up from her bed on which she 'd been sitting , and again she paced the house . But the external world was almost completely out of her consciousness . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one in a dream . Yes , she had to see Lorry . She could n't go on like this . She had to see him . She had to know . And when she did see him she 'd talk to him in plain words . Lorry , do n't you want me any more ? Yes , she 'd talk to him like that . She 'd talk to him , calling a spade a spade . She 'd even say to him , point-blank , Lorry , is it that you do n't think I 'm any good in bed any more ? If not , what is it ? What does a man want , what do you want , that I ca n't do , that I ca n't give you , that I have n't got ? Oh , if she could only see him alone , talk plainly to him then , and ask him . Then , if he told her , if he said he did n't want her , was tired of her , she would be resigned . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was tired of her or not . She could n't be resigned , at peace within herself , unless she knew . She had to know . She had to know what it was in her that made him tired , if he was tired of her . She 'd ask him . Why ? What had she said , what had she done , why ? She 'd make him answer her . The least that he could do , the least he owed her , was to tell her the truth . Why did n't he ? She 'd seen him on the street yesterday with a woman on his arm . And now , at every hotel where he was likely to be , the same answer  --  not registered . When she saw him , she 'd say , Lorry , you 're not square with me . You 're not doing the honorable thing . Why do n't you be square with me ? I always believed that you were a gentleman . But you 're not acting the way a gentleman should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an honorable man , he would n't make her suffer this way . Ah , and she , fool that she was , she 'd always thought that he was honorable , that he was a gentleman . Well , there was a God in Heaven . There was a God in Heaven Who punished those who were mean . There was a God in Heaven Who would not stand by and see meannessP283go unpunished . As sure as the day was long , as true as she was Peg O'Flaherty walking back and forth in her home at this very minute , Lorry Robinson would beunished by God for what he 'd made her go through . He would be repaid . A man who treated a woman badly , he need n't think that he 'd go scot free . There was a God . She went out to the kitchen and had another cup of coffee . " Peg , are you better ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty asked . Margaret did not hear her mother . She sipped her coffee . " Peg , do you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " Sure , and I was n't . I was only asking you if you feel any better , " said Mrs. O'Flaherty . " Yes , " Margaret said dully . Margaret sat down at her writing desk . She wanted to write a letter to the Poor Clares . They 'd pray to God for her , and their prayers would be heard . God would have to hear their prayers . God would know what the plea of their prayers was . God would know that their prayers were the plea of a poor , stricken , sinful and unhappy girl who could not pray herself , whose heart and whose soul were too torn by the misery of life to pray herself . God would know that . She sat at her desk . She picked up her pen and set it down . She cupped her chin in her left hand , and her eyes vacantly concentrated on the roses in the wallpaper . God would know . She could feel that God would know . God was good . God was kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unhappyand in misery . God did n't punish as people said He did . That was just old greenhorn Irish superstition . She could see God in Heaven . She had a picture of Him in her mind . He was wearing robes and He was sweet and kindly . He was saying that He did not send unhappy souls to Hell for the sins that they could not help committing . He was saying it to her sister Louise . Louise was in Heaven with God and with Father . P284Father was there , too , her dear father . God was saying to her dear , dead father and her dear , dead sister that no , He did not send poor unfortunate sinners to Hell . He was saying sin was in yourself , in your mind . He was saying that what poor Mrs. O'Flaherty and Lizz O'Neill thought of Him was only Irish superstition . They did not know Him truly as He was . He had not made the world to be a place of misery . He had not created Hell to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was God . She had a pictureof Him in her mind . He was good , and He was kind , and He would not punish as the old Irish superstitiously said He would . That was God . Her vision of God as good , and helpful , and comforting , and merciful and gentle , and full of charity , was strong and stirring in her mind as she addressed the letter . Dear Good Pious Lovely SistersThese Poor Clares , these kindly virginal nuns , they were the ones who were really holy . And they were n't like Lizz O'Neill . They were not holy like Lizz . They were holy the way God wanted some women to be holy . Judge not and you shall not be judged ! They were n't judges . Lizz was . Her mother was . The world was . All her life she had known a world full of hypocrites and judges . Please pray for my special intention . I am very sad and unhappy and please , lovely Sisters of God , pray for my specialintention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one dollar which is all that I can possibly afford but if I could afford a larger offering I would enclose it and it would make me so happy to do it . I have so much on my poor mind and I must carry such a heavy cross through life . Please lovely good sisters , please pray for me . Ask . God and my poor dear dead father and my lovely darling departed sister Louise in Heaven to join you by asking God to give me the strength to carry my load and my cross through life . My poor sister who is mar-P285tied she is so poor and I art so worried that I can not give her more help and my dear mother is old and I want her last days to be happy and I have to carry so many burdens and responsibilitieson my poor shoulders . Please good sisters pray for my special intention and as soon as I can I am going to send you a larger offering . You are so good . I do n't know how I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . From the bottom of my heart I write this letter and ask you this favor and tell these things to you . Margaret O'Flaherty P.S. Thank you dear sisters from the bottom of my heart . Peg drew a dollar bill from her large , black leather pocketbook , folded it up in the letter , placed both in an envelope , and addressed it to the Convent of the Poor Glares . The prayers of the Poor Glares , the plight of herself , these would wring even the heart of God , she told herself with gloomy confidence . Such prayers would bring her the help of God in sending Lorry back to her and easing the buzzing buzzing buzzing that went on in her head like some awful bug or spider . She paced her bedroom , smoking cigarette after cigarette and wringing her hands . She sat down again at the desk , a determined look on her face . She placed a clean sheet of paper before her . Dear AlI detest having to write this letter to you but I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and I was almost driven crazy . Danny of course is the loveliestboy but he is wild and careless . When he washes his hands hi the bowl in the bathroom , he does not wash the bowl out . his is carelessness is a bad example for Little Margaret . And sometimes it is hard to make her go to school . She does not like school . I work hard as you know at the hotel . I do not mind doing things at home , and I would willingly do anything . But it seems to me that Danny is old enough to clean out the bowl in the bathroom when he washes his hands and the very least he could do would be to wash the bowl out . When you were home for Christmas you talked to both of the children and they promised you they were going to cooperate . On Monday morning , I went in to clean up be f ore going to work and the bathroom looked as if a cyclone had hit it . Wet towels were on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brother you should n't be so careless and he said to me that he was not a servant or a nigger . Al you know how I love Mother and she is such a dear good lovely darling even if she does nag me until I want to scream but Al you 4 must do something when you come home because she is responsiblefor spoiling the boy and she is not fair to his sister , nags her all the time . If you do n't do something I will just have to leave because I can not stand it one more day . Mother simply must stop spoiling him and stop her old gabbing old Irish nagging and talking . I am almost out of my head with nerves and I can not go on like this . If I can not have a little peace and comfort at home I shall have to go away and try to find it some place else . I know of no girl my age , making the money I make , doing the work I do , holding the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put up with . I can not do it any more . My nerves are shattered . You must do something . If things do not change you must come home and straighten them out . If you do n't , you will not find me here when you do come home . It is the breaking point . It can not go on any longer . It is final . I will lose my head because of my nerves unless there is a change . I hate to have to write you like this but I simply can not go on . PegShe addressed and sealed the letter . Well , everything she said was so . She could n't go on with things like this . Mother nagging and nagging and nagging . Danny spoiled , becomingP287a brat , dirty and noisy . Last night , look at the way he talked to her after all she 'd done for him , and she with a broken heart . Little Margaret getting sassy , fighting with Danny . Mother nagging Little Margaret . She could not go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , Brother was a sweet boy . She would do everything in the world she could for him to make him happy , to see that he got a good education , to see that he could become somebody in this world . But there was a limit . Yes , there was a limit . And that limit had been reached . Margaret sat down again . She was going to write to Lorry . She did n't care if he had said not to . She was going to write to him . The time was past when she cared . He had not treated her right . He had not done the right thing by her . If he was going to let her pay , she was going to make him pay , too . She sniffled . She wiped her eyes and blew her nose with the sleeve of her kimono . She was going to make him pay . Dear LorryI can not go on any longer . My nerves are killing me . I cannotstand it . I can not go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care where you are . You must come to Chicago right away and see me . Lorry , this can not go on as it has been . I have lo see you . I have to know are you through with me , do n't you want me any more . I can not stand this uncertainty . I know you warned me against writing you letters like this . But I do n't care . I ca n't stand it . I ca n't help myself any more . I got to know . You have to tell me . There are things in life more important than what the world knows . I do n't care any more what the world knows and thinks . I hate the world . I do n't care . Let the world know . I am killing myself u'ith worry . I do n't care if I live or die . I do n't care . You have to see me . I have been fair and square with you Lorry Robinson . Lorry Robinson you got to be fair and square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing and threw it in the wastebasket . She got up from the chair . She lit a cigarette . She walked to and fro across the bedroom , puffing , her face cloudy , sad , absorbed . She went to the wastebasket , pulled out the crumpled sheets of paper on which she had written , went to the bathroom with them . She tore them into small pieces , slowly , carefully , and then she dropped them into the bowl . She pulled the chain , watched the rush of water , the swirl , the bits of paper curling around and around , carried down . She left the bathroom . Oh God ! If she wrote him such a letter , he 'd be more angry . She might let the cat out of the bag . Suppose she did ? Would she gain ? Would she lose ? She did n't care . He did n't care about her nerves , her feelings , her heart , her very own life , did he ? Why should she show him any consideration ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , all the love and devotion she had lavished upon him ! What did he care ? He asked her not to write to him , not to let the world know . But why ? Why should n't she , when he treated her like a cur ? Why should n't she ? What gratitude did he show to her for all that she had done for him ? None . Absolutely none . None . And the blackest sin in the world was the sin of ingratitude . She had to see him . She had to speak to him . What would she do ? She could n't go on living like this any longer . She could n't ! Oh , God , why must such unhappiness befall her , and only her ? So many others she knew , they did not have such unhappiness . She could do nothing but worry . She could n't think . She could n't work . She could n't even pray . Only worry . Only nerves . Only this state she was now in . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Again she sat down at the desk , cupped her chin in her hands . What should she say to him ? Maybe she would try one letter written like a business letter . But he was in Chicago . Would he be going back to his office ? Would the letterP289be forwarded to him if he was n't ? When would he et it ? Would he ignore it as he had ignored all the other letters she had sent him these last months ? Oh , this uncertainty would kill her . She drew out a fresh sheet of paper . She dipped her pen in the ink bottle . Dear LorryI know you do n't want me to write to you like this and I Arnow that I should n't . I know , oh Lorry dearest , I know . But I have to . If you only knew how I feel and what I am doing through , you would understand . Lorry I simply must sec you . As soon as you receive this letter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must see you . I must hear your voice . I want to know and I must know Lorry is it all over ? Is all our beautiful love dead ? You must tell me . You simply must . I can not stand this uncertainty . My nerves ere killing me . She tore up this letter , went to the bathroom , dropped it In the bowl and pulled the chain . She paced the hall . She would n't write to him . She 'd be proud . Never again would she see him . She 'd freeze her heart to him until it was like ice . She 'd go on living with a heart of ice . He did n't care . Fie had hurt her . She would n't care in time . She would becomecold and hard and calculating . She 'd act as other women did . What she had paid because of him , other men would pay because of her . She would be proud . She was young . Lorry was n't the only goldfish swimming in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach . He was n't the only man In the world . She 'd be proud . No , the world would n't be told of her sorrow and her disappointment . The world would never know . For the world , she 'd laugh , she 'd sing , she 'd smile , she 'd dance , she 'd be gay and have a good time , and the world would pay . She walked up and down the hallway , trying to steel herself . Suddenly , she ran into her bedroom , aP290closed the door after her , flung herself on the bed , and cried ' with her head sunk into a pillow on the unmade bed . She quivered as she sobbed . With equal suddennes , she jumped up , went to the desk , and wrote again . Dear Mr. RobinsonI have just had a long and confidential business talk with Mr. Olson . Conditions are worse than they were for hi in . If something does not happen immediately I am afraid that he will do something dangerous . His depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit suicide . I can not do anything for him . I advise you to try and come to Chicagoimmediately and have a long business talk with him ? Unless you do and right away , it might be too late . I have never seen him in such a black depression in all my experience with him . I am afraid he will commit suicide . I advise you to come to Chicago and see him immediately for a long helpfulbusiness talk . He wants that and only that , he says , will save him . He says so . If you do n't his death might be on your conscience . It is most urgent . Sincerely yoursA . J. JohnsonP . S. I am writing this letter in my own hand instead of dictatingit to my secretary because it is so confidential I would n't even allow my secretary to know about it . With determination , she sealed the letter and addressed the envelope , marking it personal and important . She began dressinghurriedly in order to get her letters mailed . She was determined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he did n't come , she 'd kill herself , and before she died she 'd leave a letter behind to be opened after she was gone , telling everything , everything to the world .

And today is n't so cold , so I says to meself , wait till I gee down there and tell Lizz , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , and after speakingshe lifted the thick muglike teacup to her lips .

If you 're pure and holy and live in the fear of God , you 'll have all the joys of the Kingdom of Heaven waiting for you when you die , " Lizz said . " You say the truth , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , and she took another sip of tea . " Jim and me are poor , but we 're good . We live in the fear of God . We wo n't be poor in the next world , " Lizz said . " You say the truth , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Mother , you say he gave her the gate ? " Lizz asked . " Indeed he did . He tied a can to her , " Mrs. O'Flaherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips knowingly , looked squarely at her mother , raising her brows and nodding her head up and down as if in thought and realization . " And small loss he is , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Mother , I always told you that no good would come from her running after him , " Lizz said . " Did n't I once hear tell of an Orangeman named Robinsonwho ran out on a debt ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " I dreamed it . Last night , Mother , Father came to me last night , and he told me . When you walked in the door this afternoon , I knew you were coming to tell me what Father told me last night , " Lizz said . " You saw Pa again ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty asked sharply . " Yes , Mother , " Lizz said . " The devil of a nerve he has , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said acidly . " Mother , whenever Father comes to me , he tells me to look after you , " Lizz said , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , you in there , keep quiet and play without making so much noise , " she yelled . " I 'll let you know I need no looking after , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " And so he tied a can to her ? Well , it serves her right . She carried on like a disgrace , Mother , a disgrace , " Lizz said , taking another sip of tea . " All that I ask is that I should have seen him on the street like Peg did , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Mother , no , never do that . It is n't ladylike to fight on the street , " Lizz said . " Ladylike be damned ! Ladylike to spit in the eyes of a streetwalker and suck the blood out of a Protestant limb of the Devil , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Mother , oh no ! Oh no !

That 's all he is , " Lizz said self-righteously . " Oh , but if I ever lay the sight of day on him with these eyes ! " " Mother , if you see him on the street , do n't speak to him . Do n't give him the satisfaction . Here 's what you do , " Lizz said . She arose , and her pregnant abdomen stuck out . She walked across the kitchen in a clumsy , mincing manner , swinging her arms , swaying her buttocks , and holding her nose in the air . " Just do that .

Mother , do n't you believe her . She 's stalling . She heard tome swell down at the hotel where she works talk about nerves , and that 's the whole story . " " Lizz , and how are you ? " asked Mrs. O'Flaherty .   " Oh , Mother , it 's hard . I 'm getting big , and it 's hard movingaround , and I have pains and my morning sickness . I have to get up , sick or not , and take care of this regiment , " Lizz said . " You poor thing , " said Mrs. O'Flaherty . " If I led the life of Riley like that one behind me does , " said Lizz . " Who 's that ? " asked Mrs. O'Flaherty . " That Connerty one , " said Lizz . " I came over on the boat and I was out five weeks , five weeks , and there was a Connerty from Galway on the boat , and do you know , she talked the shirt off the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lizz , " said Mrs. O'Flaherty . " I do . Say , but you should see the way I high-hat that one . But , Mother , she 's thick with Father Corbett 's housekeeper . They go out all the time . Mother , they 're cronies , and the two of them talk the legs off one another , backbiting . Mother , all they do is backbite . They 're trying to turn Father Corbett against me . I know they are . But they ca n't do it . They ca n't . I told Father Corbett that my mother 's sister is a nun in New York , and he liked that , " said Lizz . " Have you heard from me sister ? " asked Mrs. O'Flaherty . " No , I must write to her . Have you ? " " Sure , and who would write her for me , with Al on the road , and that one at home , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " She and the airs she puts on ! Who is she ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sister , she 's a hussy . That 's what she is . A dirty hussy . Her and her nerves . When Jim hears talk of her nerves , he always says that a good swift kick in the ass would cure her of nerves . " " Lizz , she does be walking up and down the hall pale as a ghost , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , raising her hands and looking upward with a shocked expression . " Mother , you should have married her off to a good man when she was a girl just like you married me . " " And sure , I did n't marry you off . "   " Why , Mother , you did , too . Every good mother marries her daughters off , " Lizz said . " And tell me , what decent man would have her with her cigarette-smoking , and her pot under the bed too lazy to go to the bathroom , and her high-lifing out at night till all hours . What decent man would have her ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim . Decent men want decent women , " Lizz said boastingly . " Indeed they do , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , while from the other rooms the children could be heard trying to sing . " Mother , if you make yourself cheap and easy to get like she did , all you can get is a dirty stinking rotter like that Robinson , and then , when he gets tired of you , he throws you overboard and does n't care if you sink or swim . But if you do n't make yourself easy , you get a good , decent , dependableman like my Jim , who does n't throw you overboard , " said Lizz . " Ah , Lizz , but I should be the girl again . The man is n't alive who would do to me what that Protestant devil did to my Peg . That ' married man ! " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " The least he could have done if he was a decent man was give her five or ten thousand dollars when he threw her overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money . It 's money that 's come out of the mouth of Hell , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " I know it is , Mother , and I would n't touch a red cent of it , but I was saying , it 's the least he could have done if he was a man and a gentleman , " Lizz said . Lizz got to her feet and spoke with many gestures , her heavy breasts wobbling . " Mother , it 's easier for a camel to go through the eye of needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven . Mother , mark my words ! When Robinson dies , he 'll go It r.i ; gilt to Hell on an express train with no stops on the way ! Mother , when I die , if I go to Heaven , I 'll look down and tare him roasting and toasting , parched for a drop of waterP296to drink , crying out to be rid of his suffering and agony , crying and bawling for the sight of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God for all eternity is the wore punishment of God . Mother , he 'll be suffering and crying , and I 'll spit on him . I 'll spit on him , and I 'll tell him , ' Go , ahead , you devil , you 're with Satan where you belong ! Burn down there , you trifler ! Roast and toast away , you dirty bum ! You have n't a swell suit of clothes and money now to hide from the world that you 're just a bum and a no-account . Burn ! Toast ! Go ahead , go ahead , fry away , you sonofabitchMother , that 's the way I 'll greet him in the next world . " " I often do be thinking that the people in the old country would have run the likes of him into the sea with pitchforks , ' , Mrs. O'Flaherty said while Lizz sat down , tired and breathless . " Mother , he has n't any conscience . That 's why he 's such a bad one , " Lizz said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was saying . " Since when did anyone hear tell that a black Protestant has a conscience ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " And , Mother , it would tear your heart out . When Peg first met him years ago , she was such a lovely thing , such an innocent girl , so sweet . And now what is she ? What ? I 'll tell you . She 's damaged goods . When you go to the grocery store , do you want damaged goods , broken eggs , and stale bread , damaged goods ? Do you ? " " I 'd break the window of him that sold them to me . " " It 's the same , the very same thing , when men go into the market and look for a wife . They do n't want women to be damaged goods , either . Mother , do you think for one minute that my Jim would have wanted me if I was damaged goods ? I should say not ! I was a virgin , Mother , a virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I was n't , he never would have had me . No man , Mother , wants damaged goods . And Peg 's damaged goods now . That dirty bum has ruined her life , P297ruined my lovely sister 's life . Now no decent man will have her because she 's damaged goods , " Lizz said . " And to think that I would see the day in the latter end of me life when me own daughter would come to this . It would make your blood run cold . Heavy is the world on me poor old heart . But , Lizz , you 're a good daughter . " " I 'm your favorite , ai n't I , Mother ? " Lizz said , her decayingteeth showing as she flashed a broad smile . " I 'm my Mama 's favorite child , ai n't I ? " she repeated , adjusting the soiled rag under her fatty chin while she talked . " Oh , but if I was a man , I 'd fist him for doin ' that to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd get some of the men that worked on the wagons with him , and they 'd fist him , they would , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " I 'll tell you what , Mother . Jim 'll get some of the men on the express wagons after him . They 'll do it . Some of them men are fighters . Oh , but they 're fighters ! Many a time my Jim has come home with his face all swollen up after fighting and I 've had to send Bill out to get raw beefsteak to put on his face . Them men are fighters , and my Jim will get them after him , " Lizz said . " I 'll give every man that punches him a quarter . " " You wo n't have to , Mother . They 'll do it for nothing for my Jim , " Lizz said . " If they beat him within an inch of his life , God will reward them , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Mother , when you told me today , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , " Lizz said . " My Louise never would have become a chippy , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Oh , my sister Louise was an angel . An angel , purer thanthe flowers , she was . An angel out of Heaven , " Lizz said . " Indeed , she was , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , beginning to cry . The tears welled in Lizz 's eyes . " God took her because she was too pure for this earth , " Lizz sobbed .   " She 's with Pa and me mother now , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " A pity , Mother , " Lizz exclaimed . " A shame , indeed , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . The four youngest O'Neill children were playing house . They halted their game when Lizz and Mrs. O'Flaherty , wearing her fur coat , stopped to look at them . " Ah , the cute little things , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , smiling at them . " Every one of them is their Mama 's Angel Child , Mother , " Lizz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's pale . Sure , the poor baby is pale as a ghost , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " He had a cold , Mother . It was so cold here . Look , we have wrapping paper all around the windows and on the floor to keep some of the cold air out , but it does n't help a lot . Jim , poor man , had to spend two nights , after being out all day on the wagon in the cold , laying that paper under the beds and couches , taking up rugs and putting it under them , putting it on the walls there near the window sills , " Lizz said . " Lizz , and sure he has such beautiful eyes , " Mrs. O'Flahertysaid . All the children looked up at their mother and grandmother . " Arty , precious , say hello to your grandmother , " Lizz said . " Lo , " Arty said . " Ah , the little dream . He 's such a pretty baby , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to Mrs. O'Flaherty . " Dammither , " Arty said , pointing to his grandmother . " And little Katy here . Hello , you little darling . She 's a cute one , Lizz , and look at the little face of her . She looks like a deep one , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . Catherine smiled .   " Mother , " she said , addressing her grandmother . " Yes , you little darling , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " We were playing house , " Catherine said . " They 're such good children . They 've been so good today , " Lizz said . " And little Dinny here , he 's a scholar now . Do you know your letters , little Dennis ? " " Oh , Mother , the Sister thinks the world of him , and he 's so smart . He reads and writes now , " Lizz said . " I know the alphabet , and I read from my reader , and I write , " Dennis said . " You little scholar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Margaret coming to see me ? " Catherine asked . " Soon it will be . Little Pegeen is a cute little one , too , Lizz , " said Mrs. O'Flaherty . " I want to see my sister Margaret , " Catherine said . " And there 's the left-handed one , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , pointing to Bob . Bob smiled up at his grandmother . " He 'll be going to school in a year or two , " said Lizz . " They 're all going to be little scholars . But , Lizz , look at the face on the little one . Ah , Lizz , he has a wise face , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , pointing to the baby . " He 's wise , a wise one , Mother . He has big , wise eyes , " Lizz said . " He looks as wise as an old man . Look at the face on him , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Mother , he is . And do n't you think he takes after Pa ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an O'Flaherty , Lizz , " said Mrs. O'Flaherty . Arty smiled shyly at his grandmother , held her in his deep brown eyes . " I never saw a baby with such beautiful eyes , ' Lizz said . " They 're brown eyes , Mama , " Catherine said . " They have the look of an old man in them . He 's goingP300to grow up to be a wise one . But he looks so pale and thin . Sure , he needs to be built up , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " It 's always terrible for them in winter . They are so cold in the house here . The wind comes right off the corner and hits us . I 'm thankful that the weather is warmer now . I hope it stays this way , " Lizz said . " Cold , " Arty said ; he crossed his hands , screwed up his face , pursed his little lips , blew air out of them rapidly . " Mother , he 's saying cold to you , " Lizz said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arty . He looked at her suspiciously . He came to her slowly . She picked him up , kissed him . He was quiet in her arms and watched his mother closely . " That 's your grandmother , Arty , " Lizz said to him . " Dammither , " Arty said , and laughed . " Mother ? " Catherine said . " Yes , Little Katy , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Arty is learning to talk good , " Catherine said . " He is , is he ? Lizz , he 's almost as beautiful a baby as my grandson Daniel was at his age , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . She looked at her grandson in her arms . " Danny was a beautiful baby with his curly hair , " Lizz said . " They 're all fine children , Lizz , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " I wish they were bigger . They 'd be less care , " Lizz said . " The time will come when they will be , " Mrs. O'Flahertysaid . She put Arty down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pressed his curly head against her leg . Mrs. O'Flaherty bent down and fumbled in her pocketbook . She handed each of them a penny . " Buy yourselves some candy , " she said . " Say thank you to your grandmother , " Lizz said . " Thank you , " the three oldest said in unison . Arty studied his penny . He started to put it in his mouth .   " Arty ! " Catherine said , rushing to him , taking his hand away from his mouth . " Do n't you swallow that . " " He does n't know better yet , does he , Lizz ? " Mrs. O'Flahertysaid . " Gim me your penny . I 'll mind it for you , " said Catherine . " Ma , can I mind Arty 's penny for him ? " Dennis asked . " I will , " Lizz said , bending down and taking the pennyfrom Arty . " Here , Lizz . Buy something for the little ones , and get the baby some milk , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother . I will , " said Lizz . " I got to be going , Lizz , " said Mrs. O'Flaherty . " All of you kiss your grandmother goodbye , " Lizz said . Mrs. O'Flaherty bent down , let each of them kiss her cheek , kissed each one on the forehead , and patted their heads . She kissed Arty twice . " You wise one , " she said to him , giving him a pat on the head . " Goodbye , Lizz , " she said . " Bye-bye , " Arty said . " Let me kiss you goodbye , Mother , " Lizz said . " Do n't make free with me . Goodbye , and take care of the little ones , " she said , and she was gone .   SOME day he would be a better ice skater than he was now . He had to keep trying to learn so that he could skate better like Albert and some of the others did . And maybe some day he would have Johnson racers instead of clamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good going around in circles . Danny set his body , stroked with his left foot , followed with his right . He swayed awkwardly , and he lost his rhythm . His head and shoulders were jerked backward . He was afraid that he 'd fall , and he struggled to regain his balance , stroking his left foot again . He just escaped a tumble . Had to try it slower . " Getting along all right ? " Albert Throckwaite , a thin , blond boy of Danny 's size , called as he went by rapidly . " Yeah , " Danny yelled after him , but Albert had gone on toward the other end of the pond . Danny struggled along by himself , unable to keep a steady and rhythmic stride . He was on the verge of tumbling when he grabbed onto a branch in the small , snow-covered island in the center of the Washington Park duck pond . He saw the half-crowded duck pond . Most of the skaters were young boys and girls . It was warm and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so sloppy , and if he could skate better . He saw jimmy Keogh trying to catch Albert . They could go so good . But they had been skating longer than he had been . He 'd only gotten the skates as a Christmas present from Uncle Al . He was learning . He saw little Hortense Audrey about fifteen yards aheadp303of him . She wore a green plaid skirt , a red sweater , and red mittens and stocking cap . She could n't skate good , and she had worse form than he had . She tried , went several strokes , stopped and looked around . " Washerwoman , " Tommy Keefe yelled ; he skated up to her and gave her a push . She fell down and sat on the ice , laughing . " You go away , " she said when she got up . Tommy laughed and skated away . He suddenly fell , but got right up . " Serves you right , " Hortense Audrey called after him , and she laughed . Danny laughed , too . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , struggled through the moving figures . He drew up awkwardly beside Hortense Audrey . " Did you see Tommy fall ? " she asked him . " Yes , he took a funny spill , " Danny said . " I was glad , " she said pertly . " I did n't care , " Danny said . " You have n't fallen down ? " " No , " he said . " You 're lucky . I did , three times , " she said . " The ice is n't good today , " he said . " No , it 's melting , " she said . " Washerwoman , " Tommy Keefe yelled at her , shooting by . " Peddle your fish , " she called after him . " He 's a good skater , " Danny said . " He 's too fresh , and every time he tries to show off how fast he can skate , he falls down , " she said . " Want me to push you ? " Albert asked Hortense , coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall down , " she said . " I wo n't , " he said . He got behind her , skated slowly , and pushed her . Danny heard her laughing as she was pushed . Some day he would be able to skate good enough to push her . He was afraid to ask her yet because he was n't sure of himself on the ice . And there was Jimmy Keogh , skating with crossed hands with Helen Smith . Virginia Doyle was n't out skating . She never went skating , it seemed . But then , Hortense and Helen Smith did , and he could see them out here . Danny took a long stroke with his left foot , followed with his right , lost his balance , heard a laugh as he tumbled , and found himself sitting on the ice . He got up and looked about , abashed . " Now you fell down , " Hortense Audrey said , coming up to him beside Albert . " It takes time to learn how to skate , " Albert said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audrey . " If you come out enough , I can teach you , " Albert said to her , and Danny , hearing Albert say this , looked wistfully past them . " My daddy is a good skater and he says he 's going to teach me how to skate . " He took a stroke away from them . Tommy Keefe and Helen Smith skated by . She threw a snowball at him , and it caught him by the side of the ear . Tommy hit Hortense with a snowball . Tommy and Helen stood there , laughing , and Danny , unsteady on his skates , wiped the snow away from his cheek and neck , some of it trickling under his collar and forming a cold stream that slid down his chest . " Ca n't catch me , Al , " Tommy said , skating away , and Al pursued him . He set his lips grimly and slowly took strokes , trying to keep himself going . He did n't know why he did n't learn quicker . He was a good roller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you could learn easy , like he always learned the arithmetic lessons . And some things you could n't learn easy . Like when the school year started , he had gone with some of the other kids to study and be an altar boy . But he went twice to learn the Latin after school , and he couldn'tp305learn the Latin . It was too hard . So he quit going . Albert learned it , and he was an altar boy now . Albert learned all kinds of things easy . Danny went persistently ahead , going around the edge of the pond . There were n't so many skating at the edge and he could keep out of collisions . He could only learn how to skate by practicing all the time . It was just starting to get dark . They would all have to be going home soon . Would Aunt Peg be home drunk ? Gee , it was going to be terrible if she fell off the water wagon and stayed off it . He did n't want to think of that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward strides , fighting himself to keep from spilling . Uncle Al had said he would give him a dollar if he got ninety on his report card . He got ninety last month , and it was the first time since he had been in school that he 'd gotten an average that high . Uncle Al would be glad of it . He bent down and made a snowball . He threw it at a small tree . " My ankles wo n't hold me up good , " Joe Conlan said , almostbumping into Danny . Joe was a dark boy in fourth grade , smaller than Danny . " Mine get weak , " Danny said . " Gee , you shoulda seen me fall , " Joe said . " I took a bad spill , too , " Danny said . " Well , the ice ai n't any good today , " Joe said . " No , it 's getting warm , " Danny said . " Yeah . Say , all the kids are inside the house . Let 's go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary wooden house . IIIt was half dark inside , and there were benches around the side and a few rows of them in the center . There was a large stove in a corner . Joe and Danny walked on their skates along the wooden floor to a corner where the gang was . Al- bert , Jimmy Keogh , Tommy Keefe , Hortense Audrey , Helen Smith , and blonde-haired Jennie Conlan were there . Danny got behind Joe because he 'd have to sit down beside Hortense Audrey . He wanted to , and he could n't get up the nerve to do it . It 'd look like he was sweet on her . He was sweet on her , and he knew he 'd blush if they teased him . " Everybody 's here now , " Hortense Audrey said . " Yeah , and it 's more fun inside than falling down on that sloppy ice , " Joe said . " Poor Joey ca n't skate so good , can you , Joey ? " Jennie Conlan said . " Well , what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , " said Jennie . " Danny , next month when Lent comes , what are you gon na stay away from ? " Hortense Audrey asked . " Gee , I do n't know , something , " said Danny . " I guess I 'll lay off school , " said Tommy Keefe . " You ca n't do that , " Helen Smith said . " Sure I can . You got to sacrifice something , and that 's a big sacrifice for me , " said Tommy , and the girls giggled . " You fell asleep in school this afternoon , and you 're lucky Miss McGinnis did n't catch you , " Jennie Conlan called down to him . " Tommy Keefe is too funny for words , " Helen Smith said . " I 'd like to give up falling on the ice for Lent , " Joe Conlan said . " That 's not serious . I was talking serious , " Hortense Audrey said . " I 'm going to give up candy and shows , " Danny saidquickly , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I could give up candy , " Hortense Audreysaid . " Why ? " asked Danny . " I got a sweet tooth , " she said . " Virginia Doyle is giving up candy , shows , ice cream , and cake , " said Jennie Conlan.  | " Well , she 's awful holy . She goes to Communion every Sunday , " Hortense Audrey said . " She 's as holy as holy water , " Tommy Keefe said . " That 's bad to say that , " Hortense Audrey said . " What intention are you going to make , Danny , when you give something up in Lent ? " asked Jennie Conlan . " Gee , I ai n't thought about it yet , " said Danny . But he knew . Only he could n't tell them . He went off into a dreamy state , suddenly not hearing what they were saying . He was going to give up something and make a sacrifice in Lent with the special intention that his Aunt Margaret would stop drinking for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the line of kids on the bench . He looked from Hortense Audrey to Helen Smith . He guessed that if I fortense Audrey would like him , he 'd like her better than he would Helen Smith . And she 'd spoken to him today . " Wo n't it be fun to eat candy on Easter Sunday if you go without it all during Lent ? " said Hortense Audrey . " And what fun wo n't I have coming back to school after Easter when I sacrifice school during Lent , " said Tommy Keefe . " Go on , you , " said Helen Smith , laughing . " Red-head , gingerbread , five cents a loaf , " Tommy singonged . " Fresh , " said Helen Smith . " Fish , " said Tommy Keefe . " For sale , " Danny added , trying to be funny . " Boys try to be funny and are n't , " said Helen Smith , and he girls all giggled . " I know a girl who 's funny , " said Hortense Audrey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Hortense . " She had dirty stockings on in school again today , " said nnic Conlan . " Sourface , " said Tommy.  | " That 's not a nice name to call even Maggie Grady , " said Helen Smith . " Maggie Grady is a baby , " Tommy said . " I do n't like her , " Hortense Audrey said . " Who does ? " asked Helen Smith . " It 's gon na be dark soon , and I got to go home , " Hortense said . " Let 's all go out and skate once again before we go , " Danny said , hoping to keep the gang together a little longer . They crowded out of the warming house . Danny felt sad when he left the kids at Fifty-first and the park . All the rest of them went down Grand Boulevard , and he had to go eastward alone on Fifty-first Street . It was dark now , and Fifty-first Street was noisy with clanging street cars ; there were many people on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting chillier out , too . He wished it was tomorrow afternoon , and it was colder to make the ice better , and he was at the duck pond again with the kids . He liked the gang . None of them teased him the way the Prairie Avenue kids did . Hortense Audrey had been friendly to him today , too . He felt like he could hardly wait until tomorrow . And now he had to go home.  |p309He  walked along Fifty-first Street , dragging his feet , his books slung under one arm , his skates strapped together and slung over his shoulder . Would Aunty Margaret be drunk or sober ? If she was drunk , there would be yelling and fighting in the house . None of the kids in the gang were going home now afraid that they were going to have somebody drunk in the house like he was . He envied the kids . And if she got drunk and was seen staggering on the street by a kid from school who knew her , and it was told ? Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grade ahead and did n't seem to talk much with kids in his gang , and Stewiewas not liked by the kids . He was one of the dunces in the room , and nobody liked him much . Stewie had never picked on him after the fight last summer and it was all forgotten . Stewie always talked to him when they met or walked to school together . He walked on , taking his time . He did n't want to get home , and the longer it took him , the better . He kicked a piece of ice along the sidewalk and it slid around from side to side . The street cars passing and the elevated trains ahead seemed to be noises that were much farther away than they were . He did n't want to go home . And , gee , would she be drunk ? And suppose , some time , Hortense Audrey and the kids in the gang and Virginia Doyle would get to know it ? lie wished it was tomorrow afternoon and they were all skating together again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked on . Why did people get drunk ? Whiskey and gin had an awful smell and he once tasted beer and he did n't like it . Why did they get drunk ? He wished he could go to the moving-picture show tonight , but he did n't think Mother would let him , and he had his omework to do . It would n't be hard to do if Aunty Peg was her . She 'd been asleep when he got home at noon . He was lad it was getting chillier . The ice might be good again morrow . If the ice was good and he went skating every y , he would be learning to skate . Then , he 'd say to Hortense udrey : Let 's skate together . Yes , she would say . He would hold her hands crossed with his , and they would ate around the duck pond . They would skate around and nand . All the kids would see they could skate good . It 's fun like this , he would say . Yes , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner past the cigar store at Fifty-t and Prairie . Oh , if she would only be sober . His heart began to beat more rapidly , and he walked on home sadly , full of fears , seeing his aunt at home , staggering and yelling and cursing at the top of her voice.  |p311MARGARET  let her eyes rove about the overstuffed parlor of her friend , Myrtle Peck , admiring and envying her friend 's home and her friend 's private income from a divorced husband . Myrtle 's home was spick and span . There was a maid to keep it up , and Myrtle did n't have to lift a hand . Sitting on a large upholstered divan , Margaret watched Myrtle , who sat in an enormous rocking chair which sprouted an abundanceof strange-looking carved animals . On the wall behindMyrtle there was a dreamy Maxfield Parrish picture . A small table to her left supported a Chinese vase . Yes , Margaret thought that Myrtle had a lovely home . She fixed her eyes on the lamp placed in the center of a beautiful cherrywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean and orderly . And just think , Myrtle did n't have to lift a finger in it , not a finger . " Peg , you must n't worry . You must live and be gay , " Myrtle said . Margaret looked straight at her friend , a woman slightly Luger than herself , but with a fine figure , a round face , blue @yes , blonde hair , a lacy , embroidered shirtwaist , and an expensiveblue serge skirt . Myrtle had money for clothes , too , and she could live just like a lady , Margaret thought to herself . " I know it , I know it , Myrtle , " Margaret said , her voice rained , as if from wearied and tired emotions . " Life was made for joy , " Myrtle said . " You can say it , Myrtle , because you do n't have the trouIcsI 've got , my " responsibilities , " Margaret said.  | " Peg , you got to shake them off like the dust and live your own life , " Myrtle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily . " Will you have a cup of tea , dearie ? " Myrtle asked , and Margaret nodded her head affirmatively . Myrtle rose . Margaret watched the slow , languid manner in which Myrtle walked out of the room . The life of a lady , Myrtle had . ' Well , she was n't jealous of Myrtle . Myrtle was too dear and kind and understanding and lovely to be one that Peg O'Flaherty would envy and be jealous of . She heard Myrtle telling the colored maid to make tea and toast and to serve it in the parlor . Myrtle lived just like a lady . " Yes , Peg , you got to live your own life , " Myrtle said , returning to the parlor and sinking into the heavy rocking chair . Margaret leaned back on the divan and stretched her feet out across the green carpet , wanting Myrtle to see the new buckskin laced boots Al had given her . " Why , what lovely shoes , Peg ! Where did you get them ? " Myrtle asked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing off the laced tan oxford walking-shoes she was wearing . " My brother Al got them for me , " Margaret said . " They 're simply beautiful , " Myrtle said . " Al sells only the best women 's footwear , " Margaret said . " He must have some good in him to sell shoes like that , " said Myrtle . " Of course , he has . It 's just that he 's a man and a bachelor . Myrtle , he just does n't understand a girl like me , " Margaret said , breaking into a sigh . " Mr. Peck understood too much , " Myrtle said slyly . " Your poor heart must have been broken when you found out how he was chasing other women , you poor dear . You must have suffered so . That 's why I decided it would be you I 'd come to see today and talk to . I knew you 'd understand , " Margaret said.  | " Oh , not at all ! I was glad to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I get enough alimony to live on , and I live my own life . I did n't care two hoots . Love and heartbreak are sad and beautiful in storybooks and plays . But in life , I feel differently . Live your own life , " Myrtle said . " Oh , but if I was strong like you . I 'm just such a weak thing , " Margaret sighed . " Peg , you 're too young , too lovely , and too handsome to be talking like that , " Myrtle said . " Oh , Myrtle , I do n't know what to do ! I do n't know what to say ! " Margaret said , jumping up from the divan and stridingback and forth across the room . " Peg , the first thing to do is to control your nerves , " Myrtle said . " That 's it ! " Margaret said hastily , her tone one of selflaceration ; she gazed tragically at her friend . " You must take it easy , relax , " said Myrtle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my nerves are killing me . They 're driving me crazy . Myrtle , I would n't tell this to anyone else but you . But you 're such a dear friend , I can say it to you . Because I have infinite trust , infinite trust in you . Sometimes I stop and ask myself , am I going insane ? I feel as if I 'm losing my head . I do n't know what I 'm doing , what I 'm saying , half of the time . " " Now , Peg , you sit down there ! I 'm going to talk to you , " Myrtle said with kind impatience . Margaret mutely obeyed . She glanced almost worshipfully at her friend , her face alive with interest and attention . " The first step you have to take is to stop thinking this way . You simply ca n't let your whole life go to pieces becauseof one man . " " But I love Lorry , " Peg said with a throb in her voice . " I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , is worth that much . You ca n't ruin your life because of any man , " Myrtle said firmly.  | " I know it ! I know it ! I know it ! " Margaret said . " I do n't care what you feel toward him . If he was a man , he would n't have treated you that way , " Myrtle said . " I simply can not understand it . He was always so kind , so tender , so gentle . He seemed to love me , " Peg said , her voice filled with melancholy . The maid entered , set the tea things down for them , and retired noiselessly . Myrtle poured the tea and gave Margaret a cup and buttered toast on a plate . " You have it so nice here . It 's so lovely , so comforting , " Margaret said , biting into her toast . " I like it , " Myrtle said . " How much rent do you pay ? " Margaret asked . " Sixty-five , " said Myrtle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could get something better than what we 're getting for that much money . But it 's that brother of mine , " Margaret said . " I liked the apartment you had at Forty-ninth and Calumet . Why did you move from it ? " Myrtle asked . " We had to get out because of my nephew . He was always running up and down the hallway , and he was rolling his baseball bats off the back porch , and the neighbors were afraid they were going to be killed by his baseball bats falling down from our third-floor porch . So we had to move . I loved that apartment , even though my sister died in it . I 'm not superstitious like the old Irish , " Margaret said . " You 're not superstitious ? " asked Myrtle . " No , not a bit , " Margaret said . " I 'm not superstitious , either , " Myrtle said . " Of course , I believe in God , " Margaret said . " So do I , " Myrtle said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punish poor unhappysinners in a Hell of fire , " Margaret said . " Of course not . That 's a trick of the ministers to scare you . Hell is in people 's hearts , " said Myrtle . " But more tea , Peg ? " she added , seeing Margaret put her teacup aside.  | " No , dearie . Hell is this earth . Hell is being a woman like me , " Margaret said . " None of that , Peg . That 's no way to be gay , " Myrtle said . " Dearie , I ca n't be gay . I ca n't be happy . I 'm too sad , " Margaret sighed . " You 're only making yourself feel worse by talking that way , " Myrtle said . " But I love Lorry , I 'd slave the skin off my hands for him , " Margaret said , beginning to sob . " That 's probably just the reason why he does n't like you , " Myrtle said . " Myrtle , do you think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you really think that he does n't love me ? " " I do n't know . I was just going on what you 've told me , " said Myrtle . " If I was sure he no longer cared , I 'd end it all . I could n't live then , " Margaret said in tears . Myrtle went to Margaret and stood over her . " Come , Peg , you must n't carry on like that . You 'll only wear your poor heart out , " she said softly , patting Margaret 's head , stroking her shoulders . " I have no heart . My heart is stone . I do n't care . I do n't care . I ca n't live without Lorry , " Margaret sobbed , her head still lowered . " Peg , you got ta learn that no man is worth a fine girl like you wearing her heart out and crying her eyes out over him , " Myrtle said . " Oh , Myrtle , if you only knew him , then you 'd understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , here ! " Myrtle said , lifting Margaret 's head . Margaretwas docile . Myrtle wiped her eyes . " Now , stop cutting up like that . It does n't make you attractive and it does you no earthly good . " " I know it ! I know it ! I know it ! I just ca n't help it ! " Margaret said drearily.  | " You got ta brace up , Peg , dearie , " Myrtle said . " I will ! You 'll forgive me . I 'm going to get over it . I 'm going to do just what you told me . I 'm going to be gay , and full of life , and have a good time . Oh , Myrtle , you 're such a dear , wonderful girl , such a dear , wonderful friend , " Margaret said . " I try to be a good friend , and I ca n't stand to see a handsome , gifted girl like you just going to pieces . I tell you , no man is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so right . You know so much more than me , " Margaret said adoringly . " We got to take life as it comes , and not give our hearts to it . If we give our hearts to it the way you 've done , we 'll break them . Human hearts are too tender for life , " Myrtle said . " Oh , I know it ! I know it ! I 'm a fool because of my heart , " Margaret said . " Yes , that 's just your trouble , " Myrtle said . Margaret nodded agreement with Myrtle . " Here , have a cigarette , " Myrtle said , and both women lit cigarettes . Myrtle set an ash tray beside Margaret . " It 's always been my trouble . I 've got to look out for myself instead of everybody else . All my life I 've worried about others . And where did it get me ? Why , it did n't even bring me gratitude ! " Margaret said . " Peg , you 're too smart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wish I was . " The colored maid appeared in the doorway . " You can take these out now , Clarisse , " Myrtle said , pointing to the tea things . They watched her as she removed the dishes from the room . " I got to change and start looking out for A-NumberOne , " Margaret said as if with newborn determination . " I tell you , Peg , dearie , that 's the policy that always wins out , " Myrtle said.  | " All my life I 've been a fool ! A fool ! " Margaret said melodramatically . " Well , it 's never too late to learn . You 're young yet , " Myrtle said . " I 've got to get out of the rut I 'm in , " Margaret said . " You ought to be able to go out with lots of men and have good times and forget this man , " Myrtle said . " I will . It was just such a shock to me . I never expected it , " Margaret said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Myrtle said . " Yes , I 've learned that . I thought that Lorry was different from other men . But I 've learned . I 've learned my lesson , " Margaret said , her voice full of sobs and sighs . " Well , I 'm glad , because , Peg , I like you , and it 's a shame to see you in the state you were in when you came here today , " Myrtle said . " Myrtle , I do n't know what I 'd 've done if I had n't seen you . I might even have gone to the lake , " Margaret said , squashing her cigarette . " Do n't talk like that , " Myrtle said . " It 's the truth . I might have . Myrtle , you 've never had the sad life , the troubles I 've had . I 've never been happy , " Margaret said . " But you 're going to be , " Myrtle said . " Yes , I 'm going to be , " Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what did I tell you ? Do I have to keep telling you to brace up , or do n't you want to ? Sometimes , Peg , you 're your own worst enemy , " Myrtle said , putting out her cigarette . " I ca n't help it . I have such nerves . I think I must have gotten too nervous when I was a child and had diphtheria . I almost died . I 've had bad nerves ever since . " " That was a long time ago , and you 're healthy now , " Myrtle said . " Oh , no , I 'm not . Do you know , I should really be under a doctor 's care , a nerve specialist . But I ca n't afford it . Every cent I earn , I give home , " Margaret said . " But , Peg ! " Myrtle said , shocked and surprised . " It 's the God 's truth , " Margaret said . " I thought your brother was doing well , " Myrtle said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a good business man , " Myrtle exclaimed . " Poor Al , he 's saddled with expenses , too . He tries . But we have such burdens . My poor sister , Lizz , we have to give her so much help . She 's so poor . All my life it 's been the same . I had no schooling , no education . My lot has always been an unhappy one . I had to work as a little girl and bring home every penny I made . I 've done it ever since . And now we 're saddled with two of my sister 's kids . We have to keep my niece who was in Madison . There 's no end to it . " " That 's not right , it 's not fair . " " No , it is n't fair . And I ca n't even have a friend of mine in the house . My mother insults them . My brother is nosy and does n't like my friends . I have no rights . When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most innocent way , I was beaten . My brother would beat me black and blue . " " If a man laid his hands on me , I 'd kill him . My husband once did , and I threw a hundred-dollar vase at him . He never did it again , " Myrtle said spiritedly.  | " All of the spirit was taken out of me when I was just an innocent little child . I was sick and almost blind , such an innocent little thing . My sister , Lizz , was always coming home and telling lies about me . If she saw me just talking to a boy on the street corner , she made mountains out of it , told Al , and he 'd beat me for it . That has always been my lot . " " It 's a shame . I do n't know why you stay with your family . You can be independent , " Myrtle said . " It 's just that I 've been a fool . I 've been a fool , Myrtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peg O'Flaherty , if you have any senseyou wo n't stick around with that family of yours , " Myrtle said . " I ca n't if I want any life . I ca n't , " Margaret said . " A girl 's a fool to stay with her family , " Myrtle said . " Oh , but do n't I know it ! " Margaret said . " Just a minute , I got to wee-wee , " Myrtle said , rising and leaving the room . Alone in the room , Margaret paced back and forth , wringingher hands . She looked out the window at the quiet street bathed in the fading light of the late afternoon . Opposite , there was a lovely home , with trees in front of it , and a wire fence surrounding a snow-covered lawn . Next to it was an apartment building that must have gone up recently . Here it was so quiet . No peddlers yelling in the alley all day long like at home . No elevated trains . No noises . Why did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even lived in a decent place . Oh , God , why had she been given such a family ? If Lorry had only divorced that woman , that dirty bitch of a wife , and married her , she and Lorry would have had a nice , lovely home like that one across the street , and an automobile . And children instead of that idiot son she 'd had by him . It was now put away and the world did n't know . She could n't think of that . Oh , Lorry ! Well , she had written him a strong letter today . He 'd understand it . He could take it or leave it . She turned from the window and paced the room again . " Why , Peg ! " Myrtle exclaimed in surprise as she returned to see her friend crying without restraint . " I ca n't help it ! I ca n't ! Oh , Myrtle , you must understand . " " Peg , dearie , I do , " Myrtle said , putting her arms around Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got to cry . I ca n't help it . Oh , Myrtle , I 'm such an unhappy girl . I 'm so weary , so tired . I love Lorry , " Margaret sobbed , her head still on her friend 's shoulder . " Peg , crying is not going to do you any good . Dry your eyes , " Myrtle said , leading Margaret to the divan , sitting her down , and then seating herself beside her friend . " I will in a minute . I just got to cry , " Margaret said . Margaret sank her head in Myrtle 's lap and sobbed , her entire body shaking and quivering . Myrtle stroked her friend 's head and continued to sit there , looking concerned , then bored , then perplexed . The room was quiet , the street was quiet , except for Margaret 's sobbing . Gradually her sobs died down . She sniffled , sighed , cried lightly . Her sobs began to come only periodically . She sat up . Her face was distraught , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straggling , hairpins hanging out over her ears . " Go to the bathroom and fix yourself up , " Myrtle said . " I will . I must stop this . I do n't want to do it , but I ca n't help myself . Oh , Myrtle , I loved Lorry . I adore him . I 'd kiss the dirt for him . I love him . I ca n't help myself . " " I see this must have been serious . " " And I know he loved me , " Margaret said , again sniffling . " Margaret , if he loves you , you got to make him show it to you . A woman must never let a man get the upper hand , " Myrtle said . " I know he loved me . And he was so wonderful . So handsome . He was so often like a boy , like my own son , " Margaret said . She thought of that child of his , an idiot , put away , forgotten . Should she tell Myrtle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Never ! And while this thought flashed through her head , Myrtle was talking . " Peg , do you think you can get him back ? Would he marry you ? " Margaret did n't answer . " Do you think he 'd marry you ? " Myrtle repeated.  | " He 's married already . He used to say that as soon as his hands were free he 'd get a divorce and marry me . " " Are his hands free now ? " " I do n't know ! I do n't know . I do n't know a thing ! " Margaret said , shaking her head nervously from side to side . " I did n't know he was a married man , " Myrtle said . " He married her when he was young . She 's a skinny bitch . I 'm better than she is . I always gave him more satisfaction . He said so . He told me so many times . He told me he 'd rather sleep with me than he would with his wife . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the truth . And why hide the truth ? Please do n't think badly of the way I talk . " " Get those silly thoughts out of your head . What do you think I am ? " Myrtle said . " Lorry said to me , Peg , my chick , I 'd rather sleep with you than with Mrs. Robinson . ' Those are the very words he said to me . " " ' When ? " " Many many times . " " Well , then , what happened ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I write letters and I get no answer . I call the hotels where he is likely to stay when he 's here and I always get the same answer . Not registered . " Not registered . ' I 'll go crazy from those two damn words . At night in my dreams , I keep telling myself , Not registered ! ' I do n't know ! I do n't know what happened . I told you about yesterday . Myrtle , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . When I see him how should I act ? Should I go to Jliin and say , point-blank , Lorry , what 's the matter ? Do n't you want me any more ? Am I no good any more ? Am I used up or what ? ' Should I go to him that way ? " " My God , no , Peg . No ! Never ! " " What should I do ? " " It 's hard to say , since I do n't know him , " Myrtle said . " Well , I can make you know what he 's like . He 's a wonderful man . He 's brainy , and he 's so brilliant . So intelligent.  | So smart , and everything he 's got in the world he 's earned himself . He 's a self-made man , " Margaret said . " What business is he in ? I remember you once told me , but I forgot , " Myrtle said . " He 's in the lumber business , " Margaret said . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's the most wonderful man . He has the kindest , the nicest , the gentlest disposition , " said Margaret . " Here , Peg , a cigarette ? " Myrtle asked , offering Margaret her box . They lit their cigarettes and inhaled . Myrtle let the smoke out of her nose . " Yes , he has such a lovely disposition . He 's so kind and so tender . The way he kisses me , and pets me , and holds my head on his shoulder and strokes it so tenderly . He is the kindest and the most tender of men , " Margaret said . " If he is , why does he treat you the way he does ? " Myrtle asked . " I ca n't understand it . I do n't know what 's come over him , " Margaret said . " He does n't treat you kindly , " Myrtle said . " It must be that some woman has gotten to his ear and she 's made him infatuated and driven him out of his senses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and him ? " " I do n't think so . That 's why he never wants me to write to him , " Margaret said . " But you do write to him . You said you did , " Myrtle said , puffing , dumping her ashes besides her in a tray . " Oh , yes , but I write letters like they were business letters and sign a man 's name , " said Margaret . " Does he write you ? " " No . He used to send me money , just addressed to me with the money in an envelope , pinned to a sheet of paper with no writing on it , " Margaret said . " Peg , you 're a goddamn fool . You ought to be spankedp323until you get some sense in your head , " Myrtle said , getting quickly to her feet , frowning down at Margaret . " Why ? " Margaret said , looking innocently at her friend . " That man does n't love you , " Myrtle said slowly and emphatically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person in a trance with her tear-reddened and swollen eyes , her face blotchy , her hair unkempt . " No ! Decidedly no ! And you 're a poor damn fool , you are . Letting yourself waste your heart on him . He protects himself in every way . He played with you . And you got to make him pay for it . You got to forget this love talk , this talk of his tenderness . It 's not true . That man does n't love you . He trifled with you . You 're a damn fool if you do n't make him pay now , and pay plenty . He can afford it , " Myrtle said . " I do n't know . He was in difficulties for years . " " Forget that ! Think of yourself . You make him pay ! You make him set you up living in decent style and fixing you regularly so you can quit your job and live like I do , " said Myrtle . " Oh , I do n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret said . " If you do n't take my advice , you do n't deserve any sympathy , " Myrtle said , sitting down beside Peg . " I will ! You 're right , darling . You 're so smart . Oh , what would I do if I did n't have a friend like you , Myrtle , dearie ? " " Make him feel guilty . You 're the wronged one . Make him feel that you are . And you make him pay you . He wronged you . You were an innocent girl until he met you . He ruined you . He took your all , " Myrtle said . " But he did n't . I got over all my innocence with a boy . It must have been when I was fourteen . I did n't know what it was . Some boy did it to me . I did n't even know what it was , " Margaret said . " That ai n't his business , " Myrtle said.  | " But he knows . I told him everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with men before I met him , " said Margaret . " I told you , he ruined you . You 're ready to go into court and accuse him , sue him and say he ruined you , trifled with you . You got to make him feel guilty and afraid of you , " Myrtle said . " I could n't do that , " Margaret said . " Why ? " Myrtle asked , annoyed . " Lorry would n't love me then , " Margaret said . " He does n't anyway , " Myrtle said harshly . Margaret collapsed in tears , flinging her head in Myrtle 's lap . " If Lorry does n't love me , I 'll kill myself , " Margaret said hysterically . " Now , I 've got to get dressed . I got a date tonight , " Myrtle said after they had had supper . " Myrtle , dear , do n't you want me to help you get dressed ? I 'll do that and then leave . I got to go home and get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her homework to get my mind off these things , " Margaret said . " Do n't bother . Clarisse helps me , " Myrtle said . " Let me help , too , " Margaret said , rising . " No , do n't bother . Please , do n't , " Myrtle said . Margaret rushed to Myrtle , embraced her , kissed her . " You 've helped me so much , " she said , still enfolding Myrtle in her arms . " I 'm so glad , " Myrtle said . " You 're such an understanding friend . You do n't know it , but you 've saved my life , " Margaret said . " Now , you forget all these blue thoughts you 've been having . Get yourself a good night 's rest , and you 'll go on . We 'll have parties and dates together . I 'd have you come alongp325tonight , but you know , Peg , two 's a couple and three 's a crowd . But some other night , " Myrtle said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep , " Margaret said . " Well , promise me that you 'll take care of yourself and brace up , " Myrtle said . They kissed . " Can I just fix myself up before I go ? I must look a sight , " said Margaret . " Yes , do , " said Myrtle . Walking away from Myrtle 's in the chilly January night , the prospect of returning home seemed gloomy to Margaret . She told herself that she was all at sixes and sevens . And Myrtle was such a nice understanding girl in her way , but there were certain things about Myrtle . Myrtle was glad to have gotten rid of her . Why ? Because she was jealous . Myrtle was going out with some fellow and did n't want to take any chances . Of course , the last thing in the world that she 'd want to do would be to take any fellow away from Myrtle . Gee , she was glad she had n't mentioned that child business . She must never do that . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell lies and stories about others ? She walked on . The street was quiet and a full moon was shining , a moon which seemed cold and distant . Margaret looked at it . In songs , the moonlight stood for love and lovers . On this winter night it had nothing to do with love , not for her . It was a very cold moon . But it was a lovely night , she felt . Oh , she had always wanted to have winter nights like this , many nights like this with Lorry . Oh , she must be like one of those persons Mother and Lizz always talked about , one of those poor creatures who had had a curse put upon them . She must be . She walked along . Yes , the street was so quiet , and ahead she could see the traffic passing along Grand Boulevard , automobiles , horses and carriages . Every year there were more automobiles on the streets and fewer and fewer horses and carriages . The horse and carriage was a thing of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of the past . These houses and buildings along the street . So many of them with lights in the windows . Some of the women in these homes and apartments were happy women , women who had their men . Ah , but did n't she know something about the happy women who thought they had the love of their men ? Lorry , he must have a finer home than any of the people living on Forty-ninth Street . Passing by Lorry 's home and seeing lights , a stranger might feel that there was a happy home . And his bitch of a wife must think she was a happy woman possessing the love of her man . Myrtle had such a wonderful life . Not a care , not a worry in the world . Some girls got so much of the goods of life , and look at poor , miserable Margaret O'Flaherty ! Hers was a sad lot , the saddest lot of any girl in the world . A man came toward her . He looked at her . Men nearly always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he look at her ? If he got anything out of it , let him . She walked slowly on . She was n't interested in men any more . She knew too much about them , too much about their dirty souls . He was wearing a silk hat . He came closer . They passed , and she could see that he was young and handsome . He might look around after her . She walked on , resisting the tempNtationto turn and see if he had . But she was sure he 'd turned around to look after her . She knew the ways of men . She drifted on , and suddenly she looked behind her . Yes , she was certain . The man in the silk hat was entering the building where Myrtle lived . He was Myrtle 's date . That'swhy Myrtle had been afraid . But Myrtle need n't have been . Margaret turned down Grand Boulevard . Myrtle need n't worry that Peg O'Flaherty was going to cut in on her . She walked slowly on . All these people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could scream at them through their windows . Oh , God , what was going to become of her ?  |p328WHY  , Peg O'Flaherty , hello , " Jack Doolin said , almost colliding with Margaret in front of the Fifty-first Street elevated station . " Oh , hello , Mr. Doolin , how are you ? " Margaret said , smiling . " Oh , I 'm so-so . Ever feel that way , so-so ? " Jack Doolin said . He was a man in his thirties , tall , well-built , but beginning to get fat . He had an insensitive face with ruddy cheeks . The jowls were coming out . The contours were forming for middleage . He had sensual lips , blue eyes , and sandy hair . " You just getting home ? " Margaret asked . " Yeah , " he said disconsolately . " I was out to see a girl friend and I 'm on my way home , too , " she said . " Not working at the hotel today ? " " I worked Sunday so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fine girl like you on your off day , and where is your fellow ? " he asked jovially . " Have a heart , Mr. Doolin . Do n't be sugaring me when you do n't mean it , " Margaret said coyly . " But I do . And do n't call me Mr. Doolin . What the heck ! Here I am , a neighbor of yours for about two years . I know Al , and I have a glass of beer with Ned when he comes to town and sees you . Ah , there 's a fine chap . And you and the old lady know my missus , and I play ball with your nephews in the back yard sometimes , and what does she do ,  |p329calls  me Mr. Doolin . I 'm Jack to all my friends , " Jack Doolin said . " Well , Jack , walk home with me . It 's cold and it 's noisy here with the elevated and street cars , " she said , smiling , showing white teeth . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was going home . I 've been blue all day , " she said . " So ' m I. I 'm deep in the dumps today , " he said . " I ca n't stand this noise here , " she said . " Say , Peg , be a sport . Come on and have a glass of beer with me , and then I 'll walk you home , " he said hesitantly . " Well , " she said , thrusting out her lips as if to indicate that she was thinking about his proposal . " Come on , do n't be a killjoy . We 'll help each other be blue over a glass of good beer , " he said . " But would Mrs. Doolin like it ? " she asked . " Just having a glass of beer with me , what the devil ! " he said . " But in a saloon , " she said . " There 's nothing wrong in it , " he said . " No , there is n't , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . They walked toward O'Callahan 's saloon at Calumet . " Why are you blue ? " he asked , glancing at her . " I 'm just worried and nervous , " she said . " A girl like you should n't have a worry in the world . You got looks , a good job , a nice personality , " he said , smiling . " You think so ? " she said . " I know so , " he said , his tone becoming more familiar , causing her to have a sudden resentment and to think that if he thought he was going to get anywhere with her , he was sadly mistaken.  |p330They  said no more , turned the corner at Calumet Avenue and walked on to the family entrance on the side of the saloon . There was a couple in a corner to the right of the door , and they took a table opposite them near the swinging doorswhich led into the saloon proper . He rang for a waiter , and when the waiter came Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked Margaret . She nodded . " Two beers Budweiser , " he said to the waiter . " Peg , I 'm mighty damn glad I ran into you tonight , " he said . " But what about your wife and family ? " she answered . " She 's home with the kid and all right , and they had a good supper . Did n't I just call her up and tell her I was held up . And she 's been having trouble with her stomach , nothing serious , just indigestion pains . She said they were better now , " he said . " I hope they are . She should watch what she eats , lots of green vegetables and things like that . She 's a lovely woman , " Margaret said . " Peg , a woman does n't come any better than my missus , " he said . " She 's very lovely . My mother and I both think the world of her , " Margaret said . " The trouble is , Peg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me . She 's too good for me , too damn good , " Jack said . " Why do you say that ? " Margaret asked , just to be making conversation ; she was n't the least interested in this man , but she did n't want to go home to her own black , bleak home , she did n't ; she wanted to have somebody to talk to , to take her mind off her sorrows . " Well , now , you take me . I like to bum around , drink , raise a little bit of cain on the side . You know what I mean , " he said , and she caught the significance of the look he gave her , but she felt like telling him that for a girl like herself there was much better pickings if pickings was what she was interestedin.  |p331She  did n't answer him . She lifted her glass of beer . Theywere silent for some time , sitting there , quietly drinking their beer . " When I left you to call up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She trusts me , all right , " he said with a slight snicker . " Why should n't she ? " Margaret asked pointedly . " Now , that 's a question , " Jack said . " Can I have one of your cigarettes , Jack ? " " Oh , you smoke , too ? " he asked in surprise . " Yes , did n't you know it ? " she answered . " Well , here , have one , " he said , offering her his package of Piedmonts . She pulled a cigarette out and set the package back near him on the table . He scratched a match on his box , and she leaned forward with the cigarette between her lips to get the light . The couple in the opposite corner looked at Margaret with curiosity when they saw her smoking . " Not many women smoke . Women who smoke are pretty rare , as rare . . . well , as suffragettes , " Jack said . " I 'm not one of these suffs . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed suddenly to think . He scratched his head and t his mouth hang agape for a moment . " Guess you 're right . Only we 're not all accustomed to it . ow , I do n't think I 'd want my missus to smoke , " he said , ming out of his philosophical trance . All alike , Margaret thought to herself but she did n't stk . She lapsed into moodiness . They sat . He rang for the aiter . " One more , huh , Peg ? " he asked . She nodded affirmatively . He held up two fingers to the aiter . He leaned back in his chair . He puffed forcibly on is cigarette . He seemed to be trying to hit on a subject of conversation , and she was giving him no assistance . He puffed pain , inhaled , watched the smoke he let out of his nose drift the calcimined ceiling . He looked around the room and another couple that had just entered and found a table.  | He inhaled again . The waiter returned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foam from his lips with his handkerchief . " It was nice coming here . I 'm glad I met you , " he said . Margaret brooded into her beer . " Say , Peg , you seem to have something serious on your mind , " he remarked , leaning across the table . " Oh , no , I feel all right , " she said , and she took a hasty gulp of beer . " I been watching you since we came here , and I can see . You seem blue . Do n't be blue . You 're too young and pretty , and let me assure you , you got too many cards in your hands for you to be blue . Just lookin ' at you , I can see you have . " His voice became sly and insinuating . " And you know , there are things than can take a girl 's blues away . " " Not mine , " she said with bitterness . " Did something serious happen to you ? What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , Jack , " she said . " Aw , come on , take a drink and forget it . There 's only one thing to do in this world with your troubles . That 's forget ' em . That 's the prescription of Jack Doolin , and let me tell you , it works . " " Well , you can say it . You 're a happy man , with your own business and family , " she said . " My business ? Yeah , it goes along just like a mule . Do n't talk to me about my business , " he said . " I do n't know . Sometimes I think I 'm going crazy , " Margaret said dully . " I tell you , Peg , forget your troubles . Forget ' em and they are n't such a bother , " Jack said . " Yes , I have to forget . I have to forget , " she said , speaking as if she were talking to herself instead of to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tell me . Sometimes relieving your mind by telling your troubles to a friend helps . It helps to get them off your chest . And you can count on me as a friend . I like you , girl , " Jack said . " I know you 're twenty karat , Jack . If I had n't thought you were , I would n't have come here with you , " Margaret said . " Peg , do n't cry . That never helps , " he said sympathetically , arcing the tears welling in her eyes . She quickly drew a handkerchief from her pocketbook and wiped away her tears . She smiled wanly . " I lost the man I love , " she said sadly . " Why do n't you get another ? " he said . " Oh , you do n't understand . Jack , you 're a man . You do n't understand . A man never understands how a woman feels , " she said.  | " No , I guess not . Not if he 's married , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He does n't love me , " Margaret said . " And you love him ? " " I 'm going crazy . I ca n't think . I do n't know what to do . you know what you just did for me , Jack ? " " What ? " he asked in surprise . " You saved my life . " " What do yuh mean , Peg ? " " When I met you I was trying to decide should I go home , should I go to the lake ? " " You 're kiddin ' , Peg . " " As true as there is a God , I 'm not . " " It must be serious . Peg , never take anything that serious . is bad , " he said . " I ca n't help it . I love Lorry . I love him , and he does n't ve me . " " Is that his name ? Lorry ? Lorry what ? " " Lorry Robinson . You must have read about him . He 's a Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham case , " she said . " I do n't remember it , " Jack said.  | " He 's the most wonderful man , " she said . " What does he do ? A politician ? " " He 's a lumber man . He was a partner with Brophy That 's how he came to be a witness in the Graham case few years ago . " " Is he big-league stuff ? " " He 's one of the finest men that walks the earth , " Margar said . " Anything happen between you and him ? Why do n't yo sue him for breach of promise ? " Jack said . " He 's married , " Margaret said and , noticing the startle expression that popped in Jack 's eyes , she added , " You think it 's awful of me , do n't you ? " " Why , no , not at all . I 'm a broad-minded fellow . I am , Peg , " he said . " I do n't care if it 's good or bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I love him . I do n't care , " Margaret said , he voice choked and nervous . " I tell you , Peg , I wish I could help you . I 'm awful sorr to hear it . All I can say to you is that you got to brace u girlie . You got called out on strikes this time . Next time u you got to make a base hit . " " I do n't know what to do . I 'm so unhappy , " she said . Jack drank . He seemed to be in a mood of serious cogita tion . Margaret looked beyond him , at nothing , brooding , he face a picture of misery . " Yes , you got to buck up , girlie . It 's a stiff jolt , and the there 's nothing much more to say than buck up . That 's all , Jack said . " I will . Forgive me , Jack , for the way I just acted , " said , trying to put on a gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Forget it , " Jack sat reaching across the table and squeezing her hand sympathetically . " I 'm not nice to be with . It 's not fun to be with me , " sh said.  | " I tell you , Peg , forget it , " he said with husky-voiced mpathy . " And have another beer . " " There 's nothing like good old-fashioned Budweiser to rive the blues away . You know , Peg , I got a confession to ake . I was in the dumps myself when I met you . A man is down in the mouth and his teeth drag on him somesines . I was feelin ' just that way when I met you tonight , " jack said , his voice drunken and wobbly . " I 'm all right now . I 'm never going to worry about him gain . I 've gotten over the shock now , " Margaret said . " That 's the way I like to hear you talk . You know , you ( ways got to figure it out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure it out this way . It 's the only way in the world figure it out . There 's always more than one gazabo inc world .

There 's nothing else in life left except to be gay , unless you want to be a damn fool . But say , Peg , you do n't bject to a little cursing , do you ? " " No , not if it 's just a little , " she said flirtatiously . He leaned back in his chair and laughed . She laughed with m . " Drink on it , Peg . You 're a damn swell girl . You look w f ul good to me , kid , " Jack said . They tipped glasses and drank . " I feel so much better , " she said . " Sure you do .

Answers you do n't know . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! How can I tell you answers you do n't know when I ai n't found out the answers or not . You got to gim me time because I ca n't answer that one until I know , " Jack said.  |p336Margaret  leaned back and laughed . He joined her in laughing . " But I 'd like to get the chance to find out , " he said with a meaningful wink . " You 're a married man , " she said . " That ai n't no obstacle , is it ? " he said insinuatingly . " Go away with your flirting , " she said . " Flirting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got too nice a wife to be talking that way , Jack , " she said . " Sure . Nicest wife you 'll ever see . A good wife is Heaven 's best gift to man . That 's the trouble . She 's too damn nice , and I got some of Hell 's gifts , too , " he said . " Which means that I 'm not too damn nice , " Margaret said , pouting . " Oh , no , not at all . Do n't take it that way , Peg , " Jack said . " I understand , gotcha , kid . You men are all alike , " she said disgustedly . " You do n't want to go misunderstanding me , Peg , after we 've gotten to be good friends like this , " Jack said . Margaret began to cry again . " I 'm awfully sorry I hurt your feelings . I am , " he said with drunken awkwardness . " I knew it ! I knew it all along , " she singsonged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the way men feel toward a girl . A girl is a fool , a fool to let herself get put into such a position . A fool . It 's the way men feel . It 's the way Lorry feels . I know it .

Take his from me , Peg . I mean it . When the breaks go against you , that 's the time you got to keep your hair on , " he said . " I want to go home , " she said . " It 's early yet . " " Your wife must be waiting for you . And I 'm so tired , " he said . " Well , all right , if you say so . " He rang for the waiter , paid the bill , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked along . t was now clear and frosty , and the moon was pouring a ne light over the street . " Peg , you 're not sore , are you ? " Jack asked after they had talked past the elevated station without talking . " Of course not , Jack , " she said . " That 's the girlie , " he said , squeezing her arm . " I was just upset , " she said . " I know how it is , " he said . They walked on , Jack holding her arm . He stopped aroundbe corner on Prairie Avenue and said : " Gee , must be pretty late . The old woman ' 11 be worried . " " Will she be up ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " Maybe you 'd better walk on ahead of me . " " But I want to talk to you a minute , and the missus might in the window , watching . Come on through the alley and c back yards here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " No , now ! I want you to understand that I did n't mean lnything personal tonight , " he said .

" You 're not afraid of me , are you , Peg ? " " Why , Jack ! " " Well , come on , then , " he said . " No , please , Jack . I do n't like that . I can see you some other time , " she said . " All right , girlie . But I do n't want you to be sore , and I do wan na see you again . "  | " You will , Jack . " " Wo n't you slip over a little good-night kiss on us ? " h asked . " On the street ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lifted her veil and raised her face . He kissed her . " Good night , Peg , " he said , giving her arm a squeeze an going ahead , singing . She watched him walk ahead . She did n't want to wait too long here , and so when he got on a little way , she proceeded . She wanted to go to bed . She was sad and tired.  |p339There  he was waiting for her in the hallway . She turned the lock in the inner hall door to go to the steps leading to the upper stories . He stood by the steps , and his apart . ment was on the first floor , to the left . He put his finger to his lips and approached her . " The missus was n't lookin ' out the window so I waited for you , " he whispered . " But , Jack , why ? " " I wanted to talk to you . You look awful good to me . " " This is foolish , Jack . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack , do n't be foolish , " she said . " Walk up a landing with me . I wan na talk to you , " hi whispered . She walked upstairs toward her floor , and he followed heruictly . She turned on the landing between the first and : ond floors , out of sight from the street . " Peg , " he whispered huskily . She waited . He grabbed her clumsily , planted a thick , senallywet kiss on her lips . She quietly struggled to free herIf . His thick , wet lips and hot , wheezing , beery breath made r shudder . Moving her face as she squirmed in his arms , r cheeks , nose , and chin were brushed by his lips . " Please , not here , " she begged . " Just a kiss . We 're alone , " he said . She submitted and allowed him to have his way , her man-r cold , relaxed . Suddenly his masculine nearness seemed fire her . She wanted to forget , to let herself go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude , but she wished to cerate herself , punish herself , humiliate herself by letting im have his complete way with her . She deserved to have ch humiliation inflicted on her , she suddenly felt . She met sensuous kisses with seeming sensuousness . Suddenly came to her senses , realizing the dangers of being caught the hallway , and she restrained him . " , Jack , we ca n't here , " she said . " We can take a chance , " he said . " No ! " she said firmly . " How about your place ? " " My mother 's there , and my niece sleeps with me . It 's too y . Mother would raise the roof off , " she said . He reached for her , but she grabbed his arm firmly and ) k her head . " It 's got to be some other time , " she said . " Why ? Ca n't we sneak out and go around to the back yard down to the basement ? " " Why , Jack ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Peg , " he said humbly . " I was just anxious . t to liking you so much I could n't control myself , " he cd.  | " Good night , " she said . " One more kiss ? " he asked . She lifted her face . He gripped her firmly , kissed strained his body against hers . She remained in his arms f long kisses , and then she relaxed . Her hat was askew . 1 i face was smeared from her own lipstick which had goat onto his lips and had been pressed back on her own menu and cheeks . She saw that his face was marked with rou She took her handkerchief , wet it with her tongue , wipedface . " Good night , Jack , " she said . " When am I gon na see you again ?

" Good night , and do n't forget , girlie , " he said . She turned and walked slowly upstairs . He leered of her . She stood outside her door and , with mirror in han made herself presentable . She heard the key turning his loc the door closing . She hated herself . With such a man ! He a pig . Crude , no refinement . What was she coming to ? S hated herself , and she began crying copiously as she let horse into her apartment . " What the hell are you kids up for ? " she asked angrily finding Danny and Little Margaret at the dining-room tab " I was doing my homework . It was hard and Dann would n't help me . I just got finished , " Little Margaret sai " I got my own homework to do , " Danny protested . " Quit it ! Can it ! I 'm too nervous to listen to you bra arguing , " she snapped . " Blessed God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , " Mp341Flaherty said , coming from the kitchen where she had overrdthe conversation . " God , I thought that it was midnight , " Margaret said .

" I do n't have to ask you what friends I can see . I 'm of , " Margaret said. the two children looked timidly and fearfully at their t . " Birds of a feather flock together , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , g back to her bedroom . Margaret went to her bedroom , and soon Danny and Little Margaret could hear her sobbing . " Gee , is she drunk again ? " Little Margaret asked . " I donno . But she 's sore , all right , and she 's gon na makeagain . She always does , and fights when she gets cryingthat , " said Danny .

He got his chair and started walking shyly down the hallway . Margaret came out of her bedroom , muttering : Jesus Christ ! " w bell still rang . Who is it ? " Margaret asked sharply . It 's me , Jack Doolin . For God 's sake , open the door , " hep342I ca n't . I 'm going to bed , " Margaret said . For God 's sake , Peg . Open the door . It 's serious ! My wife , - 're taking her to the hospital , " he said . Margaret opened the door and saw Jack Doolin in his s sleeves , a crushed , harassed man with a concerned and wearied look on his face .

Mrs. O'Flaherty rushed to them . " What 's the matter ? " she asked . " My wife 's going to the hospital with appendicitis. wanted one of you to watch my boy until my sister-in-la comes , " he said . " Peg , go down . I 'll get a blessed candle and bring it dow You poor man , God bless you , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " I 'll be right down , Jack , " Margaret said . " Thanks . I got to get back .

" Bring this down to the Doolins and have them light i It 'll bring good luck and the help of God , " she said . Danny took the candle downstairs . Just as he did , the do opened and two white-garbed interns carried Mrs. Dooli out on a stretcher . Her face was drawn and she was pale . S looked at Danny , smiled weakly . " Goodbye , Danny , be a good boy , " she said faintly ; the she began moaning.  | " Do n't worry . I 'll watch everything , " Margaret said to Mr. Doolin as he walked out after the stretcher , biting his lips , looking very worried . Danny gave his aunt the candle , and saw Georgie Doolin ebbing behind her . He went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had just happened . He felt that Mrs. oolin was going to die .

O'FLAHERTY rocked away in her bedroom with a can of of beer beside her on the floor . She reached down , picked it up , took a swig , and wiped her lips with the sleeve of her dress . She could hear the mumble of conversation from Danny and Little Margaret in the dining room . They were good little ones , they were . She took another swig . She wiped her mouth again . Her eyes began watering and she put a handkerchief to them . She gazed up at the picture of the Sacred Heart which hung over her dresser . She cried . An elevated train passed . She took another swig of beer . She heard the front door opening . " Peg , is that you ? " she called . She heard footsteps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into her bedroom . She placed the lid on the can of beer and threw a cloth over it . She got up and staggeredout of the room , across the kitchen , and down the hallway to Margaret 's bedroom . Margaret sat on the bed , bleary-eyed , her face dirty . " Hello , Peg , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Hello , " Margaret said lifelessly . " Ah , ' t is a shame you could n't go to that poor woman 's funeral to pay your last respects . That poor woman ! Ah , she was a good neighbor woman , a good Christian soul . And that poor man with his boy left behind . Ah , Peg , it was a fine funeral , and he was so nice to me . He treated me like I was the grand lady , and after they put her away , poor Mr. Doolin took me along with them and bought me a glass of beer , " she said.  |p345Margaret  did not answer . " Ah , it would break your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with a boy on his hands . It would make your heart bleed , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . Margaret still sat , her eyes fixed on the radiator .

May the Lord be good to the husband and boy she left behind ! " " My poor heart is broken , " Margaret sighed . " Honest , doncha like any of the girls in your class at school ? " Little Margaret asked , seated across from Danny at the dining-room table , her hands on the pages of a Billy Whiskers , which lay open before her . " No . I never pay no attention to them , " Danny said ; he wanted to tell Little Margaret that that was n't so , and that he did , he paid attention to Virginia Doyle , Hortense Audrey , and Helen Smith , and today at school Hortense Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going skating . But he could n't tell Little Margaret because she might tease him . She 'd tease him in front of them all , and they would ask him questions about girls and he could n't stand that .

" I 'll bet you do have a girl , " she said . " You 'll lose your money betting me that , " he said . " I did n't say I 'd bet you money . I just said I 'd bet you , " she said.
