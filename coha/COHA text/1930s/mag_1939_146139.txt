Years ago plump , round-faced Josephine Hancock Logan and her husband set up annual awards for Chicago 's famed Art Institute . Grieved by the " modernist " paintings which walked away with the prizes , Mrs. Logan four years ago declared war on her own awards , founded the Society for Sanity in Art , Inc . Last week , at Chicago 's Stevens Hotel , the Society came of age with its first national exhibition . Mrs. Logan turned up early , dressed in pink lace , pink gloves , diamond and emerald bracelets , a hat of feathers and flowers . While an eight-piece orchestra played her favorite tunes and she-befeathered , beflowered and bemused-sat humming them , a crowd , many of them oldsters , peered at 255 sane exhibits , murmured brightly : " Is n't it wonderful to see real painting again ? " First of the eleven prizes went to Chauncey Ryder , 71 , for a harmless landscape ; other prizes to sound , conservative Frank W. Benson , 77 , mountain-whittling Gutzon Borglum , 68 . Herself a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purred comfortably : " But they 're all my old friends . "
