txt The United States , Great Britain , France and Italy decided today to bind themselves for the next five or six years not to build any more cruisers over 8,000 tons in size or mounting guns heavier than 6.1 inches in caliber . Thus at last an agreement was I reached and the United States waived the big cruiser policy which its Navy Department had pursued , against the opposition of other powers , ever since the end of the Washington Naval Conference fourteen years ago . There will be no scrapping of existing 10,000-ton cruisers and , in fact , they may be replaced by others by the time they become over-age . But for the duration of the present agreement , taxpayers will not have to pay for any more of these " treaty craft , " which in the case of the newest American ships cost as much as $16,000,000 or $17,000,000 each to build . Experts for the four naval powers also agreed today upon maximum sizes and gun calibers for all other types of vessels except capital ships , and immediately turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody it in the text of the new naval treaty . In the case of aircraft carriers and submarines , the new limits will be slightly smaller than those set by existing treaty figures . In the case of capital ships no agreement was reached , and , in fact , it is unlikely that any single figure can be found which will be acceptable to ' ail four powers . Formula Is Produced . A formula was produced today , however , which should enable an agreement to be reached later in the week . It was kept secret tonight , but according to one report it simply binds all the powers not to replace their existing battleships by larger or more heavily armed vessels . Except for replacement , none of the four nations concerned is eager to build more capital ships at present unless , of course , " outside " powers such as Japan or Germany , decide to do so . Naturally , success of the new agreement will depend on whether Japan and Germany are willing to stick to the rules . It is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be invited to adhere to the new treaty , which will include not only limits on sizes and gun calibers but also a provision for exchange of naval building programs and a number of " escape clauses . " In the case of Germany , however , this would be inviting her to accept limits drawn up by others , and leaders of the Nazi Reich have declared again and again that they will not sign any treaty which they have not had a free hand in negotiating . Norman H. Davis , chief American delegate , discussed the German problem with Charles Corbin , French Ambassador , today , and is believed to have argued that Germany should be invited now before the four powers at the conference finally completed and signed their agreement . Problem for the Germans . If the Germans are true to their past protestations they will refuse to sign , for they were not consulted about the limits which were agreed upon today . If they are really anxious for Britain 's friendship , however , they will come to London and accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although Germany has limited herself to 35 per cent of Britain 's total tonnage , she is free to distribute that tonnage in any way she chooses unless she signs a new agreement . In any event , there is no limit to the number of ships any nation may build . The old ratio system disappeared with Japan 's denunciation of the Washington treaty and her subsequent withdrawal from the London conference . There are no real checks upon a possible naval building race now except the poverty of national treasuries and the common sense of governments . Yet if new limits on size and armaments are accepted by all powers , and if these are coupled with an exchange of building plans , they should at least prevent the construction of new types and guard against dangerous surprises . No Difficulty on Carriers . The maximum size of aircraft carriers was fixed today at 22,000 tons , with 6.1-inch guns , compared with the Washington treaty limits of 27,000 and 8-inch guns . This has been the only category which from the start has presented no real difficulty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 5.1-inch guns , compared with the old treaty limit of 2,800 and 6.1 inches . In reality , this is no limit at all , for there are only a few submarines larger than 2,000 tons in the world today and they have proved to be unwieldy and unsatisfactory . Only the French have insisted on a 2,000-ton figure and the result is a major victory for their policy ? one of several triumphs they won today . The French were also responsible for a complicated decision as to the size of light cruisers and destroyere . France and Italy some years ago evolved a destroyer leader of 3,000 tons . Now " Light Surface Craft . " By the standards of other powers ' this was neither a cruiser nor a destroyer , and in order to retain it the French refused to sign the London treaty of 1930 . Now the difficulty has been removed by abolishing the distinction between cruisers and destroyers and calling everything under 10,000 tons " light surface craft . " Under this all-inclusive heading there are to be three subcategories . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are to be 10,000 tons and 8-inch guns . The limits of the second , or " B Class , " are to be 8,000 tons and 6.1-inch guns . The limits of the third , or " C Class , " are to be 3,000 tons and 6.1-inch guns . As there is to be a holiday on the building of any cruisers over 8,000 tons , the first class exists only on paper , as far as new construction is concerned . Another category is " minor combatant vessels , " which includes such ships as sloops with a maximum tonnage of 2,000 , armament of 6.1-inch guns and speed of twenty knots . As to Exempt Vessels . Exempt vessels are to be called " auxiliaries " ? namely , colliers , hospital ships , monitors and naval tugs  --  the building of which must be reported , however , in the case of all ships over 100 tons . One may well ask why two lower categories of " light surface craft " are necessary if there is no distinction between destroyers and cruisers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be highly desirable to have such categories in existence if and when it is possible to make a new quantitative agreement . At present there is to be no limit on the number of ships built in any particular class , but when the nations are ready for such limitation it will be essential to have the various types clearly defined . In any event there will be no repetition of the 1930 dispute over the French destroyer leaders , which has now become legitimate for the first time . There is something comic in the thought of a naval lookout in future years sighting a destroyer in the offing and signaling " Light surface craft , sub-category C , on port beam . " It is unreal to imagine naval architects and fighting men abandoning the old distinctions in favor of these apparently meaningless labels . But , for that matter , there has been something unseal about this whole conference for the past few weeks , with " two of the most aggressive powers in the world outside it . The present agreement will become real only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the emphasis is bound to shift during the next fortnight from the committee rooms in Clarence House to the Navy Ministries in Tokyo and Berlin .
