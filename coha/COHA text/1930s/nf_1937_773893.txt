txt // menageries or zoos , it is not at all unlikely that the Incan and Aztec ball-fans munched peanuts as they watched and applauded or derided the rival teams in the immense courts , or that crowds of sightseers fed roasted peanuts to the captive creatures in the royal zoos of the Montezumas and the Incas . At all events , the peanut was as popular and as important to the Americans of long ago as to the Americans of today and was cultivated almost as extensively as maize , potatoes , sweet potatoes and beans . for it is scarcely possible to find a mummy anywhere in Peru that is not provided with its quota of mani . Truly even in those distant times it well deserved the title of the Mighty Peanut . CHAPTER XIV EDIBLE WEEDS WHEN we speak of a weed we usually refer to some worthless and unwelcome plant , quite overlooking the fact that what is a weed in one locality may be regarded otherwise in some other place . In the West Indies , portulaca and several others of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered weeds , yet the natives prize mullen as an ornamental plant , and cultivate dandelions , white daisies and our asters in their flower gardens . Also , a great many of our most prized food-plants and vegetables are weeds elsewhere , or were developed from weeds . Moreover , many of our commonest wild plants , which every farmer and gardener regards as weeds , are very excellent food-plants with edible roots or fruits or with leaves which make fine salads or " greens " . The young shoots of various ferns and the abundant " brakes " , when first showing above the earth , are as crisp , tender and delicate as any celery and may be eaten raw , or cooked like asparagus which they somewhat resemble in flavor . Another plant or " weed " of our fields and roadsides which is not only edible but delicious , is the common milkweed ( Fig. 1 ) . The young sprouts or stalks of this very common wild plant , when boiled and eaten with melted butter , are as nice a vegetable as anyone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens " just try a mess of pigweed or purslane , two of the commonest and most persistent and objectionable weeds of our gardens and farms . There is some question as to whether the pigweeds are true one hundred percent American or not , many botanists claiming they are European weeds that have been introduced to America . But the New England Indians have used the plants as food for centuries and the earliest colonists gathered " corn salad " which is a name often applied to these weeds . So perhaps the pigweeds , as well as the purslane , were here when the Europeans arrived . At any rate they are so thoroughly Americanized and so universally distributed throughout North America today that they may well be considered American weeds . Who would suspect that cattails would provide a meal ? Yet these familiar bullrushes as they are also called , have succulent young shoots which supplied the Indians with // a great deal of their vegetable food . In addition to the cattails , there are several other wild food-plants which may always be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern states . Nearly everyone is familiar with the common yellow pond-lilies often known as moose-lilies or hog-lilies , but very few persons know why they are called hog-lilies or that their tuber-like roots are edible . Yet it is the fact that their roots are not only edible but excellent when cooked that gave the plants the name of hog-lilies , for this is merely a corruption of the Indian name , kassnaog , which means an edible waterroot ( Fig. 2 ) . Along the edges of nearly every pond , lake , swamp or stream one may usually find the aquatic plants commonly known as green arum or arrow-leaf ( owing to the arrow-head-shaped leaves ) . It is always regarded as a weed , but the Indians knew its tuberous roots were edible and used them for food , either by roasting or boiling the roots and eating them as we do potatoes , or making them into a meal or flour which was // baked in thin cakes or " bread " . To the New England Indians the plant was known as tawkao , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , has been saved from hunger if not starvation by dining on the tawkao roots ( Fig. 3 ) . Another food-plant which grows wild in our woods is the ground-nut . The larger of the two species , the sprig-nut , was called by the Indians , kassnawisse ( Fig. 4A ) . The plant may be recognized by its pea-like reddish or garnet-purple flowers which grow in small more or less globular clusters . The common ground nut ( Fig. , sometimes called dwarf ginseng , is much more abundant in New England . It is easily identified by its vine and fine white blossoms . The " nuts " or more prop erly , the tubers are about one-half or one-third the size of those of the true kassnawisse or sprig-nut , or about the size of a small peanut . When raw they have a rather earthy taste and are not over pleasant , but when roasted or boiled or made into a paste or meal they are tender , delicate and have a rich nutty flavor . To be sure , there // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain human life for long , but more than once I have satisfied the pangs of hunger by lunching on the little tubers in the New England forests . Because so many of our weeds and wild plants are edible , do not assume that all those with tender shoots or tuber-like roots are good to eat . Many are really poisonous , others are bitter or acrid , and many are as hot and peppery as any capsicum . Yet even some of these , if properly prepared , are suitable for human consumption . For example , there is the common Jack-in-the-pulpit ( Fig. 5 ) , a plant familiar to everyone who visits our woods in spring and early summer . Although quite commonly known as " Indian turnip " , the plant is generally , and quite correctly , regarded as poisonous or corrosively acrid , and no one who tastes a minute bit of the Jack-in-the-pulpit root would believe that it can be transformed into a nutritious food . Yet the New England Indians did so , and still do , for that matter . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots could be treated in such a way as to be edible is a mystery // as great as that of the manioc or cassava . But sometime , some Indian hit upon the process , and discovered that by leaching the roots in wood ashes and water , and then boiling them and drying them and grinding them into meal they lost their poisonous , acrid quality and made excellent and palatable food . But I would n't advise anyone to try to prepare the roots for a meal unless thoroughly familiar with the Indians ' process . Neither should this plant be confused with the Indian bread-root or prairie turnip of our western states , which is a plant of a very different family and whose roots may be cooked and eaten without special preparation . Still another common weed with edible roots is the wild sunflower known as Jerusalem artichoke or sunroot ( Fig. 6 ) . This plant is a native of our northern states and southern Canada and grows abundantly in many localities as far south as southern New England , New Jersey and Pennsylvania and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated to some extent , especially by the Indians and foreigners , for its tubers are most delicious and nutritious . Moreover , they are // remarkable in the fact that they contain no starch and hence may be eaten by persons suffering from diabetes or other ailments which preclude starch in the diet . Although the tubers of the wild sunroot are rather small , and a good many are needed to supply a meal , yet by cultivation they may be vastly improved and it is not unusual to find the cultivated plants with tubers as large as medium-sized potatoes . When cooked these tubers have a peculiar grayish , soggy appearance yet they are tender and mealy with a delightful " wild " or perhaps I might say " woodsy " or nutty flavor , unlike that of any other root-food . The true sunroot or Jerusalem Artichoke , is the best of all the Sunflower Family for culinary purposes , but there are others of the sunflowers with edible roots which were used by our Indians . Moreover , the seeds of all the sunflowers are edible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either raw , roasted or made into a meal and cooked in the form of cakes , and in many localities in New England these seeds are sold at the stores and popcorn stands and are very popular with the children . And speaking of edible seeds we must not forget that pumpkin and squash seeds are also excellent eating , especially when roasted and salted , while ground into a coarse meal they make very tasty porridge or bread . It may seem strange to think of dining on the roots of pond-lilies and Jack-in-the-pulpits and munching young fern shoots , but it is not nearly so strange as to make a meal on the dry gray lichen known as reindeermoss . One might reasonably suppose that this lichen , which in many places covers acres of ground with a thick car108 FOODS AMERICA GAVE THE WORLD pet , would be about the most unlikely and impossible plant to provide food for human beings . But if reindeermoss is steeped or " brewed " in hot water for several hours it becomes edible and is excellent in soup or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaweed known as Dulse or Irish moss . If one is thoroughly familiar with our edible weeds and wild plants , there is no danger of starving to death or even going very hungry if lost in our northern woods , for in summer there are the various edible plants I have mentioned and even in winter the reindeer-moss is available . In fact it is not difficult to secure a complete meal , from " soup to nuts " from the wild plants of New England or our middle and eastern states . Even the fruits and the beverages are to be found with a little search , for aside from the various berries , wild plums , wild cherries and other fruits , there are the " prickly pears " borne by the eastern cactus or opuntia which in some localities is quite abundant in rocky places , especially near the seacoast . And the shrub known as Jersey tea ( Fig. 7 ) , which served our forefathers as a beverage during RevolutionEDIBLE // ary days , is still abundant , while farther south there is the Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose leaves and twigs infused in hot water make an excellent and refreshing drink which was the famous " black drink " of the Cherokee Indians ( Fig. 8 ) . For that matter the common sassafras may be used to provide a " tea " . In olden days " sassafras tea " was considered a panacea for innumerable ills , not the least of which was seasickness . So even if a draught of sassafras tea may prove a bit too high flavored and aromatic to suit most tastes , it is unquestionably healthful , and surely , if it will cure or prevent seasickness , it should be the most popular of beverages for ocean travellers . CHAPTER XV THE MOST USEFUL TREES OF all tropical trees the palms are the most familiar and the most typical . Indeed , a tropical landscape without palm trees would scarcely appear tropical and would lose much of its beauty and its lure . Yet few persons realize that of all trees the palms are the most useful to mankind , or that we of the north rely upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is scarcely anything essential to human beings that can not be obtained from palm trees of one kind or another . Houses , clothing , cordage , needles and thread , timber and firewood , boats and fodder , wax and oil , milk and drugs , wines and liquors , ivory and fibers , poisons and sirups , sugar and butter , fruits and flour , bread and a great variety of foods may all be secured from palm trees ; and many of the most valuable palms are natives of America . Perhaps the commonest of all is the coconut palm . It is an almost universal feature of every tropical seashore and village scene throughout the world , yet its origin is lost in antiquity . Although many , I might say most , botanists ( including Dr. O. W. Barrett ) claim that it is of Oriental or Old World origin , yet others believe it may have originated in the New World or even on some island or continent that has completely van-110 // ished . As far as known its presence in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erers , and it is known that it was introduced to Puerto Rico by the Spaniards in 1525. * But that does not prove the coconut palms were not already in the New World . The Padre , Diego Lorenzo , who brought the nuts from the Cape Verde Islands to Puerto Rico , may have im ported them because they were superior to those already growing on the island . And the fact that the early voy agers made no specific mention of the coconuts is not significant and does not prove these palms did not exist in America at that time . On the contrary , it would tend to prove just the reverse , for if the Spaniards and Por tuguese navigators , who had long been accustomed to finding coconut palms growing throughout the tropics // of the Old World , had found them absent in the New World they would have been surprised and disappointed and would , in all probability , have mentioned the fact . Moreover , no mention is made of the coconut in the an cient Sanskrit writings of India , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known at that time . Finally , there is the fact that by 1580 the presence of large numbers of bearing coconut palms was often mentioned by chroniclers of explorations and voyages in the New World . Coconut palms at that time were abun dant all along the shores of the West Indies , South and Central America , and grew in immense numbers on the Pacific coasts of Tropical America as well as on Gor gona , the Cocos* and other islands off the west coast of Central and South America . Yet if we are to believe that these trees were first introduced into America in 1525 , it would seem incredible that they could have spread throughout the American Tropics and could have found their way to the Pacific coast of the New World , and could have increased to form immense groves of the trees , all in the space of fifty-five years . In fact it would have been a botanical impossibility for this to have oc curred , for several years , six to eight at the minimum , are required for the coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we assume that the trees from Padre Lorenzo 's nuts bore in six years from the time they were planted , and that the very first nuts dropped into the sea and drifted away , another six or eight years would have been required for the strays to have borne their nuts which in turn fell into the ocean and drifted to some // other spot . Considering this , it would have required hundreds of years for the coconuts to have spread north and south and to have reached the Pacific shores of the continent in any numbers . And why should we assume that , even if the coconut originated in the Old World , it was not thoroughly at home in the New World ages before the first Europeans landed on American shores ? Nature designed the coconut to spread far and wide . Its nuts , enclosed in their strong , fibrous , buoyant husks , float almost indefinitely . They weather all storms and tempests , and whenever they are cast upon the shores by the sea they take root and grow , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt brine and its crown of great fronds overhang the waves and its ripened nuts fall into the ocean or upon the beach close to the sea . Exposed to the full force of tropical hurricanes these palm trees rarely suffer serious damage , for so slight is their roothold and so tough and flexible their trunks , that instead of being snapped off by the force of the gale they capsize or topple over , and continue to grow as if nothing had happened . It is quite common to see numbers of the trees with a portion of the trunks prone on the sand where they have been felled , but with their crown of leaves and nuts borne triumphantly aloft at the summit of the trunk which has grown straight upward at an abrupt angle from the portion resting on the sand ( Plate VIII , Fig. 1 ) . Very rarely , if ever , is there a straight coconut palm , for yielding to the winds , they grow crookedly and often twisted in weird forms . In the case of these palms it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined " . Considering all these facts , it would seem almost preposterous to believe that the coconut palms had to await the // hand and aid of man to reach the New World , provided they were of Old World origin . With many thousands of the nuts floating and drifting about the oceans at the whim of winds , tides and currents , some it would seem , must certainly have been washed ashore and found root-hold in America . Probably the truth may never be known , but regardless of its original habitat , the coconut palm is so thoroughly Americanized , ( as it has been for four centuries past ) , that it may quite properly be in-cluded in a work on American food-plants . And it is by far too important a food-plant in America to be omit-ted . Although practically everyone uses coconut in some form or another , and although great numbers are always on sale , yet few realize the vast , almost inconceivable numbers of nuts that are gathered and used annually . In fact the coconut is the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coconuts in some form every day of the year . More than ten bil-lion nuts are consumed annually , and to produce these requires six million or more acres of land and half a bil-lion trees , producing well over two billion dollars worth of nuts every year . While it is almost impossible to secure accurate data , there is no doubt that the great bulk of coconuts are produced in the East . Ceylon alone pro-duces about 2,200,000,000 . Dutch Malaya harvests about 2,000,000,000 . The Philippines produce about 2,100,000,000 . British India has about 1,600,000,000 while British Malaya adds another 400,000,000 . PolyTHE // nesia , Melanasia and Queensland produce about 1,000 , - 000 nuts , while Africa yields only 180- to 200,000,000 . Tropical America produces about 200,000,000 or barely two percent of the world 's supply . Very largely the nuts are transformed to copra , ( the dried meat of the nut ) which is used in making oil ; over 500,000 tons of coconut oil being used in the North Temperate Zone alone each year , while far greater quantities are used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be another important product although practically none is manufactured today . But in the Phillipines alone over 30,000,000 gallons of coco palm sap or tuba are collected annually practically all of this being used for making alcohol or vina . Yet as each gallon of sap contains about a pound of sugar some fifteen thousand tons of potential sugar is thus wasted in the Phillipines every year . Con siderable numbers of nuts also go into the manufacture of alcohol in other countries . The raw nuts are of comparatively little commercial importance , only about 100,000,000 raw nuts being ex-ported . Contrary to popular ideas , coconut palms will thrive splendidly far from the ocean and the largest plantations in the world are in the interior of Luzon in the Phil lipines , but they are far more numerous as a whole along the sea coasts . This is not because they require salt air or salt water in order to grow and thrive , but mainly be-cause so many thousands of nuts drift upon the sea beaches and take root there , whereas they must be trans-ported by man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt water can not sustain these palms , but is actually injurious to them . It has been stated by O. W. Barrett in The Tropical Crops , * " if there are any live roots below salt-water level it is certain that there is a strong flow of fresh water into the sea below the surface . Any soil three feet in depth which is loose and open is suitable for the coconut , provided the water-table does not come within two feet of the surface , and there is no poisoning effect of salt or brackish water , and that the elevation is less than 2,500 feet . " I can not agree with this as a universal rule . In many places the coconuts grow luxuriantly with their roots and the bases of the trunks submerged in the sea at high tide ( Plate VIII , Fig. 2 ) . In many more localities the trees grow within a few feet or even within a few inches of high water mark and where salt water oozes into a hole six inches in depth ( Plate VIII , Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coconut palms growing on tiny sandbars and cays where the highest land was barely six feet above the sea and where there was no possibility of fresh water existing , and on many of the San Blas Islands ( Panama ) where the finest of coconuts grow in dense groves , there is no trace of fresh water , and the palms ' roots are exposed by the action of the waves . I have even seen coconut palms , uprooted and with trunks floating on salt water , which had found roothold on the edge of the shore and were growing and bearing as well as their fellows standing above the beach . Possibly these // trees vary in their ability to withstand salt water , some being killed while others are uninjured by sea water about their roots . In the north the coconuts offered for sale are the ripe or " dry " nuts , but in the tropics the " jelly " or green coconuts are the ones eaten , the dry or ripe nuts being used for making confections and for cooking . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ripe or dry nut as there is between a hard green apple and a luscious ripe apple , only in the case of the coconuts it is the unripe nut that is the best . The meat of the ripe dried nuts we get in the north is hard , tough and indigestible , while the so-called milk is a thin , watery substance with a rather sickish flavor . But in the green nuts the flesh is soft , translucent and jelly-like , while the " milk " is rich and delicious , with a flavor totally distinct from that of the ripe nut . Moreover , the milk of the green nut is nourishing and very refreshing , and even on the hottest days the quart or more of liquid in a green coconut is cool and thirst-quenching . Although only one distinct species of coconut palm is recognized by the botanists , there are many different varieties . Some grow to a great height while others mature and bear nuts when only eight or ten feet in height . The quality of the nuts also varies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very difficult or even impossible to separate the meat from the shell without steaming , or placing the opened nuts in the sun , while in other varieties the shell parts readily from the white meat . These are known as freeshelling nuts and the most famous are those of the San Blas Islands off the Atlantic coast of Panama ( Plate // VIII , Fig. 5 ) . In shelling these rather small nuts it is only necessary to crack the shell when it may be removed leaving the flesh entire . For this reason the San Blas nuts are much in demand by manufacturers of dessicated coconut and always bring a high price . Although the coconut is undoubtedly the most valuable and most useful of palm trees yet there are many other palms native to America which are of great economic importance as food plants . Many of these produce fruits from which valuable edible oils are extracted , others are the sources of wines or brandies , a number bear most nutritious fruits , while still others are valued for the tender , white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in the West Indies . Unfortunately the removal of the heart of the palm is fatal to the tree , and in Cuba and some other localities so many palms were destroyed for the sake of the " cabbage " that laws were passed prohibiting cutting the hearts from the trees for this purpose . Among the most abundant palm trees of the America Tropics is the corozo palm or mucaja , a very spiny wild palm bearing great clusters of fruits containing 55% of a water-white edible oil , while just before ripening the hard pericarp develops as much as 27% of still another heavier edible oil . Another very valuable oil-palm of Tropical America is the cohune . Each tree will bear two to four clusters of immense masses of nuts weighing about 200 pounds and containing 15% of butter-like yellow fat in the husk , while the kernels yield another 60% of rich oil . In northern Panama there is a palm known as the pima palm which is the chief food supply of the Indians . Not only are the fruits eaten raw as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear yellow edible oil , while the flower-buds are also eaten and are excellent , tasting much like corn meal and honey . In many parts of South America the tepijilote palms are cultivated for their edible flower-buds . But perhaps the most important food-palm , aside from the coconut , is the peach palm or pejibaye , a very thorny species found from Mexico to Brazil and widely cultivated for its fruit which contain more food value than the banana and fully as much as the avocado . The fruits , which are about the size of a crabapple , are rich scarlet and orange in color and are borne in huge clusters weighing as much as fifty pounds each . In the wild varieties the fruit consists of a mealy , rather dry and sweet pulp or pericarp covering the large seed or nut . The cultivated varieties , however , are often seedless and have a rich peculiar flavor more like that of a nectarine than any other well-known fruit . Although they may be eaten raw , the fruits are usually cooked like squash . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while many are fermented and used in making an excellent and strong wine . CHAPTER XVI THE FRUIT OF HOSPITALITY DID you ever notice the carved pineapples upon the gateposts and above the doorways of old Colonial houses , and speculate upon their significance ? Even on modern houses and furniture , pineapples , usually highly conventionalized , are favorite decorative motifs , yet very few persons know why these fruits should be so widely used for such purposes . When the Spaniards first reached the West Indies they found the Indians ' cultivating the luscious fruit which the natives called anana . But the Dons , struck by its resemblance to a giant pine-cone in form , christened the new fruit pina which the English translated to " pine " and , to distinguish the fruit from the evergreen tree , they added " apple " . Perhaps because it was such a highly esteemed fruit , or possibly for some other reason , the Indians had adopted the pineapple as the symbol of friendship or hospitality , and the Europeans soon learned that if they came upon an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance , they would be welcomed and received hospitably . Of course it did n't make much difference to the white men , whatever their nationality , whether the Indians were friendly or not , for to the Europeans , the natives meant only so many men and women to be slaughtered or 120 // so many slaves to be worked in mines or on plantations . But the idea of the pineapple-symbol of friendship took the fancy of the romantic-minded Dons who carried it back to Spain . From Spain the custom spread to England , and from Britain the colonists carried it to Virginia and New England , and wherever they built their homes they placed carved or painted pineapples beside or above the entrances to indicate that visitors could be assured of a friendly welcome . Probably , however , not one out of a thousand of our ancestors knew how or where the custom originated , and were quite unaware that they had borrowed it from the despised Indians and that they were bringing the symbols of hospitality back to the land of their origin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their native land . No one knows with certainty just where in America the pineapple originated , or for how many centuries it had been cultivated by the Indians before the arrival of Europeans . It is probably as ancient as the potato or many other cultivated American fruits and vegetables , for it must have required an almost immeasurable time for the Indian agriculturists to have developed the inedible , hard fruit of the wild plant into a luscious , juicy , tender-fleshed fruit . Probably , too , the pineapple was first cultivated and developed by the Central American or South American races of the lowlands and not by the Incans or pre-Incans whose vast array of food-plants was developed in the cool highlands of the Andes , for the pineapple is essentially a tropical plant requiring an abundance of warmth for its best development . Yet the Incans and pre-Incans knew the fruit , and cultivated it in the warm valleys and on the lowlands // near the coast , for pineapples are frequently represented on the ancient pottery vessels found in the mounds and cemeteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient pre-Incan grave at Chavin , Peru ) . Moreover , the Peruvian races developed a variety of the pineapple which is quite distinct from others and is still grown in Peru . It is a small fruit , very rough and almost black in color , and with a peculiar flavor quite different from most " pines " . But the finest of the fruits have been developed in the West Indies where they were introducd by the Caribs from South America long before the arrival of Columbus . With the settlement of the islands by Europeans , the numerous local varieties of pineapples were still further improved and numerous " new " pines were developed . The Barbados " Sugar loaf " , the Red Spanish , the Ruby , the Bullhead and Black Antigua , the Ripleys and the Smooth Cayenne ( which is the variety most widely cultivated in Hawaii ) are all fine and famous while the Puerto Rican Big Head or Cabezona is a magnificent fruit sometimes attaining a weight of thirty pounds . // Unfortunately the finest grades of pineapples will not withstand long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green for transportation , those sold in our northern markets are really inferior fruits : No one who has never eaten a really fine West Indian " pine " , fully ripened on the plant , can realize what a vast difference there is between such fruits and those we are accustomed to in the north . Although a true American plant , the pineapple is now cultivated in practically all tropical lands . Vast numbers are grown in the Orient , especially in the Philippines and Malaysia , and the first canned pineapples were put up at Singapore more than thirty years ago . In Africa and some portions of Tropical America , the pineapples have escaped from cultivation and grow wild , but these are not true wild pines , a name which is applied to various parasitic airplants abundant in the tropical jungles . These wild pines , however , are very near relatives of the fruit-bearing species , for strange as it may seem , the pineapple is a member of the Bromeliad Family which includes the Spanish Moss of our Southern States . Moreover , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are cultivated as ornamental plants for the sake of their beautifully striped leaves , while others are grown for the fibre in the long leaves which sometimes are nine or ten feet in length . We always refer to the pineapple as a fruit yet it is not a true fruit , but an aggregation or cluster of many hundred fruits , each with its own core and spiny bracts marking the spots where the flowers appeared ( Fig. 2 ) . In most of the cultivated varieties the seeds have entirely disappeared , but in many of the pineapples grown by // the Indians and the natives there are good-sized seeds . Many of these less-developed or semi-wild fruits are very irritating to one 's mouth and lips , the result of the presence of crystals of calcium oxalate which has been practically eliminated from the better varieties . But care should be used in eating even the very finest and most luscious of " pines , " for the tiny needle-sharp spines of the flower-bracts , which often extend for some depth into the flesh beneath the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulcers on one 's lips and mouth . Although more pineapples are raised for canning than for any other purpose , vast numbers are shipped to northern markets and countless thousands are consumed in the countries where they grow . Aside from being eaten raw , great quantities are made into jams , confections and are used for culinary purposes , while still more are employed in making the popular pineapple juice beverage . But perhaps the most remarkable fact about the pineapple is that when decayed it develops a very deadly // poison which is used by several savage tribes for poisoning arrows and blowgun darts . Surely in their case , the pineapple is far from being a symbol of friendship and hospitality ! CHAPTER XVII FRUITS THE ROSES GIVE US STRANGE as it may seem , the Rose Family supplies us with a greater number of important , edible fruits than does any other one group of plants . The apples , pears , plums , cherries , almonds , peaches , apricots and many of the most important berries are all members of the Rose Family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many others , including some of our most valuable and prized fruits , which are truly American . At first thought there seems little resemblance between a handsome , delicately perfumed tea-rose or a crimson rambler and a pear , cherry , apple or strawberry , but botanically they are all very similar . For that matter , even the common rose bushes which we cultivate for their flowers , bear " haws " or berry-like , waxy-looking fruits which are edible , although far from palatable . Still , as the old saying reminds us : " when all fruits fail welcome haws , " and no doubt if we had no better fruits we might find rose-haws welcome , and if properly cooked or made into jams or jellies , they might be quite desirable . Like the cultivated and the wild roses , the hawthorns ( Fig. 1 ) and buckthorns ( Fig. 2 ) of our woodlands , which are members of the Rose Family , bear fruits or 126 // " haws " which are edible . As a rule , these are scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes , but there are some varieties which bear fairly sizable fruits which make good jams and jellies and were widely used by the Indians in the old days . Far better than these fruits of the spiny hawthorn and buckthorn trees are the wild plums . One of the most abundant of these in our northeastern states is the shad plum or service berry which is also known as the June berry . In the spring and early summer , its bunches of white cherry-like flowers are everywhere conspicuous in our woodlands , sometimes fairly covering the trees with masses of snowy blooms . One might reasonably expect that such multitudes of attractive blossoms would produce quantities of excellent fruits , but such is not the case , for the average shad plum is a pretty poor sort of fruit . Most of them are very small , sour and puckery , but occasionally a tree may be found with fair-sized sweet berries . They make good jams and jellies , however , and are extensively // used by the Indians for mixing with meat and other ingredients in preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach plums found from Mexico to Maine along the Atlantic seaboard . The fruits are slightly larger than a medium-sized grape , reddish or purple in color , and like most of our wild plums they vary greatly in quality , some trees bearing really excellent fruit , juicy and sweet , but the majority are sour and are only suitable for making jams or jel-lies . The Canada plum or wild yellow plain is another member of the Rose Family of our woodland districts , with fruit superior to either the shad plum or beach plum . They are handsome , fair-sized fruits , rich yellow in color and with a slightly sour but pleasant flavor . Very simi-lar to the Canada plum , aside from the color of the fruit , is the common wild plum tree with its red , tart fruits ( Fig. 3 ) , while the Chickasaw plum of our central and southeastern states has round , red or yellowish fruits much larger than the others I have mentioned , and with a true plum flavor . These trees are often cultivated and bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , there is the wild-goose plum with its strange history , all the trees of this variety that are now cultiFRUITS // vated being the descendants of a tree grown from a seed or " pit " taken from the crop of a wild goose . Far more abundant , and more familiar to most persons than the wild plum trees are the wild cherries . Although there are a number of distinct species of these members of the Rose Family found in the United States , they vary so greatly and no doubt hybridize to such an extent , that it is sometimes difficult if not impossible to identify them . But as a rule there are three fairly well marked and recognizable wild cherry trees found in our woods and along our roadsides . One is the choke cherry with its intensely puckery small fruits which identify it beyond all question ( Fig. 4 ) . Another is the wild red cherry or pin cherry with its bright red , decidedly sour but only slightly " choky " fruits , while the wild black cherry or rum cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairly juicy , and in the case of some trees , with a really delightful cherry flavor ( Fig. 5 ) . All are widely used for making jellies , jams and conserves , for pies and for making wild cherry cordial or wine . Although there are countless wild apples growing almost everywhere in North America they are all immi130 FOODS AMERICA GAVE THE WORLD grants , or at least descendants of introduced European apples , even if thoroughly naturalized . As far as known the only species of the apple tree group which are natives of America are certain wild crabapples of no importance and with practically worthless fruit , although like so many members of the Rose Family , they vary greatly in the quality of their fruit and some have " crabs " which make excellent pies , jams , jellies and sauce . There may appear to be little if any similarity between wild plums , cherries and crabapples and the raspberries ( Fig. 6 ) , and the blackberries ( Fig. 7 ) , but both these abundant and important fruit-plants are members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now cultivated in many other lands . Very often the blackberries and raspberries are confused , for while it is a simple matter to distinguish an ordinary wild blackberry from a red raspberry , there are species and varieties very similar in general appearance . But there is always one great difference , for the true raspberries slip readily from the central " core " or receptacle when ripe , while the true blackberries lack this pithy central core and break off from the stem entire . There are both " low bush " and " high bush " blackberries , some species or varieties being mere trailing vines forming // tangles close to the surface of the earth or rambling over rocks , weeds and brush , while others form dense clumps of high stalks or " canes " many feet in length . In Chile , the blackberry vines form dense impenetrable jungles , often covering many acres , with huge stalks twenty to thirty feet or more in length and two inches or more in diameter at the base . Anyone who has endeavored to push through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be like to attempt to force a way through such a forest of tangled , thorn-clad canes . Although our best blackberries and raspberries are the cultivated varieties , they are all offshoots of the native wild species , and many of the wild blackberries , the wild red raspberries and the black raspberries or thimble berries are the equals of any of the best cultivated varieties. * In addition to the red and black raspberries // there is a white or pale straw-colored variety , while the Loganberry is merely a hybrid of the blackberry and the raspberry . Other members of the genus to which these well known berries belong are the salmon berries and the buffalo berries of Canada and our northern states ( Fig. 9 ) . These are small , inferior berries , often very tart or sour and usually exceedingly " seedy " , but they are gath ered in large numbers by the Indians who add the dried fruits to their pemmican . Everyone is familiar with the delicious strawberries ( Fig. 10 ) , but I doubt if many persons know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Family of Roses . And I suppose many patriotic native sons and daughters of " Merry England " will be properly indignant at my statement that the strawberries are one hundred percent American , for the wild strawberries are as much a part of English fields and " spinneys " as are primroses , daisies , bluebells or violets . Nevertheless , there were no strawberries in Great Britain before the discovery of America , nor for long afterwards , for the first strawberry plants to be grown in England were brought from the Virginia Colony in 1629. // Today the native North American strawberries are cultivated , and in many places have run wild , in most parts of the world . Even in tropical lands , in the West Indies and elsewhere , these luscious little berries are raised to some extent , while no finer , larger , sweeter strawberries can be found anywhere than are those of Peru . Although several different species of strawberries are recognized here in North America , all are more or less alike in appearance , and all are red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated in Colombia , which has pale straw-yellow or yellowish-white berries . These are known as frutilla and while larger than the average red berries they are inferior in flavor , although some have even more of the " woodsy " taste typical of our wild strawberries . Even if our South American neighbors can not lay claim to native strawberries as fine as those of our country , they can boast of having the largest and finest of all blackberries . This is the Colombia berry , the real giant of the genus , often two inches in length , with a flavor equal to that of any of the best varieties of our cultivated blackberries and raspberries . As it has been introduced into Oregon , where it thrives well , it may soon become one of our most familiar and popular fruits of the Rose Family . While they can not be included as members of the Rose Family , but belong in the Vaccinum Family , we must not overlook the blueberries and huckleberries when on the subject of American berries ( Fig. 11 ) . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raspberries , so they fail to distinguish between the blue134 FOODS AMERICA GAVE THE WORLD berries and huckleberries , and consider any that are blue or bluish blueberries and class all the dark-purplish or black berries as huckleberries . Unfortunately , however , there are dark-colored or blackish blueberries as well as decidedly blue huckleberries . But there is a certain way of distinguishing the one from the other , for the true blueberries contain numerous fine seeds , whereas the true huckleberries have ten fairly large seeds or " nutlets " embedded in the pulp . Ordinarily , too , we divide these well known popular berries into two groups known as high bush and low bush berries . But there are several species or varieties of each , and very often the height of the " bush " varies greatly , depending upon the soil , the environment and other factors , and the same variety may be a low bush blueberry or huckleberry in one spot and a fairly " high " bush in another locality a short distance away . In the same way the size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the berries , vary according to soil and other conditions , and in the same patch of berry bushes it is not unusual to find certain plants loaded with fine large fruits while others have tiny , dry , sour berries . Under cultivation these fruits are vastly improved . The late Dr. Coville was the first horticulturist to cultivate the blueberries on a commercial scale with the result that today we may purchase cultivated blueberries , free from // " runts " and imperfect fruits , twigs and leaves , which are several times the size of the finest wild berries and with a far better flavor , as well as fewer seeds . Still , by far the greater number of the blueberries and huckleberries that are marketed are the wild berries . As they are found over a very large area of our eastern and northern states they have a very long " season " , the earliest crop coming from the mountainous parts of Virginia , Pennsylvania and the neighboring states while the last berries of the summer and early autumn are those gathered in northern Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far the greatest producer of blueberries , the very center of the industry being about Machias , where the vast blueberry crop reaches a value of more than one million dollars a season . In Tropical America the Rose Family is not so well represented among the important fruits as it is in the north . One of the commonest of the group is the feje- . cote , sometimes erroneously confused with the Surinam cherry in the West Indies . The tejecote is a native of Mexico and resembles a hawthorn , with small , yellow , berry-like fruits filled with rather dry , mealy , yellowish pulp containing three large seeds . They are suitable only for making jams , jellies , conserves and pies . A far better fruit is the capulin , a wild cherry of the mountainous districts of South America , which is superior to our best wild cherries but inferior to the poorest of our cultivated varieties . In many parts of Tropical America the small , rather acid fruits of the manzanillas are quite widely used , while the icaco or cocoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are two varieties // of this fruit , one almost black and the other greenishwhite , usually found side by side and differing only in color . Although the fruits are insipid and have a " fainty " taste , they develop a rich fruity and pleasant flavor when stewed in sirup or with sugar . Still another fruit of the American Tropics which is borne by a tree of the Rose Family is the sansapote . This is a native of Central America and resembles an overgrown pear four to six inches in length , with a smooth , greenish-brown skin . The flesh is rich yellow , sweet , but not particularly attractive in flavor . No doubt there are many wild plums , cherries and berries of this family in Tropical America which could be vastly improved and might well be developed into important and desirable fruits by careful cultivation and selection . In the interior of the Island of Dominica , especially in the vicinity of volcanic craters and the Boiling Lake , there is a wild native berry belonging to the blueberry group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush blueberries . Undoubtedly this could be vastly improved by cultivation , just as our northern wild blueberries have been improved . Throughout the American Tropics there are many wild berry-like fruits which are used by the Indians , but are wholly unknown to others , even including botanists ; and in the highlands of the Guianas , and about the head-waters of the Amazon , there is a wild grape or at least a grape-like vine , which bears clusters of pale mauve or pinkish-purple fruits with a peculiar spicy flavor highly pleasing to the Indians who use the fruits for flavoring their beverages and their food . In fact there is a wonderful field for investigation and study // of the innumerable wild berries of our tropics , regarding which very little is known . A sad commentary upon this neglect of opportunity is the fact that the best of all tropical American " wild " berries is the delicious , delicately-flavored red raspberry which abounds in the mountains of the West Indies , and is known locally as fresa in Puerto Rico and as fuez in Dominica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Himalayas , introduced into the West Indies many years ago . CHAPTER XVIII THE ORCHID THAT FLAVORS OUR CAKES WHEN we stop to consider that the Rose Family sup-plies us with many of our finest fruits and berries , and that lilies and sunflowers furnish us with edible roots , it seems quite fitting that we should make use of an orchid for flavoring our cakes , ice cream and other desserts . If you should see this orchid growing you might not recognize it as such , for we usually think of orchids as exotic , parasitic plants draping the trees of tropical jun gles and ablaze with gorgeous flowers . But the orchid that flavors our cakes is quite modest in this respect , and you would look in vain for the purple , white or magenta flowers such as we see displayed in florists ' windows or adorning the corsages of wealthy women , for instead of producing expensive , showy blossoms this orchid devel ops long , slender seed-pods known as vanilla beans ( Fig. 1 ) . Do not imagine , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it for flavoring , for the pods or " beans " in their natural state have no trace of the vanilla scent or flavor , and like tobacco , cassava , cacao and several other plant products , they must undergo a long and rather complicated treatment before being used . How the Indians of America ever happened to discover these processes necessary to render certain 138 // plants valuable or useful , is one of the greatest of un+ solved mysteries of the ancient races of America . But discover them , they did , and centuries before Europeans ever dreamed of the existence of a Western Continent , the natives of Mexico and Central and South America had learned how to convert the odorless , tasteless seedpods of an orchid into one of the most delicious and delightful of flavoring substances , and were using vanilla in their chocolate , their cakes and their confections . And perhaps the most remarkable part of their remarkable discovery is the fact that , except in one small district , the cultivated vanilla vines will not produce pods unless the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several species of vanilla orchids native to the tropical jungles of the lowlands of Mexico , Central and South America , the two Mexican species are the only ones of commercial importance . Both grow wild in the Tierra Caliente district of Eastern Mexico , especially between Vera Cruz and Tampico , in the Papantla district , where they grow to immense size , often one hundred feet or more in length , and climbing to the tops of // the tallest forest trees . The finest , most valuable " beans " are the long , slender pods of Vanilla planifolia which supplies fully ninety percent of the true vanilla of commerce . The other species , known as the Vanillon , is Vanilla pompon which has shorter , thicker pods containing a smaller percentage of the chemical vanillin , which is the source of the perfume and flavor . Although the vanilla clambers over trees and clings to the trunks and branches by means of aerial roots , it is not a true air plant like so many other orchids , but is firmly rooted in the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detritus of the bark of the trees . In its native habitat in the dense , hot jungles of the Mexican lowlands , the vanilla flowers are pollinated by small insects , but in other parts of the world where the plant is cultivated by man , it is necessary to pollinate the flowers artificially in order to produce the pods . This is usually done by means of a small stick or a sliver of bamboo with which the stigma of the flower is raised and the pollen pressed out from the anther . It is a delicate operation and must be done before 2 P. M. as each flower is viable for only five or six hours a day . An expert , however , can pollinate about two hundred flowers in a day , and in order to produce longer , heavier pods only a few of the dozen or two small flowers in each cluster are pollinated . But as a healthy plant may bear as many as two hundred clusters , the small percentage thus pollinated will yield a great number of pods . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-inch pod and three times as much as one five inches in length , it pays to sacrifice numbers for the sake of size . Even when the flowers have been pollinated the // work of the vanilla culturist is not over . Two months are required for the pods to attain full growth and seven to ten months more must elapse before the " beans " are ripe and ready to pick , so nearly a year will pass between the pollination of the flowers and the gathering of the crop . And in the meantime great care and attention must be given to the plants . Although propagated from cuttings planted in the earth , the vines must be provided with small trees , bushes of trellises of growing plants over which to climb . Their roots must be kept mulched and protected , they must be constantly pruned , and unremitting care is essential if a good crop of the valuable " beans " is to be harvested . Even when the pods are ready , to be gathered they must be picked very carefully by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pod may ruin it , and careless picking may disturb the other flowers or immature pods so that they will not mature . The next step is the curing or " sweating " of the pods . In Mexico , where practically all the labor is performed by Indians whose ancestors raised and cured vanilla for the use of Montezuma and his forebears , the pods are placed on blankets and exposed to the sun during the day and are rolled up within the warm folds at night time and in wet weather . Very soon the pods begin to darken and to become wrinkled , and in a week or two are fully cured , when they are an even , dark brown or nearly black , soft and pliable , but tough and leathery , with a strong vanilla aroma . Then comes the drying , and this is one of the most important parts of the preparation of the " beans . " This must be done very slowly and requires from six to ten weeks . When fully dried they are still flexible and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are then tied in bundles and packed in air-tight containers for shipment , although the poorer grades are often shipped in bulk . But all this care and labor to produce the source of flavoring for our cakes , our ice creams and " sweets " is well worth while , for vanilla is a very profitable crop . The best grade " beans " bring from $4 to S6 a pound and often yield a profit of 83000. an acre . Although a native of the Tropical American jungles , vanilla is now cultivated in the West Indies , the East Indies , the South Sea Islands and other tropical lands . Yet it was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that the demand for the highly-prized beans exceeded the supply produced in Mexico , and cuttings were taken to the East Indies . Today , the world consumes about seven hundred tons of vanilla beans , valued at from four to twelve million dollars every year . Of this total , Mex ico still supplies nearly one-half or about three hundred tons , despite the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the Dutch East Indian plantations . One might suppose that the cultivation and harvesting of the vanilla beans would be no more dangerous than the cultivation and harvesting of any other fruit or vege table , but a subtle affection , which is sometimes serious , lurks in these orchid vines . This is known as vanillosis or vanilla itch and is caused by the minute , needle-sharp crystals of calcium oxalate contained in the sap of the plants . Another " itch " is produced by the crystals of vanillin on the cured and dried pods . These minute crys tals penetrate the tender skin between the fingers and about the necks and faces of the workers , and produce // an intense , painful irritation and itching . At times vanillosis results in vertigo , prostration and very serious illness . Largely , however , it may be avoided by the laborers wearing gloves while pruning the plants and gathering and handling the pods . Owing to the time and care essential to the production and preparation of vanilla beans , the price of the product is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artificial " vanilla " flavorings are manufactured and sold . Clove oil is used for this purpose , as is the massoi bark of New Guinea and the tonka bean of South America , while still cheaper " synthetic " " vanilla extracts " ale prepared from coal tar . For this reason many persons prefer to purchase the whole pods or " beans " of the vanilla , rather than the liquid extracts , for only in this way can we be absolutely certain whether our cakes and ice creams , our puddings and our pastries , are flavored with the seed-pod of an orchid or with a product of the gas works . CHAPTER XIX FRUITS WE SELDOM SEE NoT only do the inhabitants of Tropical America have a great number of most excellent vegetables which are rarely or never seen in our northern markets , but they also enjoy a great variety of fruits seldom seen by north erners who have not visited the Tropics . There are several reasons for this . In the first place , a great many of the most delicious and desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances . Many others must be allowed to ripen on the trees , for when picked green they decay or never ripen properly ; and still others are not cultivated in sufficient quantities to warrant establishing a demand which could not be supplied . Moreover , northerners are almost as conservative in regard to new or novel fruits as to new vegetables . It required many years to make bananas popular ; the tomato , which is as much a fruit as a vege table , was regarded as poisonous and unfit to eat for cen turies after it had been introduced into Europe and America , and even today , when mangos and ripe figs , papayas , mameys and several other luscious tropical fruits may be found in the more expensive fruit stores , they find few purchasers and are by no means popular fruits. * // Perhaps of all the true American fruits of the tropics , the papaya is the most desirable , as well as one of the most delicious . Like all other fruits it varies greatly in quality , and unless the first papaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to forego all papayas thereafter . But there is no more reason for doing so than for a person to declare all apples poor , sour and miserable fruits merely because the first one eaten is a stunted , poor-quality apple . And a really fine papaya , fully ripe and icy cold , is one of the finest , most delicate ly-flavored fruits on earth . It is impossible to describe the flavor of a good papaya , for it is wholly unlike that of any other fruit , although slightly like a very delicate ly-flavored cantaloupe . In appearance and consistency the papaya is also very similar to a melon , with a more or less fluted , yellow or orange skin , and juicy yellow , salmon-pink or orange flesh ( Fig. 1 ) . The seeds , how146 FOODS AMERICA GAVE THE WORLD ever , are very different from those of any melon , being small , black or very deep-brown , and loosely placed as if dropped hit or miss into the hollow interior of the fruit . Both the flesh and the seeds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both contain a digestive ferment known as pa pain , which is widely used in medicine and in some cases is superior to pepsin . The leaves , too , possess remarkable medicinal qualities and a decoction made from them will sometimes cure or relieve diphtheria and other throat affections in an almost miraculous manner . Aside from the ripe fruit , which is usually eaten raw or boiled in sirup , the partly ripe and poorer fruits are stewed or made into conserves . In the vicinity of Coquimbo , Chile , there is a peculiar variety of papaya with very small dense fruits , inedible when raw , which are candied like citron and are a delicious confection . They are also canned in heavy sirup and are excellent " preserves " . The papaya plant or " tree " is very distinctive ; in fact it is unlike any other fruit tree , and once seen may always be recognized . As a rule it grows straight upward in a single stalk or trunk crowned with an umbrella-like mass of broad palmate leaves , although certain varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even several side branches or stalks . But the most striking feature of the tree is the manner in which the flowers , and later the fruits , grow directly from the trunk itself . As one northerner expressed it , they look like " Hubbard squashes grafted onto a freak palm tree " . Quite frequently , however , one may see a papaya tree bearing small inconspicuous flowers but no fruits . These are the male trees , for like many other tropical plants the paFRUITS // payas have the male or staminate flowers and the pistillate or female flowers on separate trees , and , as a rule , only the female or fruiting plants are cultivated . There is a current belief in the West Indies that if a piece of tough meat or a %ough fowl is tied to a papaya tree the meat will become juicy and tender in a short time . Although this is not strictly true , it is not such a " whopper " as it seems , for the papain content of the papaya is so considerable that a bruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the juice or latex when fresh will actually digest the skin of a person 's fingers or hands , especially beneath rings , in a few minutes . Even the thoroughly ripened fruits are liable to be injurious if consumed in great quantities , and if fed to domestic animals or birds , such as parrots or canaries , they cause a softening and bleeding of the skin and tissues , yet the mature fruits contain barely a trace of the latex which is most abundant in the green or unripe fruits . If a green papaya is slightly cut or scratched a thin whitish juice oozes from the incision and hardens or coagulates rapidly upon exposure to the air . It is from this latex or gum that the papain of commerce is prepared , the fruits being " tapped " or " bled " regularly and the " milk " collected . Each fruit yields only a small quantity of the latex , an average tree producing perhaps three or four pounds a year , which will supply barely one iuunul of the dried " gum " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , and as papaya trees are among the easiest of plants to raise , and will thrive almost anywhere in the tropics , they are a very profitable crop . A I t ho oIgh the papaya is often erroneously called " pawpaw " , it is totally distinct from the pawpaws of our // southern and central states which are the fruits of a small branched tree bearing conspicuous purple flowers ( Fig. 2 ) Another very important and popular fruit of the American Tropics is the sapodilla , a fruit of many aliases , for it is variously known as sapodilla , nispero , dilly , naseberry , and in some of the British West Indies , as apple . The sapodilla , which is the fruit of a large and handsome tree with a very hard and exceedingly durable wood , varies greatly in size , shape and quality , but is always recognizable by its smooth or slightly-roughened brown skin , resembling that of a potato , and the flattish , highly-polished , jet-black seeds ( Fig. 3 ) . As a rule they are rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while the majority are ovate or elliptical in form , many are almost round or spherical , while still others have the smaller end sharply-pointed ( Fig. 4 ) . When fully ripe they are very juicy and so soft and " squashy " that to the uninitiated they appear decayed . The flesh varies from nearly pure white or greenish to deep yellowish or even brown , with an exceedingly sweet , sugary flavor . In one respect they have a great // advantage over most other fruits , for they may be eaten freely and to any extent without danger of affecting the intestinal tract or causing stomach trouble . But unless fully ripe they are unfit to eat , while if over-ripe , with the juice exuding from the softened skin , they should be avoided , for in this condition the fermented juice is not only unpleasant , but dangerous . As a rule , the sapodillas are picked before they are ripe and are ripened in the shade , for if allowed to ripen on the trees they are eaten by birds , insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these appreciative creatures and drop from the trees , they are broken or squashed upon striking the ground . In their immature or green state the sapodillas contain a thick , whitish , sticky latex which exudes from cuts and abrasions and coagulates upon contact with the air . This gum , which is also contained in the bark of the tree , is the chicle of commerce which is the principal ingredient of chewing gum . Most of the chicle , however , is obtained from the wild trees of the Sapota Family to which the sapodilla belongs . The Sapota Family embraces a large number of trees producing a great variety of important and delicious // fruits . Probably no one really knows how many distinct varieties of the sapotes there are , for each well-marked variety varies considerably ; in different localities the same fruit is often known by half a dozen or more different names ; and there are a number of little-known varieties restricted to small , remote areas , while doubtless many others are known only to the Indians or other natives of isolated districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better-known varieties are the yellow sapote , white sapote , green sapote , black sapote , and the mammee sapote which belongs to a different genus of trees . But all are similar in many respects , being more or less like overgrown sapodillas in outward appearance , and varying from spherical to sharply-pointed elliptical in shape , with rough brownish , greenish or yellowish skins and rich , sugary-sweet meat when fully ripe . The commonest of all in most of the Tropical American markets is the mammee sapote ( Fig. 5 ) , which , as mentioned above , is a member of the genus Achras , whereas the true sapotes are members of the genus Sapota , although no one but a botanist could distinguish the difference . The mammee sapote is usually ovate or elliptical in form with a rich , orange-brown or olive-brown , fairly smooth skin , and is often mistaken for a sapodilla by persons unfamiliar with tropical fruits . The flesh , however , is very different , being firm and often mealy with comparatively little juice , and vaFRUITS // ries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep scarlet or even crimson in color . Moreover , it contains only a single large polished black or dark-brown seed ( Fig. 6 ) . In Central America the seeds are roasted and ground and are mixed with cacao beans for preparing a beverage . The mammee sapote should not be confused with the true mamey or mammee apple which is a totally different fruit , despite the similarity of names . The mammee apples , as they are called in the British West Indies , or mameys as the Spanish-speaking people call them , are big , roundish or spherical fruits , often ten inches in diameter , with scaly or bark-like , rusty-brown , leathery rinds , and resemble corroded iron cannon-balls more than anything else . The flesh is very dense , rather tough and dry , and varies from a salmon-pink or light buff to deep orange-red in color . There is usually a single big , rough , light-colored seed , although sometimes two or three . The flesh has a rather peculiar odor and is sweet and usually highly spicy or aromatic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eaten raw , and is customarily used in making jellies , jams , conserves and pies , which are very delicious and have a most alluring but indescribable spicy flavor . Among the most popular and splendid fruits of the American Tropics are the anonas which include the sweetsop or sugar apple , the custard apple or bullock's152 FOODS AMERICA GAVE THE WORLD heart , the delicious cherimoya and the guandbana or soursop . All of these , with the exception of the guanabana or soursop , are sugary , sweet fruits , but each has a distinct and delightful flavor . Some taste very much like vanilla ice cream , others have a slightly tart taste , still others have a lemon or orange flavor , while others remind one of strawberries or pineapples . They are usually roundish or almost spherical in shape with reticulated or tuberculate skins which vary from whitish-green to rich reddish , yellowish or dark-brown according to the species . It is often very difficult for a person unfamiliar with the fruits to distinguish one from the other , but some are quite distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably the sugar apple or sweetsop ( Fig. 7 ) . This is a grayish-green fruit , rounded or somewhat conical in shape , with the surface divided into numerous scale-like sections which separate easily when the fruit is ripe . The flesh is pure white , melting , and very sweet , with a peculiar aromatic , agreeable flavor . Another similar fruit is the custard apple or bullock's-heart ( Fig. 8 ) . As its name implies , it is more or less heart-shaped with a much smoother reticulated skin than the sugar apple . In color // it varies from brownish-red to purplish , and frequently is covered with a lilac-colored bloom like that of a grape . The quality and flavor of the custard apple varies greatly , some fruits being insipid and " fainty " , as the West Indians express it , while others are fully equal to the sweetsop . Far better than either of these anonas are the cherimoyas ( Fig. 9 ) . These natives of Peru where they were cultivated in the most ancient times by the preIncan races who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothills . ( Fig. 10 , a pre-Incan water jar in the form of a cherimoya fruit , from a tomb at Chan Chan , Peru ) . Unlike most of the anonas , the cherimoya does not thrive where it is very hot , but prefers the cool climate of the mountains , the name meaning " fruit of cool places . " Although the finest of these fruits are those of Peru , excellent cherimoyas are grown in Central America and Mexico , as well as in the West Indies , and the trees are now cultivated in many parts of the world , especially in Madeira , the Canary Islands , in the Mediterranean countries , in India and Africa . The fruit is usually heart-shaped , although many are nearly perfect spheres , often weighing several pounds , with an // almost smooth skin which in the best varieties is an attractive russet-brown shading to rich reddish-orange and crimson . The flesh is soft , delicate and almost like custard in consistency ; very sweet and fragrant , and with a flavor more closely resembling strawberry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful aromatic " tang " in addition . Very different from the other anonas is the soursop or guanabana ( Fig. 11 ) . It is a much longer , more heartshaped fruit than the others , and instead of having a reticulated or smooth surface the skin is covered with rather soft , spine-like projections , although in some varieties these may be merely warty protuberances . In color it is green , usually with blackish areas when fully ripe , with a cottony-white flesh having a fragrant , aromatic odor and a peculiar sourish-sweet , rather acid flavor . Although few persons like it when eaten raw , the fruit makes an excellent sherbet or ref resco when mixed with ice and water , and it is especially good as a flavoring for ice cream . In addition to these most common and important members of the Anona Family , there are a number of others which are restricted to certain localiFRUITS // ties or areas , or are occasionally seen in the markets of Tropical America . But they are all so similar in appearance and in quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no necessity for mentioning them in detail . Another popular fruit of Peru , which is occasionally seen in other Tropical American countries , is the lucmo . This is a rather small egg shaped fruit , buff to bright golden-yellow or orange in color , with a smooth skin and having a soft , mealy pulp with a peculiar but pleasant flavor . Although eaten raw as a dessert , the lucmos are far better when made into jams , jellies or conserves , and they are excellent as " pie timber " . Somewhat similar to the lucmo , especially in external appearance , is the egg fruit or ti-es$ , which is common in Florida as well as in the more tropical areas of America . Like the sapodilla to which it is closely related , the ti-ess , when fully ripe and fit to eat raw , is so soft and " squashy " that it appears decayed . The fruit is small , about the shape of an olive , and has a smooth yellow or orange-colored skin . The flesh is sweet but rather " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of conserves , jellies and jam . Far superior to these fruits are the star apples or cai156 FOODS AMERICA GAVE THE WORLD mitos which received their commonest name because of the star-like pattern formed by the radial internal partitions when the fruit is cut transversely across ( Fig. 12 and Frontispiece ) . They are about the size and shape of medium-sized apples , although usually somewhat flattened endwise , and have smooth , polished or shiny skins which in some varieties are rich , deep-purple while others are green . They are among the sweetest of all fruits with a peculiarly rich flavor . The rinds or skins of the ripe fruits , as well as the flesh of the unripe fruits , contain a sticky , rubber-like sap or latex which is most annoying if one attempts to bite into the fruit instead of scooping the pulp from the rind in the proper manner . Somewhat similar to the star apples in sweetness and flavor , as well as the presence of the gummy latex , but far superior to them , is the bui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a native of the British West Indian island of Dominica , and is a rather rare fruit borne by one of the most beautiful of all tropical trees . The fruits are about the size and shape of a Queen olive and have smooth , shiny , deep-purple or almost black skins . The pinkish-green pulp is deliciously sweet , but is rather too rich to be eaten freely by most persons . Somewhat similar to the bui in outward appearance only , is the jaboticaba , a Brazilian fruit very popular in that country where it is eaten raw and is also used extensively for jams , jellies , etc . These fruits are borne either singly or in clusters close to the larger branches and the trunk of the tree . The pulp is translucent and delicately pinkish and very sweet , but the flavor is rarely pleasing to those unaccustomed to it , although like olives the fruits " grow upon " one after a short time . // Far more abundant and widely used than almost any other fruit-plants of the American Tropics , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pear-guava of Peru ) . In fact in most parts of our tropics the guava bushes or trees , for they frequently attain a height of twenty or thirty feet , are a nuisance and soon overrun pastures or even cultivated lands . Although the ripe fruits are rarely seen in our northern markets , nearly everyone is familiar with the delicious guava jelly and guava paste or jam prepared from the guava fruits . For that matter , those who have never seen or eaten a ripe guava have n't missed much , for the fruits are far better when stewed in sirup or transformed into jelly or jam . In fact , when raw the salmon-pink pulp within the buffcolored or yellow tough rind is full of small seeds , and is often wormy , while the distinctive guava flavor is offset by the rather sourish or insipid taste of the fruit as a whole . Far superior to the true guava is the guava-like fruit known as the f eijoa , which has been introduced into California and southern Europe . The exterior of the fruit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dense , peach-like fuzz or " bloom " . The flesh is // almost translucent , white or slightly pink , and has a most delicious flavor like a combination of strawberries and pineapples . But its most remarkable and attractive peculiarity is its intense fragrance which is so strong and enduring that hours after the feijoa has been removed from a dish or basket , the aroma remains , scenting an entire room with the delightful odor of the ripe fruit . Throughout Tropical America the various granadillas are very popular ( Fig. 15 ) . These , like the Maypop of our southern states , are the fruits of various species of Passion flowers , and while some are eaten raw , they are used mainly in the preparation of refreshing and cooling beverages or sherbets known to the Spanishspeaking people as ref rescos . Strictly speaking , the name , granadilla , applies only to the largest species , a huge fruit six to twelve inches in length , roughly foursided , and buff-colored or yellowish-green in color , with a heavy , fleshy skin or rind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy capsule is a mass of small flattened seeds in a sack of slimy juice . The entire mass , seeds and all , may be eaten , but as a rule the juice is strained from the seeds and is used for making the granadilla refrescos , while the thick rind is // stewed in sirup , or is candied to form a confection . Al-though some persons find the flavor of the fruit most pleasant , it is intensely disagreeable to others . The same is true of the various other fruits of the Passion flower vines . Some of these , known to the West Indians as wa ter-lemons ( Fig. 16 ) , have thin , rather hard or crisp rinds and very watery interiors , having a peculiar acidity which is very cooling , while the best of the lot , as far as its eating qualities are concerned , is the yellow or sweet granadilla which has a delicate , pleasing odor and a sweetish refreshing flavor . Another refreshing fruit which possesses very marked " cooling " properties is the cashew . The peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north , but there are few persons who realize what truly curious " nuts " these are or that they are not true nuts but the seeds of a fruit . The cashew , which is the fruit of a large wild tree of Tropical America , is unique , for the single large seed develops on the outside , where it is attached to the broad tip of the pear-shaped fruit , and is formed before the fruit which grows from the blossom pushing the " nut " ahead of it ( Fig.17 ) . When raw the " shell " or rind of the " nut " contains a powerful corrosive // poison , and the kernels are inedible until roasted . Few fruits anywhere are more decorative than the cashews with their highly-polished , wax-like surfaces and brilliant scarlet , crimson , yellow and white hues , ( Frontispiece ) . Some trees bear fruits of almost uniform color , but it is not unusual to find every shade and combination of shades of red and yellow on the fruits of a single tree . In edible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in color . Some are so " puckery " that the Carib name , meaning " mouth-twister " is most appropriate , while others are sweet and have only a trace of the astringent effect . But all are alike in being exceedingly juicy . In fact the interior consists wholly of almost liquid pulp , about the consistency of clotted cream , and soft fibres , while even the most puckery varieties possess a marvelous property of quenching thirst , and leave an indescribable " clean " taste in one 's mouth . As thirst-quenching fruits of the Tropics , the fruits of various species of cactus rank high . Practically all cactus fruits are edible , but some are pithy and not worth eating , others are dry and tasteless , still others are sour or insipid , while a number have excellent flavors and are really desirable fruits , either eaten raw , made into jams , jellies or conserves , or otherwise cooked or prepared . Among the best and most popular of the cactus fruits are the tunas , as they are called in the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cactus commonly known as the prickly-pears , one species of which grows wild as far north as central New England ( Fig. 18 ) . They are usually more or less pear-shaped fruits , usually slightly fluted or ridged longitudinally , // and in most species are a dark-purplish or liver-red varying to pink in color . Within the past few years they have been on sale in the fruit stores of our larger cities in the North , but have never become popular , partly because these are the poorer , inferior varieties which will stand transportation and are picked green or partly ripe , for even the best tunas must ripen on the plant to be really good and sweet . Of all the cacti the most useful and important is the sahuaro or saguaro ( Cereus giganteus ) commonly known as the tree cactus or candelabra cactus ( Fig. 19 ) . Every one who has dwelt in or visited our southwestern states is familiar with these huge cacti , sometimes rising in a single great shaft , at other times with numerous branches , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical of the American desert as the coconut is typical of tropical isles , and to the Indians the sahuaro serves as many useful purposes and is as essential as is the palm to the natives dwelling in its shade . It is a most interesting plant , too , for its deeply-grooved or fluted trunk is a most remarkable device for retaining moisture by // opening like a bellows to absorb moisture during damp or rainy weather or closing to retain it between the flutings during dry weather . Yet despite this wise provision of Nature to enable the sahuaro to thrive on the most arid deserts , it seems little short of miraculous that the giant cacti can survive , or at least can propagate and spread . Birds , bats and climbing rats eat its fruits before they are ripe . Indians gather them by hundreds of thousands , and the few which ripen and fall are promptly consumed before the seeds can sprout . For that matter the seeds themselves are eaten by many birds and quadrupeds as well as by the Indians while woodpeckers riddle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material to prevent its sap from flowing from the wound , and in these cavities dwell hawks and owls , birds of many species , bats , and even bees who find these ready-made hives exactly suited to their needs . But once the seeds sprout and the plant begins to grow the sahuaro escapes the ruthless destruction of man because it is so useful and is such a blessing in a thirsty land that by the unwritten law of the desert it is never needlessly felled by Indians nor white men . It would go hard indeed with such desert tribes as the Pimas , Papagoes and Cocomas if there were no sahuaros , for the huge cacti supply them with food , drink and building material . Early in May the tops of // branches and trunks are covered with clusters of creamwhite flowers which , by the end of June or early in July develop into large fruits the size and shape of a hen 's egg . ( Fig. 20 shows flowers and fruits of sahuaro cactus ) . They are covered with a spiny skin but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , filled with numerous black seeds , is refreshing , slightly sweetish and nourishing . Although great numbers are eaten raw by the Indians the bulk of the fruits are used in making a thick excellent sirup superior to cane molasses . This is preserved in jars and a great deal of it is employed in making sahuaro wine or brandy by adding water and letting the mixture ferment . Although the fresh juice is most refreshing the potent " wine " is a most important item to the Indians and great quantities are consumed at the annual ceremonies connected with the sahuaro harvest which , among the Papagoes , marks their New Year and is also combined with rain-making ceremonies . According to the traditions of these Indians the deity known as " Elder Brother " created the sahuaro by beads of perspiration from his forehead . Then , making a jar , he placed the juice of the cactus within it , and as it fermented and became wine the rains began to fall . Hence at the annual gathering of the fruits the Indians believe that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall , thus at the same time commemorating the miracle of the first rains and honoring their traditional deity . The fruit , however , is not by any means the only or the most important product of the giant cactus . The seeds are carefully gathered , ground and eaten as meal . The tough woody framework or skeleton of the dead cacti // serve the Indians for timbers and rafters for their houses , for making fences , chicken-coops , chairs , household utensils and many other purposes , while finally the holes made by the woodpeckers and lined with the woody cactus fibres are dug out entire and are used as water-jars and drinking cups . Among the other cactus fruits which are noted for their edible qualities are the Mexican strawberry ( Fig. 21 ) ; the fruit of the hedgehog cactus or melon cactus of Mexico and our southwestern states ; and the strawberry pear ( Fig. 22 ) , which is the fruit of one of the Cereus Family of Mexico and the West Indies . In addition to being eaten raw or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cacti are dried like figs and are excellent when thus prepared . In some localities the Indians obtain a rich sweet sirup from the fruits of certain cacti , while the crushed and fermented fruits yield a heady , potent liquor . At times an unusual tropical fruit appears in some of the higher-priced fruit stores of New York , Boston and other large cities in the north . It is a most attractive arrd striking fruit , from a foot to even two feet in length and three inches or more in diameter , more or less like a cucumber in shape , but a vivid , rich crimson in color // ( Fig. 23 and Frontispiece ) . This is the sikana or cassabanana , also known as the curuba and pepino angolo , the fruit of a Peruvian vine which has often been erroneously attributed to the Orient , and is now widely cultivated in many parts of the Tropics . The appearance of the sikana is far more attractive than its strange , exotic flavor or the heavy , penetrating , almost foetid odor which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten raw , sliced , its principal use is for making aromatic beverages and a sort of jam or paste . Somewhat resembling the sikana in outward appearance and size , and also the fruit of a tropical vine , is the ceriman . The vine is common in many parts of the American Tropics and always attracts attention by its huge , calla-like leaves curiously perforated with irregular openings of various shapes and sizes as if accidentally cut or torn . The blossoms are much like the flowers of a gigantic calla-lily , or perhaps more like those of the Jack-in-the-pulpit , with the central spadix forming the fruit ( Fig. 24 shows the leaf , flower and fruit of this strange plant ) . The ceriman is a far more desirable fruit than the sikana and has a delicious but peculiar flavor resembling a blending of bananas and pineapples , // and makes wonderful ice cream . But great care must be taken that the fruit is fully ripe or slightly overripe , as in the green or unripe state it is somewhat poisonous . These ceriman fruits also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruit stores in New York City . Although so well provided with many luscious and de-sirable fruits which we seldom see in the North , yet the natives of tropical America can not equal us in the variety and excellence of their small fruits and berries . To be sure , they have numerous palm fruits which might be classed as berries , but aside from these there are few good small fruits . Probably the best of all the Tropical American tree-berries or " plums " is the red mombin , ciruelo or spanish plum as it is variously called . This is a widelycultivated tree in many parts of our Tropics , especially in Mexico and Central America . Although called the red mombin , the fruits of some varieties are clear yellow , while those of others are very deep crimson or maroon . They are fairly good-sized , an inch or two in length , and are very sugary and sweet , as well as juicy , with a slightFRUITS // ly acid tang something like that of a damson plum , although less pronounced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruits of Tropical America which we seldom see , but no list would be complete without mention of that most popular and widely-used fruit , the avocado , even if it can not properly be considered a " fruit we seldom see " , for it has become a very familiar fruit in the North ( Fig. 25 ) . Very probably many persons may feel that the avocado or aguacate , also known as alligator pear , calavo and midshipman 's butter , should be considered a vegetable rather than a fruit . Perhaps from an alimentary standpoint it should be classed among the vegetables , but if we class as fruits those eaten raw , and consider those cooked as vegetables , then the avocado is most assuredly a fruit , for it is seldom cooked . Just how it is eaten depends very largely upon individual preference . Some persons like it best scooped from the " shell " either plain or " doctored " with pepper , salt , vinegar and other condiments ; others prefer it combined with lettuce , celery , etc. , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the know " who have learned the trick from our southern neighbors , find the avocado at its best when added to soups . But irre168 FOODS AMERICA GAVE THE WORLD spective of how the fruit is served or eaten it is a most nutritious and desirable addition to our foods , and we have the ancient pre-Incan races of Peru , the Mayas of Yucatan and Guatemala and the Aztecs of Mexico to thank for having given us the splendid fruit , for all of these people cultivated the aguacate and had developed many fine varieties of the fruit centuries before the " discovery " of America by Columbus . Whether the pre-Incans , the Mayas or the Aztecs were the first to see the possibilities in the development of the aguacate will probably never be known , for the fruits are depicted on pottery and sculptures of all these immeasurably ancient races . ( Fig. 26 shows a pre-Incan double water jar in the form of aguacates , from a mound at Chan Chan , Peru . ) For that matter it is quite probable that all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same period , for there are many species of the genus , some native to Peru , others to Central America , others to Mexico and still others to northern South America . The ordinary everyday avocado or aguacate is the West Indian and Central American species , or the Mexican variety , although there are also hybrids of the two . In Guatemala there is the splendid species known as the coyo . Venezuela has a remarkable species with a peculiar " beak " . In Costa Rica there is a local species called yas and in Ecuador and Peru there is the giant , magnificent species sometimes weighing six to eight pounds each , known by the ancient Quechua ( Incan ) name , palta . Our own popular name , avocado , is a mongrel cognomen , perhaps derived from the Spanish aguacate , which was the Dons ' version of the Aztec ( Nahua ) name , ahuacatl , while the Mayas knew the fruit as on in Yucatan and as // o , j in Guatemala . In fact few fruits have had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another alias has been added to the list when the Californian growers com-bined the first syllable of their State with the word " avo-cado " and christened the fruits from California " Cala-vos ' . But it 's a case of the old , " what 's in a name " , and as long as we can eliminate the senseless and meaningless name " alligator pear " , bestowed upon it by some for-gotten person , it makes little difference what we call the fruit . Although in the North we are accustomed to seeing and using aguacates of almost uniform appearance , there is a tremendous variation in these fruits . Some species or varieties weigh only a few ounces and have shiny , jetblack rinds ; others are big , green or purplish , with rough , scaly or bark-like skins and may weigh four pounds or more each . Some are round , others ovate , still others are pear-shaped , while a few have long , curved " necks " much like those of a crook-neck squash ( Figs. 27 , 28 ) . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Florida or California , are picked too green and never possess the rich , delicate flavor or the fine , almost custardy , buttery consistency of // the fruits when used in their native lands . But in selecting an aguacate a little knowledge will be of great assistance in securing the best specimens . Never expect a really good fruit if it is unevenly ripened with hard spots in the otherwise soft surface . Never accept a fruit that is really " mushy " or that has large black or brown scars or blem ishes upon the surface , and always shake the fruit to determine if the large round seed rattles . If it does you may feel sure the fruit was not too green when picked and does not adhere to the flesh and cause bitter , discolored spots , whereas , if it does not rattle it is a sure sign that the fruit was picked too green or has internal faults . And if you wish a real treat , and have never tried it , follow the example of the inhabitants of the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of the fruit and add it to your dish of soup . Any description of the aguacate would be incomplete without mentioning the remarkable character of its flow ers , which are male or female by turn and last but a single day . Thus the flowers of an aguacate tree may serve as pistillate or female blossoms in the forenoon , and the very same flowers may function as staminate or male flowers the same afternoon , while another tree may have just the reverse , with the stamens active in the fore-noon and the pistils active during the afternoon . Truly , taken all in all , the aguacate is one of the most remarkable as well as one of the most valuable of all Tropical American food-plants , and as a final touch to its peculiarities its seeds contain an indelible ink which is used by the natives for dyeing , for marking their laundry work , and , in the case of some of the savage Indian tribes , for painting their faces and bodies to imitate tattooing. // The aguacate is one of the comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention by our horticulturalists , and by careful cultivation , hybridization and selection has been greatly improved in recent years , until today there is even a seedless variety . As a rule , very little effort has been made to improve the Tropical American fruits , and in many , in fact most , cases the best varieties of cultivated fruits of the American Tropics are those developed by the ancient races of Mexico , Central and South America , ages before the arrival of Europeans . Quite possibly many if not all of these " improved " fruits were the result of chance rather than of good management or design , for as soon as any wild , semi-wild or cultivated plant is intensively cultivated it develops new varieties ; not mere " sports " but distinct changes , due perhaps to new environment , soil or care , which may become fixed or constant . If the preIncans and other Indian races took advantage of this and promoted the best of these new varieties , they did far more than our modern horticulturists have done , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is no exaggeration to state that no new important food-plant has been really developed in modern times . As Dr. David Fairchild says : " We are only half-way in plant exploitation and discovery , when it comes to tropical food-plants , and especially the Tropical American fruits . " Our horticulturists and pomologists have been so wrapped up in developing new or better citrus fruits and ornamental plants that they have woefully neglected the possibilities of the multitude of food and fruit plants of the American Tropics , which present an almost untouched field for development and exploitation . CHAPTER XX NUTS FOR DESSERT " ALL the nuts that are fit to eat " and " If it 's a nut we have it " , are signs which we often see displayed on nut stores . But it would be no gamble to wager any amount that not a nut store in the United States could verify either statement . For that matter , they could not even claim , truthfully , to have all the American nuts that are fit to eat , while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to our nut stores . In fact the assortment of nuts which is to be found on sale here in the north is limited to a comparatively few well known and " standard " species , even if the display may seem almost bewildering in the variety of nuts . There will be the almonds , hard and paper-shelled , the big English or Grenoble walnuts , filberts and pecans , Brazil nuts and Italian or Japanese chestnuts , perhaps some smaller native chestnuts , hickory nuts , black walnuts , butter nuts and pistachio nuts , cashew nuts and peanuts , with sometimes the sweet little pinon nuts and hazel nuts or even beech nuts , and now and then the big paradise nuts . And although you may never have realized this , all but the almonds , the English walnuts , the filberts , the big Italian or Japanese chestnuts , and the pistachio nuts are American nuts . Probably no other 172 // countries in the world are so rich in native nuts as are North and South America , and probably no other race on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuratively speaking , as ourselves . Yet America 's store of fine , rich , nutritious and tasty nuts has hardly been touched , and you may look and look in vain through our nut stores without finding macaw nuts or juvia nuts , cream nuts or souri nuts and many others . However , even as it is , we have a wide range of nuts of various sizes , qualities and flavors , many of which are cultivated , while others are still gathered from the wild trees of our woodlands . Probably the most popular and best nut of our eastern forests is the common chestnut ( Plate IX , Fig. 1 ) . Rather , I should say it was the best and most popular nut , for during the past twenty-five years a disease or blight has almost completely destroyed all the large chestnut trees over practically all of our eastern states , and for the past few years the once abundant brown nuts in their prickly burrs have been as rare as the proverbial " hens ' teeth " . But there are hopes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sprung up from the roots of the dead trees appear to be immune to the blight and are beginning to bear a wealth of the tasty nuts . In western Massachusetts , during the past season , I found many of these young chestnut trees bearing , and bearing at an earlier age and even more abundantly than the big trees they had supplanted . One , which was scarcely eight feet in height had nearly a dozen big burrs , each containing two or three large perfect nuts . So , unless some unforeseen event transpires , future generations of youngsters may yet go chestnutting in the // golden autumn and garner pocketfuls and bagfuls of chestnuts from among the fallen brown leaves , and prick their fingers in their efforts to extract the nuts from the spiny green burrs before they have been opened by the first nipping frost . In our more southern and central states the chincapin or chinquapin takes the place of our chestnuts of the north . This is the nut of a dwarf chestnut with a much smaller nut , and usually with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chestnut Family is found in California where the nuts are erroneously known as chincapins . Far more abundant and widely distributed than our chestnuts are the various hickory nuts . Every country boy in New England is familiar with the pig nut , shag bark or shell bark trees within a dozen miles or more of his home , and impatiently awaits the frosty autumnal days when he can go nutting and garner the crop of hardshelled hickory nuts ( Plate IX , Fig. 2 ) , for while the size and quality of these nuts vary greatly , all are the fruits of the hickory trees , which strictly speaking , are not true walnuts although sometimes so classified . Although the great majority of the hickory nuts are small , with thick , intensely hard shells and a small quantity of poorly flavored often bitter meat , and belong in the class commonly called pig nuts , other trees bear fine large nuts with thin , easily-opened " rinds " and fairly thin shells filled with rich , well flavored meat which is most excellent for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut bread " . By selection and cultivation , the hickory nuts are greatly improved , and in time our farmers may awaken to the possibilities of developing a really desirable and // valuable variety of these nuts , just as the pecan nuts of our southwestern states have been developed and improved during the past few years . Speaking of the pecan ( Plate IX , Fig. 3 ) , how many persons know that this very popular nut is also a hickory ? It is true that there is little similarity between a paper-shelled pecan and an almost iron-hard " pig " hickory nut . But the nuts of the wild pecan hickory trees are little better than our pig nuts . The meat is very puckery , owing to the tannin in the thin partitions or membranes between the kernels , while the shells are so thick and hard that the Indians ' name for these nuts is pegan , meaning " bone shell " , which was corrupted by the white men to pecan . Today , the paper-shelled pecans are one of the finest of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in Florida , Georgia and in Texas where the trees grow to immense size . The best known of the true walnuts of North America are the butternut and the black walnut . Unfortunately for nut-lovers , the timber of the black walnut trees is so valuable that practically all the larger wild trees have been destroyed , and only here and there can one be found bearing the big roundish , fuzzy-surfaced sticky capsules each containing a thick-shelled curiously-sculptured or wrinkled nut ( Plate IX , Fig. 4 ) . When first gathered , the meat of the black walnut is very oily , and while edible is not very palatable , but after being kept and dried the flavor is greatly improved and much of the oil disappears . Even then they are far better when used in cakes , ice cream and confections than eaten raw as a nut . In some respects the butternut ( Plate IX , Fig. 5 ) is very similar to the black walnut . The rind or capsule // surrounding the nut is thinner , more elliptical and less fuzzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe , while the meat is much finer and richer in fla vor with a buttery rather than oily consistency . Like the black walnuts , the butternuts are used extensively in making cakes , nut-bread , ice cream , and especially in maple sugar candy . Unfortunately , they become rancid very soon . Among the most popular of imported nuts are the European filberts , but these are merely the nuts of a cul tivated species of hazel , and we have native hazel nuts ( Plate IX , Fig. 6 ) and filberts which are as fine or finer flavored than the European nuts , even if they are much smaller . Very frequently the hazels will fail to bear for several years in succession , the immature nuts withering or dropping off when barely formed , and then , for no apparent reason whatever there will be an enormous crop of the nuts . While there may be no connection between the two , it is an interesting fact that wherever the hazel nuts are found in abundance , a buckthorn tree is usually near at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land hazels produced a bumper crop of nuts in Massachu setts and elsewhere , although no nuts had been seen on the bushes for several years previously . I personally gathered more than a bushel of the nuts , and I noticed that if I found a buckthorn tree in the vicinity of the hazel bushes I could be sure of a lot of nuts , whereas in other lo calities , only a short distance away , where there were no thorn trees , there were few if any nuts . Possibly the hazel flowers may be pollinated by some insect which fre quents the buckthorn blossoms in the spring . Very frequently , among the ordinary hazels one will // find a bush bearing nuts which differ markedly from common hazel nuts . Instead of having broad " frilled " fruits growing in clusters , these bushes produce single elongated fruits with a constricted " neck " tipped with " ruffles " or fringe and containing a very large nut ( Plate IX , Fig. 7 ) . The surface of the fruit also differs from that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's skin , and if carelessly handled will produce an almost nettle-like sensation . Locally these are called " filberts " , and I have no doubt that by selection and cultivation they could be developed until even larger and finer than the genuine filberts of Europe . For that matter , I do not think that anyone has really attempted to cultivate and improve the ordinary hazel nuts or " cob-nuts " as they are called in England . As our hazel nuts are far superior to the filberts in flavor there would seem to be no reason why they should not be cultivated and improved to produce fine large nuts ( Plate IX , Fig. 8A , hazel nut ; Fig. 8B , filbert ) . When I was a youngster my favorite nuts were the beech nuts , and I never had any difficulty in gathering a half-peck or so of the little three-cornered , mahoganybrown , sweet and tasty nuts contained in the rough-coated pods or burrs of the beech trees of the New England woods ( Plate IX , Fig. 9 ) . But of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single beech tree bearing edible nuts . Although the trees blossom and the burrs or capsules form , the nuts grow to less than half their full size and are merely empty shells . No one seems to be able to explain why this should be the case , for the trees appear to be as healthy as ever . But as it is , beech nuts are practically a thing of the past , at least in New England . // Also , in my youthful days , we boys always knew of white oak trees with sweet edible acorns . Many of these were as sweet and delicately-flavored as any chestnuts , and were very popular , either eaten raw , boiled or roast-ed . But it 's a difficult matter to find edible white oak acorns today , probably because of the hybridization of the various oaks , or at least cross-pollination of the white oak and the others bearing bitter acorns . Even these are edible if properly prepared , however , and acorn meal and acorn cakes or bread formed a large part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as food by the In dians of our western states is the pine nut or pinon nut . These nuts are really the seeds of pine trees , especially the pinon pine . They are small , elongated , very rich sweet-flavored nuts and have become quite popular in the eastern states . Immense quantities of the pine nuts are annually gathered by the various Indian tribes , especially the Utes and Navajos , who use them in mak ing meal or flour which is cooked in the form of cakes or bread . As far as known the seeds of all pine trees are edible , but in the majority of cases they are far too small to be worth gathering . Probably the largest of all the pine-nuts are the seeds contained in the huge cones of the Araucanian pines of Chile . These are often more than an inch in length and are very fine-flavored with a sweet " nutty " delicate meat . From the American Tropics and from India we im port great quantities of the cashew nuts* ( Plate IX , Fig. 10A , natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , // which are the external seeds of a handsome edible fruit ( see Chapter XIX ) , and in Puerto Rico and Haiti , as well as in Cuba , there are species of walnut trees with fairly good nuts which might become of commercial importance if cultivated and improved . But the commonest , the most important and the most popular of all the tropical nuts are the big rough , brown , three-cornered Brazil nuts known also as " nigger toes " , " sheeps ' noses " and cassidines ( Plate IX , Fig. 11C ) . These are the nuts of several large forest trees abundant in the dense jungles of the Amazon Valley of Brazil , and also found in the Guianas , southern Venezuela and in eastern Ecuador and Peru . When growing on the tree the nuts are contained in large almost spherical or slightly pearshaped woody capsules , each filled with from eighteen to twenty-five nuts closely fitted together in regular tiers ( Plate IX , Fig. 11 ) . As one of these big fruits may weigh five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath one of the trees when the nuts are ripe and ready to fall . Such a missile , dropping for sixty or seventy feet or even less , is about as deadly as a cannon ball and will easily crush a man 's skull . It is said that a number of men are killed and many are seriously injured every year when gathering the nuts . In Brazil these nuts are called castanha or chestnuts , while the tree that bears them is known as the castanheiro . No one really knows how many kinds of nuts are to be found in the American Tropics , for there are vast areas of jungle and forest that are still almost wholly unexplored , and which have never been visited by botanists . Yet everywhere in the Amazon Valley , in the Guianas , in the forests about the head waters and the tributaries of // the Amazon and Orinoco , in Venezuela , Colombia , eastern Ecuador , Peru and Bolivia there are innumerable species of forest trees bearing edible nuts which are known only to the Indians and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are members of the Brazil nut genus or Bertholletia but still finer and larger than these are the cream nuts , Paradise nuts ( Plate IX , Fig. 12 ) and the sowri or more properly souri nuts . Occasionally the higher-priced nut stores of our cities display limited stocks of the Paradise nuts although quite frequently these may be a mixture of the true Paradise nuts and the even superior cream nuts of the same genus , while at other times a chance lot of souri nuts may be sold as " Paradise nuts " , for to the trade any large South American nut is a " Paradise nut " , as a general rule . Like the Brazil nuts , the cream nuts and true Paradise nuts are the seeds of immense forest trees , and like them are contained in huge woody capsules which are called " monkey-pots " in Guiana . The nuts are somewhat similar to Brazil nuts in appearance , but are larger , more slender and curved and have smoother , much lightercolored shells even thicker than those of the Brazil nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar Brazil nut , with a more creamy or " buttery " consistency , and with a tendency to become rancid in a very short time . Even larger than these Paradise nuts , several times the size of Brazil nuts , and the largest of all American nuts ( not counting the coconuts ) are the magnificent sowri or souri nuts ( Plate IX , Fig. 13 ) of the Guianas and the Orinoco district . There are a number of species of the souris known as // caryocar , butter-nut , saguaro , suearro , etc. , but the nuts are all much alike with exceedingly hard almost smooth shells of light brown or ochreous color and tender slightly oily very rich meat with a distinctive chestnutty flavor . Like the Brazil and Paradise nuts , the souris are contained in immense spherical woody capsules often weighing twenty-five pounds each , and when resting on the ground under the trees they resemble rusty iron cannon balls more than the fruits of a forest tree . It may seem strange that such splendid nuts should not be imported in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are several reasons why the souri , the Paradise and the other fine , superior nuts of South America have not become as common and as abundant as the Brazil nuts . In the first place , there are no large " stands " of these nut-trees as there are of the Brazil nuts . The trees grow here and there , scattered along the banks of the rivers or in the heart of the jungle , and one may often travel through the forest or on the streams for days without seeing a nut tree , while at other times , in other districts they may be abundant . Moreover , they do not bear uniformly . One tree may be loaded with the great spherical nut containers , while others in the neighborhood may be bare of fruit . As a rule , too , they are found in the most remote and inaccessible districts , above the rapids and the cataracts , where transportation is a dangerous , costly and serious problem . Although I have often been in areas where a large canoe could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have also travelled for weeks without seeing a single souri tree with enough nuts to fill a bushel basket . // As a result of all this , there can be no steady , regular supply of these nuts to be depended upon . One year the supply might far exceed the demand , while another year there might be no nuts available . And even those that were collected would of necessity be so high-priced as to be almost prohibitive . So until some one cultivates large " stands " of these tropical nut trees and produces them on a commercial basis , they will remain merely rarities or curios here in the north , and we will have to be satisfied with the old favorite Brazil nuts , which after all are mighty fine nuts . CHAPTER XXI STRANGE FOODS OF STRANGE PEOPLE THERE is a very old saying that " what 's one man 's meat is another man 's poison . " Perhaps this is not literally true , but nevertheless , many races or nations eat and enjoy certain articles which others consider wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raccoons and opossoms are prized as delicacies and are widely eaten , yet prairie-dogs and woodchucks are almost unknown as food , although there is no tastier , tenderer or better game than a good fat woodchuck . In Peru and other portions of South America the Guinea pigs are very important food-animals and are for sale in all the markets , yet here in the north no one thinks of eating these animals , although we raise hares and rabbits for the table , and despite the fact that Guinea pigs have been domesticatd and bred for food for thousands of years in Peru . In fact they were known to the pre-Incan and Incan races who considered them one of the best of foods , and have been domesticated for so long that no one knows the original wild animal from which they have descended . In our southern states , especially in Virginia and Louisiana , muskrats are deemed a great delicacy and are sold by thousands in the markets of New Orleans , Richmond , Washington and other cities under the name of " marsh rabbits " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a few woodsmen and trappers , ever think of eating a musk-183 // rat . Skunks , too , are excellent eating and are far superior to the popular gray squirrels in this respect . Most people like clams , oysters and scallops , yet in the United States the mussels , winkles , fresh-water clams , whelks and snails have never become popular although in great demand in Europe . Nowadays civilized nations are so closely linked , and transportation and refrigeration have been so highly perfected , that a large proportion of the foods consumed is more or less the same the world over . Moreover , in nearly every large city and town , there are foreign restaurants where natives of distant lands may dine on the foods typical of their own country and race . Although many of the foods which tickle the palates of people of other lands are far too odorous or repulsive for civilized man to appreciate , there are others which are truly delicious , once we can overcome our prejudices in order to sample them . This is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white person would have been disgusted at the mere idea of eating snake meat , yet today canned Florida rattlesnake is a popular and fashionable dish and is served in the most exclusive and highestpriced restaurants and hotels in New York and elsewhere . There are many other snakes just as palatable as the " rattlers " , however , among these being the common North American black snakes or chicken snakes , bull snakes , gopher snakes and pine snakes while the boas and anacondas of Tropical America are far superior to the rattlesnakes when properly cooked . Alligators ' tails are another excellent food which is well known and duly appreciated by the natives of the Tropics as well as by foreigners " in the know " , yet no one has yet placed // canned alligators ' tails on the market . In the north , frogs ' legs are considered a real delicacy , although the entire frog is not eaten , while in some of the West Indies the huge land-frogs or crapauds are used whole . Many North Americans who have learned to eat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on lizards , yet the big iguanas of Tropical America are as tender and delicate and fine-flavored as any chicken , and are a popular food , as are their eggs , in many localities . After all why should n't a lizard or a snake be just as ood to eat as a terrapin or a sea-turtle ? And speaking of turtles , while epicures pay exorbitant prices for terrapin , comparatively few persons appreciate the fact that the big , savage snapping turtles of our ponds and lakes are just as good if not better than the " diamond backs " . The North American Indians ate and still eat many things which seem strange , repulsive or even nauseating to white people , yet many of these foods of the Indians are highly nutritious and when properly prepared are tasty and delicate . Among the Indians of our west , grasshoppers and crickets were important sources of food , and when dried and ground and made into crisp cakes they are truly delicious . In the West Indies the natives , as well as many white people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pith of palm trees . The gru-gru worms as they are called are the larvw of a big weevil ( Fig 1 ) . When spitted on a sliver of palm and toasted over hot coals , they swell up and pop open like roasted chestnuts which they much resemble in flavor and consistency . In Mexico no wedding feast is considered complete without a dish of the honey-ants ( Fig. 2 ) , while the egg-masses of an aquatic beetle are considered // a real delicacy and are gathered and marketed in vast quantities . In Guiana and Brazil the Indians are very fond of the big queens of the umbrella ants . Many a time when I have been in the jungles , my Indian carriers have thrown down their loads as they discovered an ants ' nest with the insects swarming about their winged queens . Utterly heedless of the bites of the vicious warrior-ants , and with blood streaming down their legs from the punc tures made by the insects ' jaws , the men would scramble over the nest , gathering the queens by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians would retire to a safe distance and squatting down would munch the queens with as much enjoyment as children eating candy . The queens of these ants are over half an inch in length with bodies distended with eggs and have a rather sickishly sweet taste , more like condensed milk than anything else . Although I can not say that I like them myself , yet the Indians consider them a great treat . On one occasion while in the jungle I noticed the Indians gathering quantities of big , brown sphinx moth caterpillars which they roasted in the coals of their fire and devoured with great gusto . Curious to learn how the caterpillars tasted , I gathered a number and had my campboy drop them into boiling grease . They puffed up and browned and looked much like fritters and were delicious , tasting precisely like soft-shelled crabs . // We often hear of travelers in Tropical jungles being compelled to subsist upon monkeys . But we need not waste pity on men " forced " to this seeming extremity , for there is no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another popular dish in the American Tropics is the armadillo . Usually these animals are baked in their own shells and are far nicer than roast pig . We in the north , or at least many of us , are fond of caviar and fish roe , but in Barbados and others of the West Indies , the natives consider " sea eggs " by far the best of sea-foods . The " sea eggs " are a species of spiny sea urchin which at certain seasons are filled with roe . They are mushy , un appetising-looking things and , to me at least , they taste like sandy soup flavored with fish oil . While on the subject of fish , I wonder how many northerners have ever tried eating raw fish , which the South Sea Islanders consider far superior to cooked fish . Unless one can secure a perfectly fresh fish , just out of the water , I do not recommend trying it raw ; but a fresh ly-caught Spanish mackerel or pompano , or a kingfish or dolphin , is just as palatable raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hundred could tell whether the fish were raw or cooked if his eyes were closed when eat ing it ; that is , as far as the taste goes . But raw fish smells decidedly " fishy " , which to my mind is the only objection to it . Possibly many persons feel that to eat raw fish savors of savagery and is repulsive , but those same people will eat raw oysters and clams and thoroughly enjoy them . In the same way , moldy or even maggotty cheese is regarded as one of the choicest morsels by many of our epicures who would never think of eating palm grubs or caterpillars . // In fact what is good to eat and what is not is all a matter of habit , custom and taste , and until one has actually tried some of the strange , and often seemingly disgusting , viands of other lands and other races , it is impossible for one to state whether or not they are really tasty and good . But it is a great pity that we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite apart from those of vegetable origin , for if we could once acquire a taste for many of the tropical dainties in the form of insects , reptiles and marine animals , our menus would be far more varied and not only would we have a greater variety of foods , but much cheaper foods as well . CHAPTER XXII THE THANKSGIVING BIRD WHEN we gather each year to celebrate Thanksgiving and dine on roast turkey and all the " fixin 's " , we enjoy an almost all-American meal , for the pumpkin pies , the cranberry sauce , the potatoes and sweet potatoes , the vanilla in the cakes or ice cream , the tomatoes in the salad , the turkey itself and most of the nuts are all truly American foods . In fact it is quite possible and simple to serve a Thanksgiving feast that is wholly American , from soup to nuts . Oysters are natives of our waters , although found in other parts of the world , or we can be still more American and serve clams which are strictly New World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are a number of fish , such as swordfish , blue fish , lake whitefish , brook trout , tautog or blackfish , tile-fish and scup which are found only in American streams , lakes or seas . Green peppers , potatoes , squash and sweet potatoes , Lima beans , tomatoes , string beans and maize afford an abundance of vegetables native to our own land . If we wish , we may even substitute butter made from palm oil for that made from cream , and we may use maize or palm oil for frying . Peanut oil will serve as well as olive oil for the salad of avocado and tomatoes , and corn bread or corn muffins will do as well or better than bread made from wheat flour , while for sweetening there are various maize sugars such as " Dyno " , or even maple sugar . As 189 // a beverage we have cocoa , and there is a wide variety of strictly American desserts . Tapioca puddings , strawberries , pumpkin pies , corn starch blancmange or puddings , various fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brazil nuts ? surely enough to satisfy anyone . And of course there is the turkey ? the real Thanksgiving bird with the equally American cranberry sauce ( Fig. 1 , low bush cranberry ) . But how about the eggs and the seasonings ? you may ask . Salt of course is essential , but salt from American deposits or from the West Indies is the equal of any , while paprika or red pepper , pimento and bay leaves are all American . And why should n't we use turkey eggs or the eggs of Muscovy ducks instead of hens ' eggs ? In fact we could live very well indeed and could have a great variety of meals made up wholly of American foods if we were all vegetarians . But if we depended upon animal food of true American origin I 'm afraid our meals would become very monotonous , for aside from the native wild creatures or " game " and certain fish and sea-foods , the turkey and the Muscovy ducks are about the only American " meat-foods " available . It does seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cultivated and developed such a vast // array of vegetables , fruits , and food-plants but should have been so lacking in domesticated animals . But the aborigines of America were agriculturalists and hunters and had an abundance of wild animals and game to draw upon for their meat , and hence had no real necessity for domesticating birds or quadrupeds . Moreover , there were comparatively few wild creatures adapted to domestication , and as long as there was an abundance of sea-food in the waters and along the shore , and wild fowl by countless millions , and big game could be had for the asking , or rather for the hunting , why bother about taming and confining the creatures ? In North America this was particularly the case , and aside from their dogs , which to the Indians were good " meat " , the aborigines had no domestic creatures . In Mexico , there were the strange hairless dogs , which were bred mainly for edible purposes , the pheasant-like chachalacas , and the turkey , as well as Muscovy ducks , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scarcely in the category of food-animals , as well as the Guinea pig , the Muscovy ducks and the socalled Inca dog , which was used for food as well as being a favorite pet of the Indians . Most of these domesticated creatures of the American races differed very slightly from the wild species , but the Guinea pigs , the Incan and Mexican dogs , the llamas and alpacas had been domesticated for so many centuries that their original " wild " ancestors are unknown . It is supposed that the llamas and alpacas are the domesticated descendants of the wild guanacos or vicunas , or perhaps hybrids . But there is a vast difference between either of these wild South American camels and the llamas and // alpacas ; a far greater difference in fact , than between domestic cattle and the wild cattle of Europe or the domestic horse and any of the various wild horses of Asia or Africa . Moreover , skeletons of llamas having five toes ( as contrasted with the two toes of the species today ) have been found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-toed llamas were not " freaks " is proved by the number of skeletons found assoicated with the mummies , and by the fact that numerous pottery vessels taken from the tombs and graves represent llamas with five toes . As the Parakas people were one of the most highly cultured of pre-Incan races and reached a high state of civilization ages before the Incan Empire was established , we can only assume that in their day the llamas had not been so long domesticated that they had lost three of their toes , as is the case with the present-day animals , yet even then they were totally distinct from any existing wild species . Neither do we know the ancestors of the Incan dogs , the Mexican hairless dogs or the Guinea pigs . Although the silken-haired , sharp-nosed , bushy-tailed , short-legged , docile and attractive Incan dogs are quite fox-like in many ways , they differ as greatly from any living wild foxes as the llamas and alpacas differ from the wild vicunas and guanacos . Even more baffling is the origin of the little Guinea pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared these domesticated creatures as a source of food , for their flesh is one of the finest and most delicate of all meats despite the fact that they have never found a place on our menus , yet no one has even been able to definitely identify the original wild species of cavy from which the Guinea pigs were developed . Perhaps the wild ancestors // have completely vanished from the world , or possibly the domesticated " cavies " differ so greatly from their ances tral species that there seems no connection between the two . The origin of their common name has been almost as much a puzzle as the origin of the little rodents them-selves . One explanation is that the first of the animals brought to England came in on a " Guineaman " or slave-ship which had been trading between the coast of Guinea in Africa and the West Indies and hence it was assumed that the " pigs " came from Guinea . But this is a very far-fetched theory and it is not at all necessary , for there can be little doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cor ruption of " Cuyini " the Quechua ( Inean ) name for the animals , and has no connection with the African terri tory . There is no question as to the ancestor of the domesti cated turkeys , however . Although many persons think they are the descendants of the wild turkeys of the Unit ed States , this is not the case , for the " tame " or domesti cated turkeys are derived from the Mexican or " bronzed " turkeys , and were thoroughly domesticated by the Aztecs and other Mexican and Central American races long before the arrival of Europeans . In fact no one has ever succeeded in really domesticating our native wild turk eys , although they have been crossed with the Mexican species . Even at the time when Cortez conquered Mexico , the Aztecs had developed a number of varieties of their domestic turkeys , and had white , gray , buff and other " breeds " familiar to us today . Like the potato , the Guinea pig and various other products of America , the Thanksgiving bird was fated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have borne , // and despite his American origin he has become universally recognized as the " turkey " , although just why he was so christened is not definitely known . Perhaps it was because his red wattles hanging over his face resembled somewhat a tasselled Turkish fez , or it may have been because the English erroneously thought the birds came from Turkey . But as the earliest British voyagers and explorers to reach America were familiar with wild turkeys , and as it was well known that the domesticated birds introduced into England came from America , this explanation of the origin of the name is n't very logical . As the Spaniards know the bird as the pavo there can be no connection between the English and the Spanish name , and it is probable that the common name was bestowed upon the bird because of its clucking note ? " turk , turk , turk , " when excited or disturbed . In fact , in some of the old documents and accounts of the settlement of Virginia , the birds are referred to as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was bestowed upon the splendid American bird he will always remain the turkey and will ever be associated with our Thanksgiving Day feasts , which is most appropriate , for Thanksgiving is a truly American celebration , borrowed from the Indians who every autumn feasted and gave thanks to the good spirits and their gods for the crops of maize , pumpkins , squashes and beans and berries , and abundant game . Although America can boast of few native domestic animals used as food , there are a number of edible wild animals peculiar to the New World . Among these are vicunas and guanacos of the Andean regions of South America , the big cabybaras , the tapir , the prong-horned // antelope , the big-horned sheep and mountain goat , the bison and elk , the moose and caribou the woodchuck and muskrat and many others . A number of these , such as the bison , elk , moose , big-horn sheep and our native deer , are closely related to very similar species found in the Old World , while opossoms are not confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaya . But there are others , such as the raccoon , the prong-horn and the muskrat which are found only in the New World . Yet of all our native quadrupeds and birds , only the turkey is of wideworld importance and is prized for its delicate flesh by men and women of nearly every race and land . Surely it is a great pity that our ancestors did not select the turkey rather than the thieving , carrion-eating baldeagle for our national emblem . How much more fitting , as well as attractive , would be the figure of a strutting " gobbler " with outspread tail depicted upon our coins !
