No sooner had U. S. troops dug in on the Western Front in World War I than they started a newspaper . The Stars &; Stripes made fun of lice and mud , pricked the vanity of many a martinet , nurtured young journalists like Alexander Woollcott , Columnist Franklin Pierce Adams , who were later to bloom luxuriantly in Manhattan 's literary gardens . <P> Last week Nazi efficiency , aping U. S. individualism , had established not one but ten newspapers for German soldiers fighting World War II . Some were published at the front , others in Berlin and Breslau for front-line distribution . All were strictly edited by agents of the Ministry for Propaganda ; they gave news of the war but featured drawings and articles by soldiers , concentrated on entertainment . <P> Biggest is the Wacht im Westen , which resembles the Frankfurter Zeitung ; smallest the Armee-Kurznachrichten , a single half-size sheet of Army notices . The Air Force has its own paper , Der Adler von Friesland ( The Frisian Eagle ) .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
