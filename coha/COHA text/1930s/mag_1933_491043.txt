T HOUGH. the European holds many differing viewpoints from the American , there is one thing that he frankly admires , and that is American machinery . It always works . If it does n't , remedial action is prompt and cheerful . The sale of ice chests , mowing machines , typewriters and automobiles in Europe would be child 's play , but for the excessive duties imposed . Nevertheless , the commerce is active , and the Americans who captain the far-dung battle line of American trade are as much admired by the natives as the goods they sell . In Biarritz , which is a sort of Palm Beach close to the Spanish frontier , a man named Judson Curry represented a great American firm that specialized in refrigerators and radios . Re had done well ; particularly among the many Spanish residents , for he could sell them goods delivered in Spain , where the duty was low , and they could then bring them into France as household goods free . Since the revolution , however , things had not gone so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had boosted duties to the skies , and had taken certain internal measures that sound well in speeches , but that had had the immediate result of making the rich poor and the poor destitute . Mr. Curry 's office , to economize on space , was part of his showroom . As he sat one morning reading his mail and wondering what new rabbit the latest ministry would pull out of the hat , he saw approach , to his intense surprise , two Spanish gentlemen whom he knew very well  --  Diego Contreras and Alipio Perez . What surprised him was that it was but ten o'clock in the morning , and he had never seen either of these young men abroad before noon before . " Well , well , " greeted Curry . " Qug tat ? What are you doing up this early in the morning ? Must be something unusual to get you two out of bed at this hour ! Sit down and take a load off your feet . What will you smoke  --  a cigar , cigarettes ? " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brother-in-law , Diego , and I are up early  --  that is to say , we have not gone to bed at all . We have been up all night . Talking . Discussing . And the result of our talk was that we must come down to see you . " " Well , well , " said Curry , somewhat mystified . " Must be something serious here . Let 's hear about it . Speak in Spanish if you want to , so that Diego can follow us . " " Pues , senor , " began Alipio in Spanish . " It begins with the revolution . We were not prepared for it . We never dreamed of it . Then , suddenly , we have it . Now , when the present government was a revolutionary committee , they promised that if Spain ever had a republic , all the money of the rich would be distributed to the poor . Also that everyone who had supported the dictator would be executed . The result was that when the change came in the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They took what money they had with them , and made arrangements to draw out the rest . You follow me ? If everyone in Spain who had any money took it to France , there wouldn't. be any left in Spain . So what do they do ? The government passes a decree that no one can take any more money out of Spain . This serves a twofold purpose , you see . It prevents exportation of capital , and it forces those who would otherwise flee the country to remain . " " Why ca n't you go back to Spain ? " asked Curry . " Well , we both have leases on our houses here . Assuming we went back , where would we go ? But I will tell you the main reason , Both Diego and I held office under the dictator . The first thing the republicans would do would be to slap us into jail . The next thing they would do would be to shoot us . " " But meanwhile , " said Diego , " how are we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand now , Senior Curry , why we sat up all night discussing . " " I can , yes . " agreed Curry . A feeling of apprehension began to grow on him . Either these two men were going to ask him for a job , or for a loan , neither one of which he was in a position to give . Yet they had not only been good customers but good friends . " The discussion ended , " resumed Alipio , " with the decision that we should promote a bullfight . " " A bullfight ? " gasped Curry . " Why a bullfight ? " " It is the season now . But the real reason is that we can buy the bulls and contract with the matadors in Spain , where we have all the money we need . We then bring them all into France and make a profit on them . " " You 're going to have this fight in France ! Alipio , I do n't know . I 'd look into it pretty carefully . Where are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . In B6ziers . The people in that part of France are much more aficionado than they are here . It will be simple , you know . We just hire the aren , a , get the agency to sell our tickets for us , the people from whom we buy the bulls deliver them to the ring , the matadors come themselves , the people go to the fight , and we collect our money . " " Lim-m-m , " said Curry , " but I should imagine there would be certain slips between the cup and the Lip . " " Very true , " agreed Alipio : " and that is the reason we have come to you . We want you to run it for us . " While the conversation had been going on , Curry had thought of what he would say if he were asked for a loan , and also what he would say if they requested employment . But the request that he should manage a bullfight for them took him completely off guard . Ho refused , flatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls , let alone how a corriria was managed , and he had no desire to learn . He had his own business , that took all his time . Moreover , Alipio had just said that a wrrida ran itself , so why did they need a manager ? " Well , " said Alipio , " there is first the renting of the arena . Then the fixing of the price of seats . Then the printing of the programs , and that sort of thing . It requires someone with a knowledge of business , which we have not . " " But those things will have to be done in France ! " said Curry . " How can you finance this end of the affair if you have n't any money ? " " We will take all the money we happen to have in the bank . We will pawn some of our wives ' jewelry . It will take every penny we can raise , but it will be sufficient . " " You 're taking an awful chance , " remarked Curry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's why we came to you said the two Spaniards together . " And if you refuse to help us , we are indeed lost ! " " But I haven't. got the time ! " protested Curry . " I really have n't ! " " Well , " said Alipio , " will you do this one thing for us ? We ca n't go to Spain . We 'd be put in jail if we did . Will you have your agent in Seville buy the bulls for us ? Can you do that much ? With our money , of course . Say you will do that much for old friends . " " I 'll be glad to do anything I can to help you , " said Curry , " but ourman in Seville does n't know any mere about hulls than I do . How do you buy them ? Where do you go ? " " Why , it 's very simple . He goes out to the ranch and says that he wants six bulls for such a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pasture and he gets into a little stone fort , and they drive the bulls by , and he picks out the ones he wants . " " Then why ca n't you get anyone to do it ? " asked Curry . " Because , " said Alipio , " there is always the question of price . And no one we know could debate that as well as you or as your agent in Seville . " " Well , " said Curry after a long period of thought , " write him , anyway . see what he says . Now , how much had you in mind to pay for these bulls ? " The two Spaniards looked at each other a little dubiously . " I do n't know , " said Alipio finally , " anything about the price of bulls , but let him get them as cheaply as possible .

Bdziers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by poets since the days of the Romans , a city that is set on a hill , is proud of the old saying of travelers , " At Baziers , one enters Spain . " Here , upon a Sunday , Alipio Perez and Judson Curry descended from a fiacre at the outskirts of the city and took their way across the square toward the bull ring . It was just before noon , and the streets were deserted . The two men paused before a huge poster that decorated a blank wall , a poster that represented a beautiful Spanish lady with a rose in her hair and another between her teeth , watching a young man doing something with a cape . Beneath ran the legend , " Sunday , June 12 . Six beautiful hulls of the celebrated Spanish gee aderia of Santa Coloma , for the applauded matador 's , Eseudero . Nino del Real , and Magritas . Direction Judson Curry . " " I see they put your name on the poster after all , " smiled Alipio . " Well , in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Curry . " It was like everything else . I agreed to have my agent buy the hulls for you , and then I agreed to do something else , and then something else , until it became apparent that I might as well go into this thing completely and run it . Well , I arranged the deal for the advertising and they put my name on the posters . It was too late to take it off , and anyway , what harm does it do ? I 'm going to send one or two to America . The boys would get a great laugh out of them . " " The prices are very reasonable , " remarked Alipio . " Seg urn 1 " agreed Curry . " We cut them down , you see , to get attendance . Why , this is the most inexpensive bullfight I hey 've ever had here ! And to see hulls of Santa Coloma , one of the best breed in Spain ! Bulls intended for the Fiesta of San Jose at Alicante ! What luck we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for just about their price for beef ! " " The agent did n't say how they happened to be ordered for Alicante and never delivered ? " " Oh , no . I did n't ask , " said Curry . " He simply said he had this lot of bulls that had been sold , and half the price paid down , but they had never been delivered . Uncalled-for merchandise , you see . Fifty per cent discount ! " " Ah . And have you seen them ? " " Oh , yes . They 're all in tine shape . A little solemn-looking . They look like bulls I used to see at the county fair when I was younger , only they have longer horns . " " Let us hurry on , " said Alipio . " I am eager to see them myself . Tell me , where are the cajones ? " " I had them locked up in the stable as soon as the bulls had been taken out of them , as you requested . I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more about it than I do . Curious-looking things , are n't they ? Would you like to see them ? " " I would , yes , " replied Alipio . They turned into the courtyard behind the arena . On one side was the hospital and chapel , and on the other a stable and a place where the butchers cut up the bulls as they came out of the ring . Curry , taking a ponderous key out of his pocket. , unlocked the doorand they went in . Against the far wall was a row of great wooden boxes , like piano boxes on tiny wheels , called cajone$ . In these boxes the bulls are shipped from the ranch . Directly he saw them , Alipio 's tired , careworn manner disappeared . He crossed the stable floor nimbly , opened a little door in the side of the first en-:Ian and peeked in . " I like the smell of them , " smiled Alipio , turning around . " It reminds me of Andalusia . These cajones are very valuable , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ranch . You must be very careful of them ! " " I will , " said Curry , " do n't worry . There must be three or four hundred dollars ' worth of merchandise there . " " Efectivamenie " agreed Alipio heartily . " Let 's go now , and see what came in them ! " They climbed a narrow stairway and came out on the gallery that surrounds the corrals . Curry took his friend to the railing and showed him below , placidly chewing their cud , two dusty-looking bulls , two of the half dozen thatwere spread about in the honeycomb of corrals below them . Alipio 's eyes grew round , He leaned over the rail and , resting his elbows thereon , ( Continued on Page 59 ) All batteries may look alike on a dealer 's shelf .

The shadowed front of a building at the farther limit of my vision is a rich backdrop for the scene , a deep blue that is almost purple . Caught and fixed on canvas , woven perhaps into the fabric of a fine tapestry , the colors here would enchant even the normal eye . But perhaps they are not here at all . Perhaps it is only that I am color blind . The normal eye sees colors as they are , no doubt . I sat down again to think the matter out . For the first time in many years I felt that I was baffled  --  not completely baffled , of course , but moderately so . I lit my pipe and tried to consider the few clues that I had . Usually , these problems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate . In the first place , I reflected , my caller is a woman . That seemed fairly obvious from her voice . I remembered , too , that she had spoken without an accent , which placed her definitely as a native-born American . The call had come from a local station ; that was evident , because the operator always asks you to wait while putting through a long-distance call . I filled another pipe and surveyed my data with considerable satisfaction . I had limited the field enormously . The person I was looking for was a woman , native horn , living in the city . I was getting close to a solution ! At this point I must digress a bit to tell about the Mudington pearls . You will recall the great sensation a few years ago when old Colonel Mudington , the traction magnate , startled local society by eloping with his young secretary . She was about twenty years old at the time , and , according to the pictures that appeared in newspapers , extremely beautiful . Her name was Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , it was a name that sounded like that ; I ca n't recall now , but I have the records in my files . Mudington 's two married daughters were exceedingly indignant and threatened to have the old man committed as an incompetent . I came into the case in this way : I had just returned from Bolivia , where I had spent several months solving the Bolivian Bond Mystery that had baffled the police of four continents . I was pretty well fagged out , as you can readily believe , and I was planning to run off to the mountains for a week or two of fishing . There was a little inn up in the Catskills in a secluded spot in the heart of the mountains . The inn was run by a man named Kelly , whom I had once befriended . Kelly was a queer chap . He had been a gold prospector in the Klondike , a barnstorming aviator in the early days of flying , a cowboy , and at one time a bartender in a saloon in Greenwich Village in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend his remaining days in this little inn of his in the Catskills .

If a thing seen must be believed , then there may he things it is better not to see . If a cloud is dull and gray and somber , it is as well not to see it at all . If it must be seen , then there are compensations in being able to discover , reflected in that cloud or filtered through it , all the bright radiance of the sky . I have , by inquiry and comparison , long since convinced myself that the normal eye sees less and more than I do ; and I prefer to be , as the phrase goes , color blind .

I was desperately tired , and in a moment I had fallen off into a deep slumber . These recollections flashed through my mind as 1 sat puffing on my pipe and trying to fathom the mystery of the strange telephone call . What was the connection between old Mudington and his young bride , Kelly , the taciturn innkeeper , and my mysterious telephone caller ? Could it be that the voice at the other end of the wire was I was so deep in reverie that my telephone rang twice before I actually heard it . I picked up the receiver . " Mr. Deane ? " It was the same voice . This time . I vowed , I would discover the identity of my mysterious caller . Not for nothing have I been called The King of Detectives . " This is Mr. Deane , " I answered steadily . - " We were cut off , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of penetration . " Yes , " I replied . " I 'm sorry to bother you , " she said , " but my bathroom pipes are leaking . " " I beg your pardon ? " I exclaimed . " Is n't this Elmer Deane ? " she asked .

" " I 'll start the asking , if you 'll let me . Why were you suddenly so furious with me last night ? " " Must 1 tell ? " " Not if you do n't want to . " She was silent for a moment . Martin looked at the shore line with its varying green of pine lanced with white birches above a silver rim of breaking ripples as they collapsed on the sand or were shattered by glistening , spray-dampened rocks . What a heavenly spot : what a heavenly day Was n't she sweet ? More than beauty , a sort of aura . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young womanhood that pressed against his side and beat through him as the small waves he was watching beat against the shore . " I think I 'll tell , " she said at last . I think I must if I 'm to be myself . And I 'm going to be that with you . " She seized his hand suddenly , feverishly . " I swear it  --  I mean really , Mar-Martin . " She turned and looked up into his face . Do n't kiss her . Do n't ! Do n't ! Do n't ! " All right , my dear , " he said evenly ; " go ahead . " " I went out with you last night thinking it would only be for a minute , and because  --  well , because it was simply suffocating to be picked out that way and  --  and attract so much attention . . Boy , this is hard ! " He tightened the fingers that were entwined with hers reassuringly . " Then , on the steps , something happened to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer . You seemed  --  this sounds nutty  --  you seemed like a god . You do n't understand , do you , Martin  --  not even you ? " " You precious thing , " said Martin . " Well , when you asked me to go out in the canoe , I came to for a minute , until you said you would stay as long as I needed you , and then it got me again and 1 did n't give a damn about anything ; I just wanted to be with you . Now comes the really hard part . " " It . should n't he hard to tell me anything , " said Martin . " Yes , that 's queer too . It is n't really ; it 's just that I 'm not used to it , if you know what I mean . " Martin nodded . " When I went with you I thought I was crazy about Hugo . He is marvelous , do n't you think ? " " Yes , " said Martin , " I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of older people are wild to have him try for the Olympics  --  swimming , you know . They 've been alter me to  --  well , sort of use my influence with him to make hitu train . Womanly wiles  --  that sort of thing . As though I had any . ' ' She laughed derisively . The laugh abruptly died . " Oh , I don't. mean that , Martin ; I 've got . a lot . I never hull anything else until now . I suppose I 'll be making slips like that all the time  --  at first . But you 'll understand , wo n't you , dar  --  M artin ? " Again she looked up at kiln . " If you kiss her , you should be shot ! " was Martin 's thought . " Well , when you began to talk about what I could do for lingo , 1 thought . they had got . you to do it . I thought . you had pretended to pick me out and then handed me a line . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me positively sick . I was wild at myself , not you , for being so dumb . I simply took it out on you . I was crushed . You 'll never know how horribly cheap I felt , until you showed me I was wrong . " " How did I do that ? " asked Martin uneasily . " Why , by  --  oh , you know  --  what you did there on the beach . I went , home simply blissful because , of course . a person like you would n't do that it ' I had n't meant . something to him , would he , Martin ? " " You mean that I kissed you ? " " Yes , Martin . " He had asked the question to give himself a moment more to decide how best to retreat .

I 've been kissed  --  well , lots , but there 's a difference in how you do it . I 've never really kissed anyone until last night . Did n't you somehow know that , Martin ?

Tears that had changed the crystalline blue of her eyes to soft wet flowers had already made a thin wet track down the peaehblew of her cheeks . It was not the tears , however , that moved him most . He had grown a bit cynical , as the years had passed , toward women 's tears . It was the inexpressibly touching quiver of her chin that made him feel so utterly despicable , that gave his heart a. sudden wrench . " Oh , my dear , " he said . " Please do n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember afterward just how she got into his arms . She was there , at any rate ; for the purpose , apparently , of soaking the front of his coat with amazingly large tears . She said , " I 'll st-stop as soon as I can , Mis-Mister Braithwaite . " There seemed nothing to do but hold her and wait . He dared not look down at her chin . The pathos of that sob-stricken " Mister " had all but undone him . And he had thought that morning , in a dim way , that he could go ahead with this . That he could have a delightful , not too intense , week or so with her and hand her back to a  --  by then impatient  --  Hugo . No one was to be hurt .

" " Of course , anything , ' ' said Martin . " But first let me try to tell you how sorry I am ? " She interrupted impatiently . " Oh , please  --  never mind that . I just fell for a line . I never thought I would . I must have , if you say so , but ? " She broke off . He saw a small , quick frown appear and depart as she stared at him . " Why did you come to this cove this morning ?

" Her face grew blank , the chin threatened to quiver . She controlled it . " And you did n't even remember giving it to me ? " " Gave it to you ? So I did ! How stupid ! " Her hand went to a pocket in her skirt . " Here it is . " Before he could take the offered lighter , she withdrew it .

" " Well , then you 'd stay if 1 needed you , oh , just terribly ? " " I 'm afraid ? " Martin began , and thought , as she interrupted him , " Well . there 's the truth , at any rate . " " Wait . " she was entreating . " Please wait till you hear . " " Of course . What is it ? " She sank back , dropped her head on his shoulder , sat up suddenly . " Oh , my ! I should n't do that now But if I know it does n't mean a thing and you 'll let me . I think I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , yes ! " " Thanks a lot , " she said humbly . He felt her settle against him with a comfort seeking wriggle . " You said last , night . I was wasted , Then , afterward , you told me what you meant . I 'd be that way until I cared more for some man than myself , you said . When I got home I thought it over , and it seems perfectly silly , if you ask me . Do n't you see why ? A person has to find the man first , does n't she ? " " No denying that . " " Well , then , what could I have done before last night ? I was bound to be wasted , was n't I , Martin ? " He failed to reply . The " before last night " had robbed him of speech .

At her whisper , the two arms tightened for an instant . Braithwaite felt his heart pause , leap and race madly . He looked down at the nestling head above his pounding heart . He found her smiling a faint ? , puzzling smile . " I think you 'd better sit up , " he said . He was annoyed at finding that his voice had grown suddenly husky . She was instantly erect .
