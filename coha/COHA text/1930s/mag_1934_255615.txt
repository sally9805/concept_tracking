FATHER GOOSE-Gene Fowler-Covici-Friede ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Michael Sinnott was a good boilermaker but he wanted to sing in opera . So he left East Berlin , Conn. , changed his name to Mack Sennett , went to Manhattan to seek his fortune . That was in 1906 . How he struggled and prospered , and how a little mouse got him in the end is the theme of Gene Fowler 's Father Goose . For once biographer and subject are an almost perfect match . Readers who never saw a Keystone comedy will have a hard time restraining their whoops as Gene Fowler unreels this fantastic slapstick-story of Hollywood success . <P> Mack Sennett had a big voice , but he found it easier to get a job in a choir than on the stage of the Metropolitan .

Biographer Fowler denies his sense of humor but says ' ' perhaps he had the greatest sense of the ridiculous of any man in modern times . " When he laughed at a gag , audiences were sure to howl over it . The roster of his employes reads like a Hollywood Hall of Fame : Marie Dressier , Wallace Beery , Gloria Swanson , " Fatty " Arbuckle , W. C. Fields , Ben Turpin , Harold Lloyd , Weber &; Fields , Lew Cody , Louise Fazenda , Bebe Daniels , Buster Keaton , Hal Roach , many another . It was Mack Sennett who imported Charlie Chaplin , overcame his disastrous first appearance by changing his make-up and costume . With a boilermaker 's education , habits and vocabulary . Sennett distrusted such academic impedimenta as written scripts , insisted on his authors telling him their stories verbally . The post-War years 1924-26 were golden harvests for Mack Sennett .
