That was a forward step for the state , he told every one , taking the personalattitude he always assumed about civic questions , as though he must choose sides and pull for which side he thought right . There were a few other improvements of local type , even though times were noticeably hard , wildcat money abroad , and crops not any too good that summer . A bridge was built across the river at Sturgis Falls , the posts from native elms cut in the Big Woods , and hewn by hand .

Times grew more dull as the summer passed . Very little building was being done in either town and only the court-house was under constructionin Prairie Rapids . For the first time there was no growth in population . Every one was in a sober mood about it . It seemed that everything one had to buy was " iky-high , " anything one sold+rr " cheap as dirt . " Corn and oats were ten and twelve cents a bushel , wheat twenty and twenty-five . El cnry drove to Dubuque with potatoes which he had to sell for ten cents a bushel , but the tavern-owners in Sturgis Falls had offered only five cents , the Sherman House in Prairie Rapids six , so he took the long trek for the difference .

No one knew what made prices low , so there was much speculation as to the cause . Tariff , transportation , this antislaverytalk , weather , the national administration , state politics , human sins , predestination , all figured largely in the discussion up and down the river road . Mrs. Burrill thought Satan had planned it so . " I 'll swallow anything but that the poor old devil is to blame , " Jeremiah said . " He ai n't settin ' the price of corn , I know that .

Then He turned me loose in a world where there was fish in the streams , meat in the woods , bread in the ground , timber for houses , and springs all up and down the Valley .

"  | There was more scattering now of the Martin family than usual . Phoebe Lou was working for Mrs. Mel Manson again , and Melinda was at the Horace Akins ' . Jeanie went over to Sturgis Falls for a few weeks to help a friend of Sabina 's who was sick and had to have rest and quiet , but when George Wormsby , Ambrose Wiltshire , and Sam Phillips all kept coming to see Jeanie , the lady suddenly grew enough better to do without help . No one called them hired girls  --  they just " helped out a little , " famous for their good food , their neat persons , and their vitality , so that any one who could get a Martin sister to help was fortunate .

It would be fun to keep all three guessing . Jeremiah  --  as Sarah put it  --  kept the road warm to town . " Ma , " he would grin , eying her to see how she would be taking it to-day , " I 'll have to be going over to the Falls for a little while , I guess . " And when this was met by a mere look of scorn he would add an explanation : " Some opposition to all this buildin ' up of the new Republican ticket . It 's a big venture , this party . Has to be gone at just right with no fallin ' down on choice of good candidates this fall . Have to launch the new capitol out right , you know . Most important general assembly comin ' this winter the state 's ever had . Wildcat hanks , school lands bein ' speculatedon instead of in the right hands . . . plenty o ' things ... " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw hat or cap . At the long silence ensuing while Sarah vigorously scrubbed with home-leached lye the very grain off the wood of a cornerp203cupboard , he would ask pleasantly : " Anything you want from town , Ma ? " No , there was usually nothing Sarah wanted from town , telling him shortly that had she wanted anything , she would send for it by some one who would remember to bring it . If the day was pleasant , he would have on his big straw hat , pants tucked into boot tops , and blue shirt open at the neckband , the aperture covered by his jet-black crinkling beard . If the day was cool he would have on a cloth cap and his gray shawl fastened by the long pin made from a darningneedlewith red sealing-wax for a head . Rain or shine he went to town several times a week to assist at the bornin ' of the lusty Republican child . The king was dead . Long live the king .

But your father , he has to squander his energies all over the county . Wallace Akin do n't care the toot of a tin whistle whether the county 's governed right or not so 's he gets good crops . " The girls sided with her sometimes by mere way of smoothingher ruffled feathers , but on the whole they rather approved of Pa 's dipping into the political pot . Everybody liked him , they told her . Maybe he was a real help to the men over at town . And after all , the boys got more work done around the place in an hour than he ever did in half a day with people stopping to talk to him . They had seen Pa leave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence , stand there and talk so long to some man on horseback or in a wagon that after a while Lassie and Laddie would start to amble toward the stable . There was one thing about Pa  --  when he got home he told everywhere he had been , named every one he had seen , re- peated everything they had said . His " I says " and " he says " lasted for a good hour after he came . Phineas laughed once at his mother 's faultfinding . " Ma , you better be thankful Pa is wrapped up in politics instead of petticoats . I could name some not three miles from here who would n't want to tell their wives and girls how they 'd put in every minute like Pa does . " Toward the close of the summer Jeanie laughingly told the girls she 'd had the third proposal now . It was from Ambrose Willshire . And now that George Wormsby and Sam Phillips were away looking up land in other counties , Ambrose was taking things right into his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fascinated her like a snake , could not reconcile this new attitude with it . Ambrose , himself , addressed Jeremiah formally just outside the lean-to door on a Sunday afternoon . " Mr. Martin , I wish to take this opportunity to ask for the hand of your daughter , Jeanie . " " Well . .. now ... Ambrose ... what 's Jeanie got to say to that ? " " I am making her gradually see the light about it . " " And what good have you got to say for yourself ? " Jeremiahthought to joke him a bit . But Ambrose 's make-up included very little humor . " I can say , sir , " he said seriously , " I never drink a drop . I am chaste . I do n't smoke . I do n't chew . I do n't swear . I think no evil thoughts . I . . . " " My God , " Jeremiah burst out , " you 're just about perfect , Ambrose . " " I try to be , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically letting Ambrose decide the three-sided issue while the other swains were away , was to marry a paragon of virtue in October and live on a farm six miles north on the prairie.  |p205The  nearer it got to the time of the county convention of the new Republican party , the more politics were discussed around the long table in the lean-to . In truth Jeanie 's coming marriage and politics took up practically every mealtime . Jeremiah took the newspapers from both towns , the newly christened Courier and the Gazette . Sarah had a good deal to say about the extravagance of it this summer with every one hard up . " What you need two for is more than I can see . We can go without refined sugar , but we have to have all the newspapersin the county . I suppose the one says the weather was good last week and the other one says it was n't . I suppose one tells you the railroad is comin ' through and the other says it ai n't , so whichever way it goes , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ma . " Jeremiah was reproving . " I live nigh unto halfwaybetween the two towns , and I do n't see no pa'ticular call to be partial to one town more'n the other . Besides , " he grinned slyly , " the Courier took some of your tomatoes in payment for it and the Gazette took some of Henry 's wood . " But Sarah was suddenly curious . " Another thing , how does it come you 've got so sweet on Prairie Rapids this summer ? " Her little thin face looked sharp and suspicious . " Fire and brimstone was n't good enough for ' em when the court-house scrap was on . Nobody else 's got over it . None of the neighbors or Sturgis Falls folks is hardly speakin ' to Prairie Rapids folks yet . All but you . You 're maple syrup to ' em . And what you talkin ' so long for at the fence to Judge Hubbard from down there ? " " Oh , I just think the whole county ought to begin to pull together now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by-gones . " Then he rose and walked out of the cabin with dignity , his six feet one straight as an Indian , his black beard covering lips half parted in surprise . Outside and alone he slapped his kneep206in appreciative mirth . Trust Ma . She was nobody 's fool . She 'd noticed that , had she ? Smart as horseradish , Ma was . It was only a little over a week before Sarah knew the answer . On September third the first Republican county conventionwas held in the court-house headquarters at Prairie Rapids . All the Sturgis Falls men who had vowed never to set foot in those rooms over the brick store building glanced a little sheepishly toward each other when they first arrived , but soon forgot the embarrassment in the importance of the occasion . Jeremiah got home at sundown , tied Jupiter to the iron ring in the stable , and walked hurriedly to the cabin . Sarah was mending one of her black netting caps . Celia was setting the table , Emily frying potatoes . Suzanne came in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Inside the door Jeremiah paused and surveyed them all , gloating over this moment . It went through his mind that the occasion would be perfect if only Henry , Lucy , little Nora , Phineas , Melinda , Phoebe Lou , Sabina , Tom Bostwick , Wayne Lockwood , Ed Armitage , Ambrose Willshire , the Akins , the Burrills , and the Mansons were here . " Well , did they have the meetin ' ? " Sarah looked up , only half conscious of her question . After all , Pa 's life was just one succession of meetings after another . " Yes ... they had the meetin ' . " " Go off satisfactory ? " " Yes . " " Who 'd they nominate ? " He went through the list of nominations with assumed lack of interest  --  County Treasurer , County Judge , Recorder , Surveyor , Coroner , Superintendent of Common Schools . " I thought the most pa'ticular one was to be a state representative , " she said testily . " It was . "  | " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , is it a big secret ? Did they make you promise not to tell ? " " No . " " What 's come over you ? We do n't usually have to prod you into talkin ' . Who is he ? " " Madam , you have slept with him for thirty-two years . " The women folks all stopped short in their very tracks . Emily 's skillet , Suzanne 's egg-basket , Celia 's plate , Sarah 's needle , Jeanie 's water-pail , all were suspended in mid-air , as though the motivation had suddenly ceased to function . Suzanne was the first to speak and surprisingly she shouted : " I guess now you wo n't poke fun at Pa any more ! " " To go to the new capitol down at Fort Des Moines ? " Jeanie looked awe-struck . " Not Fort Des Moines  --  just Des Moines , " Jeremiah primly corrected , as though that were the main point . " To be gone all winter ? " Sarah asked , and her thin little face looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this ai n't no election , " he explained humbly . " This is only a nomination . But , " he added with candor , " it 's a strong ticket . " Emily 's face beamed through the red freckles . " Pa ! " She could scarcely comprehend it . " You .. . with all those lawyers ! " " Oh , I ai n't never seen the lawyer I could n't hold my own with , " he admitted with becoming modesty . Right away Henry and Lucy must be told , and Phineas . Sabina would know it soon for Tom had been at the convention . Suzanne was allowed to ride Queen to the Mansons ' to tell Phoebe Lou , and to the Horace Akins ' to tell Melinda . And then , because she was galloping over the ground so lightly to-night and the moon was coming up to make white magicp208and the news was so very big and exciting , without permission to do so she ran Queen all the way up the lane road to tell Wayne Lockwood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the candles lighted behind her eyes . . . " oh , Wayne , if he 's elected , we 'll be landed gentry . "  | INDIAN summer came with the sunshine palely yellow filteringthrough a screen of haze , with the maple leaves spreading red fire through the tops of the timber and the oaks wrapped in a greenish-bronze smoke . Stalks of goldenrod like so many lighted candles burned along the stake-and-rider fences , spread themselves up the lane road . Emily finished making over the yellow dress and when Jeanie tried it on for the last time she looked like a part of Indian summer , too . With honey-colored hair and dark eyes and a yellow dress standing stiffly over her hoops , Jeanie was a stalk of goldenrod , herself . And now there were all the things to do for Jeanie that had been done for Sabina . Suzanne said she seemed to be living over the very same occasion as though you had looked once at a picture in a book and now turned the leaves back to look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . One or two other things were different , however . There was a preacher coming out from Sturgis Falls instead of a justice of the peace , although Sabina bridled when she heard it and said she was just as much married as Jeanie would be . And Ambrose requested that the wedding be more dignified than the other , as he thought the occasion too serious for unseemly levity . Everything for Sabina 's wedding had gone forward without a hitch . She had loved Tom Bostwick and no other , and he had loved her in the same way , so there were no complications . Now , however , with the day set and the neighbors all invited ,  | so many people reported to Jeanie how Sam Phillips was wearing his sensitive heart on his sleeve , and threatening to jump in the river , that she sent for him to come and talk it over . " Well , the river 's low , " Sarah , tired from all the extra work , said grimly when she heard about it . " He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message for him to come , thought Jeanie had changed her mind and had the whole disappointment to go through again , half tearfully , so that Jeanie for a few brief moments wondered whether she ought not marry him instead of Ambrose . Sam Phillips ' lachrymose farewell was only a week past and the wedding two days off , when George Wormsby , arriving back from Grundy County , rode up on horseback and created a loud and turbulent scene in the vicinity of the tree-trunk stoop , calling Jeanie out and accusing her of coquetry , doubledealing , changeableness , lack of backbone , everything but mayhemand arson , and hinting strongly at a possible shooting of himself . He upset her so that she was almost ready to give in and take him instead of Ambrose , when Sarah came out and told him that if he was going to shoot himself to get off her clean tree-trunk stoop that she had just scrubbed with lye . But there were no suicides either by fire or water to mar the wedding . Sam Phillips would not attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable all evening and shucked butternuts . George Wormsby came , though , sustained by something from a jug in his buggy and spent most of his time bragging about a pretty girl he had met south of Prairie Rapids . It was true that the wedding turned out to be more dignified than Sabina 's . Something about Ambrose 's unbending manner and critical attitude toward anything that verged on hilarity cast its spell over the assembled family and guests , subduing the laughter and practically engulfing the jokes . When the affair was over and the bride and groom werep2IIleaving for their north prairie home six miles away , Jeanie , gay and tearful , half laughing , half crying , clung to them all with such an unusual show of affection that every one spoke about it after the sound of the lumber wagon had died away up the lane road . Jeremiah , standing at the gate of the stake-and-rider fence , looked after the disappearing speck . Then he turned to Wayne Lockwood who happened to be nearest him . " Wayne , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drink .. . do n't swear ... do n't smoke . . . do n't chew . . . by granny , the pent-up old Nick has got to come out in some way , singin ' or laughin ' or jokin ' . And if he do n't do any of them either ... that 's too much steam compressed in one human . " It turned out that the very day of Jeanie 's marriage had been the day Governor Grimes issued a statement that the newly built capitol at Des Moines was acceptable . " It better be , " Jeremiah said , " **27;5793;TOOLONG buildings do n't grow on bushes . " November turned raw and cold . Great flocks of ducks came down from the northern lake country , rested on the slough waters , winged on to the south . A light snow fell . The small creeks carried thin opaque glass on their surfaces . The river ran , blackly sluggish beyond the timber . The Indians up at the Turkey Foot , pointing out to a settler how the beavers were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant a wet year was ahead . Election day came . To the surprise of every one Jeremiah rode back home right after he voted in the morning . Ile put Jupiter in the stable , chopped wood all day , and sat clown quietly in his arm-chair before supper with the newspaper . Such retirement behind the scenes of activity knew no precedent . When the meal was ready , he took his place , mumblingly asked the Lord to bless this food , but pecked sparingly at the same . The chatter around the board was far less than usual , laughter almost entirely missing . " Try a little o ' this baked squash , Pa , " Sarah said , coaxingly , as though he had been ill . There was a feeling of suspense in the very atmosphere . It was as though they did not know which part to act , laughing jubilation at the supremacy of l'a and the Republicans , or disgusted resignation at the winning of the opponent and the Democrats . Pending the decision , and until such time as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for them to do was to sit in the audience . The night was clear and cool , the roads frozen but not too bad , so that a horseman riding as soon as the votes were counted in one community brought the news to the other . The newly platted villages of La Porte and Hudson had a small vote to add . Wayne Lockwood and Ed Armitage , riding into the yard in the late evening , took every one to the door with their yelling . " Hey ! " Wayne called out jubilantly . " Is the Honorable Jeremiah Martin here ? " Suzanne , shivering in the doorway with the raw November wind and excitement , had to pinch herself to be sure she was not living only in that world of fancy . The whole family was laughing and saying that everybody knew those old Democrats would get snowed under by the good new Republican party . " I always say right triumphs in the end , " Jeremiah said pompously , not quite knowing what the " right " was or where " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was Pa 's title . Was everything going to be strange and different now ? My goodness gracious , how should you act when your family got to be landed gentry ?  |p213But  after all , even as others less childlike than Suzanne have discovered , life under the bright light of an honor was not going to be so vastly different . Great snows came on . Jeremiah butchered , with Sarah and Emily making headcheese and sausage and pickling the pigs ' feet . Melinda and Phoebe Lou were still away " helping . " Celia and Suzanne wallowed through the deep snows to school , Celia threatening to stop the very minute Pa got away to Legislature . Everything centered around that great event now . Even Christmas , sharing the highlight of the year with the Fourth of July , was overshadowed by this fact of Pa leaving soon after New Year 's for the capital , down at Fort Des Moines  --  no , just Des Moines . " We 've got to forget this fort idea out here now , " he remindedthem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours do n't need to emphasize forts any more , as though we 're backwoodsy or afraid of Injuns . " News came that all the state offices and the state money had been moved from the disgruntled Iowa City to the jubilant little Des Moines . If that was n't the court-house scrap all over again on a bigger scale , every one said . No one in Iowa City would move the treasurer 's safe with the money , so Des Moines men had been obliged to go after it . They had used eight or ten yoke of oxen and even then such a bad snow-storm came up that they had been obliged to abandonit , and for days the state money lay out there on the prairie . " That just goes to show how useless money is in itself , " Jeremiah took occasion to say . " Thousands of dollars layin ' out there on the prairie . . . and what good would it be to thieves comin ' along in that storm , freezin ' and starvin ' ? Could n't eat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be a lesson to you . Never go dependin ' on money alone . You girls tell that to your husbands when you get ' em . Tell ' em no matter what business they 're in , always own a piece o ' land and you can fall back on it for food and fire and shelter . The good land wo n't go back on you like gold or a piece o ' paper that only says it 's worth so much . Own a little land and you 've got shelter and food and warmth and independence . You 're a king in your own kingdom . Nobody can ever tell a farmer what he can and ca n't do . " The new Governor Lowe was to be inaugurated January eleventh in that year of 1858 . Irow Jeremiah was to get there , the Lord only knew . Sarah prophesied dire things . Roads would be terrible in any event . If it stayed as cold as it was now , ice and sleet and snow would render them impassable for staging . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all made Jeremiah half a mind to go horseback . A horse with no cumbersome vehicle was about as good as a pair of wings . " What this state needs more than anything is railroads . " For the hundredth time he said it and for the first time Sarah agreed . Iowa did need railroads , she suddenly decided , which had the effect of making the Honorable Jeremiah grin and say that it all depended on whose ox was gored . Now that a Martin wanted to travel , Ma could see that the country needed steam-cars . But Ma said she would n't rest a minute while a member of her family was in one of the dangerous things . That last summer'sHarper 's Weekly which Aunt Harriet sent had just cured her relish for steam-cars . " Every man who leaves the city by a train , " it said , " must cast a lingering look behind , doubting whether chances of a safe arrival are not entirely against him . ... Boilers are bursting all over the country , railroad bridges breaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry then , Ma , for I 'll carry my track on my back and Queen 's boiler ai n't goin ' to bust . " There was not so much actually to do in preparation for the event as there was conversation concerning it . " Now you girls will all have to help Henry and Phineas. "  |p215That  caused a surreptitious rolling of eyes so Pa would n't see them . He probably did n't even realize how little he had done around the place since he got this political bee in his bonnet . Sometimes he talked about where he would live , how much board he would have to pay , two dollars and a half a week , maybe , how long the session would last , and what questions would come up . But more often he discussed how he could get there , pondered whether to try to ride through to Cedar Rapids and over to Des Moines from there , or go to the southwest to Eldora , then to the town of Nevada , and down to the capital . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so he would be sure to find shelter at night . " Pa , you 're fifty-seven years old , " Sarah said dubiously . " It 's a big horseback trip at your age . " " Just about old enough to begin to have horse-sense , " he retorted . " Do n't worry about me . I 'll pull through . " Pull through ! Suzanne , listening , told herself she bet she had heard her father say that a thousand times . Yes , you could count on Pa . When he said he 'd be in Des Moines by the eleventh of January , he 'd be there , rain or shine . Pa 's word was as good as gold  --  that 's what people said about him . The last night he was to be home was a strange one . Suzanne thought she could scarcely stand it to see him wind the clock for the last time , saying , " There ! Day 's over . To-morrow you can have a fresh start . " Why , it just seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who gave you the tomorrows . And then all at once it was morning and he was getting ready to leave . " This is the day I long have sought , And grieved because I found it not , " he sang in a husky tone like Emily 's as they were sitting down to breakfast . The great platters of spare-ribs and corn-cakes ,  | baked potatoes and hominy , sat in a row down the center of the table in a long appetizing parade . Pa bowed his head . " Bless this food to Thy glory , " he rumbled through his beard . A lump came in Suzanne 's throat to think of all the food they must eat unblessed by Pa . It was bitterly cold to-day . Snow was frozen solid on the small-paned windows in the east wall of the lean-to . The west windows were black as night with gunny-sacking nailed over them . The whole house was banked four feet high with manure and straw which had been packed up from the stable in November . It had frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the spring it would thaw and steam and smell horsy , and Sarah would scold every day until it was carted off . Suzanne , picking at her corn cakes and spare-ribs , knew that if she lived to see the end of the world it could not give her more of a " gone " feeling in the pit of her stomach . Sarah and Emily had packed Pa 's hag , the nap of the flowers on the carpet sides looking more worn than they would have wished for a state legislator to use . There was no telling how long he would be gone into the spring so they had put in calomel , quinine , and sassafras , although how he was ever going to get anybody to steep this last for him was a puzzle which they did not try to solve . he had on his good clothes . Phoebe Lou had come over from Mansons ' in time to grease his boots with mutton tallow until they shone . Sarah kept worrying about what he would do without his bootjack but Jeremiah laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . She had cut his hair as he sat in a lean-to chair with a sheet around him , and trimmed his whiskers so close that he claimed he felt sort of undressed and immodest . But Sarah knew he 'd forget himself when he was gone and like as not get to looking like a prairie-wolf so she had sheared off as much as she dared . Soon after breakfast teams began driving into the yard withp217neighbors coming to see him off . Every little while another sound of screeching sleigh runners on the hard-packed snow brought a new load . By no means did he dislike this being the center of centripetal force . To all and sundry he had dropped subtle remarks anent the time of his leaving  --  ten o'clock on Wednesday morning . One would have thought he was taking steam-cars at a scheduledtime instead of the back of Queen , he had given out the time of his departure with such accuracy . But there were still no steam-cars to take and if Sarah was right in her prediction there was no likelihood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Des Moines . " I 'll bet you anything the day 'll come when you can get right on cars here in Prairie Rapids or Sturgis Falls and shoot straight to Des Moines , " he challenged her . " Well , you and I wo n't be here to shoot , " was her decisive answer . Both the Wallace and the Horace Akin families came , Mrs. Wallace Akin wearing three layers of capes to keep out the cold , so that , short as she was , she looked as round as a butterball . The Mel Mansons came , the Emersons , and the Burrills , who were moving to Missouri in the summer where according to them everything was better than here . Wayne rode in on Blackbird . Ed Armitage came tearing up to the lean-to door and , thinking to frighten Phoebe Lou into an admission of liking him , pretended that he had decided to go to Missouri with the Burrills . But Phoebe Lou only laughed and said Evangeline Burrill was probably the magnet . When every one else had arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her home up on the prairie , her hands half frozen to the lines , her lips blue with cold , and so ill when she came into the warm lean-to that she had to go back outdoors . " Where 's Ambrose ? " they all wanted to know.  | Jeanie tossed her head and essayed a smile . " Oh , he could n't leave very well , " she said brightly . But every Martin there knew that Jeanie was having to " pull through " something by herself . " But I came on anyway . I could n't let Pa go without saying good-by and I was just starved to see you all and have a good laugh . " " I suppose it ai n't polite to laugh up there , " Sarah muttered to Emily in the confines of the dark new buttery . Suzanne was almost overwhelmed with the emotion of it all . It was like a funeral and yet not like it , either . The rooms were filled with men and women who had taken off their wraps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have them stay for dinner after Pa left . The day would be spoiled anyway and they might as well put it in visiting together . Sabina was the only member of the family not there but Jeremiah was going through Sturgis Falls on his way and would stop to bid her good-by . Grundy County , Steamboat Rock , Eldora , the town of Nevada  --  that was his itinerary . Stopping in town a little while would give him a chance to see some of the folks who had helped elect him . There had been some regret on his part that the way he had chosen to go would not take him through Prairie Rapids . In his anxiety not to make any point of partiality about it , he was wishing heartily that he could start from both places in order to save any possibilityof ill feeling . " Hell , " he said under the emotion of his magnanimity , " after all , I represent ' cm both , as well as all the settlers in other parts of the county .

Celia tied a thick knitted muffler over the cap , and Suzanne put the gray shawl around his shoulders and fastened it by means of the long pin with its red sealing-wax head . There were jokes on all sides about loading Queen down , and that maybe the mare ought to have some of the wraps on her . And then the jokes died down as though no one had any more heart for them . A silence fell on the room so that the Seth Thomas clock with the great iron weights and the E Pluribus Unum eagle sounded loudly insistent in the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-blue eyes cloudinga bit anxiously above the coal-black whiskers so strangely neat and tidy to-day . " Well , " he said , taking in wife , children , and neighbors alike , as though they were all his family , " be good to yourselves . Anything comes up , use your gumption . Pull yourselves on through . " He might have been Moses bidding his flock farewell , or Abraham troubled over his people . Sarah stood off at the side . Her face looked small and pinched under its sagging weight of reddish hair , graying a little at the sides . He singled her out from the others with his eyes . " Take good care of yourself , Sarah  --  I 'll let you know how things are , soon 's I can . " Suzanne looked at her mother quickly . How funny to call her Sarah . She 'd never heard him say anything but " Ma . " It was like a love word to say " Sarah " so kindly . He must have called her that all the time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him just now . Maybe for just a minute she was that girl she used to be . Suddenly she felt it was terrible that this was happening , that there were times in life when you could scarcely stand things for the queer feeling that tore at your throat and hurt your heart . She looked across at Wayne Lockwood standing there so tall and straight against the loft ladder . Nothing ever moved Wayne . He was always the same , so cool and undisturbed , no matter what happened . Sometime in her life she hoped she could see him deeply moved , caring intensely about something . Pa was outside the lean-to door now , and Ma and some of the girls had followed as far as the stoop where they stood shivering . Suzanne got her shawl and galoshes from behind the door , tugging hurriedly to get them on . She could hear : " Well , good-by , everybody . " " Good-by , Pa . " She pulled her wrap around her , ran out the main-room door , and sped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small rail gate , was up on it when her father rode through the larger one . She was bound to be the very last one to see him go . Life would be so queer without him at home . Why , he was just the center of everything . " Good-by , Pa ! " " Good-by , Suzy . Be a good girl . " " I will . " Her hand was at her throat and she could scarcely see him for the tears in her eyes . Pa had called her by her baby name , too . It was just terrible to see him ride off into the ice-locked country to the southwest all alone . She clung shiveringly to the gate , leaning over it to watch him go . Far up the snow-packed road he turned and lifted his arms high so that his gray shawl formed wings . Through her tears she was laughing that Pa looked like a big gray moth flying into the cold wintry sky . When she went back into the house to tell her mother about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bedroom by herself with the door shut tight.  | LIFE was so queer without Jeremiah all through the winter j weeks  --  a little dull and unexciting without his news from Sturgis Falls and Prairie Rapids , his constant remarks about coming elections or past ones , his loud-voiced political argumentsand his hearty laugh . Something was missing , some vital thing for which every one scrubbed and cooked  --  the time when Pa would come in the house from his trips ! There had been no word from him since the day he had gone up the river road on Queen , his gray shawl wrapped tightly around his shoulders and his flowered carpet-bag whacking the mare 's sides . But that was to be expected as there was no direct stage from the new capital . So any letter that Pa had written must of necessity go from Des Moines around to Iowa City , Cedar Rapids , or the town of Nevada , and wait over until anotherstage could get through to Sturgis Falls . Every time Phineas came home from the Falls he was met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremiah left , Iowa had been in the grip of snow and ice with a twenty-below temperature , but the last part of the month the ice king released his hold as suddenly as one lets go of a rope , and almost overnight an abnormal warm spell enveloped the state , so that creeks were running high and rivers were foaming . If the cold and ice had slowed the stages , now the mud and water laid even more detaining hands upon them . It was as though Pa had disappeared for good and all into some isolated country off there to the southwest . And then suddenly a stage and the letter came . Phineas brought it outp222to his mother  --  a large sheet of lined blue paper , every inch filled with Pa 's cramped shaded writing , folded over and sealed with the red wax from his shawl pin . Sarah was as excited as a girl , forgetting to put brown paper over her baking bread , and the top crusts pushing up against the oven scorched and had to be cut off . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud  --  Henry , Lucy , Emily , Phineas , Celia , and Suzanne . Pa said he took his pen in hand to let them know he had pulled through all right . IIe had been a long time on the way , staying his first night in a cabin in Grundy County , when a storm came up and he had to lay over . He was ashamed it took so long , but all told he had been seven days on the trip . Just pulled through by the skin of his teeth the night before the inauguration . He had been lucky to decide on riding the horse . Several of the legislators had not got there in time for inaugurationon the eleventh . Suzanne broke into the reading : " What did I tell you ? " Pa had said he would be there on the eleventh . And there he was . The letter said Des Moines was going to be all right some day for the capital  --  a good choice , center of the state and all that  --  but so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's life to get there . One senator , the one from Council Bluffs out on the Missouri River , had come the hundred and fifty miles by stage in that twenty-below weather and like to froze . What this state needed was railroads . When Sarah read that part they all laughed out loud  --  it was just as though Pa sat right there saying it . Des Moines folks had been cordial . Maybe it would get to be a city some day . Just now it did n't appear to be near as much of a trading town as Prairie Rapids or Sturgis Falls . Board was higher than a kite , three dollars per week . The letter was much more stiffly written than Jeremiah 's easy conversation . When Ma finished and they were passing it allSONG OF YEARS 223p223around , Suzanne , reading it to herself , thought of that peculiar thing and wondered why it was that when people wrote letters it did n't sound like their talk . " Respectfully your obedient servant , " Pa had written . It made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thumping up the feathers in Ma 's bed under the calico tester . Pa was n't very respectful at times , he never was obedient to any of them , but did about as he saw fit , and you just could n't think of him being anybody 's servant . She had heard him say more than once that he 'd rather raise skunks for a living than work for any one else . When Melinda came down the loft ladder and asked her what she was grinning about like a Chessy cat , she refused to tell . She did n't want any one to think she was making fun of Pa , a big man in the legislature that way . But it made quite a joke just the same when you stopped to think about it : " Respectfullyyour obedient servant . " It grew cold again , snowed , froze the river and streams as " tight as a drum , " turned warm suddenly , and started thawing . The top snows and the upper layer of ice melting so quickly under the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , seeking their level in every gully and creek bed . Underneath this rushing of water one could see ice which the warmth had not yet penetrated . But soon that too was breaking . Ice in the river cracked and boomed like artillery , its great cakes piling high on each other , grinding and crunching with the river 's flow . Every little stream choked , trying to swallow its own ice . Suzanne said Deer Run ought to be called Deer Run-over . With the spy-glass one could see the river backing into the lower timberland . Creek and bayou , slough and river  --  it was no longer possible to tell where one left off and the others began . Wayne , going to town once for some necessary supplies , had to swim Blackbird through such high water in front of the east-side taverns that he wished he had not tried to come.  | Jeremiah was having to stay in Des Moines for some committeework so that it was almost like summer weather when he got home through the high water , his beard grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp scissors , his carpet-bag tied on the saddle , and his felt boots , astraddle of mud-soaked Queen , thumping up and down behind him as though an invisible man were riding there , too . Queen had eaten her head off in the winter , he said , but when the snow thawed and the first green showed through he had staked her out to browse near the capitol . They had a big family dinner for him on that first Sunday after his arrival . While Henry , Lucy , and little Nora , Tom Bostwick and Sabina , Ambrose Wiltshire and Jeanie were all expected home , with Ed Armitage and Wayne Lockwood thrown in for good measure , no one realized until they began turning into the yard that both families of Akins , the Burrills , and the Mansons were all coming , too . Jeremiah , riding around to greet the neighbors after his arrival , had invited them to add their presence to the occasion but had forgotten to tell Sarah and the girls . Seeing the first of the loads turn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting the long table in the lean-to , threw up their hands and uttered moans of protest . But Emily , coming by , her face red from the hot fire , said , " Oh , do n't be snivelers . Get a-hold of your bootstraps and pull yourselves out of it . " So the girls called to Phineas to help , and the three hurriedly put boards across sawhorses out in the rain-soaked yard where Sarah 's hollyhocks were coming up , and set the table there . Happily , the two Akin families had brought dried-apple pies and a cooked shoulder of pork , and the Mansons a driedpumpkinpie and corn cake . Mrs. Burrill brought three dozen gooseberry jam tarts , although they were acid sour , and so tough that Melinda 's whispering to the girls about people prob/ably eating the jam off and passing the crusts back for more , thinking they were dishes , had the effect of sending them all into such paroxysms of laughter they could scarcely go on with the dinner . Henry and Lucy brought over their chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom and Sabina drove out from town in their shining buggy and brought one of Sabina 's big cakes for which she was noted , but because the filling had not quite set and the ruts in the road were so bad , the jouncing had caused the layers to slip a little , so that it looked like a snowy white leaning tower of Pisa . When Ambrose and Jeanie came in the lumber wagon , they drove up to the side stoop and Jeanie slipped into the lean-to where she sat all the warm afternoon back of the stove so no one would notice her . Sarah tried to get her to go in the bedroom where she would be cooler , but Jeanie said no , she was so starved to see them all and hear their silly talk and laughter that she did n't want to miss one word or giggle . " Do n't you ever laugh any more ? " Jeremiah asked so kindly that quick tears came to Jeanie 's dark eyes , and she said suddenly : " Oh , Pa , it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muttered something to Emily about being married to a hitching-post . When all were finally seated , there was a great deal of scatteredtalk around the long table , but it was Jeremiah who was the important personage of the day , so all deferred to him whenever he started to speak , even the talkative girls ceasing their chatter at frequent intervals as he began telling about something at the capital . The legislature had done some big things . " We sanctioned the new Constitution , " Jeremiah said , and if there was a slight pressure of the vocal chords on that " we , " every one pretended not to notice . " We put county governments on a workable basis . We got rid of the wildcat money , ' made a revenue law ,  | and liquidated the state debt . We got school lands away from speculators and started a property tax . We did just about everything , in fact , but put a bounty on old bachelors ' hides , " which sent the girls into spasms of laughter . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men folks were all curious to know just what Jeremiah himself had done , the part he had taken personally in all this . Had he introduced any of those bills that really became laws ? " Well , " he answered them , his black beard wagging as he wrestled with one of the tough gooseberry tarts , " I believe I can safely say I did more satin ' on unwise measures than anybodythere . Sometimes I think was the official killer of bad bills . One I recollect at this minute was about exemptin ' debtors from their just debts . The more I listened to ' em argue about lettin ' people get out from under their legitimate obligations , the madder I got . If the day ever conies when you can legislate people out of their honest debts ... well , I never want to live to see it . The country will be in a bad way , that 's all I got to say for it . " By the time I was madder than a wet hen , I got the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I says , as dry as dust , Mr. Speaker , America 's based on honesty and fairness . That 's what America is . Iowa 's based on honesty and fairness . That 's what Iowa is . Our liberties we prize . And our rights we will maintain . They 'll never in this world be humans with equal brains or equal ability to get ahead . Consequently they 'll never be equal amounts of property owned . Some things we ca n't help . Our souls may all be equal in the sight of the Lord , but our gumption and ingenuity ai n't . So the results of man 's labor will never be equal . " I 'm a farmer . I 'm goin ' to raise as good corn and wheat , hogs and cattle out here in our new state as I can . Mine 'll be better than some of my neighbors and not as good as others . That 's because some of ' em has more ability , foresight , ingenu/ity , and gumption than I have , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my just debts because I did n't do as well as some , or seein ' my neighbors shuffle off their just debts because they did n't do as well as me  --  no , sir . That ai n't Iowa and it ai n't America . Our rights we will maintain . That 's for them that gets much and for them that gets little . We better stick to that or we 'll have a pretty kettle of fish in our midst . " It might be nice and benevolent to try and fix over the laws to help out some poor cuss . But even if it looks benevolent on the surface it ai n't good horse-sense . It 'll work out evil in the end . Mr. Speaker , ' I says as dry as gunpowder , I hope our benevolent friends wo n't tinker up the law to prevent a honest feller from payin ' his debts if he wants to . ' " " What did they say to that , Jeremiah ? " " Yes , what did they do , Pa ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust gooseberry tart . " The bill , " he swallowed , " was killed deader'n a door-nail. "  | IT rained much of the time that early summer . The Indians up at the Turkey Foot were not surprised . The beavers had forecast it so . The Cedar , which had rolled over its banks angrily , foamed into the timberland , and spread out over low fields , was acting like a steady old friend turned inimical . Familiar sand-bars were no longer in sight . Places which once afforded a good crossing were too deep for safety . Currents and cross currents came together in whirling madness . The new bridge at Sturgis Falls looked from a distance like a long floating raft with railing on the sides . Over in Prairie Rapids boats were used among some of the stores for transportation ; the mail sack was thrown out on a platform above the highwatermark . There was much crop damage . Corn was washed out and had to be replanted . The wheat was a failure , sometimes not as much harvested from one acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sacks of this to the mill , but the flour made from it was poor , Sarah 's usually light loaves of bread being about as hard as cannon-balls and only a little more palatable . Ducks and geese settled down complacently over the region for a summer 's stay , thinking they had reached the lake country . Wall-eyed pike and catfish were seined in erstwhile prairie pastures , and a majestic muskellunge , the only one of its tribe ever known to the river devotees , came into the waters from somewhere , like a lone wanderer seeking its own , was ignominiously caught and served at a tavern.  |p229Roads  were impassable , stages delayed so long that all schedules were disrupted . Business was almost at a standstill , farming difficult for the first time . The influx of strangers was materially lessened , of new settlers practically stopped . Every one felt hard up . Most of the population was in debt . Added to the local depression over the rains , high water , and crop failure , the national financial depression had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came riding down the Red Cedar . Heretofore the river had been a sparkling **25;5822;TOOLONG , content to carry the settlers on its broad breast , to turn their mill wheels , and proffer them its fine fish . In its new attitude this summer it flowed darkly through the timberland , unrecognizable in its sullenness . Like a human whose mentality is unbalanced it moaned at times with a quickening of its ripples , quieted down , shrieked anew with an insane madnessof tearing waters , turned pleasant again a short distance away , spread languidly into quiet coves , rushed out a few yards farther on in a wild frenzy of foaming cross currents . And by its very insanity it fascinated . To go to the river and ride into the currents was a modern brand of 1858 sportsmanship which took daring and nerves of steel . On a Sunday in July , all the neighborhood young people took their dinner and went to a shady place above Lover 's Retreat  --  Emily , Phoebe Lou , Melinda , Celia , Suzanne , Phineas , Ed Armitage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Wormsby . These last two  --  Jeanie 's cliscardedbeaus  --  were now trying to " shine around " Celia and Suzanne with very little encouragement from Celia and a downrightcold shoulder from Suzanne . The picnic itself was something in the way of a farewell to Evangeline Burrill who was about to move with her parents to Missouri.  |p230All  afternoon they had been taking turns in the two boats , riding from the languid waters of a willow-lined waterlily-filled cove into the swift current , the girls shrieking with excitement and fear as the boat swung into its dizzy ride . Emily , as the oldest , had said it was time to pack up and go now , and Phineas and Wayne agreed , for they both had chores to do . But Melinda and Evangeline Burrill , about to get into the boat with Sant Phillips , set up a tremendous wail , so that every one said , " Oh , go on , go on once more . We would n't want to take two children bawling all the way home . " They pushed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what happened to make this different from all those other rides of the afternoon . Did Sam not get started right ? Were they farther out on the breast of the river than before ? Did a new rushing current of water come in from some released brush or beaver dam ? For a lifetime they were to wonder what took place . For with Sam Phillips working desperately , the boat stayed sidewise in the black current , then whirled like a little fragile pea pod with which a child plays in a tiny stream . Wide-eyed with horror , frozen into fascinated fear or roused into shrieking terror , the crowd on the bank watched the whirling boat which was but a maple chip on the treacherouswater . " They 'll be all right when they hit Lover 's Retreat , " George Wormsby said , his lips white . Already Phineas , Wayne , and Ed Armitage were pushing off in another boat . The girls on the bank , crying , praying , moaning , or , as was Suzanne , bereft of all feeling excepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare , saw the boat strike Lover 's Retreat , tip , spill its human cargo as the pod spills the three peas a child places therein for passengers . Running , stumbling , hoping , and yet half knowing their hopes could not come true , they worked down nearer a point opposite the island , crouchedp231together in their moaning , saw the boys land , strained their eyes to see which girl they brought out of the water and could not tell , saw two of them working over her , the other helping Sam out of an overhanging tree , saw Sam join that boy to run up and down the island looking , looking , lookingIt was Melinda who was saved , Evangeline Burrill who had disappeared from the very moment of the boat 's tipping . And then people came from Prairie Rapids  --  volunteers with grappling-hooks . Fires were built on the island 's edge . All night long and all the next day and the next , people were to look for Evangeline Burrill . But the Martin girls must take their baskets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrapped in coats and the quilts they had brought for sitting upon . And Wayne Lockwood and Emily , because they did not refuse to take the hard task upon themselves , knowing that some one must shoulder it , had to go to the Burrills ' cabin door and tell Mrs. Burrill that Evangeline was drowned . In the days that followed , Sarah Martin almost lived at the Burrills ' , trying to care for the wild woman who had lost her only child to the mad waters of the Red Cedar . It was a week before they found Evangeline in one of the quiet coves where the river was calm and tranquil , the shallow water shimmering gaily between white water-lilies in the late July sunshine . A deceptive , two-faced , lovely thing , that Red Cedar River , sparkling and flowing on to the Mississippi , and taking a hundred lives in these years of its sparkling flow . There were services then at the school-house over the drowned body of Evangeline , and a long procession going across the prairie up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come when only relatives and close friends would attend funeral services , but that day had not come in 1858 . When Death entered a community it came as a mighty Power whose presence was acknowledged by a cessation ofp232activities . Men hearing of a death unhitched their teams and went to the house , thinking it not seemly to appear unaware of the grim rider . So the field work and all the home work ceased , while from far and wide , from farm and town , wagons and buggies came bringing settlers to stand in the school-house yard near the dead body of Evangeline . Jeremiah and Henry- said they would take the coffin in their wagon , but Mr. and Mrs. Burrill said no , they would carry their girl themselves . Suzanne thought she could not stand it for the aching in her throat and the agony gripping her heart to ride in that slow-moving procession , so long that one could not see the end across the prairie . The wild grass was drying now on the hillsideafter the long rains so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people walked through it . Crickets and grasshoppers jumped ahead of the sweeping skirts and the late July sun beat down unbearably . The great pile of dirt under which Evangeline was to lie was heaped at the side of the long grave , black at the base , yellow clay at the top . The slough at the foot of the graveyard hill was thick with cat-tails , and the grackles came noisily there while the preacher was saying , " Ashes to ashes , dust to dust . . . " Suzanne and Celia stood on each side of Melinda with an arm around her , and Melinda shook like a leaf , crying and ' whispering to them that she wished she 'd gone , too , and could lie there peacefully by Evangeline , but took it all back when she got home and was glad she was alive . Jeremiah , looking around that evening at the girls with their swollen eyes and red noses , said only this : " Girls , you 'll never forget it as long as you live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lives . Why our girl was let live and the other took , no human knows . Some say predestination . They do n't know that either . She 's gone . Nothin ' can bring her back . Life closes up over the vacancies and goes on . They 'll be deaths , births ,  |p233marriages  , fun , and sorrow for you all . Just meet ' em all fair and square . Face facts no matter how bad . Then , come what will , you 'll be ready for everything . Now , pull yourselves togetherand just go on with your livin ' like as always . " Vaguely it went through Suzanne 's mind how much better a sermon Pa had just preached than the real preacher with his talk about angel wings and the resurrection so far away . They were all partial to Melinda for a little while , thinking how she might not have been here , but as the summer wore on , the tragedy became a bad dream , and soon she was the butt again of many a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus making it easier to get back into the old natural ways . Yes , life closes over the vacancies and goes on . Because the rains had abated and the weather settled down to a normal attitude in late summer , the stage headquarters in Dubuque , as though to make up for past discrepancies , sent one coach through in a day with no stop-over except for a short time at the taverns in Delhi and Independence . It arrived , if the elements were on their good behavior , at ten every night , and left with another driver and fresh horses at four in the morning , arriving back at Dubuque at ten at night  --  the whole hundredmiletrip in eighteen hours . That was service for you . Sometimes when the Martin girls heard the pound of the horses ' hoofs and that special clank of harness , they all ran laughing in their night-dresses down to the stake-and-rider fence , where the horseshoes hung on the gate , and crouched there in the night watching it go by , trying to make out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars how many figures were silhouetted against its windows . But often they were in bed and asleep when the hoofs pounded past toward Sturgis Falls , although on summer mornings they were usually up in the early dawn ready for work when it started east . For this fall was one of harder work than ever and of hand-tomouthliving . Every potato down to marble size was cooked ,  |p234every  edible thing in the timber utilized for food . Hickory nuts , walnuts , butternuts , crab-apples , grapes , plums , prairie-chickens , quail , wild geese , ducks , raccoons , rabbits , squirrels , maple sugar , honey  --  these were Dame Nature 's gifts to the settlers . But it took long days of labor to get them , other days to prepare them . The lady did not hand out her meals ready prepared on platters . Surprisingly the corn had come on after the rains abated . Though some of it washed out , too late to be replanted , neverthelessthere was enough in the fields for home use . All fall and winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost prohibitive in price . No one could make such palatable things out of it , or such a variety of dishes as the Martin women . Cornbread , hasty-pudding , Indian pudding , johnny-cake , white pot , muffins , gruel , griddle-cakes , dodgers , samp , creamed dried corn , hominy , Indian dumplings , apple corn-cake .. . " I hope there ai n't a grain of corn-meal in heaven , " was Melinda 's grumbling wish until she stopped suddenly to remember that even now she might have been there to find out . Because of that high water all summer , the steamboat plied back and forth from Cedar Rapids to Prairie Rapids , but it could not go on up to Sturgis Falls . A brush and frame dam had fixed all that . Once it brought nothing but salt so that the whole Valley could turn to making salt-rising bread if it wished . Optimistically steamboats were being built to carry goods betweenSt . Louis and Prairie Rapids , but it was to turn out that nothing much would come of this long-distance venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Nebraska , was being constructed to Cedar Rapids and there was much talk that it might send a branch line up the Valley . On a fine fall day Wayne Lockwood and Ed Armitage drove the girls on an all-day jaunt away up to Turkey Foot Forks to see an Indian council taking place . When Wayne came over to ask them if they wanted to see it , Melinda said at once enthu/siastically that she did n't know anything she would rather do . The girls all hooted and reminded her that she would have said the very same thing if the boys had asked them to go over to the creek to see a school of minnows swimming , proving that their recent unusual regard for her was waning . When they got back in the evening they were full of talk about the powwow with its peace-pipe smoking between the Pottawattomies and the Winnebagoes , and laughing that Suzannehad her first proposal . A squaw had tried to take the green silk parasol away from her , they told Ma , and Suzanne had held onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands off , so that a young buck , grinning , had come over and made her understand he was impressed and wanted her for his own . Jeremiah came home from town while they were telling it , so he , too , must hear at once how Suzanne had been almost of a mind to stay with the good-looking Winnebago . And right beforeWayne Lockwood , Phoebe Lou said : " He looked for all the world like Wayne would look if he had walnut juice on him , wild-turkey feathers in his hair , and elk teeth around his neck . " They all laughed at Suzanne 's red face , telling her it was silly to care what an old Injun said . But Suzanne 's face was not red because of the Indian . When they were still laughing at her , Jeremiah said he had a piece of news , too . George Clark over at the Falls had brought one of the new kerosene lamps with him from Illinois . It had a glass bowl through which you could see the oil just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wick that turned up or down for a high or low flame , and a glass chimney . He was enthusiastic in the telling , as he always was with the new , and wanted to be the next in the community to own one , but Sarah had something to say about that . " What does this oil cost ? " Well , he guessed maybe if he heard George Clark rightly ,  | George had paid a dollar and a half a gallon for it , but he bet it would get cheaper . " And how about this glass chimney  --  what do you do to take care of that ? " Well , he guessed maybe it got smudged up pretty easy and you had to wash it every day , but just the same they 'd be in use everywhere in a few years . Sarah sniffed . " I 'll stick to candles . " It was only the next day that Ambrose drove down from the north prairie to tell them that Jeanie had had her baby , the tone of his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl , and the sex , too , appeared to be a dereliction of Jeanie 's . Also he was sorry to report confidentially to her parents that she had lost control of herself during what was only a natural procedure . Sarah , with set lips , slapped together some belongings , gave multitudinous directions to the girls , and left with her son-inlaw , her little wiry figure in its black bonnet as erect and stiff as a poker on the seat of a lumber wagon jolting along north over the prairie.  | J EREMIAH MARTIN 'S entrance into the lean-to , wiping his feet for dust on Sarah 's piece of old rag carpet by the door , scraping mud , or stomping snow , was a signal for all to cease their labors to hear what Pa had to say . He was a magnet which drew all community and state news . Nothing escaped his listening ear . From newspaper , neighbor , townsmen , stagedriver , traveler , peddler , drummer , he gathered to himself all the happenings everywhere as a lodestone draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs shook off water when they came out of the slough . Lately he had been hearing a lot more underground talk about that fellow John Brown , living down in Cedar County among the Quakers and so fanaticalabout the slavery question . Now he 'd actually made a raid over into Missouri , freeing a dozen slaves who were supposed to be right here in our state hiding somewhere . All fall it was a never failing topic of the wrong of owning black people , and whether if John Brown came right to the lean-to door with slaves , the Martins would help hide them , with Pa saying they certainly would and Sarah not so sure she was that much interested in them . A Miss Cotton taught the home school all winter , a strongminded , capable woman in her thirties , who had come from Ohio to see what the new west was like . Of the Martin girls only Suzanne was still in school , one of the two oldest pupils whom Miss Cotton introduced to the mysterious thing called algebra and the diagramming of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the small blackboard . Miss Cotton said Suzanne had an excellent mind and that it was too bad to think that her schooling was to be over in this spring of 1859 . Furthermore , Miss Cotton said , the two times she had left the children under Suzanne 's care proved that she would make a good teacher . It gave Suzanne a thrill of self-confidence and ambition to take the county teacher 's examinations . And then all at once Jeremiah had a new interest and a new topic of conversation . The Horticultural and Literary Society had been formed by Mr. Peter Melendy , one of Sturgis Falls ' most prominent citizens , and as Sarah told the girls , " Pa was in his element to be going to something where there was plenty of opportunity to talk all night . " There were plans for festivities in Overman Hall , oyster suppers and debates , prizes to be given later for good gardens , maybe the beginning of a library . An English family by the name of Bancroft , who had been seven weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started a real greenhouse . Jeremiah , enthusiastic over the improvements , said it looked as though the community would blossom like the rose . Sarah sniffed and said it looked as though all the roses would blossom over at town and the Martins could get along with burdock and pepper grass . By fall Mr. Melendy , the Overmans , and Jeremiah had laid plans for a lecture course for the winter , local men to talk on their favorite topics . Mr. Melendy 's was to be " Horticulture , " Jeremiah 's " Agriculture , " while the press , the bar , and the pulpit were to be vocally represented . Suzanne 's plans for taking a teacher 's examinations went into nothing because Phoebe Lou was helping the Horace Akins , Melinda was up on the north prairie at the Emersons ' , Celiap239was over at town as an apprentice in the new milliner shop , and so she was needed at home . It seemed very queer to her to be through school , as though something told her that this must not be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying that she craved knowing more about those things of which Miss Cotton had given her glimpses . It was as though you could look up a long road and see pleasant experiences all along the way . She believed she would read all the books in the world if she had a chance . So she reread the copies of the Atlantic and Harper 's Weekly , The Indian Lover , A Mother 's Recompense , The Parlor Annual , and all those sentimental poems which Emily cut and pasted in the old agricultural reports . Jeremiah sympathized with her , said that anybody who craved knowledge ought not be kept from it and that , by granny , if there was a school near-by for older pupils he would be of a mind to see that she went . All this was scarcely understandable to Celia who was more than glad to be rid of the dry lessons and into the silks and velvets of the little shop in Sturgis Falls . In those moments of confidence when the two girls were buried under an avalancheof goose feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia sometimes told Suzanne just what her plans for the future included . She was ready to marry now any time , was quite clear-headed about it and to Suzanne 's way of thinking not in the least romantic . She would marry with her eyes open , she said , and so far there was no one she really wanted . She called the roll of eligibles , including a few in Prairie Rapids whom she did not know , giving their status in her own mind with complete freedom and frankness . She would choose some one with lots of life and , above all , with plenty of land or town prospects . There was Cady Bedson for one  --  he was getting ahead fast , Pa said . He and Tom Bostwick knew how to buy cheap and sell for plenty . She had thoughtp240of Wayne Lockwood some recently , but he was too seriousminded , and Emily showed pretty plain that she liked him . Suzanne , with her head in the cup of her arm on her pillow , felt her heart pounding foolishly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick out a man . " " Oh , yes , you can . " Miss Celia 's approach was nothing if not practical . Sometimes Suzanne wished she could be more like her . And now as though in answer to Suzanne 's craving for readingcame an unexpected and wonderful book from Aunt Harriet . It was called Uncle Tom 's Cabin and Jeremiah read it aloud by the fireplace every night that fall while Sarah , Emily , and Suzanne sewed carpet rags . They all grew so excited that often when a big ball of sewed rags rolled off no one would retrieve it until the end of the chapter . Sometimes Jeremiah would lay the book down and tramp around the room to cool off because of the contents . Suzanne , not able to wait for another evening of reading , often went into Ma 's room and took the book out from the walnut bureau , climbed the loft ladder with it , and read on ahead , answering " Making beds " to Ma 's callingup to know what she was doing . They talked almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when Jeremiah read how an assistant editor of the New York Independent , who was a relative of Banker Leavitt in Prairie Rapids , was rotten-egged for conducting an antislaverymeeting and would not allow the egg-stain cleansed from his coat , averring that it was a mark of honor , he made the man a hero , talking about him to every one he met . Two other important events occurred that fall . The Honorable Jeremiah Martin was reelected to the legislature and the Dubuqueand Pacific Railroad was completed to Independence . Trains came two-thirds of the long distance now so that grain had to be hauled only about thirty miles . That was an improvementover the old hundred-mile trip , but even so , the talk ofp241further building died down and it looked as though that stretch of country between the two points was not to see an engine yet for some time . Christmas came on with every one at home for Christmas Eve and a family sing around the fireplace , all the beds filled and some pallets on the floor , and a big dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old John Brown had been hung . " They think they 're crushing antislavery sentiment , " Jeremiahtold the family , " but they 'll find they 've made it worse . This may even be the thing that will split the country . . . all this disunion talk ca n't go on . " And then almost before they could realize it , January had arrived , the year of 186o was here , beginning a new decade , and it was time for Jeremiah to leave for Des Moines again . This trip was not to be taken on horseback . The newly elected SenatorPowers of New Hampton was driving through in a wagon with his young bride , and Jeremiah and representatives from two other counties were to join them at Sturgis Falls and all go together . There was not so much excitement over the leaving this time . Pa was a man of the world now . He had mingled with senators , state representatives , and the governor . He had held his own on the floor of the house , served on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told a big lawyer to speak loway language so they could all understand what he was trying to say , given the legislators more than one good old bellylaughat the dry wit with which he took the wind out of some orator 's full-blowing sails . The wag of the house , they called him . No , the family had less fear now to see Pa disappear into the snow-locked southwest . There was a farewell dinner for him on New Year 's with all the family present but Jeanie and Melinda . It rather spoiled the day for the others to think of Jeanie away up there on the north prairie , not well enough to come back so soon for the day , knowing how she would wish to be with them . At ChristmastimeAmbrose had asked one of the girls to go home with them to help . He explained the situation with cold austerity , as though Jeanie had overstepped the bounds of good taste in expecting a second child , so that after he had gone Sarah said the Lord 's biggest mistake was making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was anxious to go , but every one knew that by now she would be wanting to cone back home . Sabina and Tom drove out in their new cutter , both to see Jeremiah before he left and to celebrate their wedding anniversary . " Five years and no sign yet . What do you make out of that ? " Sarah whispered to Emily in the dark buttery where the walls were frost-laden and the shelves held six dried-apple pies , frozen solid but ready to be thawed out and eaten during the week . The two Akin families and the Mansons all drove in at differenttimes in the afternoon to see Jeremiah before he left , and still later Ed Armitage and Wayne Lockwood rode over . Ed had been to Missouri but was now back , full of talk about going to Colorado and mining . Gold was just thick in the mountains around the city of Denver . He told Phoebe Lou he bet she 'd look nice in earrings made out of gold ore . The other girls all laughed at that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore that would be dangling from her ears . But , surprisingly , for the first time , Phoebe Lou would not laugh with them . She looked frightenedinstead and said , " Oh , Ed , you do n't mean it , do you ? " The Burrills had sent word for the girls to go up to the cemetery when spring came and put wild flowers on Evangeline'sgrave and maybe build a little fence around it so the wolves could n't dig into it . A family by the name of Beard had bought the Burrill place and would move there in thep243spring . It was queer to think that already a settler had moved away from the river road where so very few years ago every one was just moving in . The morning of the third of January Jeremiah left for Sturgis Falls to join the other legislators and the newly elected senator and his bride . It was snowing and twenty below zero . Henry said if the wind got any harder it would turn into an old blizzard of a storm . It worried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than last time , " Sarah said with unaccustomed gentleness . " A big storm on that long trip would n't do you no good . " " Ho ! " He made light of it . " This wo n't be the first storm I 've bucked . We 'll pull through . " They all clustered about the lean-to door to see him off , Sarah , Lucy , little Nora , nearly four now , Emily , and Suzanne . He would say his farewells to Phoebe Lou when he passed the Akins ' . Celia and Sabina he would see in town . But Jeanie and Melinda on the north prairie were too far away . Suzanne fastened the gray shawl with the pin made from a darning-needle . Ma had built up the head with new sealing-wax . And now there was that old feeling which was half sadness , half fear of something happening  --  an emotion which Suzanne knew all were experiencing but not allowing to come into the open . The whole family was like that , she thought , never wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover it . But you knew the feeling was there underneath like timber moss under sodden leaves in the springtime . Phineas drove up from the stable , the bells on Lassie and Laddie jingling . He had put on the bells not so much for their elegance as that the snow was getting more dense and they would signal the presence of the team on the road . Henry , too , came up from the stable where he had been looking after old Queen who was acting a little under the weather . He had just turned thirty , but with his heavy black beard and sober ways , one would have taken him to be nearly as old as Jeremiah . " Well , good-by , all . Take care of yourself , Sarah . " Pa had n't called her that since the day he left two years ago . " Good-by , Jeremiah . " " Good-by , Pa . " " Good luck to you all . Good-by . " Remembering how sad she felt that other time , with no other emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pa and his big duties . The county just about could n't get along without him , nor the Valley  --  maybe the whole state . Lassie 's and Laddie 's huge shaggy legs , the hair clotted with snow , pulled out of the drifts and were off . The bells jangled all the way out of the yard with Pa waving his arm and lookingback . By the time the sled had started up the river road toward town it was lost to sight in the thickly falling snow , but you could still hear the bells faintly . The family was anxious to hear from him but there was not that deep worry connected with it which they had known when he went alone . The weather was even worse this time , however . The snows raged all through January , piled over the west windows of the lean-to , formed great drifts everywhere , across the tree-trunk stoop , up to the roofs of the low outbuildings , over parts of the stake-and-rider fence so that in some places it was completely obliterated , in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sifted on the girls ' beds in the night , giving the pieced comforts new and varied designs each morning . Every evening Sarah brought her milk and eggs into the main room near the fireplace , for the fire in the wood stove was allowed to go out in the night . In the morning she was always up first to find the lean-to as cold as out-of-doors , its windows opaque with white whiskers of frost , the water-pail frozen solid , and if by chance the smoked ham or side meat had been left out there inadvertently , it had to be cut with an ax.  |p245Through  all this Jeremiah and the other two representatives , and Senator Powers and his bride , had driven in a wagon the long way to Des Moines . Small wonder the folks at home wereanxious to hear . When the letter came it was directed to Henry  --  a largepiece of writing-paper folded with the blank side out and sealed with wax from the shawl pin , and inside it opened the discourseto his son with the words : My trusted friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Suzanne thought , as she listened  --  he was always so faithful here at home whilePa went away . They had pulled through . The cold grew more severe as they crossed the prairie in Grundy County . Senator Powers ' bride almost froze to death and the couple stopped in Steamboat Rock , but he and the other two went on to Eldora where theystayed at the tavern . They got to the town of Nevada on the second day and had a very decent bed and deep sleep . ThePowers couple joined them here and they proceeded together again toward Des Moines . However , they took the wrong trail , lost their way , and , when night came , were still many milesfrom Des Moines . They stopped at a cabin and asked for shelter but were told by a bumptious man to move on . I shall now relate the happenings to you , for I done what my conscience told me to do . I jumped out of the Sleigh and told the party to unload at once , that there was ample room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man by storm , replenished his fire and settled ourselves to warm when another load arrived , which had lost their way . These too I invited in . I took complete Possessionof the house , ordered our men to take down the beds and make more room on the floor , turn the Cattle out of the straw barn and housed our Steeds therein . We brought in our robes and blankets and made a bed for the Bride and Groom in the shed . I was loath to oversee a man under his own roof but when one so far forgets the rules of Christianity and Hospitality  --  which be in many ways the same thing  --  I shall ever deem it my duty to set him straight.  | They all discussed for a time what Pa had done until Henry said to come now , he was going to get on with the letter . Pa said they found they were but eleven miles from Des Moines so they reached their destination at the hotel at the foot of Capitol Hill before noon the next day . Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humdinger . Kirkwood may have been a plain farmer and miller but he hit the nail square on the head with his common sense . He made it plain he would ignore threats of disunion and insist to the utmost that the union be preserved . The serious outcome now was that the Democrats were fighting against letting the address be published , claiming it was biased in opinion , upholding the John Brown affair , and openly accusing northern Democrats of ignoring real northern sentiment . The letter closed by saying all good feeling shown at the opening of the Assembly was over and the two parties had gone to their corners like fighters glowering at each other . There was much talk of gold-seeking in Colorado so they could tell Ed Armitage he had company a-plenty in his schemes . The town of Des Moines was coming on now , quite a noticeable improvementbetween this and the other session . What the state needed was railroads . He hoped they were all in their usual health . He was their obedient servant . Into the warmth of the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plum and crab-apple blossoms , Dutchman'sbreechesand bluebells thick in the timber back of the river road , came more of that strange and serious antislavery talk . It came in constantly by stage and steamboat , by newspaper and letter  --  seeping into the Valley as the waters of the Cedar seep into the lowlands in the springtime . The Iowa prairies , newly settled as they were , and isolated from the country 's more thickly populated centers , were nonethelessshaken with the threats that rumbled underneath themp247like tremors of an impending quake . All up and down the river road men drew teams up side by side to ask each other what in tunkit the country was coming to . When he came home from the legislature , Jeremiah Martin was one of the most talkative of these participants . Although he went back into his corn lands with a great show of settling down , yet was he doing less and less of actual field work . There was always a hired man up in the loft with Phineas now . Sometimeshe worked for small wages , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phineas , and the hired man of the moment worked the place , with the girls helping out when necessary , and little wiry Sarah always there to have the last word in a decision . So more and more was Jeremiah speaking his mind by rail fences and beneath roadside elms , in stable doorways and under the wooden awnings of new store buildings . One foot up on a rail or a tree log , a wagon-wheel hub or high wooden sidewalk , his big knotted hands gesticulating , his crisp black beard straggling over the bosom of the clean blue shirt with which Sarah kept him constantly supplied , he discussedthe country 's political situation with whoever would listen . Starting to town in the morning with wood or grain for delivery , he might not arrive home until after dark , when the supper things would be put away and only his plate left on one end of the long table surrounded by a little group of covered dishes , with Sarah scolding that Pa had no sense of time when he had any one backed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president and all other candidates , and thus put an end to slavery in the new states and extravaganceand corruption in public office , was his life-work now . Every waking thought was to this end , every hour he spent in anything but furthering the cause was so much wasted time . The new Republican party was to be the country 's life-saver . Whatever man might be nominated its standard-bearer must be a Messiah . Providence and the new Republican party would work hand in hand , and if either one failed , all was lost . Conversation was almost entirely political whenever Pa was in the house . Sarah and the girls entered into it with vehement one-sided partisanship , enjoying thoroughly the opportunity to say malicious things about those old Democrats and the dumb Whigs and Stephen Douglas  --  Celia alone holding out for his good looks  --  enjoying each other 's sharp jokes about them and laughing hilariously at some unusually tart remark . If politics kept them all stirred up there was one other equally disturbing factor in the household conversations this spring . Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out to Denver City to hunt for gold . No one knew just when Ed 's jovial persistency began to make an impression on Phoebe Lou , but somewhere along the line during the years , that good-natured if violent clashing about had done its work , and now whatever Ed planned to do next was of deep interest to Phoebe Lou . As he was constantly talking some new venture , no one was surprised that gold-hunting in the Rockies came next on the program . Since the family first knew him he had farmed for his brother-in-law , gone to Missouri , returned because of his fascination for Phoebe Lou 's teasing ways , clerked in Mullarky'sstore , bought an eighty on credit , sold it the same way , driven a stage for two trips , purchased some sheep , sold them in three weeks , built a stable for Mel Manson one summer that fell suddenly and noisily over on its side during a spurt of wind in the autumn . But he had a dashing way with him and Phoebe Lou said she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I declare , Phoebe Lou , I 'd as soon think of marryin ' a Winnebagoand takin ' my chance of settlin ' down , " Sarah said with her usual candor . " It 'll be like tyin ' yourself to a dragon-fly  --   |p249you  'll be always dartin ' and skimmin ' around with a man never having any plan in his head or lightin ' more'n a minute . " But according to Ed if one could only arrive safely in Colorado , it followed that one immediately picked up gold on ledges in the Rocky Mountains . He made it sound so plausible to Phoebe Lou that she began to visualize the ledges as looking rather like Ma 's buttery shelves with the gold chunks arranged in as symmetrical order on them as the stone jars . All this gold talk called for more scolding on the part of Sarah . " A fly-up-the-creek if there ever was one . " Even Jeremiah mildly admitted that Ed was not always practical . " That 's a polite way to say it , " Sarah snorted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tom Bostwick sided in with Sarah and said a great deal against the Colorado scheme , too . Even though he himself had made a little money from his California trip in ' 49 , had momentsin which he wished he had stayed out there to grow up with the country , he was conservative , wanted always to be on the safe side , was satisfied that he had decided to cast his lot with this midland state and its agriculture . He was makingmoney right along in Sturgis Falls . " There 's plenty to be made here if you keep your eyes open , " he was wont to say . So he put up two store buildings and loaned out cash privately in addition to a partnership with Cady Bedson of Prairie Rapids buying and selling grain and cattle . Sabina often told the folks Tom had his heart set on building one of the nicest houses in town some day . But because Jeremiah had a streak of adventure in him or because of his interest in everything which lay beyond his stake-and-rider fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so deeply resentful of Ed Armitage 's large talk about taking one of her girls far afield , he feigned a deep inter/est in Ed 's plan , really thinking that Ed was but wanting to impress Phoebe Lou . So he read everything about Colorado he could find , enjoying Sarah 's acrid comments . " See here , Ma , " he would say , " see what the editor of the New York Tribune wrote home from Denver City , Rocky Mountains . " Sarah sniffed . " Who 's he ? " " Name 's Horace Greeley . Writes , I am here in the vicinity of the gold-diggings nearly half-way across the continent , although only one-half of the way through my journey . I have a lame leg caused by an upset of the express wagon , which has bothered me a good deal and will keep me here for the next week . I have been riding almost constantly since my accident and have spent the last three clays climbing the Rocky Mountainsand looking through the new gold-diggings . There is gold here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . " Jeremiah had run into an argument on Sarah 's side and was surreptitiously attempting to abandon the reading . Sensing it , Sarah demanded that he finish , so that he read rather mumblingly : " But it is harder to get by digging than in almost any other way . A few will make fortunes here , but many will lose all and go away utterly bankrupt . ' " " So that 's what you 'd let your girl run her head into ? " " Now , Ma , you moved out here with me . " " Yes , and sometimes I think more 's the pity we come . At least I had stairs back in York State . " " Why , Ma , you and me will be climbin ' the golden stairs togethersome day . " He laughed long and heartily at the thought . " Then you 'll feel foolish you made such a fuss about any other kind . " But Sarah would not laugh . Stairs were serious matters . Suzanne could not understand Phoebe Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as though all the Martin girls had minds of their own until they fell under thep251spell of some man . Sabina thought what Tom Bostwick said was the law of the land . " Tom says ... " " Tom thinks ... " " Tom believes . . . " Jeanie had been putty in Ambrose Willshire'shands . And now Phoebe Lou ... ! " You do n't want to go away out there , do you , Phoebe Lou ? " " Why , of course not . I could n't bear it . " " Then say so to him . " Suzanne was beginning to be alarmed at the continued threat of his going , sensing that what had started as a joke might turn out seriously . " Let him know how you feel . Have some backbone . " " Wait till you lo  --  like a man , Suzanne . You 'll be willing to go where he does . " " Oh , your grandmother 's eye-tooth ! There is n't any man in the world I could ever think that much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was there one man in the world with whom she would go to the wilds of Colorado  --  or anywhere  --  if she had a chance ?  |p252ALL  of Ed Arnmitage 's continuous talk about going to thewilds of Colorado to pick gold off the ledges was unimportantnow . And all the antislavery and threats of secession talk at the table and on the front stoop , faded into the backgroundby the side of the fact that a big new house was going up on the river road . Being built by new-corners , too . Their name was Scott and they were from some place down south . Some said Kentucky , some said Virginia , others held out for Tennessee or North Carolina  --  the roll-call of the southern states was made in the various arguments over it . No two people agreed on the facts of the news , except on the points that a Mr. Scott had bought the Mansons ' land lying to the west of the Martins ' and was to put up a big house far back from the road , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Wayne Lockwood 's . Mr. Scott had appeared out of the sky , even though by way of the stage from Jesup , the railroad having crept a few miles nearer to Prairie Rapids now . The negotiation for the land was made through a real-estate man in Sturgis Falls , the house plan left to a carpenter with instructions to get all the help he could and push the work . And the mysterious Mr. Scott disappeared again over the horizon via the stage . Lumber and supplies began arriving by team , and the greatestexcitement prevailed along the river road since the Indian scares and the court-house scrap . Not even the talk of war loomed as large , for , after all , that was a mere threat which would probably never materialize , while this big new house set sop253queerly away off the road was a reality . One saw it go up before one 's eyes , that is , if one 's eyes were keen , for by that most unaccommodating performance on the part of the owner in building it so far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after all , it took a bit of nerve to drive with no excuse whatever down the long trail the supply teams were making at the edge of Mr. Manson 's old corn-field , merely to satisfy one 's curiosity and return to the river road . Not a day passed that Phoebe Lou or Suzanne , Emily , Melinda or Celia , depending on which ones were at home , did not climb the ladder to the loft and train the spy-glass over on the activitiesdown there in the timber at the west end of the slough . It became their favorite indoor sport to see if they could detect anything new from day to day . In the last of April the Republican county convention went into session at the new brick Prairie Rapids court-house . Jeremiah , making ready to go in clean shirt and freshly greased boots , was twitted considerably by Sarah who reminded him that time was when he would n't have set foot in Prairie Rapids itself , let alone the court-house . But Jeremiah was above such small feuds these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , large-hearted and forgiving toward Prairie Rapids . Such battles as he carried on now were in a wider sphere , their sole object the complete political annihilationof the dumb and dastardly Democrats . Those who attended the convention composed almost a rollcallof the settlers who had first broken sod in the Valley . When he came back Jeremiah said quite casually that he had been chosen to go to the state convention in Iowa City . Yes , life for Pa was just one long journeying to far distant points , his days just one unending succession of meetings . " You might be one sent to the national convention , Pa . " Suzanne felt there was no limit to Pa 's potential activities.  |p254But  Jeremiah retained at least a semblance of self-depreciation . " Oh , I would n't say that . " When he got back from Iowa City via the evening stage , having walked part way out home until overtaken by a neighbor , he had to report that he was not a delegate to Chicago . " Now you can settle down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah said . Jeremiah agreed cheer fully that he could do so and , as soon as he changed his clothes , went out to the stable to fuss around there , not wanting Sarah or the girls to know how chagrined he was in being overlooked . Every one must have some disappointments , he told himself , in old Queen 's stall . He 'd sailed along a little too fast maybe . ' Twas n't good for you to have things come your way too much . All that month of May in the fields , with the smell of the mellow loam in his nostrils and the prairie larks singing from the rail fence , he held himself to his farm work even while his thoughts were on the country and its problems , on the coming convention and the crucial moment of its choosing the candidate . By the middle of May the Scotts ' house emerged into a skeleton of pine uprights shining white against the green timber . And then on a gray day Mr. Scott reappeared to supervise the finishing . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro men were with him , all driving through from Dubuque in a fine carriage pulled by spanking bays . And now gossip flew about that the ladies of the family were in Dubuque awaiting word of the house being finished before arriving . The information was followed by the astounding news that they were bringing a woman slave and her children . " But you ca n't bring slaves into Iowa . " " Who said you could n't ? " " The Missouri Compromise bill said you could n't . " " Oh , I do n't believe it had anything to do with us. "  | " What can be done to stop ' em ? " " I 'd like to see anybody flaunt a slave under our very noses . " Oh , my goodness  --  was there any place else in the Union where life was so exciting ? Even Wayne Lockwood , generally oblivious to gossip , attendingto his own business with his usual characteristic steadiness , was drawn into much conversation over it with others in the community . Speculation was rife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not in sympathy with this secessiontalk . Some had heard the niggers they were bringing were free . " Well , they 'd better be . " Not all niggers were slaves . Look at old Bunk over in town at the Overmans ' . Free as air ! Just lived there and did chores . Some said they came because of this growing talk of war , that they did not want the son to have to fight in case the worst happened . " That 's a pretty excuse , " Jeremiah said , " and I do n't believe it . If there 's to be war , he 's got to fight on some side . They would n't move here now if they was in sympathy with this secessiontalk . Those ai n't slaves , mark my word . He would n't try that on Ioway . " " Oh , Pa , not everybody would have to fight ! " The girls were saying it almost simultaneously , each thinking of a different person as she spoke , unless , perchance , Emily 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd hate to be the one that did n't shoulder arms . " " Maybe these Scotts do n't believe in slaves and just want to live where other people think that way , too . " " I ca n't reconcile the fact the niggers are with them , though . " Around in a circle , all the talk came back to , " Maybe the niggers wanted to come along . " The whole community was a living question-mark.  |p256On  that morning in May , Jeremiah felt that he could scarcely stand the slowness of passing time of this day and the ones to follow until he could hear what was being done in the Chicago national convention . At breakfast when the family gathered about the table where dishes of fried potatoes , sausage , and great platters of fried corn-meal mush waited to be consumed in little ponds of maple syrup , all were surprised and almost embarrassed to hear their father add to that familiar prayer of " Bless this food to Thy glory , " a mumbled " and be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must justify himself before them for having reminded the Lord to attend the conventionhe gave them a rambling and long-winded peroration about the vital issues that would be discussed on the floor . All through the day in the field where he held himself strictly to the first cultivating as though to do penance humbly for expectingtoo much honor , he ached with the wish to be in the convention in the thick of the fight with the smoke and the stale air and the arguments . What was going on now ? Why could n't there be some way to hear it ? There was an instrument called the telegraph . Why in tunkit could n't there be such an invention as hearing the speeches and the bitter words of the battle ? But he put the foolish thought out of his mind , visualizing the leaders walking about the caucus rooms , haggard , sleepless , working hard for their candidates . Who was being nominated ? Chase ? . . . Seward ? . . . Lincoln ? He was for Lincoln , lock , stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom had cone through many an argument , Tom often saying , " Can you think of him meeting with some of those eastern men ... breaking out into one of those backwoodsystories of his . . . with his feet on a desk ? " Well , if meeting eastern men was all there was to it ... They heard results in record-breaking time , the very night followingthe day of nominations . The papers containing the re/suits came on through Dubuque to Jesup by train and were hurried out by stage , so that night had barely fallen when the news came . Jeremiah , standing with the crowd around the stagedriverat Sturgis Falls , heard it from him before any one had a chance to see a paper . It was Abraham Lincoln . Tom Bostwick , half angered , half relieved , admitted : " All right ... I give up . Maybe he 'll make up in judgment what he lacks in polish . " " You can put polish on everything from hair to shoes , " Jeremiah told him , heatedly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gumption like Abe Lincoln 's been born with . " There was yelling , back-slapping , hand-shaking . Several of the Republicans slipped over to the saloon to celebrate and to drink to the hope of Lincoln 's election . Several Democrats slipped along to drink to the doom of it . Jeremiah did not yell nor back-slap nor drink . He walked quietly over to Queen , mounted her , and rode home over the river road through the deepening prairie twilight . The clammy odor of fresh herbage came from the fields across the stakeand-riderfences . A white mist settled down in the hollows at the roadside . Frogs croaked . There was the feel of green groping things . Abraham Lincoln ! That gangling , honest , smart , tarnationhomelyold rail-splitter ! Abe Lincoln , who saw eye to eye with him in everything , whose speeches were just what he would have said if he could talk easy ! Abe Lincoln , who was of his kind , whose very blood seemed to flow in his own veins ! Abe Lincoln , who had been a settler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joked and cussed , who hadexperienced cold and hunger , faced storms and an irate woman ! Abe Lincoln , who would never forget the feel of mellowp258loam. .. the sound of the cracking black-snake whip .. . the smell of upturned prairie sod ... ! He pulled his gray shawl around him and spoke sharply to Queen . He must get home to tell Ma and the girls.  | SO many changes in the Valley as there had been during the six years since the youthful Wayne Lockwood walkedinto it across the prairies from Dubuque that sunlit afternoon ! The railroad creeping within twenty-four miles of town and met by the stage was one change . Another Concord stage up the Valley rolled into Sturgis Falls behind four horses in a whirlwind of dust or lumbered through splashing mud , having made connections with the new train there in the growing Cedar Rapids . Eight , ten , a dozen passengers sometimes alighted  --  new-comers , drummers , visiting politicians , an occasional returnedresident who had been visiting " back home . " If there were big changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was no longer the inexperienced youth of eighteen who , lonely and homesick , had written his mother about the loneliness but never the homesickness . He was twenty-four , a man , his own boss , a respected settler . He had raised as good crops as any one , owned a nice flock of sheep for which he had built a shelter bigger than his cabin , so that people joked him about treating his stock better than himself . A hard worker , yet he was ready at all times to dress up and take part in sociables , mass-meetings , singing school , festivities , church services . His cabin was neat even though there were no softening touches to the harsh furnishings excepting that Emily had made curtains for it and covered his big chair . More than one young woman in the Valley would have been glad to add that touch . More than one cast demurely pensive or warmly long/oing eyes toward the young giant whose blond head was set so well on his fine shoulders . But to all these Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself that any girl would let her eyes tell tales out of school until a man had sought her out . When the glances were bold he drew a coat of armor about himself . Sometimes in self-analysis he pondered why this should be . If he had no mind to court one of the modest maidens who yet wore her heart on her sleeve , why not meet one of the audacious-eyed ones on her own terms ? But to this he felt a strange repugnance . Working in the soil and with animals he was a part of Nature herself . He knew the urge of groping , growing things , the force that drove the mating , the mellow feel of Nature at the seeding and the satisfaction of the harvest . But something held him back , some sensitive instinct given him he did not know , excepting as some predilection to those things which were fine and subtle bade him do , excepting as he sensed that a mating for him would satisfy to the fullest only when he desired a girl too deeply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Armitage or Tom Bostwick or Phineas Martin  --  asking why he did not bring a girl to that cabin up the lane road , he made some slight answer , turningit off jestingly with : " Who 'd want to have a flock of sheep for a rival ? " or , " Snide is all the company I 've needed so far . " For how could he say that marriage meant more to him than that the work in his cabin should be done and a woman lie by his side ? How could he tell them that always he carried within himself the thought of a girl whose face was the face of a girl in a cloud ? They would have laughed at him and told him no angel was going to drop out of a cloud into ap261cabin up the lane road , that no unusual girl would seek him out there in the Red Cedar Valley in the year 186o . And for that he knew they would have been right . But even so , he kept his fancy to himself , attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shun femininity nor run after it , but bode his time , feeling completely comfortable only with the Martin girls who were always themselves , always jolly  --  not " girls " at all , just " people . " And sometimes in the evening after the day 's work was done , when he went down the lane road , he let his voice out to its fullest , putting into a melody all this that he carried in his heart but would never tell . Her eyes soft and tender , The violets outvying , And a fairer form was never seen , With her brown silken tresses And checks like the roses , There was none like my darling Daisy Dean . Or perhaps another favorite : Forever shall thy gentle imageIn my memory dwell , And my tears thy lonely grave shall moisten ; Nellie , dear , farewell . He could not know that his voice , carrying across the north prairie its unconscious longing as the bittern calls for its mate , unaccountably stirred the pulses and brought an unwanted mist of tears to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Daisy nor Nellie . For whenever Suzanne heard that voice singing up the lane road she would slip away from the others  --  to the loft bedroom or into the edge of the grove  --  drinking in the song alone for fear some one would notice that which she must conceal . Jeremiah rode home from town on one of those first daysp262in June , tied Queen to a ring in the stable , and hurried to the house . " Ma . . . Emily . . . Suzanne . . . Phoebe Lou ... where be you all ? Here it is . Listen to this . " " What is it now ? " Sarah 's sharp brown eyes peered from under their short sandy lashes . " His acceptance speech . Listen . " He cleared his throat , readingslowly with emphasis on every syllable . " ' I accept the nomination tendered me . . . . Imploring the assistance of Divine Providence and with due regard to the views and feelings of all who were represented in the Convention ; to the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ; . . . perpetual union , harmony , and prosperity of all ... am most happy to cooperate for the practical success of the principles declared by the Convention . ' " Without change of expression or monotonous meter he finished : " **54;5849;TOOLONG ' -Ma-where's-the-shears ? " " What you want of shears ? " " Want to cut this out ... and keep it . ' Want to keep it in my hide trunk for my grandchildren to read . " Prophetic words , that it was to be found seventy-eight years later . The Fourth of July celebration was the most elaborate yet attempted by Sturgis Falls . All morning teams came in from the country-side bringing their loads , lumber wagons with three or four boards across for seats , or chairs arranged along the side , single buggies , double-seated carriages , the horses ' heads decorated with flags , red , white , and blue rosettes , or field flowers wilting under the hot sun . Every girl was gowned in her best from the light calico dresses of the north prairie Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an Overman daughter , young Mrs. Joseph Chase , a bride of three months . There was a parade with girls in white to represent everyp263state , and only brooding Kansas in black because she had been refused admission as a free state . The Declaration of Independence , new songs and old , a sense of the seriousness of the coming election , and the ascensionof a flag-decorated balloon , all stirred together in one long day , brewed a concoction of patriotic fervor that rendered all more or less drunk with the emotion , so that when it was over there was a distinct reaction of fatigue and low spirits . It was a summer of good crops . Wheat headed out into a golden tapestry ready for the cradles . The green corn stood slim and tall in the fields like so many green-blanketed Indian chiefs with yellow feathers in their hair . There was never ceasing labor to break up more new land so that the green and the gold would spill itself out over more acres another year . More wheat ! More corn ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Wayne broke up the last of his acreage , hiring Ed Armitage to hold the plow as he drove ; at the end of every furrow stopping to file anew the dulling plowshare . When the new Scott house , there at the edge of the timber , began to be clothed in garments of snowy white paint and green blinds , every feminine heart between Sturgis Falls and Prairie Rapids fairly ached with envy . To Sarah Martin , remembering her own substantial if plain stone farm-house in York State , scrubbing away on bare planking , running slivers into her hands on occasion , whitewashing walls every spring , trying in vain to hide the blackened , weather-beaten logs of the big cabin with morning-glories , the new house flaunted itself with the same result which a red flannel would have had for old Sandy , Pa 's bull , in the south pasture . She scolded about it at the slightest provocation . " We could have a frame or brick house if Pa would ' tend to his business and get ahead . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county to be looked after and the state . Now lately here 's the whole nation ! He 's got to manage that for a change . ' Twould n't do to let anybody else look after the union and keep the south petted up . " " Now , Ma , this is a real comfortable home , " Jeremiah would soothe her . " The whole family 's got a place to sleep and a place at table to eat . We got good feather-beds . Everybodythat ever comes along the river road stops . Folks like to put up here . They all know nobody can cook like you and the girls . We ai n't codfish aristocracy like a few beginnin ' to come in now over in town . We 're just common folks , but substantial , and everybody conies here from preachers to politicians . " .. " And peddlers . " It still rankled that Pa had bought a Life of Lincoln from a peddler , paying for it by the pound , she told the girls , when it proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only the next day after this placating conversation that , grinning cheerfully over the happy surprise of it , he arrivedhome atop a load of lumber from the Sturgis Falls sawmill , with the announcement that he was going to build on another room for Ma . This he began at once at odd times with the help of Phineas and Melinda , the latter sawing away as vigorously as any man . Finished later in the fall , the addition made the house look more peculiar than ever . Instead of the appearance of two cabins pushed together by some human with herculean power , three now ranged along in capital-I formation with the lean-to on the back , as though a giant 's child in playful mood had built a rambling house of blocks . They called the latest addition " the company room . " It was to contain a stove , lacking completely in the friendliness of the main-room fireplace , a shelf with river shells in a stiff row , cat-tails , bursting milkweed pods , a bed with tester and valance , a rag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on occasion.  |p265But  before it was finished , something happened which made the excitement of a new room , war talk , presidential election , and even gossip over the Scotts moving here with niggers seem idle chatter . Suzanne knew she would never forget the day as long as she lived . It was a warm morning and they were picking wild blackberries in a swampy place at the edge of the timber  --  she and Melinda and Phoebe Lou . Celia was helping Emily and Ma , having fussed so about going out to hurt her complexionthat Ma had let her stay , so that Melinda had a good deal to say about " the high-toned lady living at the Martins ' having her way again . " Suzanne and Melinda squatted or stood by the bushes , but Phoebe Lou lugged a three-legged milk-stool around with her and made a great deal of commotion getting her voluminous skirts fixed on it just so each time . No one wore hoops while at work but their full skirts were much in the way . Stiffly starched Shaker bonnets kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also kept the breeze off and formed exploratory funnels for multitudinous gnats hovering over the purplish berries , so that sometimes the girls took the bonnets off and whacked viciously at the insects . All picked at the same clump of bushes and moved together so they could talk easily , talk being the breath of life to the Martin girls . Just now they were discussing their Chicago cousins , wondering how it would seem to be living in that great city of a hundred thousand and to be able to pick out new dress-goods right in their father 's own store , when some one on horseback came tearing down the river road and into the yard , drawing up suddenly with tight rein so that even from this distance they could see a cloud of dirt flying in all directions . " It 's Ed Armitage , " Suzanne said , and looked hurriedly at Phoebe Lou who was standing there , a little pale , with her berries in one hand and the three-legged stool in the other . " Come on , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suzanne was conscious of something of great import . It was in the air , in the way the horse was pawing and the way the heat shimmered over the prairie , seemingly in the hoarse excited cawing of the crows . Ed came toward them , his dark eyes sparkling and his head thrown back , looking at Phoebe Lou as though neither Celia nor Suzanne existed . " Phoebe Lou . .. we 're going . .. you and me. . with the Gainses to-morrow . I stopped in Prairie Rapids and got the license . It 's right here . " He took a paper from his back pocket , so that all eyes concentrated on the white thing as though it had life . " We 'll be married right away . .. and on our way to Denver City early to-morrow morning . " " Married ... right . . . " Phoebe Lou 's voice caught and could not finish . " Yes . Put your bonnet back on and we 'll ride up the lane road to Squire Marquis . A justice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher . His wife can be witness .... " Sarah had come out to the stoop , her graying sandy hair dragging at its pins , her thin face red from the cook stove . " What 's this ? " Ider voice was sharp . Ed wheeled to her . " Phoebe Lou and me are goin ' up to Justice Marquis to get ... " " That 'll be about all of that from you , Ed Armitage . " Sarah 's head tossed , and her little pinched face set in authoritative lines . " You 'll do nothing of the kind . Phoebe Lou .. . are you still determined to marry Ed , even if you have to go to that jumpin ' - off place with him ? " " Why , yes , Ma .. . if Ed thinks ... " " Then we 'll have a weddin ' right here like white folks . You 're my girl till you get away . Every girl of mine gets mar/ried right here in her own home . There 'll be no slippin ' around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , Ed . " " Oh , well ... anything you say , Phoebe Lou . I just thought ... " " If it 's got to be to-day , we 'll pitch in and be ready by night . Emily . .. Celia ... " Sarah turned to the two behind her . " Go on with your work . Suzanne , go to the field and tell Pa and the boys . Phoebe Lou , you look over what berries you 've got and then take the rest of the day to get yourself and your things ready . Come now , all , stir your stumps . " " I 'll ride to Jeanie 's to tell her , Ma . " Melinda brightened at the prospect of going off the place . " You 'll do no such thing . Men folks can do that . You catch four chickens and kill ' em . Scoot , now . " This wedding was so very different from Sabina 's and Jeanie 's . With only a few hours to prepare , every one turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Sarah 's bedroom with Phoebe 's Lou 's best dress of winecoloredpoplin . There she held communion with herself , a Godey 's Lady 's Book , and a home-made pattern cut from a newspaper , and in the next few hours made over the dress with white collar and cuffs from Aunt Harriet 's last package of finery . Phineas rode up to Jeanie 's on the north prairie to tell her the news and see if she was still able to come . Jeremiah went to town to tell Sabina and ask her to make a cake , with Sarah calling out after him not to so much as speak to a Democrat for fear he 'd forget to come home from the arguing . Only Henry stayed in the wheat field and jogged faithfully along at the binding . Melinda dressed chickens . Celia pared potatoes . Sarah made drop-cakes . Her thin little face twitched nervously and sometimesher mouth trembled . Suzanne helped Phoebe Lou finish the berries and then get together her things , ready to be taken in the morning . There were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave something from her own small supply , Celia her best handkerchief , Emily her good knitted wool scarf , Melinda an apron . Suzanne , her heart warm and tender with the sudden experience , made the supreme sacrifice and put The Indian Lover in the little trunk which Ma brought out from under the bed . In the middle of the afternoon Emily called the other three girls into the bedroom where she was sewing frantically , her red hair tumbled and stringy , and after a hurried conference they presented Phoebe Lou with the company-owned green silk parasol . It made Phoebe Lou cry a little , so that the girls all laughed at her , telling her the parasol would think it had dropped in the Cedar again if she got so much water around . But they all ran out of the room and turned furiously to their work so that she could not see their own telltale eyes . Suzanne thought she could not stand it  --  that intense emotionunder a surface of the commonplace , a torn throbbing feeling as though you must scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the soggy leaves in the springtime . Only this morning they had been laughing and talking over the blackberries as unconcerned as though they had a lifetime to talk together . All summer they had acted as though the Scotts ' new house was the most important thing in the world , and as though a new room was something to be excited about , as though it mattered who the old Republican candidate was and who would be elected . And now this was the only importantthing after all . Phoebe Lou was going away beyond the Great American Desert . You could not comprehend it . It was as though Phoebe Lou was going to die . The only difference would be that this way you could get a letter from her sometimesand you never got word at all from the dead.  |p269There  would be the long journey first to the Missouri River  --  it had taken Wayne Lockwood and Tom Bostwick eighteen days to go and return and even so they were driving horses with no load . Ed and Phoebe Lou and the Gainses could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over two weeks with their loads . And that would be only a start  --  seven hundred miles over the Great American Desert after that , seven times from here to Dubuque . Oh , why did families pull apart this way ? All day she thought of Phoebe Lou as the favorite of her sisters , forgetting that she had known moments of thinking the same about all of them . The little fusses they had indulged in over stemming wild gooseberries or the wearing of a ribbon or Phoebe Lou 's constant teasing , seemed too trivial now for words . When Jeremiah returned home , having been of no mind to talk to Democrat or Republican either , because his girl was going so far away , he fussed out around the stables until evening . Suddenly he had lost his appetite for politics . All his life , when agitated , he had made for the stable . The sound of the guzzling horses and the whacking tails of old Red and Baldy were familiar steadying sounds . The smell of the stock and the manure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good substantial earthy odors that kept his thoughts from running riot . To-day one of his girls was going away , out to the Rocky Mountains , a two-months ' journey , maybe . He did n't want her to . He wanted his family all together . He wanted Sarah by his side , Henry and Phineas not far away . He wanted Jeanie and Sabina within riding distance , Emily , Suzanne , Melinda , and Celia all near . And he wanted Phoebe Lou . Hell , how he wanted Phoebe Lou . He curried Queen with unnecessary precision , thinking all the time of Phoebe Lou going away and wondering if maybe he should try to stop it . He kept telling himself that young folks have always done this thing . He had brought Sarah .. .  |p270by  granny ! He stopped and looked out the stable door to the yellow stubbles after the cutting . Was this the way Sarah 's folks felt in York State when he brought her out to Illinois ? He 'd never fully sensed it before . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens shut in a coop for Phoebe Lou to take . Bewailing that the new company room was not yet finished , Celia and Suzanne fixed up the girls ' loft room for the bridal chamber . They put fresh covers on the barrel-stand and the two barrel-chairs , and pressed out the window curtains with the sad-irons hot from the kitchen stove . There was new white mosquito-netting over the windows and Celia laughed about the years when there had been nothing and the flies and moths and an occasional wandering swallow or bat had pestered them so , saying , as she recalled it , that a person does n't realize how times improve as they go along . But it was as though something dreadful hung over the house to-day , not at all like the times of Sabina 's and Jeanie 's weddings . But because Phoebe Lou must not be allowed to go away feeling sad , they put on a great deal of foolishness , even as they hurried at their tasks . They joked her that Ed was so rattle-headed he might forget her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would n't miss her very much because they 'd be so busy watching the Scotts ' uprisings arid downsittings . And all the time of the joking no one could look another in the eye . Toward evening Ed Armitage , all dressed up , drove into the yard , but now there was no pulling of his horse up so smartly that the dirt and gravel flew about , for he had stolid old oxen and a covered wagon , with his saddle horse hitched to the back and a coop of geese on one side . Emily made them all laugh by saying she could n't imagine Ed Armitage going as slow as those oxen  --  she could just see him getting on the saddle horse and riding around them in circles.  |p271Jeanie  and Ambrose Wiltshire and their little girl came , with Jeanie expecting again so soon that Ambrose said apologeticallyhe was almost ashamed to have her come , and Jeremiah saying , by granny , he 'd have gone up for her , himself , if he 'd thought Ambrose was so delicate-minded . Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sabina and Tom Bostwick came in their nice buggy , Sabina in a new delaine dress so fashionably big and round that her father said she looked like a walking pincushion . She had held the cake on her lap all the way out from town she said , swinging it upward whenever the wheels hit a rut in the road , which made Phoebe Lou ask if they remembered the leaning tower of Pisa , so that they all laughed over the memory , their laughter catchingand breaking because Phoebe Lou would not be joking with them any more . Sabina wondered if Ed and Phoebe Lou would n't rather go over to Sturgis Falls and stay at her house to-night in her company room and the Gainses could meet them there in the morning . Phoebe Lou looked up the loft ladder which she had laughinglymounted so many years with the girls and said : " Yes , Sabina . . . oh , yes , I would . " The minister and his wife came , a little man with black side-whiskers who walked as though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slanted outward and would not allow her mouth to close . Suzanne ran into the south pasture which Pa was letting grow high for winter hay and hurriedly picked long spikes of wild sweet-william , rose-pink and pale pink and the deep magentashade , bringing them in for the mantel and pulling out the long prairie grasses hastily as she ran . Over in the timberlandshe could hear the prolonged plaintive wail of a mourningdove , thinking again as she ran how you never noticed theirp272call unless you were sad and then you heard it and your heart answered back . " Dearly beloved , we are gathered here together in the sight of God and these witnesses ... " Suzanne thought she could not stand it . There would be Christmas dinners and Phoebe Lou not here , Sunday reunions without her  --  Jeanie would have a new baby that Phoebe Lou might never see . Why , maybe they would never all be together again after to-night . You could n't tell what would happen . Never ! Her hand was at her throat which was throbbing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now it was over and Phoebe Lou was smiling up at Ed Armitage because he was her husband , not remembering at all the time she rode away making fun of him behind his back . There was laughter and talk and the hastily cooked wedding supper , and then Ed and Phoebe Lou were ready to leave in the clumsy wagon after Tom and Sabina had gone in their nice buggy . The whole crowd stood there by the stake-and-rider fence to see them off . It was moonlight and warm , but with a mugginessin the air that betokened thunder-showers to come . There had been so very few times for kissing in the Martin family . But this was one . Phoebe Lou kissed every one of them from Pa down to Jeanie 's little girl . And then Mr. Horace Akin swung his arm out , pulled Phoebe Lou up to him , and kissed her , too , so that every one laughed , especially when he said he was going to admit before his wife that Phoebe Lou had always been his favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suzanne , struggling with her tears , felt that if she said anything she would burst into such wild crying that nothing could stop her.  | " Good luck . You 'll pull through all right . " " Do n't drive those fiery oxen too fast . " " Write to us from Nebraska Territory . " Phoebe Lou called back a last word , her voice catching : " Ma ... makes me wish I 'd helped you better . " Sarah 's thin little face twitched and her mouth worked . " Pst ! You was always a good girl , " she said and hurried up the path into the house . " Oh ! " One of Suzanne 's hands was on her throat again , the other clutching the fence top . Why did such things have to be ? The tears were starting now and she was not going to be able to stop them . Suddenly she looked up and there was Wayne Lockwood standing beside her , so tall and stalwart , so cool and undisturbed as he grinned down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , to wake him up and make him feel emotion , too . Something made her say it with hot tears : " Oh , what do you know about feelings ? " He put his hand over Suzanne 's hard little hand clutching the top rail of the fence there as though she would clutch life and hold it to her . " Maybe , Suzanne , " he said quietly , " I know more than you think . "  | PHOEBE LOU was gone beyond the horizon where the prairie sun set so gorgeously these summer nights . So there were only four girls to go laughing up the ladder now , each scrambling to escape the pinching of her ankles by the one behind her . Celia and Suzanne had moved up there at the south end , Emily and Melinda occupying the north end of the room whose sloping sides made one bump her head if she were not careful . All the hot days at this tag end of the summer , Suzanne did her allotted tasks as energetically as ever , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little memory of the evening Phoebe Lou was married , turning it over in her mind to revel in its beauty there in the dark as one might take a jewel from its case and turn it in the sunlight to get the gleam of its facets . The hand that he had touched  --  the left  --  seemed favored above the other . Sometimes there in the dusk she slipped the right hand over it trying to recall the feeling of that firm supple one that had the strength of one of the new steel traps and yet had lain so tenderly on it . Over and over she had repeated the brief conversation to herself , trying to interpret it in various ways . " Oh , what do you know about feelings ? " " Maybe , Suzanne , I know more than you think . " She knew the words with their every voice inflection as well as she knew all the copy-book maxims she had learned at school . They seemed to belong with those other important sayingsof wise people . Honesty is the best policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moss . Maybe , Suzanne , I know more than you think . It had n't even been a game where you are obliged to touch hands . It was all of his own accord . She looked over at Celia lying there so peacefully asleep in her bleached muslin nightgown , milkweed cream on her face and her oldest mitts over her creamed hands , and envied her that complacent way of thinking she was good enough to have any one she wanted . As always Suzanne went back to that possible distressing interpretation for Wayne 's tender gesture . He was merely sorry for her because she was crying at Phoebe Lou 's leaving . " Oh , I do n't want any pity , " she thought , and groaned out loud at the idea of a mere bone of compassion being thrown at her , so that Celia roused and said sleepily : " I bet you ate too many ground-cherries . " " Oh , hush up ! " Suzanne snapped . Romance and groundcherries ! All the wheat was cut and tied , shocked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that Suzanne and Melinda had been obliged to go into the field twice with the boys at a special rushed period . There were so many topics of conversation which could take form at the table these days and around the door-stoop at night that one never lacked for a good talking subject . There was the constant wondering about Phoebe Lou , where she was right now , and how soon the first letter would come . There was the new Female Seminary being built in Prairie Rapids , a big two-story brick , with eastern ladies coming out to run it and Pa saying Celia and Suzanne both ought to go . Neither one was of a mind to do so , Celia complacent that a Female Seminary could do very little for a female who was doing right well for herself , and Suzanne torn between the desire for the better schooling she had once wanted and the secret joy of living where she could hear a horseman come singing down the lane . There was no end to the subject of Abraham Lincoln 's chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really mean secession ? And if there was secession , would the north let them go through with it ? There was the County Fair to be held at Sturgis Falls , with horse-races and stock-showing . Pa had been riding back and forth a lot lately to help get it going . Ma was planning to enter her butter with the water-lily stamped on top and Pa was entering old Sandy , the red bull that acted hateful toward everybody but him and Henry . There was the ever wordy topic of the Scotts ' new house and speculation about them , when were they coming , why were they moving here at all , and the rehashing of the recent sight of the two wagons loaded with household furnishings arriving . There was the prospect of hearing about Jeanie any time , with Ambrose saying he wanted no more girls and Ma telling him to his face he 'd take what he got and like it or lump it . There ' was Sabina telling pridefully that Tom Bostwick was never going to rest easy until he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such bragging . There was the bride , Mrs. Joseph Chase , coming all the way out here to see if Emily would make her a dress because Sabina 's delaine was so pretty . There was Celia saying boldly right out to the whole family that she was ready to get married now any time as soon as she saw somebody who answered specifications . And then there was the new company room with tomboy Melinda sawing away on the lumber for it , climbing up on the roof with her full skirts tied into pant-legs until Ma said she was ashamed to look up there . Oh , life was exciting , with Pa winding the old clock weights behind the American eagle every night and saying : " Day'sp277over ... fresh start to-morrow , " and no telling what all was going to happen to-morrow . My goodness , just imagine Aunt Harriet writing and wanting to know how they put in their time and what they had to amuse themselves with away out there on the prairie in Iowa . Amuse themselves ! " Tell her we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When all other topics failed , that silly thing Aunt Harriet had written once could always be trusted to bring a good laugh . No matter where you lived , the girls agreed , York State or Chicago or near Sturgis Falls or up by the Big Woods or away out in the wilds of Colorado , you could just bet Martin girls could snake themselves a good time . And then , on a late August afternoon with a peculiarly cool tinge in the air vaguely reminiscent of past falls , with the goldenrod and little purple asters beginning to blossom along the river road and cicadas chirping down in Pa 's new apple orchard , Jeremiah ordered Suzanne and Celia to go over to the school-house to scrub it and wash the four glass windows set into logs , two on a side . School would take up after a bit now and he was n't going to have the new teacher think the director who had a school-house right under his nose could n't get it ready . So Celia and Suzanne , growling a little because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pails and rags , carrying water from their well and saying they hoped the day would come when the men would get around to dig one for the school itself . They were almost through , with the benches piled neatly and the windows clean of their summer cobwebs , when Wayne Lockwood rode up on horseback . Without dismounting , he came past an east window opened on its leather hinges and leaning from his horse said : " Hist ! If you want to see something , the stage is coming down the road and black Hi is driving fast up the Scotts ' new field road in the big carriage.  | If I 'm not mistaken you 'll soon have your curiosity satisfied . " Celia squealed and ran first to one window and then another . Suzanne , flustered at the sudden excitement and the fact that Wayne was dismounting and coming in , knocked over a pail of water , so that both girls were breathless with laughter , steppinggingerly through the dirty suds , as he opened the door to join them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia said , " Wayne Lockwood , you 're just as anxious to see them as we are . " The three stayed away from the window but where they could get a view of the open carriage stopping at the corner close to the school , black Hi holding the reins taut over the backs of the stepping blacks . Suzanne did not know which was more exciting , the arriving Scotts or the nearness of that masculine presence of which she was always so keenly aware lately . They could hear the sound of the stage , the harness jangling , and the horses ' hoofs pelting along on the road back of them . And then it was in sight , past the school , and stopping . The young man swung down , in tall beaver hat , with white ruffled shirt front and light gray suit . Mr. Scott got out . The two turned together to assist a lady with a closed parasol and voluminous skirts held carefully away from the dusty weed tops . And then one other was alighting  --  a young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her head a little white straw bonnet from which a blue plume and a long white veil drooped . She stepped down , and in doing so , turned her head toward the school-house so that they could see her pale delicate features . As she stood there looking toward the east and yet not seeing them , a breeze picked up the long white veil and whipped it high about her head . Involuntarily Suzanne glanced up at Wayne . He was staring at the new girl with a queer expression on his face , so thatp279Suzanne 's pounding pulses stopped in sudden questioning of the strange look . And Suzanne , you had reason to question . For , peculiarly , at just that moment , the girl 's face in the flowing white veil looked like the face of a girl in a cloud.  | AUTHENTIC information and wild speculation about the Scotts drifted up and clown the river road in such mixed proportions that no one knew for sure where one left off and the other began . The few items that gave indication of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott , the son George , and the ( laughter whose name was Carlie . The Negroes with them were Hi , his wife Maria , their two children , Plunk and Mamie , and another farm worker called Mose . Why the Scotts had come north and how they happened to choose the Valley were questions which could be answered only by guesswork because of the reticence of all concerned . This secretive characteristic was scarcely understandable to a communitywhose families knew each other 's every activity , and particularly so to Jeremiah whose " I says " and " he says " were the result of so much frank conversation by roadside and field . In the days after their arrival , every one in the vicinity kept talking about going clown to the Scotts ' to make a neighborly call , and nobody went . One wondered why . Certainlyno Martin had ever shown any hesitancy before about riding in to see new neighbors , welcoming them , inviting them over . Even Jeremiah , whose prize joke was that hospitality began with a hors , showed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far back from the road , its very location telling the neighborhood there was to be a certain sort of privacy about it which no other home proclaimed.  | " Somebody ought to invite them to the County Fair , " Jeremiah said . Sarah sniffed . " You better . You own it . " Jeremiah grinned . After all was said and done , he liked Ma 's spunk . You never knew what she was going to say and sometimes it was as smart as a black-snake whip . That last was a pretty sharp come-back when he had spent so much time helping get up the Fair . To the Martin girls the new Carlie Scott living there behind the walls of the white painted farm-house with the green blinds was a medieval princess in her tower or the Grecian Exile in the pages of the Parlor Annual come to life . Whenever they trained the spy-glass in the general direction of the dormer-windowed castle they could almost always catch some picture of activity about the place , the black farm men , the little black children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott or the son . Once they saw Mrs. Scott on the porch , her skirt flaring over hoops , even in the morning , but never did they see so much as a wave of the blue plume or a flutter of the white veil of Carlie . And now all this curiosity was dulled a bit by Phoebe Lou 's first letter . Suzanne got it from the Post Office at Sturgis Falls where she had gone on horseback to spend the afternoon with Sabina in order to tell her more about the Scotts . The Post Office was in a substantial wooden building . One could scarcely believe that Demsey Overman had once carried the mail in his hat , for there were sixteen hundred souls in Sturgis Falls now ( even twelve hundred in little Prairie Rapids ) , to say nothing of the farm people up and down both sides of the river and those who were beginning to locate on the prairie to the west and south of town , all of whom came there for their letters from back home . Suzanne took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater portion of the afternoon wondering whether or not to open it , since it was directed to their mother . Sometimes they were of a mind to do so , knowing that the contents would be written to them all , but just as they were about to break the seal each time , they hesitated , remembering Ma 's sharp tongue . It ended in deciding that discretion was the better part of valor , and Sabina said she would get Tom to drive her out soon to read it , that just getting a letter addressed in Phoebe Lou 's nice shaded hand showed that she was all right . So Suzanne left on Queen , with the letter inside the stays of her basque and the wide skirt of her best blue poplin ballooningup at the side because she had forgotten to pin the little sack of shot inside the hem to hold it down . When she rode at a breakneck gallop into the yard and gave the letter to Sarah who was helping Emily take down the clothes , that unpredictable person said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say you did n't have the gumption to let Sabina read it while you was there ? " No , you just never could guess how Ma would look at anything . Sarah sent little Nora over for Lucy and to the stables to get the men folks in to hear the letter . It was not until they all came , Nora 's brown bare legs flying ahead of the others , that Sarah broke the seal and read it to the assembled group . It had been written at Nebraska City , that far-off place on the other side of the Missouri , a river which no one in the community but Tom Bostwick and Wayne Lockwood had ever seen . Phoebe Lou was writing it on her lap , she said , at the side of the Overland Trail . They had made the trip in two weeks and two days  --  better than two hundred miles  --  and was n't that something to brag about , what with the Gainses ' cattle wandering off the trail constantly and their having to ford several streams . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped over and an old hen of Ma 's  --  the one with the frozen-off toes  --  had drowned . She had squawked and spread out her wings like a scared old lady grabbing at her skirts and gone down . It had made Phoebe Lou feel badly as though something had happened to a real person from home . They had ferried across the Missouri , finding Nebraska City a queer , noisy , rough place full of covered wagons , mules , dust , oxen , prospectors , saloons . Somebody told Ed there were ten black slaves right in the town , and more than that , although she was half afraid to put it down on paper , there was an underground railroad and that John Brown Pa was always talking about had come more than once through here with slaves from Missouri . They were camping now not far from the home of J. Sterling Morton . It was the Mortons , folks said , who had negotiated with the Injuns to turn over their land to the government . They said Mrs. Morton had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . The country had seemed awful wild coming  --  just rolling plains and prairie grass . She was always thinking of them all and when she shut her eyes she could almost see them . She 'd give anything for a drink of cold water from the well or the old spring . " If it was not for Ed I would be very homesick . But I love him ... " Plainly Ma was embarrassed at this bold paragraph , probably thinking how people were foolish to write things they would n't say , but she read on with fortitude : " and as long as I have him and he has me , I guess nothing else matters . " They were ready to start now over the long seven-hundred-mile trail . Ed sent his regards . She was their obedient daughter , Phoebe Lou . Suzanne wanted to read the letter again to herself as she always did , and when Sarah handed it over , she slipped outdoors , down the garden patch , and through the side gate , thinking to go down to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake-and-rider fence where the corners of it met the tim/ber-line , deciding it was too near supper time to go on . There was no one in sight and because she still had on hoops from visiting in town , she pulled them and her skirts high and climbed to the top of the fence , releasing them then so that they sprang out into their round fullness , giving her the appearance of a blue mushroom growing like a parasite on the bark of the rail fence . She re-read the letter , put it in her bosom , and then , chin in hand , sat thinking . " But I love him and as long as I have him and he has me , I guess nothing else matters . " She visualized Phoebe Lou leaving the folks and going off that night with Ed Armitage because she loved him . Other things had happened that night . Maybe , Suzanne , I know more than you think . Suppose , just suppose , that Wayne Lockwood should come through the woods now , while she was sitting elegantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that underbrush , and say right out of a clear sky : " Suzanne , I 've known you for a long time . I love you . I 've loved you ever since I saw you the first day I came to the Valley . I 'm going to Denver , far away , to seek gold . It will be a long hard trip and you wo n't see your folks again for years . But I love you so much I ca n't go without you . " She was living the part now . Emotion swept her body like a warm sweet wave , so that her breath came quickly with the deep feeling . " We 'll go together , Suzanne . " His voice would be low and tender . " Just you and I. It will be hard for you to leave , but I 'll have you and you 'll have me , and nothing else matters . " He would be standing by that wild grape-vine over there  --  no , probably here by this old hickory with the fallen tree-trunk near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stopped to consider how handsome he would look standing that way with his head turned toward her . " We 'll be married to-morrow . No . . . I ca n't delay . To-morrow night we 'll sleep under the stars . . . and even though we hear wolves . . . andp285Indians will be near . . . and wild things . . . nothing will hurt you for I 'll be by your side . Will you , Suzanne , dear one ? " So far , the scene involving the ardent proposal had been confined to that vague locality known to Suzanne 's past childhoodas her magic world , always a place of silence , far from human voice . But now in the warmth of the loved one 's fervor and her own reaction to his imagined emotions , it broke bounds and she said aloud : " Yes ... oh , yes , I will . " " Will what ? " Twigs were snapping . A branch was crackling . And Wayne Lockwood came through the underbrush . No longer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she promptly and completely fell off the fence . Not gracefully , but in an awkward , sidewise tumble , with her hoops catching on one of the stakes and her best ruffled pantalets a prominent part of the picture . In truth , the lady dangled in mid-air . Wayne threw back his head and sent out to the skies hearty male laughter . Even so he was hurrying to disengage the wireand-elasticskeleton structure and its disconcerted owner from their perilous position . " You do n't need to laugh . " Suzanne was fiery red , the combinedeffect of embarrassment and the rushing of blood to a head which normally should have been the other way up . " I 'm sorry , Suzanne . Really I am . " He lifted her down and helped settle her skirts , " And I honestly did n't mean to scare you . " " You did n't scare me . " She was almost tearful . " Well . . . just frightened you then . I was looking for a couple of stray sheep and heard some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merriment again . When the robust laughter died away , he said , " Anyway , I 'm glad I ran across you here alone . "  | He had put a foot up on the log of the fallen hickory tree trunk and was facing her . " Suzanne . . . " He was all seriousness now . " I 've known you a long time . . . ever since the first day I came to the Valley ... " Suzanne 's eyes were fixed on his with fascinated fright . It went through her mind with half-delirious terror that she had done something magic . Some uncanny thing was taking place because of the thoughts she had harbored. " ... and I want to ask you something . " An unseen force was performing a miracle for her . From out the world of imagination by some unknown means she had called an exquisite reality . I-Icr pulses were pounding so loudly that she was afraid he must be hearing them . The familiar trees and undergrowth were swimming in a warm liquid mist . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " would you go down to the Scotts ' on some excuse when you have a chance and find out more about the daughter ? " Like the shocked silence after crashing thunder on the prairie , Suzanne 's beating pulses were numbed . " You want me . . ? " " I hate to ask you . It seems cowardly and underhanded , but I want to get acquainted with her and they seem so stiff and unfriendly , I thought maybe if you could go first and find out a little more about her and tell nie .... You 're the only one I felt I could trust to do it . . . and keep it confidential . " Suzanne moistened her dry lips . " And you ... trust me ? " " Yes . I do n't know just why , Suzanne , but of all you girls ... you 're the one who seems the most ... " His voice trailed away in half-abashed silence . Suzanne said quietly : " All right , Wayne , I will . " They walked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them like a gray veil . Even if he had been attracted by Carlie Scott , that suddennews could not keep her heart from beating fast because hep287was beside her . Even if she was only a neighbor girl that he trusted , the knowledge of that ordinary and uninteresting place she held in his mind could not keep her from feeling his nearness . The main thing was never to let him know . Keep your head up and do n't let him see how you feel , she told herself sternly , summoning to her aid all those things her father was always saying . Life has to be met squarely . You ca n't always have things the way you want . Pull yourself on through . Once for a few moments he took her hand to jump across the old hardened furrows of the garden so that her pulses , with no apparent intention of obeying , quickened violently to the touch . At once she turned on that traitorous throbbing with scorn . Stop that . Face facts . She had always said not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't she ? That included herself , did n't it ? She had imagined some lovely girl for him , had n't she ? Well , here she was  --  Carlie Scott , a pretty girl in a blue plume and white veil ... . Oh , that darned mourning-dove in the timber ! Supper was a long and irritating meal , including noisy talk about Phoebe Lou and the Scotts , Abraham Lincoln 's chances and the County Fair , with the food sticking miserably in Suzanne 's throat , and Ambrose Willshire riding in afterward to tell them with cold disapproval that Jeanie had another girl , so that Ma , her lips set in a straight line , hurried to get ready to go back across the prairie with him . It was nearly bedtime when they heard Wayne singing in the lane road , his voice melodiously rich coming over the ripeningcorn so that all went outside to hear : " It was here with the bright blue sky above I told her the tale of my heart 's true love , And long ' ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise to be my bride.  | " Oh cruel and false were the tales they told That my vows were false and my old love cold , That my truant heart held another dear , Forgetting the vows that were whispered here . " Then her cheeks grew pale and .. . " The words died away but the faint melody came back from the north prairie . Suzanne said suddenly : " Pa , I want to go to this new FemaleSeminary in Prairie Rapids when it opens . Do you think I could ? " Jeremiah appraised his youngest with a critical if furtive eye . " Well , those are legitimate desires , I 'd say . But just why are you anxious to go this week and was lukewarm last ? " " I 've been thinking .. . and I 've made up my mind to be a teacher . If I go there this winter I guess I could pass the teacher 's examinations and get a school instead of just helping Ma or the neighbors . " " Or gettin ' married and settlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I would n't marry anybody if . . . if every man in the county wanted me . " " Well ... there 's not such a great lot o ' danger o ' that , but just to save you the possible embarrassment o ' giving ' em all . the mitten , I guess maybe if Ma 's willin ' , you better go . Celia goin ' into the milliner shop again ... Emily sewin ' for folks ... that 'll leave Melinda to hold the fort helpin ' Ma . It 's fifty cents a week tuition . That conies pretty often for a half a dollar . I 'd want you to make the most of your time . " " Oh , I will , Pa . I want to spend my whole life studying ! "  | THE day before the County Fair , making an invitation to attend it the excuse for her going and thus keep her promise to Wayne , Suzanne dressed in her blue poplin and rode Jupiter down the field road to the Scotts ' . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed mental state including , as did Suzanne 's mind , timidity , curiosity , envy , and disrelish . Although she had often been to the west end of the slough in pre-Scott days , it seemed now a strangely unfamiliar place with the new white house and its green blinds sitting there where once only the maple and butternut trees stood and the hazel brush tangled with the sumac . There was no one in sight as she dismounted , but almost immediately the two little black children came from around the corner of the house . They were probably only seven and nine years old but they scampered to Jupiter 's head at once to hold the bridle . Suzanne felt peculiarly uncertain about her attitude toward these first black children upon whom she had ever laid eyes . A slave race , lots of people thought , just meant for slaves and nothing else . " Just as good right to their freedom and live their own lives as you and me , " Pa said . You did n't know what to think . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaying so stylishly that she felt very elegant and at ease . But when she was admitted by the fat black woman to a room with a stairway right in front of her and beheld Miss Carlie Scott coming down that stairway in a wider skirt with more swingp290to it , she no longer felt elegant , and only the thought of Pa 's being the Honorable Jeremiah Martin bolstered her courage . " My name 's Suzanne Martin , " she said and knew her voice sounded pinched and squeaky . " I thought I 'd come over and tell you about the County Fair to-morrow , and urge you to go . " Miss Carlie Scott said that was nice for her to come , and to sit down here where it was cool  --  only she said it so very differently from the way the river-road people talked , " heah " and " fo ' . " Carlie Scott was pretty and so pale that Celia would certainlytake a back seat , Suzanne thought . Her little mouth was a pouting pink which gave her the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she might have been crying . With a quick sweep of her eyes Suzanne saw a carpeted room , chairs shining with horsehair upholstering , lace curtains at the windows , a spread peacock tail , wax flowers under glass  --  for all that , it would be Sabina 's turn to envy . Mrs. Scott came in then , tall and genteel . The black woman whom they called Maria brought in cookies and glasses of something that tasted to Suzanne partly like wild grapes and partly like apple cider . But even the eating together did not make the call a complete success as Pa said breaking bread always did . Something between them seemed never to be overcome . It was as though they could not reach across a space and meet in a common subject , as though the Scotts stood on one side of the creek bed and Suzanne on the other with high water between . " How do you like it here ? " " It 's very pleasant here near the trees . " " We like the Valley . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " Suddenly to Suzanne a whitewashed cabin was ap291most distasteful thing . " My father 's the Honorable Jeremiah Martin . He 's in the legislature . " " Oh , a politician ! " Oh , dear , how could she get them to know that everybody looked up so to Pa ? " He 's been elected twice , " she said sturdily . " And to all the Republican conventions . " No one could belittle Pa 's honors . " I suppose there are quite a few Republicans in the locality . " Quickly Suzanne had a presentiment that maybe the Scotts were not Republicans . Oh , goodness ! " There are some nice young people around here . " Suzanne tried Carlie again . " And they would be pleased to have you join them in singing school and spell-downs , picnics and boatrides . " She would do all she could for Wayne . " Sometimes "  --  she had a sudden feeling that she was talking like Pa , always putting the best on everything  --  " there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporting all about it at home , she said , " I ca n't tell you what it was , but I do n't believe I 'd ever feel acquainted with them . I do n't believe they ever have fun and I bet they do n't know what a joke is . " The Scotts went to the County Fair . The girls , each with an eye in that direction as they dressed , saw the carriage come up the new field road , black Hi driving , Mr. Scott beside him , and the two ladies in the back . They held little parasols over themselveswhich made Celia say frankly she certainly wished they had n't slopped over with generosity all at once and given the green silk one to Phoebe Lou . Sarah was not going . Never sick , she " took a pain " that day under her shoulder-blade so that at the last minute Emily stayed home with her . Henry took Lucy and little Nora in the buckboard . Jeremiah drove with the other three girls in the wagon , Melinda on thep292front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard he was thinking they were a pretty comely-looking bunch of girls . Celia had on her apple-green challis , and her little white bonnet lined with green inclosed a very fair skin because she had not once gone into the field , or ever , under the most trying circumstances , neglected her milkweed cream at night . Melinda , as sunburned as a Musquakie , had on her brown dress with red plaid trimming , and red and brown ribbons pleated across the front of her straw bonnet . Because she had taken some pains with herself she looked neat and proper to start with , although the chances were by night she would be in a state of complete disintegration . As for Suzanne , she was in the blue poplin which once she had so deeply admired , and her blue bonnet of Etruscanstraw to match , but now neither one pleased her , the dress being less full than Carlie Scott 's , and as for the bonnet  --  how could any bonnet without a plume be worthy of the name ? There was a ten-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it only remained unsold until she could go to school , get her certificate , and teach , she would buy it with her very first money . With a plume the exact color of her eyes , maybe Wayne . . . she dreamed all the way to town . Dust from the teams ahead hung heavily in the warm Septemberair so that Celia and Suzanne covered their faces with their handkerchiefs at times to keep clean , but Melinda did not bother to , swallowing dust cheerfully and coughing over it as she talked a blue streak to Pa . They crossed the new bridge , Laddie 's and Lassie 's shaggy legs pounding along with clumping hollow sound and the wagon rattling , passed along Main Street between the stores and taverns toward the fair-ground several blocks away . Jeremiah had to pick his way around the stumps still clinging to Mother Earth as though she would not let man forget that he had desecrated her forests to build him a town . The fair-ground was a forty-acre tract of prairie land withp293a grassy quarter-mile race-track for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the live stock on exhibition , the pumpkins , apples , and plums , the fanning mills , stirringplows , and a cider press . The town band was there tuning up for the parade around the track . It was all too exciting for words . They got out of the wagon and Jeremiah , tying the horses , told the girls to watch their manners and he would meet them right here in this very spot at five o'clock . He must get over where Phineas was to see how Sandy was taking all this excitement . They could see Phineas leading old Sandy out of an open stall right then , ready for the parade , a ring in his nose and a wary look in his eye . Near-by Queen was pawing the ground restlessly where she was tied to the side of the rude open shelter . It was not five minutes before several young men sauntered their way  --  a clerk in one of the stores whom Celia knew , his cousin visiting him , and two stalwart strangers who were introduced to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new settler south of town . The one called Rand , with eyes for Suzanne , pestered her continually to walk around with him alone , but she put him off laughingly and stayed by the girls . Celia , too , was refusing Alf Banninger to leave the group , her pale pretty face turned away at times , searching the grounds for the new Scott son . Melinda said loudly and cheerfully that she would go , but the young men , with warm looks for Suzanne and Celia , pretended not to hear . They all stood there together until the passing of the stock parade , headed by the brass band which made all the horses cavort about skittishly but affected the dumb old oxen not at all . A young fellow by the name of Sol Humbert from the west prairies , driving six oxen hitched to a long pieced-out wagon made from new lumber and containing twenty or thirty persons , won the prize for bringing the greatest number in one equipage , although the fair management would not let him go onto the race-track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which attracted the most attention , Sol Humbert 's long wagon or the Scotts ' open carriage with black Hi driving and the two ladies with their parasols seated therein . Jeremiah 's friend , Mr. Peter Melendy , mounted the judges ' stand and demonstrated the fact that a shrill whistle could be made out of a pig 's tail . There was a running race with a man by the name of Brownell winning , even though he ran in heavy cowhide boots . There were other races with prizes and then a man on a high wooden stand called out between cupped hands : " A race now not scheduled heretofore , ex-clu-sive-ly for the ladies . A ladies ' race open to each and all of the feminine persuasion . No stipulationsor rules  --  any age lady and any age animal  --  in fact any kind of animal . Whoever starts at the gun going off and gets around the quarter-mile first , by carriage or beast or foot . Prize . . . ten dollars . Prize . . . ten dollars ! " Ten dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connecting ten dollars so speedily and so definitely with a drooping blue plume that not thirty seconds had passed when she said very low to Celia , " I 'm going on Queen , " and was off before Celia 's protestations had been put into words . She went behind the open stable where Queen was tied , removedher bonnet and placed it on the low back of the sloping roof . With a quick glance around the side of the building to be sure that she was not seen , she pulled up the skirt of her blue poplin and with some fumbling untied the stout strings which bound her hoops , letting them down around her feet , so that , suddenly and rather ridiculously , she had collapsed from a plump semisphere into a very slim perpendicular piece of femininity . There were only four other contestants , two town girls in real riding habits , leading one to think they might have hadp295some pre-knowledge of the impromptu race , a buxom middleagedwoman from the Big Woods , and a young girl from the west prairies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best poplin blowing into a big blue mushroom and her hair tumbling over her neck , and Queen , thinking she was tearing madly over the prairies , winning the race for Suzanne amid much cheering , from which Celia 's contribution was entirely missing . But when Suzanne had received her prize from the hands of the announcer and was returning with Queen to the shelter of the shed and the collapsed hoops , she saw that which made the winning as ashes in her mouth . Wayne Lockwood , in a fine new gray suit with vest , white ruffled shirt , and gray beaver hat held at his breast , was standing , tall and straight and handsome , by the open carriage and talking so intently to Carlie Scott that he did not even see her pass by . Ten dolltrs in her hand  --  more money than she had ever possessed ! Almost more than she had ever seen ! Virtually the drooping blue plume on her bonnet at that very moment ! Suddenly , it came over her in bitter knowledge  --  you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , never buy a man 's love , nor even his passing interest . Sarah talked about it off and on all the rest of the month , thinking that Suzanne had disgraced herself by the impulsive and public act . Jeremiah said that what with the sinking of the Lady Elgin , a cable for messages being laid between Ireland and Newfoundland , the coming election , antislavery debates , possible secession , and even war talk over the whole country , it did seem that a little thing like a girl dashing around a quarter-mile track on a respectable old mare was n't such an important topic . " But when I think of her hoops hanging there on the side of that building . . . for any one to come along and see ... " " Oh , come now , Ma ! Most everybody sometime or another has caught sight of hoops . You do n't think a glimpse of those wire birdcages is going to pollute the morals of the whole Cedar Valley , do you ? " But in time there came an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when corn-husking was over Suzanne went to the Prairie Home Female Seminary there in Prairie Rapids , riding along on the high seat of a lumber wagon filled with corn whose sideboards rattled noisily all the way up the street to the big brick building where she was to live and presumably to learn . Jeremiah , taking her there , was combining , as always , a load of something to sell along with " toting the women folks . " Tied high on the corn so that it would not lose off was a bundle containing bedding , her blue poplin dress , two loaves of bread , a roll of Sarah 's sweet butter , some tea , a pot of wild blackberryjam ( which Suzanne was to be scarcely able to eat for remembering that Phoebe Lou had picked the berries ) , and bacon so thoroughly smoked that when Susanne put on her poplin that first evening she smelled like nothing so much as a bonfire in which a piece of meat had been dropped . Miss Anna Field had graduated recently under Mary Lyon at Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had receivedsome training in teaching . The two met and welcomed Suzanne , stood for a time and talked politics with Jeremiah , offering such intelligent Republicanizedstatements concerning the antislavery trend of the times and the importance of the coming election , that he left his daughter happily convinced she was in capable hands . In the following days his every waking moment was spent in preparation for the biggest political mass-meeting the Valley had ever seen . The old leading political question , the tariff , was overshadowed completely this time by the threatened secession . Something about this particular election was pulling at the very fibers of every one 's being.  |p297Sturgis  Falls Democrats were practically tickling themselves to death this fall with a song that had drifted here from no one knew where : Say he 's capable and honest , Loves his country 's good alone ; Never drank a drop of whisky , Would n't know it from a stone ! Any lie you tell , we 'll swallow , Swallow any kind of mixture ; But , oh , do n't  --  we pray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , show his picture ! Well , maybe Lincoln was homely , but just wait and see what the crowd would do when the parade went by . It turned out to be all that the committee could have desired  --  a great night , and the longest procession the county had ever known , with three bands , flaring torch-lights , and new campaignsongs . And now  --  what was that coming down the street next to the last band ? A wagon being hauled down the crooked stump-filled Main Street by a half-dozen men . Abe , himself ? No , but gosh a'mighty , it was his spit'n image . A tall angular settler , representing Lincoln , was splitting logs . Sleeves rolled up , a pile of tree-trunks there before him , at work with ax , wedge , and mawl , he was almost the living replica of old Abe . The crowd was roaring itself hoarse . Hats were being thrown in the air . The wagon could scarcely move for men and boys crowding around it . " We 're for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his night 's work . Suzanne shared a room in the big brick seminary with two students from south of town . There was so much to do for themselves in a physical way the first week that sometimes it seemed there was not any time left to devote to the mental . They washed out their own stockingsand aprons and built fires in their room stove there on the second floor , carrying multitudinous chunks up the long stairs , sweeping after themselves each time on account of the constant dropping of pieces of maple or elm bark en route . They cooked all their meals , feasting the first part of the week and fasting at the close , for not one had any money to spend at the stores and all had brought supplies from home for a week 's eating . When Suzanne went home with Phineas at the end of that first five days there was another letter by pony express from Phoebe Lou waiting to be read . It had been written in a huge camp of gold-seekers just this side of Denver with mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes and they a good twelve miles away . There was so much to tell she did n't know where to begin . Just before they left Nebraska City there had been a revolt among the ox-drivers and muleteers with much excitement because they wanted twenty-five dollars for the round trip to Salt Lake City . The long dusty trail had been packed with teams . Seemed as though the whole country had decided to come west . For hours at a time she could keep her mind on nothing but the thought of the cold spring down there at the creek behind the house on the river road . Did they all remember how the old trail out from Illinois had been thick with grass and mud holes and sloughs ? This one was all dense gray-white dust . Oh , so many sights  --  seeing the military company at Fort Kearney , the low sluggish Platte River with sandy islands covered with mud hens , an Indian village too filthy for anything , a place called Gilman 's Ranch where they had good spring water and an adobe house  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that wagons traveled in long trains . Sometimesthe stories you heard just scared you out of a year 's growth but of course Ed was right there by her . Sarah 's snort , the listeners all knew , meant what was a littlematter of hostile Indians if that flibbertigibbet was near-by ? Ed said they would have a fine home in Denver City somep299day and Pa and Ma could come and live with them . At that Sarah was almost too overcome to sniff , remarking : " They 'll visit us , I warrant , long before we 'll ever visit them , " as she put the letter away for the other girls to read . When , at the close of the letter-reading , Melinda , excited to a point of giggling breathlessness , told Suzanne that she had another big piece of news : Wayne Lockwood , all dressed up , had gone riding down the field road to Scotts ' , Suzanne knew at once that she was through forever with the thought of buying a plume . To save Pa the expense she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for twenty weeks . Twenty weeks of education instead of a blue plume ! " Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay , " was all right for Mr. Alfred Tennyson to say , but what if you had no choice in the matter ? What if you had to live through a cycle of Cathay instead of wearing a blue plume for some one ? Miss Anna Field had read some of Mr. Tennyson 's works in one of her classes . Miss Anna taught English , all mathematics , and even Latin to two aspiring town girls who enjoyed a superiorif fragmentary conversation with each other that first month by means of such mysterious sounding words as " mensa " and " agricola . " Miss Libbie taught bookkeeping , spelling , and a species of penmanship which involved many shaded tails and curlicues on the letters . Suzanne was just finishing a chalky version of these capitals in Miss Libbie 's room one Friday later in the fall when Miss Anna came to the door and said , " Suzanne , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her heart started up foolishly at the sight of Wayne Lockwoodwaiting for her there in the big hall , explaining in amatter-of-fact way that because he had been obliged to cometo Prairie Rapids she was supposed to ride out home with him . So Suzanne , knowing that keeping men folks waiting wasone of the cardinal sins , packed her bundle hurriedly and in a very short time was heading for home on the wagon seat by the side of Wayne . The hard maples and oaks were a riot of color . The air was crystal clear after several days of rain , all the dust of the summer washed from the Valley . As much as she was liking school it was nice to be going home , so she was gaiety itself , hugging to her this hour of riding out the river road with Wayne . She laughed and chattered , sipping at the fountain of her joy as though , if this moment were never to come again , it must he quaffed deeply . Wayne , too , fell in with this pleasant mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze timber flamed at the south . " Is n't it nice ? " With a sweep of her arm Suzanne took in all of the world that was visible . The gesture included the grading for the new railroad over there to the north  --  it was nearly finished to Sturgis Falls  --  that long line of embankment across the farms like a huge runway thrown up by some gigantic mole . " Yes . You ca n't think that there 's all this unrest and excitementeverywhere about the slavery and secession and all , can you ? " " Oh , Wayne , it 's so silly . It 'll all blow over . " " I 'm not so sure about that . I used to think that , too . But you ought to see the papers . They say if Lincoln is elected , the south will rise right up . " " Oh , I still do n't believe that part . We 've had presidents before some of the folks did n't like . Pa did n't like ... " " But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five more days to election .... " But Suzanne was not too interested in the election just now , choosing rather to speak of the important things of school , of the interesting books Miss Field had on a shelf behind the stove , of the Prairie Rapids girls who had enrolled at the Sem/inary , knowing all the time that not an item was so important as this one of Wayne being here by her side . Once he broke into singing : Her eyes soft and tender , The violets outvying , And a fairer form was never seen ... so that Suzanne , out of the sheer exuberance of her feelings , sang , too : With her brown silken tresses And cheeks like the rosesThere was none like my darling Daisy Dean . Oh , you felt as though you were floating on those puffy white clouds to be out here on the river road singing Daisy Dean with Wayne Lockwood . When they were almost home , by the east corn-field , the queer built-on whitewashed house of logs and timber visible through the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down to the Scotts ' for me that time . I meant to . .. but I did n't get to . So thanks for doing it . I would n't have needed to ask you , but I appreciated it . I got acquainted with her anyway . Suzanne , she 's ... " his voice wrapped itself about the words , folding them in tenderly ... " she 's like a flower . " " A flower ? " Suzanne repeated stupidly . One does not fall from cloud distances without some shock . " Yes .... l guess one of these . .. little wind-flowers .. . you know , dainty and delicate . " He laughed suddenly . " Funny I could say that out loud to any one . Sounds pretty foolish , does n't it ? " They had driven into the yard , were by the lean-to door now , and Pa , Ma , Melinda , Emily , and Celia had all come out to greet her . They were so glad to see her that for a moment itP302hurt her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went into the house where there awaited her a hot supperof mashed potatoes , baked chicken , creamed dried sweet corn , and even fresh apple pie from the first year of the new orchard 's bearing . Also there was much noisy conversation anent the election , antislavery , threats of secession , and split parties . But what did it all amount to ? What was an old election ? And what did secession matter if Carlie Scott was like a little wind-flower ? And then it turned out that Suzanne did not go back to school Sunday night . No one knew just how it happened unless it was the weather turning cold suddenly and a drizzle starting when she was down in the timber for butternuts Saturday afternoon , and getting soaked that way , but she came down from the loft Sunday morning with a stiff neck and a throat so sore that Sarah made her get into her old downstairs bed to be doctored . For two days Suzanne lay twisting and tossing in the bed behind the tester there in her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and throbbing . Sarah worked over her , binding slabs of fresh pork on her neck with flannel cloths , bringing bowls of hot catnip tea to the bedsi4l dosing her with onion-and-molasses syrup . There was no one like Ma to doctor you . Queer , too , how gentle she was . No matter what she said or scolded about when you were well , always if you got sick , she was all tenderness and patience , her hands seeking unerringly the trouble and sometimes rubbing it away . No matter what she would say spunky to the well ones , Ma never was cross to the sick . In the evening of the third day Pa and Phineas were inPrairie Rapids waiting to hear the election news . When theyheard it in Dubuque , the railroad company was going to senda trainman on an engine out to the end of the line to tell folks . Sarah , Emily , Melinda , and Celia all sat up to wait for them , but finally the girls grew sleepy and Celia said she 'd alreadyp303put her cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won ? So Suzanne knew they were tiptoeing past her bed and mounting the ladder to the loft , their candles making flickering lights through the tester . She heard suppressed laughing and knew that whoever went first was scurrying fast to keep her ankles from being pinched . The noise of the girls passing to and fro overhead ceased about the time she heard the sound of horses ' hoofs thudding down to the stable . She must have dozed off a minute for just as she thought she was trying to make a good chain of capitals for Miss Libbie Field she heard Ma 's voice near her at the foot of the loft ladder . " Girls . . . girls ... ! " Ma was trying to speak quietly , probablythinking she was asleep . " Are you still awake ? " There was a thumping and rushing sound overhead and the girls ' voices were answering , " Yes . What is it , Ma ? " " I just thought , " Ma was calling up to them , " you 'd like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the year Suzanne went back and forth tothe Seminary  --  home Friday nights , back to Prairie Rapids Sunday night , or so early Monday morning that the pale December sun was not yet up . The winter winds whipped about her as she rode down in the bottom of a straw-filled sleigh , one of Ma 's Indian baskets by her filled with the week 's supplies : bread , a pie , twisted fried cakes , some side meat or fresh sausage , maybe a cooked chicken , all of these to be shared with the two girls who lived with her , just as she in turn shared their side meat , corn-bread and dried-apple sauce . With parsing , spelling , diagramming , making those long picturesque tails of shaded ink on penmanship papers , even tackling more algebra than Miss Cotton had given her , the short days were passed . And when it grew dusk in the late afternoon , she wrapped up and went with the other girls to the well and woodpile to bring their own supply of water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodbox . Christmas was over , the year slipped away , and the cold descendedin earnest . For next to the winter of ' 56- ' 57 , weather in 1861 was the most severe that any settler remembered . A succession of snow-storms blocked roads and entirely shut the Valley off from communication with the outer world . There was no letter mail from east of the Mississippi River for ten days , no papers for over a week . Suzanne , stranded at the Seminary , pieced out her scanty provisions with a sack of cornmealshe bought at the store on promise to pay when she came back from home , almost worrying herself sick that Pa who  |p305never  went into debt would be disgraced by her asking for credit . When she finally got home she found Pa so wrought up over the news which had just come through that he did n't act as though her going in debt was anything very bad . Secessionists , making threats , were shipping arms out of New York and hurrying home to avoid arrest for treason . Pa said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then soliciting Louis Napoleon to assume protection of the South . At the supper table he explained jubilantly , gesticulating with his knife and fork and forgetting to eat , that if you counted out the six seceding states , there were fifty-eight members of congress and that the Republicans would have exactly half besides the vice-president ; in the house there would be one hundred and fourteen Republicans , seventy Democrats , and twenty-one Americans , a good Republican majority , so that Lincoln would be well abetted if the seceders refused to come back in . She breathed a sigh of relief to think how many Republicanswould be there in Washington to make things come out all right . Life now to Suzanne was divided , like that Gaul Miss Anna Field told about , into three parts : I. School . II . War talk . III . Wayne Lockwood . She had too much pride to ask any one about Wayne and Carlie Scott when she was home , but , even so , there was no need , for Celia and Melinda volunteered glibly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowpackedfield road and that the night the storms abated enough to hold singing school he sat by Carlie Scott 's side and sang , " Thou only hast my heart , " like to raise the dead . Only Emily remained silent on the subject , never mentioning either one . There was lots of gossip about the son . He was a hard drinker and a hard rider , and Pa said if any one ever saw him come tearing down the road to get away off at the side , for half the time he did n't know what he was about . But even George Scott could not tear wildly about this month , for February 's weather did not moderate to the bitter end . A mail was brought out from Dubuque by a mule team which made the round trip in two weeks . When the long string of mules floundered through the last cut into Sturgis Falls the two drivers told the assembled group of citizens that it was authentically reported the rebels would try to take the capital on inauguration ( lay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves into a potential military company , Phineas among them . The Prairie Rapids town girls attending school brought such frightening tales that week  --  how Lincoln was on his way to Washington , how he had stopped in Philadelphia and said he 'd rather be assassinated than surrender the principle of liberty on which the union was formed , how their fathers said the whole country was just sitting on a volcano until after the inauguration  --  thatSuzanne could scarcely stand it until she got home to hear what Pa had to say about it . Even so , nothing big happened on inauguration day . If the country sat on a volcano there was no eruption . Maybe it would all go into nothing after Lincoln saying he was of no mind to interfere with slavery in those states where it already existed . That was the way things turned out lots of times . Every one had been talking about the inauguration as though it were right there in the Valley . It seemed almost like an anticlimaxwhen Jeremiah got home , rode Queen to the stable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Emily asked at once . " Did he get there without being shot ? " Sarah wanted to know . " Safe in Washington . " Jeremiah spoke with satisfaction as though he had been personally responsible for the journey .   " Safe so far , " Sarah said laconically . But Lincoln 's speech of assurance was so much water under a bridge . Suzanne felt such a childish desire to see Pa after she had heard the town girls ' wild talk for a full week that never would she miss catching a ride home these spring Friday nights even if no one came for her . Mud , rains , thunder-storms  --  nothing kept her from going to the Prairie Rapids stores and watching for any one from the river road . She went home on creaking wagon seats , in springless two-wheeled carts , up on a load of grain sacks , or in front of a penned-in cow bawling lustily in her ear for its calf . Once she rode with Cady Bedson behind his spanking team . He was going to consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of the county in case there was war . And once , when no one came for her and no neighbor appeared in the stores , she pulled her skirts up over her galoshes and started out on the long trek . All of that March the great crew of workmen hustled to complete the Dubuque and Sioux City track into Sturgis Falls . It was as though they were working against time , trying desperately to reach their objective before some threatening storm should descend . Dark clouds filled with spring moisture gatheringthere on the prairie and breaking into heavy rains were not the only clouds hanging over the Valley . Others were there , low , black , and ugly , whose damaging disruption was to stop the railroad 's progression farther west for four long years . But now it was finished into Sturgis Falls . On Monday , April first , a train was to come over those shining tracks laid out there on that giant mole-run through the farms of the first settlers , across the lane road , and on into town . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass , that a train was to chug down the long grassy trail from Dubuque which old Baldy and Star , Red and Whitey , had traveled so many times . P308For the first time Suzanne stayed away from the Seminary for another reason than sickness or being snow-bound . Sarah scolded that with her tuition paid and only one more week on her twenty to go it was wasteful , but Jeremiah told her to stay home and see the first train cross the prairie , that a world-shaking event did n't happen often and she would never miss a day 's lessons . He , himself , hitched up to go over to town so that he might be there at the depot when it came . To Sarah 's sniffed commentthat she knew no reason why he had to be at the depot when you could watch it come across the country as far as eye could see , he said he wanted to be with the crowd and see how she slowed up to stop  --  calling the train " she , " as in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's a little late to-day , " apologizing for her mistakes , or " Well , she 's on time all right , " proudly commending her as though now she were reforming . Melinda hurried to get ready and out to the wagon the minute she heard he was going . Even after the two had gone , Sarah was skeptical over the actual arrival . " It 's April Fool 's Day and probably it wo n't come at all . " But it came . A little black speck in the distance at first , the smoke of its fires streaming with the spring wind , chugging and blowing across the plowed fields and the pasture land , it came in the late afternoon like a huge black animal snorting its way out from Dubuque , fouling the green prairie . When they heard the far-off whistle like the long-drawn-out wail of a mourning-dove , Suzanne , Emily , and their mother all stared at each other for a moment as though this thing that was happening had come from some mighty force too prodigiousto comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual fashion , hurried down to the stake-and-rider fence to watch it go by . When the others came home they brought Celia along , allP309three saying the crowd had gone mad , cheering and throwing caps in the air . Furthermore , in the Post Office they had found an invitation to the Honorable Jeremiah Martin and lady to attend the grand celebration banquet next week for which a special train carrying all the officials would come out from Dubuque . " And Pa 's to give a toast , " Celia informed them . " Yes , sir , " Pa bridled a bit . " Toasts by them that 's done the most to help get it here . " " Toast can get overdone , " Sarah said dryly . " Now the train 's looked after , girls , get your supper work going . Scoot now ! " So Sturgis Falls and Prairie Rapids were connected with the outside world . No longer would the great oxen pull the loads of merchandise over the green trail out from Dubuque or the lone traveler spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come the long hundred miles . It did not seem possible . Suzanne 's twenty weeks of schooling were over and she felt quite confident about her teacher 's examinations . Ten dollarshad been spent for higher education . But it was surprising how much knowledge could be crowded into the brain of an alert young country girl there in 1861 between her tasks of building fires , cooking , dish-washing and carrying in water and wood . Part of the satisfactory result was due to the naturally keen mind of the scholar , and part to the able teachings of Miss Anna Field only recently away from the influence of Mary Lyon at Mount Holyoke . So Suzanne was home now in the midst of all the talk about secession and what was to happen next , seeing Phineas ride to town every evening after the spring plowing , tired as he was , to drill with the Pioneer Grays getting ready for any emergency , and seeing Wayne Lockwood ride sometimes down the field toward the Scotts ' . Back to the neighborhood at this time came Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no home now , for Mr. Burrill had been shot on his own door-stoop , called to the door by a group of men on horseback and killed . Oh , poor Mrs. Burrill ! She had n't seen it but she had heard the shot . They called them " bushwhackers " and they would stoop to anything . As she told them all this on her first day 's visit her eyes grew wild and the Adam 's apple pumped up and down her scrawny neck . Scarcely could Sarah or the girls cook the dinner and get the house cleaned that day for stopping and listening to the tales . The bushwhackers down there wore home-made linseywoolseyscolored yellow , an ugly yellow like a green pumpkin rotted just when it was turning . They used butternut bark for it , and called the men " butternuts . " They all wore badges to show they were on the slavery side  --  a cross-section of a butternut . It made a handsome pin , you could n't think how ornamentalit looked if you did n't stop to think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the state line , right in Iowa itself , wore them . " I suppose they 've been more fights over them pins than you could shake a stick at . One wa'nt five miles from us . A big copperhead fellow with a drink of likker in him just swaggered around daring any one to touch his butternut pin . A Scotch farmer . . . disremember his name at this minute . . . come into the crowd , saw the pin , heard them brags bein ' said , reached and got the pin off o ' him and his whole shirt with it . " Jeremiah did not go outdoors even for a semblance of overseeingthe boys . He sat and plied Mrs. Burrill with questions , to which she had ready and frightening answers . Melinda , Emily , and Suzanne all lingered and listened and started up again furiously at their work with Sarah 's " Come , come , girls , your Pa has to eat and we have to keep clean around here , if bushwhackers and copperheads should be settin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " Mrs. Burrill jumped up then , her eyes wild and her forefinger on her lip . " Yes , " she whispered . " Ssh ! There be , too . There be , too , bushwhackers on the door-step . All get back . Do n't let Burrill go out . Make him stay in the lean-to . There 's bushwhackers comin ' down the Cedar in a boat . My God ... they 've got Evan-geline . " Rooted to the spot , the girls stared at their visitors , their faces blanched and their eyes dark with fright . " Bushwhackers have got my girl in a boat that 's whirlin ' in the high water ... turnin ' and whirlin ' and carryin ' her down ... " She was screaming . " Get her ! Get Evangeline ... " Only wiry little Sarah could do anything about it . She had her arm around the distracted creature . " Now , now , Mis ' Burrill . . . this is Sarah Martin come to help you get ' em . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out ... in sickness and harvestin ' ? .1 ' 11 help you this time , too . I 'll help take care of Burrill and Evangeline . " Ma 's voice was kind . " Come , now . You and me are goin ' in the other room and you 're goin ' to lay down . " Already walking slowly with her into the company room Ma was still talking gently . The girls stood unmoving , shaken to the depths , hearing Ma 's soothing voice through the woman 's wild one . " See ... I 'll rub your neck and head a little . ... Do n't that feel better ? And a cup of tea will make us both feel good . We 'll drink some together in here . . . just you and me . . . " All day Ma sat with her , combing her hair , rubbing her head , speaking gently to her , until the wild talk stopped and only low moans and the sound of crying , sad and sane , came from the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant source of talk . Men cornering Hi or Mose could never resist pestering them with questions.  | " Do n't you want to be free , Mose ? " " Ah is free . " " But you can leave the Scotts if you want to , then . " " Yassir . Ah knows it . " " Then why do n't you strike out for yourself ? " " Yassir . But ah don ' know where ah 'd go , sir . " Uncle Tom 's Cabin , between covers , had been passed up and down the river road until it was in a state of disintegration and merely held together by virtue of Sarah Martin 's energy and white of egg . Uncle Tom 's Cabin , as a play , had been given in a tent with coal-oil lamps for lighting , hard boards for the spectators , and Eliza crossing unbleached-muslin ice . So every one tried to think the Scotts ' blacks were ill-treated , and felt rather put out that no one could prove it . There was something amiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legree . Church services in the log school-house took on a fervid political trend . No longer were sprigs of caraway necessary to keep the youngsters ' eyes propped open . The patriotic shouting did that . Brother Osgood had gone on to newer frontiers but a Reverend Josper came every other Sunday afternoon , making the Martins ' Sabbaths very full , as Jeremiah and Sarah had just become charter members of Sturgis Falls ' newly organized Congregational Church , to which services they went in the morning . The Reverend Josper , seemingly commissioned by the Lord to pronounce judgment on all rebels , preached his heated denunciations with wild abandon . Even his appearance , the fiery red of his face , the snowy whiteness of his hair and whiskers , and the piercing blue of his eyes , took a colorful patriotic trend . On April eleventh the grand celebration over the coming of the railroad held the boards . Every activity in the Martin householdthat day turned toward the event . Jeremiah was on the committee to be at the depot when the Dubuque moguls arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fromP313south of town , were coming to get Celia and Suzanne for the evening dance in Overman Hall , and Pa who had just heard the Banningers were Democrats was not so keen for trusting his girls with them . When no one said anything to Melinda about going , she asked the current hired man if he would n't like to go with her . It hurt her pride a little but not enough to counterbalance being left behind . Emily worked so hard all day to help every one off that she was too tired by late afternoon to get herself ready to ride to town with the folks , so she just went over to Henry 's , neither one of whom was going as Lucy was expecting a child and Henry said it looked as though some one had to stay and do a little farm work . All those roads which led to Rome could never have been so muddy as these to Sturgis Falls . Jeremiah and Sarah were over an hour getting the two miles in the buckboard , with the wheels sometimes sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzanne and Celia in separate buggies and each young man 's prime object in life apparently was to get to town first . Every little way one would get stuck and the other would pass him with a great upheaval of mud , saying , " I wo n't take anything off of a brother of mine , " so that the girls clutched their full skirts in constant fear of getting them splashed . The brass band in a wagon with four-horse team , the great crowd , the cheers , the train coming in to be decorated with a wreath of evergreens by Sabina 's committee as though the iron horse were one of flesh and blood  --  oh , it was a stirring sight ! From the wreath dangled a dozen cards bearing felicitations : from Dubuque to Sturgis Falls  --  from Sturgis Falls to Dubuque  --  with much reference to " the iron chain that now unites us . " The events were rather progressive in nature  --  a program at the depot , the procession moving on to the HorticulturalP314Rooms for a second welcoming , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one of the Dubuque moguls , Mr. Platt Smith , predicting a telegraph some day , and the dance at Overman Hall for which a band had come all the hundred miles . It was so late when the girls got settled in the loft room after the great event that night was beginning to clear in the east . Celia said sleepily she was n't going to bother with cream , that those Banninger boys were perfect cards , and she never had such a good time in her life . Suzanne agreed . It was the easier way , even though the memory of the evening must include Wayne Lockwood 's yellow head bent over the dark one of Carlie Scott in the dance . She would just have to get used to that sight . In the days that followed , sometimes Jeremiah read aloud and talked of other things than secession  --  the new steam passenger-carin the east with the two stovepipes sticking through the top and carrying fuel enough for a fifty-mile run , the " parlor skates " that girls in Boston were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather on runners ( and saying that Ma and the girls ought to have them to get around to their work faster ) , a man on Pike 's Peak really getting twentyfivedollars of gold from a pan of iron pyrites ( whatever that was , and would n't Ma feel cheap if Ed Armitage got rich ? ) , a new machine on sale that would reap and mow , cutting a swath six feet wide ( that was too easy , we 'd all get lazy ) , a man opening an ambrotype gallery in Prairie Rapids for taking " the immortal type on iron , glass , or leather " ( and which of those foundations did the girls think would hold up best under the strain of their countenances ? ) . But more often he read and talked of the one subject that lay nearest to the heart and mind of all . Would the secession really lead to war ? If it led to war , how many would have to go ... and who ?  |p315Sometimes  the talk grew so exciting as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " It might mean all of fighting age . . . sending every man that could hold a gun .. . Phineas , me , and Henry . . . Ambrose Willshire , Tom Bostwick , those two rampageous Democrat Banninger boys ... Wayne Lockwood ... " " Oh ! " Suzanne burst out , " why should we ? Why should we fight for a lot of niggers ? What 's it to us ? They 're maybe even happier the way it is . Let them stay slaves . Look at black Maria . She 's free but she do n't even care . Look at that black Mose saying he would n't even know where to go or what to do if he did n't live with the Scotts . Who cares anything about them anyway ? What do we stick our noses in their business for ? They 've just as much a right to their way as we have to ours . It 's their own states . What 's secession so bad for anyway ? Let them have part of the country for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both be happy ... " " Suzanne ! " Jeremiah 's voice had the sound of the voice of God speaking from the burning bush . " That will do for you . " This was no joking " I 'll thump you . " He had not spoken to her so fiercely since she was small and tied the calf 's tail to the fence where it froze in the night . A horse 's hoofs came splashing into the yard , stopping at the side stoop , so that the embarrassing thing of Pa 's intensity was averted . Even as knives and forks were suspended and the customary " Who 's that ? " was being asked , Wayne Lockwood stood there . With his lithe body in the April sunshine of the doorway , his head thrown back , arm outstretched across the opening , he might have been cast in bronze as the avenging angel with outstretched sword . " The Secesh have fired on the flag , " he said , with deadly calm , " and taken Fort Sumter . " Jeremiah jumped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plate catching on his pants ' band and overturning : " Why , the goddam .. . " Pa. .. that word ! " Sarah said . He turned on her fiercely , as he had on Suzanne . " As thoughwords made any difference now . .   N O , words made very little difference now . Jeremiah came home with Wednesday 's newspaper . At the top of the right-hand column in quite ordinary print itsaid : Exciting News the War Begun Fort Sumter Attackedand Burned . The detailed article had it that efforts to concentratea formidable military force around Washington were being made , all roads to Washington were closely watched , that Senator Douglas had called on Lincoln to bury the bitter politicalhatchet of the past which pleased the president , that the Confederate Congress would at once declare war on the United States . And then , because life goes on its small and unimportantway in the face of great events , immediately underneath all this , in the same size type , the public was informed that Mrs. Capler was opening a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some God-forsaken wretch stole a cow from Mr. Flower on the east side of the river . President Lincoln called for seventy-five thousand men . Governor Kirkwood called for Iowa 's quota , a single regiment , wondering ( so it was afterward learned ) where he could find them , surprised beyond words when so many responded that it was going to be impossible to use them all . Or so it seemed then in 1861 . The Pioneer Grays said they were ready . Phineas was a PioneerGray . Though the plow stood in the furrow and the fiddle hung on the side of the cupboard , Phineas was ready . So were noisy Alf and Rand Banninger , tearing madly back and forth from drill , trying to beat each other home or to town.  | Over at the fair-ground the Pioneer Grays drilled every few days . In the abandoned court-house square , politely called " The Park " now , little boys marched interminably with sticks over their shoulders and tin cans for drums . Tom Bostwick and Cady Bedson advertised they would pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal purchased ahead as farmers were getting sick of losses through bobtail currency , worthless Illinois and Wisconsin shinplasters . In all this excitement some one found out that the Scotts ' son was no longer at home , gone , it was rumored , after a hotheadedquarrel , back to the south where his sympathies were . It was hard to tell anything about the senior Scott 's sympathies . He was not for seceding but neither out-and-out loyal to the union . Jeremiah said he was like that muskellunge they caught in the river that time , away from his native haunts and not rightly belonging anywhere . Meetings ! Meetings , every day now , with Pa called back to Des Moines by Governor Kirkwood to attend a special legislativeassembly . And in May , the printed order : " Attention , Grays  --  all those who have enrolled themselves with the Pioneer Grays are hereby notified that they must report themselves to the commanding officer , as the company should drill daily until the time of departure . The citizens of the town are furnishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steam-cars at nine o'clock Tuesday morning , June 4 . " Phineas was going to war at nine o'clock on Tuesday morning , June fourth . It had the sound of a time set for funeral services . And now Suzanne thought of Phineas as her favorite memberof the family . No matter which one was leaving the old river road home , that one seemed at the time the best liked . Everything that Phineas did was noticed , everything he said was cradled lovingly in her mind . To see him hustling aroundp319in the old familiar way , whistling while he helped Henry with those last chores before joining the company , brought tears to her eyes and an indissoluble lump to her throat . Pa 's first leavingfor legislature , Sabina 's and Jeanie 's marriages , even Phoebe Lou 's crossing the Great American Desert , sank into insignificance beside this . Emily made Phineas a red flannel belt to wear over his stomach so he would n't get dysentery , and even though he laughed at it , he tried it on under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pincushion , sewing a little ruffle of linen lace around it , knowing the foolishness of it , but feeling all the time that it was her own heart through which she was pushing the needle . Jeremiah was gone only two weeks , saying when he got home that never had an assembly been in such accord , pledging the credit and resources of the state , authorizing the purchase of arms and help for volunteers ' families , just packing the two weeks with unanimously voted decisions . One heard bugle sounds all times of day or night . Stores did practically no business except that which had a direct bearingon the coming departure . Every one hung on the news of the daily paper coming in on the train , wishing that the words of Mr. Platt Smith predicting the clicking of a telegraph instrument in the little frame depot would come true . " We certainly live in a modern age , " Jeremiah said , coming home , tired , excited , talkative . " And we 're never satisfied . But dissatisfaction makes progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just back a bit when we had to wait for the stage to bring in the papers ? That 's what enterprise will do . " Sarah sniffed . " We could use a little enterprise around the place here that was n't all got up by women folks . " But when Sabina and pretty Mrs. Joseph Chase drove in for contributions the next day , she rolled up her gray print sleeves and " whacked out " six dried-apple pies for a hospital supply supper and then sat down to help the girls make undergarments for some of the Pioneer Grays ' families . Henry worked silently about the place in his slow methodical fashion , getting more done than ever Phineas had with his hustling but less systematic ways . Once when Suzanne said , " Henry , you could n't go  --  we could n't ever get along without you , " he looked at her queerly and said : " Some people always have to stay behind and saw wood , I guess . " Celia was in more of a flutter about her new beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaming herself sometimes for not having given him much thought before that dance at the hall . She confided to Suzanne that he was just what she had been looking for ever since she was sixteen , good-looking , lively as a cricket , and with plenty of prospects , one of only two sons whose father already owned a thousand acres of land . It had taken some thought , she said , to decide on Alf instead of Rand as they were so much alike ; but all in all , there was something about Alf that took her fancy a little more than Rand , although if she had never met Alf she would have been satisfied with his brother . If she had only started on him sooner ! Marrying Alf Banninger , she could show Melinda a thing or two . And now he was leaving with the Pioneer Grays , all full of war talk and plans to give the rebels the biggest scare of their lives , and with no thoughts of marrying at all . She had certainly bungled matters . Suzanne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her sister . What a queer way to think about love . But Celia had always been like that , cool and self-possessed , making her plans and carrying them out , too . If Celia had her heart set on Alf Banninger , no doubt she would get him . Looking at her , so confident and calculating , Suzanne almost admired her gumption even while she knew that she herself could never so much as raise her finger to do anything toward getting a man . " As long as he does n't ... I mean if a man did n't care forP321me with every bit of his mind and heart and body and do all the courting , I would n't want him , " she told herself . The war was a monster that lay in wait over there to the south beyond the horizon . Here they were safe , for it could never come to the Valley . Lying in bed these nights next to Celia and her eternal slippery coating of cream , Suzanne would try to think what it meant . Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . they were paragraphs in the history and dates to recite to Miss Libbie Field . But war was something more than paragraphs and dates . It was Phineas and Alf and Rand Banningerand all the Pioneer Grays . There was even talk that maybe Lincoln might call for more than these first boys . If he did ... She would lie quietly , staring into the blackness of the logs . " Do n't let Wayne Lockwood go , " she would petitionsome unseen force which was composed strangely of both Lincoln and God . " Even if he belongs to Carlie Scott , keep him safe here . " On Saturday they all went over to town to see the soldiers drill , excepting Lucy who was too close to her time to dare venture forth , and Emily , who knew some one must be with her . Sarah offered to stay but Emily said , " No , you go ahead , Ma . It 's your own son going . " Yes , it was her own son going . She and Jeremiah went in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phineas and his fun-loving disposition and hustling ways . Henry drove the spring wagon with Celia , Suzanne , and Melinda dressed in their best  --  Suzanne in her blue poplin with a white mull fichu and new ribbons on her butter-bowl hat ; Celia in a new dress with a pink vine rambling over its white background and a white hat with pink buds as though the flowers from her dress had rambled up on to it ; Melinda who never cared what she wore , in brown with the family red cherries rattling glassily together on her dark straw bonnet . They crossed the bridge , Lassie 's and Laddie 's heavy hoofs clumping noisily over it , drove past the stores through Main Street with the stumps still a part of the picture , and out to the drill-grounds where last fall the cows and the horses had paraded at the Fair . Now it was men parading . It was Phineas and the Banninger boys , John Philpot , George Tuthill , and Charlie Boehmler , and all the Pioneer Grays in their new uniforms . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July and County Fair rolled into one  --  and yet unlike them . Sadness and excitement ! Grief and pride ! Women biting lips to keep them from quivering . Men swearing lustily to hide unwanted emotion . Young girls in tears . The band playing . Flags on horses ' heads and on carriage tops and in the sideboards of lumber wagons . When the drill was over and ranks were broken , all the brave new uniforms began mingling with the crowd . Here and there a uniformed young man and a white-skirted girl strolled into the timber paths near-by . Celia , in her pink and white dress , and Alf Banninger were two of the strollers . It went through Suzanne 's mind that Celia must have maneuvered it well . Suzanne , in her blue dress and butter-bowl hat , and Melinda , in her dark brown and rattling cherries , were standing there together when Rand Banninger , Phineas , and Celia 's clerk friend all came up to them . Rand , with warm eyes for Suzanne , pulled her away from the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , which she was of no mind to do . " Suzanne , " he said hurriedly when they were a few yards away , " marry me , will you ? Marry me before I go . " He was bending to her , his dark face close . Suzanne went a little white with the suddenness of it and his nearness , not really knowing that Rand liked her that well , wrought up , too , with the band 's playing and the flags and the excitement . Strangely enough her first lucid thought was thatp323marrying Rand would ease the hurt about Carlie Scott . Just for a moment  --  for one tempting moment  --  Rand Banninger and his father with a thousand acres of land held out ointment for stricken pride and solution for groping questioning . And then she was herself . " Oh , no , Rand . I could n't . " " Why not ? " " I just do n't . . . do n't think enough of ... " " Well , I like you enough . . . come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few weeks . Come on , please . " He was coaxingas light-heartedly as though asking her to take a boat-ride . " We 'll build a house on the north half-section . I 'm dead anxious to beat Alf getting settled ... " " No ! " She was crimson-faced now , recoiling from his close contact . " Do n't speak of it again . " Alf and Celia coming back from their stroll found them standing so . Alf was excited , jubilant , could scarcely wait to get close before calling out : " Celia and I are going to get married . . . right away this afternoon . We do n't have to report at the barracks until to-morrow night , Rand . We 're going to hunt up a preacher . " Celia was cool , unperturbed , smiling at Alf 's excitement . Suzanne looked at her in amazement so that Celia gazed back with knowing half-closed eyes . " Oh , Celia . . . so soon . You do n't think ... " " Of course it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rand turned to Suzanne , saying low : " Is that the last word you 've got to say ? " " Yes , it is , Rand . " His face flushed and his dark brows drew together . " By gad , " he muttered , " no brother of mine can get ahead of me like that  --  " and started across the parade-ground . It was all very confusing , with Celia insisting they must hunt up Henry and start right home , Alf saying he would find his folks and then set out on horseback to get a preacher to come . Suzanne started to look for the folks and break the worldshakingnews to them , but just as she turned , they came up with Henry . Celia at once told them the plans . " Where 's Melinda ? " Sarah asked . " We 've got to get right home if this is really so and you ai n't jokin ' us . " And then Melinda came up , her wide brown skirts scraping the prairie grass , her bonnet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the haste she was in . Rand Banningerwas with her . She looked a little frightened and wholly excited , giggling nervously . " Rand and I are going to get married to-night , Ma , " she said . " Along with Celia and Alf . I hope you do n't care . " Sarah 's thin little mouth set in a straight line . " I do n't know 's I could do anything about it , if I did . " " Well . . . well . . . " Jeremiah said . " I ai n't been so surprised since I got my first nomination . " It was all right with Jeremiah . Old man Banninger owned most a township , seemed like . Time was , he could n't have stomached these two brash young Democrats . But things were different now . Looked like the war was making him crawl into bed with the northern Democrats . Suzanne felt a little ill . Her head whirled , and she had a sensation of being blown about in some strange world whose storms she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Melinda this was not what love was like . Love was wanting some one person more than any one else in the whole world . It was n't  --  oh , it was n't taking it as lightly as this . With some wild idea of calling Melinda aside , she caught Rand Banninger 's eyes upon her , dark and flashing . They held an expression of threat and triumph and something else that was almost little-boy pleading . There stood Melinda  --  good , funny Melinda  --  so tomboyish and noisy , so anxious always to be going somewhere . Yes . Melinda was wanting top325do something different , to be " going somewhere . " What could you do about it ? They were all on the way out home now , Henry pushing heavy old Lassie and Laddie at the top of their clumsy-footed speed . There were chores to do and two weddings to be performed . Alf had found his folks . Rand was ahead , long out of sight , riding his horse at breakneck speed to Prairie Rapids for licenses and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though these events were nothing to get excited over . Melinda was all animation , talking a blue streak all the way home , laughing incessantly and trying to get a dab of mud out of her eye . " What was Rand saying to you , Suzanne ? I saw him corneringyou . Was he talking to you about me ? " Something caught at Suzanne 's throat  --  the reaction to the memory of three girls playing together with acorn dishes down by the slough , Celia , Suzanne , and happy-go-lucky Melinda  --  the memory , too , of a dark day when a boat whirled and turned and tipped . " Yes , he was , " Suzanne said . " He was asking me if I thought you would . " These were the strangest of all the weddings that had taken place in the log-and-lumber house . Even Phoebe Lou 's had been leisurely in comparison to this double ceremony which was to be performed as soon as Rand came back with the licenses and preacher , and Alf with his folks . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falter in her managerial capacity , saw her stand for a few minutes in the middle of the lean-to , the back of her hand across her twitching mouth , then go uncertainly to the door and call : " Emily ... can you come ? I need you , Emily . " No , Ma could n't get along without Emily . But by the time Emily had arrived from Henry 's , panting and a little disheveled , to report that Lucy was all right so far , Sarah had hold of herself , was telling the news of the marriages about to take place as though they were all in the day 's business . " The Banningers will be here most any time . . . and the preacher . We 've got to whack up a decent supper . Melinda , cut the heads off some of those young fries . And keep your own head level while you 're cutting theirs . Emily , make up a good fire and pare potatoes . Celia , you put the good cloth on and set the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get all fixed ... " " That 'll do for you . Scoot , now . " Bride or no bride , the table had to be set . And when Suzanne said , " You left me out , Ma , " Sarah said , " You ride to Wayne Lockwood 's and tell him to come . He 's been to every girl 's wed  --  " " No , Ma . . . I wo n't , " Suzanne said quietly . " I 'll do anything else , but I wo n't do that . " So Phineas , riding in then , was sent for Wayne and in the excitement the unusual stubbornness went unnoticed . The Banningers came in their heavy covered carriage  --  little Mrs. Banninger crying nervously whenever any one spoke to her , Mr. Banninger , bluff and hearty , saying that if the boys were bound to do this unexpected thing , he could n't have found better girls for them if they 'd sent him out to hunt up a couple . Tom and Sabina drove in , and Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her cabin . But there was no time to get word to Jeanie , six miles away , and it was not until Monday on Soldiers ' Day that she learned her sisters had been married . Wayne came in his fine gray suit , and Phineas , Rand , and Alf were in their new blue uniforms . The Reverend Eberhardt who was sending two boys with the troops on Tuesday came out from Prairie Rapids with Rand . So after the potatoes were mashed and while the fries were still popping and sputtering in the iron spiders , Celia and Alfp327stood up at one side of the fireplace with the old clock and the wild-turkey feathers above it , and Melinda and Rand stood on the other side , and were married , the young men in their blue uniforms and the girls in the dresses they had worn all afternoon , taking off their kitchen aprons for the ceremony but putting them right on afterward to help Ma . Suzanne , looking on , felt strangely callous . She did not know why . All those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to have been observed by some other girl than herself , an emotional creature to whom a wedding was the culmination of a romance . Celia and Melinda , the two closest to her in age , with whom she had always played , were marrying these two strange noisy men , scarcely knowing them , living with them to-night , seeing them go off to war on Monday . Surprise  --  sorrow  --  repugnance  --  knowledge of Rand 's wanting to marry her instead of Melinda , tore so at her emotionsthat the sum total of their torture was this cold callousness . Even the sight of Wayne Lockwood across the room looking particularly handsome in his gray suit with fine white ruffled shirt moved her not at all . " Alf and Celia , I pronounce you man and wife . " " And now , Rand and Melinda , I pronounce you man and wife . " And Ma was saying something about hoping the chickens had n't crusted down in the butter . Then they all sat down to the table , but though there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk nor the laughter could keep them from seeing the shadows of three blue uniforms cast by the light of the candles flickering in grotesque uncertain shapes high on the whitewashed walls . After supper , Phineas rode away to see some one , Henry and Nora hurried home to Lucy , Wayne Lockwood left , and the elder Banningers . Then Sabina gave the key to her house to the newly married couples , telling them that she and Tom would just stay here to-night in the company room and drive over in the morning . And Alf and Rand Banninger , laughing long and boisterously at the joke that neither one had outwitted the other in marrying first , went away with Celia and Melinda . Pa wound the big iron weights of the clock , saying " Day 's over ... " And even though his voice caught on the words like a coat sleeve on a bayonet , he finished bravely : " Fresh start to-morrow . " So only Emily and Suzanne were left to mount the loft ladder , each having a wide bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher like Miss Anna Field , " Suzanne said to herself as though she were speaking to another person . With her face turned into the crook of an arm deep in her pillow , she drew away from the thoughts of marriage like a little white nun slipping into her cloister . Henry and Lucy ! Sabina and Tom ! Jeanie and Ambrose ! Phoebe Lou and Ed ! Melinda and Rand ! Celia and Alf ! Wayne Lockwood and Carlie Scott .. . " Oh .. . yes ... a teacher all your life . "   SUNDAY , that second of June , was the queerest day Suzanne thought she had ever experienced  --  a still one , as though the wind in the maples and cottonwoods was hushed for the strangeness of it , because Celia and Melinda had been married so suddenly and gone away with Alf and Rand Banninger , because Phineas was helping Henry around the stables for the last time before going off to war , because there had been nine children around the table in the yesterdays and now there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and an emotional one , with Ma , her mouth twitching , asking Phineas what he wanted most for his last dinner , and Phineas saying , like a little boy : " Hot saleratus biscuits , Ma , with chicken gravy . " In the afternoon all but Phineas got in the spring wagon and went to Overman Hall to hear the farewell sermon , a solemn meeting which wrapped every one in a mantle of gloom . Phineas rode Queen over , but now that he was staying at the barracks Suzanne rode her home . At the lane corner in the dusk she almost ran into Wayne driving across the river road toward the Scotts ' field in a shining new high-top buggy . " Well . . . hello , Suzanne . " He waved a tasseled whip , calling out jokingly , " A dark man with sinister design is crossing your path . " Evidently Wayne was not unduly disturbed that the boys were leaving without him , she thought wryly . Monday was given over entirely to the soldiers . After the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three women folks , they all went to town again except Henry who stayed with Lucy . The town was a moving mass of humanity . Citizens milled up and down the sidewalks in front of the little stores with children darting in and out of the crowd , not more excited than their elders . Horses with flags in their harness stomped bluebottle flies at the long lines of hitching-posts . The band played . The atmosphere was tense , every one 's nerves ready to snap . The whole countryside was there  --  the Scotts in their open carriage , Wayne Lockwood on horseback , Ambrose and Jeanie with the babies in a lumber wagon , Sabina in and out of the crowd comforting some one here , telling some one there how soon the whole thing would be over , the two Akin families in good covered carriages now , Melinda and Celia with Mr. and Mrs. Banninger , Celia in the back with her new mother-in-law , Melinda in the front seat with Mr. Banninger , so that Emily and Suzanne laughed together , wondering whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . The two brides were enjoying the stir they created with people coming up to shake hands and tell them how surprised they were . Celia looked cool and composed as though being a surprise bride was nothing new ; Melinda was excited and redfaced , her cherry bonnet on crooked and her neck ribbon awry . At noon the recruits from Waverly , a settlement farther up the river , arrived . In mid-afternoon , the Union Guards from Butler County came . Each contingent brought several hundred cheering settlers , so that Sarah said if mere noise could win the war , the Valley already had the Secesh licked . As though all this were not enough excitement for one day a letter from Ed Armitage arrived by stage saying he and Phoebe Lou had a ten-pound son and that Phoebe Lou said to tell the folks she bet she 'd played the biggest joke of her life on them , never once letting on what was up . At the evening meeting in Overman Hall , two ministers , twoP331attorneys , and the Honorable Jeremiah Martin spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at her mother 's thin face with its gray-red hair sagging a little under the black bonnet , caught in the swiftness of it a distinct expression of pride , so that she whispered : " Pa 's real good . " " Beard needs trimmin ' , " Sarah hissed back . There was no joking from Jeremiah Martin now . With simple directness , if in homely speech , he was promising the wives and children left behind that the community would not forget them , giving his word of honor to the departing Pioneer Grays that their families would be looked after . It brought quick moisture to Suzanne 's eyes to hear her father give his pledge to look after these dependents . If Pa gave his word , he would carry it out to the best of his ability . On Tuesday , the fourth , with the Grays leaving , Henry 's wife , Lucy , being nothing if not patriotic , went to bed and had a boy . This procedure had its drawbacks because it was going to keep Sarah home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " You 've got to see Phineas leave , " she told her mother . " You take Ma with you , Pa , and I 'll help the doctor with Lucy . " Henry , too , was expecting to stay from some vague sense of paternal duty , but Lucy herself settled that . " For goodness sakes , go on , " she said with a sudden show of spunk . " It 's all over , and it ai n't you been having it , anyway . " And now this was it . This was going off to war . Five thousandpeople packed around the little depot . The band playing . The flags waving . Horses skittish and whinnying with fright . The train getting up steam like a black monster about to carry the boys into the Unknown , with two passenger cars and a string of flats trailing behind the snorting thing . The Pioneer Grays , the recruits from Waverly , the Union Guards  --  seventy-eight men , with thirty more to get on at Prairie Rapids , all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors , sweethearts . Phineas , who had kissed half a dozen girls , was saying goodbynow to his father , shaking his hand , with Pa not letting go for several minutes , was giving his mother a kiss who had not been kissed by him since he was a little boy , her face working grotesquely . Another kiss for Suzanne , for Jeanie and Sabina , Celia and Melinda , and saying , " Tell Emily good-by again , " then shouldering his way down through the crowds . Melinda and Celia clinging to Rand and Alf , crying for the men they had known as husbands for so few hours . The enginegiving an ear-splitting blast . Tears . Moans . Hand-clasps . Last kisses . Women clinging to men . One woman fainting . Men tearing hands from their necks . Phineas turning to wave from the steps of one of the cars . " Oh , Phineas ! " Alf and Rand waving , trying to laugh . " Come back safe ! " Women calling out , sobbing . A few members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , were sobbing " Come back safe . " The train pulling out . Hands waving . Caps in the air . Tears . The train a tiny speck across the east farm lands . It was a strange summer with the girls all gone but Emily and Suzanne . Phineas was in camp at Keokuk  --  the Pioneer Grays now called Company K of the Third Regiment . Jeremiahat sixty was putting his big shoulder to the wheel of the farm work again , but so busy with meetings , war committees , and journeyings here and there that Henry , as hard-working as he was , must have another hired hand . Willie was his name , but Emily and Suzanne , surreptitiously changing the " W " to an " S , " had to watch themselves all summer for fear they would do so to his face . All talk was war talk  --  how reinforcements were arrivingp333every day at Cairo and Memphis , the federal and rebel strongholds , how the northern troops were planning to march right through to Richmond , how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars ( no one could begin to comprehend the vast sum ) and a half million additional troops . Sometimes Jeremiah heard these things from Mr. Scott before he could get to town for his own paper . It galled him secretly that the trainmen threw Mr. Scott 's Democratic Dubuquepaper off at the lane road where it was retrieved from the weeds by little black Plunk , the men carrying it past the lane a long way sometimes to tease the boy and to see him scurry after the train so fast . This accommodating of Mr. Scott irked Sarah openly . " Just who does he think he is ? " she asked often and sneeringly . If there was to be any " taking-down " of Pa , she preferred to do it herself ; most certainly it was not to be done by the uppish Scotts . Every one went to Prairie Rapids to the celebration on the Fourth . So infrequently had the family seen each other in the past month that it was quite a treat for Suzanne , Emily , Jeanie , Melinda , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly wait to see Ma and tell her something confidentially . Whatever it was , Celia evidently was provoked about it but Melinda could hardly whisper it to Ma for losing her breath with laughter . The day was one long seance of national salutes , martial music , military display , the reading of the Declaration of Independence , orations , a public dinner , toasts , fireworks , ending in the flourish of a firemen 's ball to which Suzanne went with Sam Phillips . Wayne Lockwood was there with Carlie Scott , scarcely able to take his eyes from the pretty flowerlike features of her childish face . Once he danced with Suzanne , whisperingwith tender inflection , " She 's like a doll , is n't she . . . a little china doll ? " And once Cady Bedson danced with her ,   saying heartily and loudly : " Well , Suzanne , I did n't know you 'd all at once grown up into such a pretty young lady , " so that it lay over her bruised heart like the healing leaves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success was every one in the Valley that the news of the rout at Bull Run was as unbelievable as devastating . It threw the community into deepest dejection and the rest of the summer was filled with gloom . One variation only from the high tide of war talk came to the neighborhood  --  a traveling showman holding forth at the school-house . He was a queer little pock-marked man but the feats he performedwere so wonderful that adults were nearly as enthralled as the children . He borrowed Jeremiah 's hat and pulled from it a lady 's garters , and when the sight convulsed the audience , he added to the hilarity by gingerly removing some baby clothes also . He ate a newspaper outright . He pulled yards and yards of red , white , and blue ribbons from his ears and mouth . He threw his voice into the far corners of the room where it seemed to come from staid Henry Martin in childish voice saying , " Humpty Dumpty had a dweat fall , " so that every one roared . But the climax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the open door and , with eyes rolling , wanted to know of the showman if his mammy was there . No , his mammy was not there . " What you want her for ? " the showman asked . It seemed that Plunk was late getting the newspaper up the lane and was afraid to go up the long road in the dark . " Oh , you trot along , " the showman advised , and winked at those nearest him . " You 'll be all right . " He stood at the door watching Plunk until the blackness of his little body became one with the blackness of the night . ThenP335there rose from the lane road horrible cat-fighting sounds , and when they died away , a weird low voice saying , " I want a nigger , " and in a moment , " I 've got a nigger . " It was told with a great deal of merriment all up and down the river road , how scared little Plunk was , and how he always scurried for the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one cause for laughter in the seriousness of the summer . Crops were excellent . The Martins thrashed three thousand bushels of wheat ( the neighbors all turning in to help , even as the Martins went in turn to the neighbors , there to help in field and house ) and put up countless tons of hay , while the corn stood tall and ripening in the summer sun . Soon after thrashing , a series of great summer storms swept the Valley  --  lightning that tore the skies and struck tall trees in the timber like fire from a rebel battery , thunder that crashed and rolled over the prairies like the reverberations of artillery from Bull Run , wind that bent and twisted the tall corn as though so many armies of green uniformed soldiers were mowed down . And then as Henry and his father were hauling the first two loads of wheat to town ready for the Dubuque train , grain took a great tumble in price . Currency was scarce . There was a heavy advance in freight rates . General Fremont had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which removed also the prospect of getting any grain to Chicago . They hauled the wheat back and stored it in the long granary , blue over the outlook . Excepting for that one time on the Fourth the family did not get together all summer  --  a strange situation for the Martins with their clannish instinct as strong as the birds whose names they so appropriately bore . Phineas at camp , Jeanie up on the north prairie expecting her third child , Sabina so busy with her war work in town , Phoebe Lou out in Colorado writing that the whole of Denver City was in commotion because so many southern sympathizers were mixed with loyal settlers , Melinda and Celia living over across the river with their new in-laws , " finding out , " Sarah said , " even if you have a thousand acres of land you ca n't live on but a few square feet at a time , " Emily and Suzanne at home , working hard , once or twice going into the field to help for a few hours on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist Lucy in the care of the new baby boy , Suzanne taking her teacher 's examinations and passing with flying colors . By September she was getting the home school ready for her first teaching . Seeing Wayne Lockwood ride down the field road toward the Scotts ' she would put him out of her mind for days as completely as long ago she had shut the door to her childish magic world . Now she not only shut but locked it . Then he would ride up , as she was leaving perhaps , stop a few minutes to chat , maybe swing off the horse and stand near her , so big and stalwart and likeable , and the door of that magic world would fly open as easily as though some impish creature , insertingthe key with invisible hands , had pushed it ajar in wicked glee . When the second call came for troops , she was almost sure that Wayne would volunteer . No family , no responsibilities exceptingthose he made for himself , he was just the kind of young man to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put up tons of hay in his new frame barn , so much larger than his cabin , brought in more sheep , built another new shelter for them , said casually to Suzanne one day as though his thoughts , longharbored , were involuntarily forming speech : " When I build my new house , Suzanne , it shall be something like my grandfather'sold home near the sea . . . wide clapboards painted white ... and green blinds . . . and a built-in seat on both sides of the stoop . "  |p337Hearing  it , Suzanne locked the door of her fancy once more and threw the key away  --  threw it blindly and far this time as one would toss a little unwanted thing into the green sea of the pasture grass . Now for school to begin into which to put all her energy , all the theories that Miss Anna Field had taught her , and all of her heart and mind ! No more philandering . Nora , five and a half , was starting , the Manson children were coming , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emersons from the lane road , black Plunk and Mamie from the Scotts ' , and several others . They were full of war talk . All the songs were patriotic , all the lessons ended in chatter about the last news from the south . Suzanne , not wise enough to understand that events unfolding in that year would some day make hard history lessons for other children , tried to keep all such talk out of the school-room , but failed signally . For how could that be done when fathers and brothers and neighbors were moving off to Shiloh ? Even in the first week , school was dismissed because every one wanted to go to town to see the new recruits entrain . All that same sadness of a company leaving was to be gone over again . It was late that afternoon when the Martin family , just home from the day 's excitement , heard a lumber wagon rattling down the road and looked out to see Jeanie driving into the yard , her face pale , her ashy hair stringing untidily from under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at her feet with the second little girl braced against her small body . Seeing Jeanie come in so unexpectedly , every one went out at once , with Jeremiah saying , " Anything wrong , my girl ? " " Oh , Pa . " Jeanie was alighting cumbersomely over the high wheel . She bit her lips , fighting hard to keep the tears back . " Ambrose has gone . "  | " To war ... without telling ... from Prairie Rapids ... Idid n't even know ... " She was fumbling for her handkerchief , bringing it out with a crumpled paper which fell by the well curbso that Sarah picked it up at once and with no hesitancy read it aloud : " JEANIE : I am taking this occasion to notify you of my enlisting . By the time you get this from whatever neighbor I find to send it by , I will be gone to Camp Union at Dubuque . I take this means because I know how opposed to it you would be and how you would have deterred me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to do . But feeling as I do toward my country , only a noble desire to help save it , I can not listen to what would have been your cowardly pleas for me to stay . Adieu and may you have the heavenly blessing of our Father . AMBROSE " " Well , of all the smug , pious , godly . . . " " Oh , do n't , Ma . He means all right . " The tears welled now and Jeanie was against her father 's old stable coat , sobbing : " Pa ... you know I would n't have held him back if he 'd just said . . . " with Jeremiah patting her arm awkwardly and saying , " There now . . . there now . " Suzanne was cuddling the smaller girl , Emily petting little Gracie . They all said she was to stay and live at home with them , but Jeanie straightened her shoulders at that , wiped her wet face , and laughed a little . No , she would n't do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she must be getting toward it , too , with the sun slanting already and two cows to milk . Just give the children a bite to eat and they 'd start back . Nothing they could say would make her change her mind , so they loaded a basket with smoked meat and bread , wild-grape jelly and half a sour-cream cake , and made her promise she would rig up some signal for her nearest neighbor if she got to feeling bad .  |p339When  she drove out of the yard , the lumber wagon rattling drearily over the hard-packed ruts , she turned and waved , tried to laugh a little , calling back , " Oh , do n't look so glum ... I 'm all right . " And Suzanne went up to the loft and cried all the tears that Jeanie was too brave to shed . I WORD came back that the new recruits with Ambrose among them were housed in a big wooden building at Dubuque which had been turned into barracks , that on their first night there southern sympathizers shot into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and that if the officers had not interfered there would have been a struggle at once entitled " The Battle of Dubuque . " The four remaining members of the Martin family sat around the tree-trunk steps talking about this and other news that had come . It was warm and muggy so that every one fanned and whacked at mosquitoes . Queer formations of black clouds slipped slowly across the sky at different heights blown by vagrant winds . " Look , " said Sarah suddenly . " What do you make of that ? " Two long rows of tiny black cloud figures moved slowly toward each other , met , intermingled and fell back , drifted together again , were blown apart , those at the south gradually getting dimmer , the north formation holding to their shape longer until they , too , disintegrated . " Did you see that ? It 's a sign . Battles . . . as sure as shootin ' . And the North winnin ' . " The next day word came back of a skirmish by the Third Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys who had gone in June were killed and another wounded . " What did I tell you ? " Sarah reminded them , so that for the first time in her life Suzanne looked with respect on Ma 's premonitions . P341It brought the whole terrible thing home to every one , as though they had not fully realized before that this could happen to the Valley boys . War had come out of the shadows and struck . It was no longer a menacing generality off there to the south and east . It had assumed shape and form and struck down James Brownell , Peter Dorlan and Lorraine Washburn . Only by chance were those names not Phineas , Rand , and Alf . It cast more gloom over both towns and called for much local criticism of the administration in neglecting Missouri and taking Iowa men east to defend Washington . Peter Dorlan , the wounded boy , was brought home on a cot and his arrival was the signal for a holiday in Prairie Rapids , the whole community turning out to line the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Phoebe Lou said troops were being organized out there , too , that Ed had volunteered , been made a second lieutenant , and was just here , there , and everywhere . No one was surprised when Sarah read the news to them out loud , Emily breaking into the reading to say it was just what she would expect of him . But when Ma read : " Ed has bought a new dress-parade suit with the very last of our money and he looks so handsome in it with sword and hat and sash , " she could scarcely get the words out for a contemptuous snort and remark about that whipper-snapper . Phoebe Lou said there was bustle and confusion on all sides , that a band was parading right now , and that you could hear the sound of fife and drum from morning until night . She had attended a regimental ball given for the officers and it seemed terrible to dance when you thought of what might be in store for all . She had been at the barracks when a recruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills and she hoped the girls would n't care but she had torn up the old family parasol and made him an eyeshade . The first of October Jeremiah took Sarah across the north prairie , leaving her there to care for Jeanie and the new baby , a third girl , of whose sex Ambrose at the Dubuque barracks would no doubt heartily disapprove when he heard . In the middle of the month Suzanne went to Teachers ' Institutein Prairie Rapids where one of the questions discussed was how to teach geography when the old lines of the country might be dissolving right before your eyes , and another was , why talk as though the only history to teach was away back in the Revolution when you could look at it that what was happeningright now was history . One teacher was brave enough to say she was n't worried about those two subjects half so much as how to keep the children warm on both sides at the same time this winter , and the drinking water from freezing . When the last session was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noise attracted them both . Men and boys were moving rapidly down the street , some running , others loitering along as though only half decided to join the group . Whatever was happening , its culmination was at the Central House and Jeremiah , never one to stay on the side-lines , hitched the team again and told Suzanne to wait until he investigated . " What 's the trouble ? " he asked a man who was walking by . " Franson , the lawyer , has been talking again . Old Barney , the tobacco man , too . He just came in on his tobacco wagon , pockets bulging with southern papers . The two have been hobnobbingtogether over the news . Folks have kind of had enough now and the crowd 's getting out of hand . " Suzanne , of no mind to be left out , kept at her father 's side as he walked toward the seat of trouble . The manager of the hotel was evidently pleading with the crowd not to do anything rash . But the temper of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yelling " we 've enlisted to fight rebels and we might 's well begin at home as anywhere . " P343The crowd gave noisy assent . Some one came from a store near-by with a rope . Men and boys surged into the hotel . " They 're at the supper table . " " No , they 've run upstairs . " " Hang the Secesh ! " " Hangin 's too good . " Several men were affixing ropes to the top of the building . And now others appeared at the entrance with the lawyer and the little swarthy tobacco man , their coats torn and hair disheveled . " Go back to the wagon , Suzanne , " Jeremiah said sternly . But Suzanne , even though sick at the sight , stayed rooted to the spot with fear and interest . " Make ' em talk . " " Yah ! You give us the first speech , Franson . " Two big dry-goods boxes were rolled to the door of the hotel and in no gentle way the men were yanked onto them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the man was plucky , a semblance of dignity still about him . " I 've only said . . . and I still say ... " " Yah . . . I guess you have , " and " We 've heard what you said , " rose with cries and cat-calls on all sides . " Is President Lincoln a fool ? " called a loud voice . " Well ... " " He ai n't quick enough with that answer , boys . " There was a surging toward the unhappy man . " No . He 's no . . . no fool . " " Who ai n't ? " " Lincoln . " " Say it again . Say President Lincoln ' with a little reverence in your voice , damn you . " " President Lincoln , " he said acridly enough but in the noise and cheers on all sides it passed for reverence.  | " Let him go , boys . He 'll keep his mouth shut or next time there 'll be one less Secesh . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who had been shaking visibly . In contrast to the lawyer he began a gibbering pleading : " Boys . . . do n't do nothin ' . Let me get to my wagon and get you some cigars to pass around . . . honest , boys , I 'll pass the cigars . . . . I ' 11 ... " " It ai n't tobacco . . . it 's a speech we want , Barney . " " Yes . . . a good patriotic speech . " Shaking , the little man said : " Why , I love the flag , boys .. . all I ask of you if you kill me is to wrap the Stars and Stripes around me for a windin ' - sheet . . . and ... " " That 's better ... " Suzanne rode home by the side of her father , silently , almost ill from the nervous shock of the episode . How could human beings treat a refined-acting man like Mr. Franson so . . . and even old Barney ? Both must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa , thinking to say so , but his face , set straight ahead , looked as grim as those faces of the men in the crowd . She said nothing , for she did not want to hear what Pa would answer . School took most of Suzanne 's time now and practically all of her thought and energy . Through a dusty path to the log building she hurried all those first weeks , then along a leafy rain-soaked one , and later one so snow-filled that it was all but obliterated . The day usually opened with an unmusical rendition of : We have come to our school-room ; we have come to our school-room ; We have come to our school-room in the State of 1-0-WAY . And in search of knowledge , and in search of knowledge , And in search of knowledge we will pass the time away . It passed on to McGuffey Readers and spelling , arithmetic , preparation for spelling school , the transmission of Suzanne'sP345recently acquired knowledge of capitals with shaded tails , and ended in a perfect orgy of musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common schools forever , Shout for blessings on the giver ' til we make the air resound ; And to those who labor for us and whose guardian care is o'er us We will swell the grateful chorus ' til the echoes back resound . By working hard at her task of teaching these neighbor children Suzanne filled her time with something which resembled the work of a missionary whose zeal amounts to fanaticism . If one put the whole mind on one 's work as did Miss Anna Field , she reasoned , anything could be taking place and one need not notice or heed  --  relatives and neighbors leaving for war , a young man riding up and down the lane road to Scotts ' , anything . In truth , Miss Anna Field became a symbol to her that fall , a sort of saint whom she set up in a niche in her mind , the calm orderly portion of her mind undisturbed by fancy or emotion . Suddenly in December wheat went up in price and cars were available so that Jeremiah and Henry , glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Prairie Rapids depot ready for shipment . One afternoon they reported that four hundred team-and-wagon outfits loaded with wheat and pork , and packed in too tight for any horses to run away , were lined up in the streets . " Enough to feed the union armies , " Jeremiah said , " but one thing 's sure , the rebels ca n't eat their cotton . You ca n't tell , maybe it 'll be food that will win it for us instead of generalship . " He wanted to know , too , if they had heard about the cannon firing , telling about the jubilation he had witnessed over at Prairie Rapids because Franson , the Secesh lawyer , had betaken himself to parts unknown . " Prairie Rapids has gone to lots of pains to get folks to come there to settle , " he chuckled , " but first time a jubilee was ever held over one departin ' . "   The new year of 1862 opened with varying reports so that one could scarcely tell just what was taking place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But victory or defeat made very little difference in one respect , either was tinctured always with fear for the safety of near and dear ones . The report might be favorable , but what about individual soldiers ? A battle might be won but what about Phineas ? What about Alf and Rand Banninger ? Or Ambrose Wiltshire ? Or Ed Armitage , dashing around so daringly out there in Colorado in his dress uniform with clanking sword and flapping sash ? Ambrose wrote Jeanie that they were encamped on a beautifulhill on the banks of the Cumberland near Smithland , Kentucky , and had not yet seen active service , but that they had commenced work on entrenchments under General Wallace and staff . It began " My honored wife " and ended " Your obedient husband " so that Jeanie cried for sheer joy that out of the awfulness of war had come this pleasant letter from her man , and then drove all the way across the snow-laden prairie with the three babies , so the folks could read it , handing it about proudly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremiah went to Des Moines again but this time he was sergeant-at-arms . Phoebe Lou wrote that little Theodore was thriving , as husky as could be , all unaware of their constant fears over hostile Indians and that his father 's company had been ordered to New Mexico where they might meet up with the Texas Rangers . And in the Red Cedar Valley , the weather was fine and favorable for sheep . Wayne Lockwood was more ambitious to get ahead than he had ever been , must make the most of the good prices , he told himself . He was to be one of the big landownershere some day . He must have good stock and fine crops , carriages and a great house , white with green blinds ! He must beAt a sudden thought he stopped and grinned to himself , P347remembering Suzanne Martin once riding bareback madly to his cabin to tell him they were going to be landed gentry . Yes , he must be landed gentry . No one could think of such queer things to say or make you laugh more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no one he would rather have around than Suzanne , happy and full of fun and intensely interested in everything about her . But not delicate and dependent ! Not fragile as a little china doll , nor dainty as a wind-flower ! No , one would n't call Suzanne a wind-flower . She was a . . . he could n't think just what , but grinned again , imagining how readily Suzanne could have answered him with some funny comparison . Yes , this winter Wayne Lockwood felt almost money-mad , angered that the war was intruding itself just when his prospectswere so good . A fragile dainty girl must have everything nice . . . all the fine things that money could buy . Letters from his mother asked constantly about his plans , worried that he would be going , cautioned him against volunteering , saying that soon it would be over . Little she knew that he was of no mind to go now . His deepest hope at every dawn 's rising was that the next battle would be the last , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goading thought of obligation to his country . " If war ends in the summer there will be piles of money made on produce , " he wrote home . But the war was not to end in the summer . Never had he felt completely at ease with himself since that first voluntary contingent of soldiers , the Pioneer Grays , had pulled out from the new depot the June before . Since that time another company had gone from Prairie Rapids and acquaintanceshad joined others . These were the men anxious to jump in , he told himself , the restless ones who would rather be at the front in the excitement than the cooler , more level-headed ones , like Henry Martin and himself , who stayed to raise the wheat and the sheep .   " I 'll wait a while and see , " he salved his conscience . " I 'll be neither the one nor the other , throwing myself into it hastily nor hanging back too long . It will soon be over . But if the call comes again and I see I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of draft I 'll volunteer before it comes . " He wrote his mother then to quiet her fears : " I shall probably not be needed , so cease your worry . In the meantime , because of the fine open winter my sheep have done well . " But seldom did he sing . For some reason , even though the flowerlike face of Carlie Scott was often in his thoughts , he was not letting out his melodious voice there in the Valley as of old . For how could one sing of war with thoughts of love stealing through the martial strains ? And how could one sing of love with the guns of war drowning out the melody ?   WINTER set in more earnestly in February . Snow fell with almost constant regularity . News of the battle at Fort Donelson came . The Twelfth had acquitted itself well . To Jeanie up on the north prairie with her three babies , Ambrose was the whole Twelfth Regiment . There had been only two casualties from Company E reported and neither one was Ambrose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had ever happened when the message came containing the victoryat Fort Donelson . Members of the house embraced each other , laughing and crying . As sergeant-at-arms he guessed he might as well have been an Egyptian mummy , for he made no pretense to keep order . Since the celebration you could n't tell a Democrat now from a Republican , a statement which the folks at home knew to be the test supreme of Pa 's magnanimity . Watch this man Grant , Pa said , too  --  that unconditional surrendermessage just beat the Dutch . Phoebe Lou wrote again . Life was so hard and worrisome . Sometimes she thought if she could just be back in the shelter of the old house she would feel better even though Ed was off with his company as he was now in New Mexico . There was lots of sickness here at the barracks . Often , she shut her eyes to the sight of the soldiers and her ears to their moans and imaginedherself at home with them all , around the old fireplace . She could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mantle and smell spare-ribs cooking and hear the girls joking each other . P350 " I guess she do n't know we have n't anything much to joke about , " Emily said . It was true . There was not much to joke about . Sarah , Emily , and Suzanne living alone  --  Suzanne hurrying home from school through the snow to help Emily with the chores . No one had the heart for singing school so there was very little going on in a social way excepting those occasional festivities over at town whereby money was raised for the soldiers . Wayne Lockwood had a new cutter and sometimes they saw him drive down the field road and come back with Carlie Scott tucked under his buffalo robes , her fur-trimmed pelisse on and a little muff held under her chin for all the world like the Grecian Exile in the Parlor Annual . And seeing her dressed so , Emily made Suzanne a new pelisse , too , and trimmed it with the minks Phineas once caught and skinned for Emily for a muff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even though Suzanne had the new mink-trimmed wrap , almost as pretty and fashionable as Carlie Scott 's , it never rode in the new cutter . Once Wayne came to get Emily to line a fine deerskin he had cured two winters before but never used . When Emily asked him how soon he wanted it , he said he must have it by Friday night for sure . Friday night , they knew , there was to be a festivity to raise money for the new library , an oyster supper , tableaux , dancing . The same day on which Henry brought the letter from Phoebe Lou he had one for Suzanne  --  a strange circumstance which no one could explain . As plain as clay it was directed to Suzanne , but inside the envelop the letter itself was to Carlie Scott , only asking Suzanne kindly to hand it to her . Every one questioned why this was sent so , but could make out no answer . Wayne Lockwood riding in then to get his deerskin robe , Suzanne painstakingly snuffed out the candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any interest for him in them , andP351asked cheerfully , almost laughingly , so good was her acting , if he would take the letter to Carlie Scott . Wayne laughed , too , saying , " How did you know I would be seeing her ? " The family seldom saw Sabina . She was busy from morning until night with her war work , and when not at the headquarters of the bandage workers , could be found going up one street and down another into the homes of the soldiers , a basket on her arm or some little youngster by the hand . " As like Pa as a twin calf , " Sarah said . " The responsibility of the whole world on her shoulders . " Jeanie was getting through the winter somehow , and would still not hear of coming home . " I made my bed . . . " she said the one time she drove down . " I 'm not coming back to have you help . I 'll pull through . " So she cared for her babies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying the second one in the home-made high chair and trusting the **30;5905;TOOLONG to be a little mother while she went out to shovel paths , split wood , and milk the cows . Jeanie , who had been a stalk of goldenrod in her yellow silk ! But sometimes when George Wormsby or some other old beau of hers would ride by and stop to do the hardest of her chores , Jeanie would forget her harsh reddened skin , her frost-bitten fingers , and unbrushed corn-silk hair , and roll her eyes merrily and break into girlish laughter . Emily and Suzanne had long known what it was that Celia and Melinda had whispered so excitedly to Ma at the Fourth of July celebration , and now the last day of February the brides came home to await their time . Rand 's and Alf 's mother had been just as good as gold , they said , but she was a china-dish kind of woman , worried , and scared to be left alone with them , fearful something wrong would happen , so the girls had Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't afraid of sickness . They got stuck once and Melinda scrambled out and helped shovel , but Celia stayed covered and warm under the robes . Sarah scolded a little behind their backs to Emily and Suzanne about the extra work and responsibility , but they saw right through her  --  she was as proud as a peacock that the girls preferred her to their mother-in-law . School to Suzanne was like the weather , uninteresting , gray , monotonous . The children clumped into the one-roomed building , great clods of snow falling from their thick shoes as from horses ' hoofs , their faces red under woolen hoods , their hands too stiff to hold the pencils for a time . The iron of the stove in the center of the room glowed red with heat so that any one within a radius of six feet of it roasted , all others froze . Little Nora told her Aunt Suzanne that she wished she could feel alike all over and not have part of her too cold and the other part too hot . Sometimes Suzanne held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her lessons . March came in neither like a lamb nor a lion , rather like an ox , stolid , still , patient , with its monotonous snow-storms . The railroad blocked . " Four feet on the level " was what Henry reported to the folks . Down the river road toward Prairie Rapids just where the river timber ended and the open prairie began , a pile of snow had drifted as high as a haystack . On the third of March Dr. Pierce floundered out through the drifts on horseback and helped deliver a ten-pound boy to Melinda , and when Celia showed no signs whatever of following suit but sat , cool and complacent , sewing by a lean-to window , Sarah sputtered no end about the doctor having to wallow back through all this snow and maybe turn right around and come out again , as though Celia were being stubborn . At that , Sarah 's prophecy was quite correct , for on the nextday Celia gave birth to a boy , laughing weakly but triumphantlywhen told that he weighed half a pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month a young man from north ofPrairie Rapids who had been wounded at Fort Donelson camep353home on furlough . He was wanted everywhere for dinner , for supper , to spend the evening , and stay all night . When he first came he said he had killed a confederate in battle there . As his course of entertainment at various farm homes carried him up the river road from Prairie Rapids toward Sturgis Falls , it was noticeable that the number of Johnnie rebels who had fallen before his trusty weapon increased , until by the time he arrived at the Martins ' practically a whole company had fled at his attack . There was a cessation then of snowing around the last of the month but the days remained cold , drear . Sometimes there was no one moving in the whole landscape , no animal stirring or human in sight , as though the prairie lay locked in an eternal ice age . School was depleted because of drifts , only the river road being broken and passable , and part of the lane . The Akin children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Scotts ' Negro man Hi shoveled through the field-road drifts to bring his two children every morning . They were as clean as whistles , Mamie 's pigtails tightly braided around little dark blue ribbons , Plunk 's neat waists made from the fine material of Mr. Scott 's shirts . Because life was so filled with the war , practically every day at school was a patriotic day . On Friday afternoons this was particularly true , the whole program being given to lusty shouts of " My Country Tizzof Thee " and " Say , Darkie , Have You Seen Old Massa ? " and similar bursts of semi-musical loyalty . On this last Friday in March with the weather moderating for the first time , as though April would soon take command , one of these Friday speakings had just been brought to a noisily patriotic close by the hanging of Jeff Davis to a sour-apple tree , so that school was out again until Monday morning . Suzanne herself was to have something that looked like a real break in the monotony for she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday and Sunday with Sabina . P354Emily had suggested it , pretending to put the blame for Suzanne 's lassitude on loss of sleep because of the new babies . So now Suzanne 's bundle containing her night-dress and comb was lying on her desk until Mel would come by . There was the customary bundling process by the children and the warning on teacher 's part to hurry home . Black Hi came for Mamie and Plunk . Nora left in the care of the Akin boys . Suzanne put on her bonnet and wrap and was getting on her galoshes ready for the jingling of Mel Manson 's bells , bending low to fasten them , when she heard the door . She looked up quickly to see Carlie Scott standing in the halfpartitionedentry . Carlie had on her fur-trimmed pelisse with its matching muff and a little velvet bonnet tied under her chin . It was true that she looked like a flower , a pale little snowdrop , perhaps , underneathits winter covering . Suzanne stood up , startled that any one was there at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " Oh , I thought you 'd be gone . " There was something queer about it . Carlie Scott here alone for no purpose  --  the program over , school out , the day dark and gray , and thinking Suzanne would be gone . Plainly , too , she was disturbed . Something was not turning out as she had planned , and Suzanne felt intuitively that the something was her presence . Well , she had a right to be in her own school-room . The two young women stood facing each other in their furtrimmedwraps so strangely alike , and because there was somethingof awkwardness about it for both , Suzanne said , rather inanely : " I 'm waiting for Mel Manson to come by to take me to town . " " Then you 'll be here until he comes ? " " Yes . " " In that case "  --  Carlie Scott put down her muff as thoughP355she , too , were staying until some one came by  --  " I guess I 'll just have to throw myself on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise me that ? Promise not to tell anything about seeing me here ? " Suzanne 's heart stood still with fright and the pain of what Carlie was to say . " If it 's . . . necessary . " " It most certainly is . " The girl 's eyes flashed and Suzanne saw that she was not a little snowdrop just now , but a bit of a pepperplant . " Do you promise ? " " Yes , I promise . " " Your word of honor ? " Something of Jeremiah stiffened Suzanne . " When I promise anything , " she said quietly , " it is my word of honor . " Without answering , Carlie Scott walked over to the woodbox , removed all the top chunks gingerly , and from under others extracted a satchel . It went through Suzanne 's mind for a momenthow queer it was that the fancy flowered bag had been under there all afternoon , like something alive , and no one had known it . " Some one is coming for me , " Carlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I 'll be gone . " The room spun a little crazily to Suzanne , so that there was a queer blurring of homely wooden benches , small windows on which the snow still clung in half-moons , the tall iron stove , and the white face of Carlie Scott in a brown velvet bonnet . Standingso , she knew that she must say something , give evidence of having heard aright , make pretense of being able to listen to this astonishing confession . " Wayne Lockwood . . . is coming ? " Carlie gave a short laugh that held irritation in it as well as faint amusement . " Oh , no . . . how stupid ! The man I love . . . that they did n't want me to see any more . . . that they thought they were sepa/rating me from for always . Well , they 'll find they could n't do that . He 's over in town ... and coming for me ... and ... " Like a tree branch pulled to the limit of its tautness and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intenserelief that she wanted to cry out from the sudden sharp change . Until she remembered ! What would this do to Wayne ? Oh , poor Wayne ! For a time they stood in awkward silence and then there was the sound of floundering horse hoofs and squeaking runners , and Carlie Scott was at the door opening it only a crack at first , then flinging it wide . In the doorway she turned back and laughed nervously , her pale cheeks flushed . " Now , you can have your big solemn farmer . Maybe you think I have n't guessed . I was n't blind . Well , that 's all I wanted of him ... to throw them off the scent ... keep them from knowing my real feelings and what was going to happen . Good-by . " For long moments Suzanne stood unmoving , eyes to the door beyond which Carlie Scott had disappeared , listening to the recedingsounds of floundering hoofs and squeaking runners . Still in a daze she finished fastening her galoshes and put on her mittens . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " I 've changed my mind , Mell , " shaking her head when he failed to understand . " Not go ... ing . " She was of no mind to go to Sabina 's now . Sabina was so everlastingly good  --  all her talk would be about her war work and her committees . No , she wanted to get home to Emily , to crawl into bed to-night by the side of the one sister who knew when to be silent . Poor Wayne ! How shocked he would be ! He must have been caring deeply for Carlie . It would be his nature to care intenselywhen once he did . She felt compassionate toward him for the great hurt , looked up the lane road as though she mightP357see the answer to her question there and send some of that sympathy to him on the sharp spring winds . The cold was less brittle than in recent days , but with that peculiar instinct of the prairie child , she sensed more snow in the offing , looked askance at the low-flung clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semblance of a giant face , two for cheeks and a third for the nose , great inflated features that no doubt would blow their icy breath on the countryside again in the night-time . Mind in a turmoil at the knowledge of this devastating thing that had happened to Wayne , clutching her bundle , she lowered her head and walked into the cold wind across the schoolyard . Scarcely had she come to the deep snows at the road 's edge until she heard lunging horses and creaking runners and looked back to see Mr. Scott and black Hi turning from the field road toward town so sharply that the sleigh tipped , tottering perilouslyfor a moment before righting itself and going on up the snowy highway . She shivered with the cold and the nervousness of this thing that had just happened and the added knowledge of Mr. Scott and black Hi giving chase as their mad driving appeared to be . Holding her long skirts above the high ridges of snow where a few sleighs had lumbered back and forth , she started east toward home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high above the horizon now , her eyes suddenly caught a glimpse of that which caused her to stop short in her tracks . Other grayishwhiteclouds were rolling along on the ground , turning , twisting with a peculiar up-and-down bobbing motion so similar to the clouds above them that they seemed but a continuation of those in the sky . They were Wayne 's sheep , crowding together in a tight pack , following the bell-wether , drifting foolishly ahead of the storm as sheep will , heading straight for Deer Run . Sheep would follow a leader into any fool place . She looked around franticallyfor help , hallooed once or twice for Henry , but her voice returned to her eerily on the silence , so she knew there was no use wasting time in vain calling . Instead , she picked up her skirts and plunging across the width of the river road , turned back and north into the lane . If the river road had been bad , cut as it was with the ruts of many sleighs and the deep declivities of horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a few families came down from that direction , so that the snow was less cut and walking that much harder . But to get to Wayne 's cabin and tell him about his sheep was the least she could do for him . Otherwise they were heading straight for broken ice , which meant the utter destruction of all his work . He must not have this loss on top of his loss of Carlie . To the north she could see his cabin standing at the edge of the grove with no smoke from the chimney , no movement about the place , no pawing horse or leaping dog . It looked silent and desolate . There was no use wasting time , then , in going on up the lane . Cutting across the field , herself , to head off the bell-wether was clearly the only thing to do . As soon as she had passed the end of the Beards ' rail fence , she turned toward the creek to make a diagonal crossing in order to reach its bank before the flock did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes she sank through snow still soft and light from the last falling . Sometimes she broke through hard crusts so that their knifelike edges scraped her legs cruelly , once feeling a warm trickle of blood on her ankle . But always she kept her eyes on those dirty-white backs , like grayish clouds that bobbed and rolled along the ground as though the sky and the prairie were one . Her long skirts hindered her and made her recall Pa 's reading from the Courier one night before he left about a young ladyP359from the East who had been arrested for promenading in male attire , but who claimed the right to wear pantaloons , defending herself manfully . She and Emily and Pa had stood up for the girl , but Ma had said it was too unladylike to be condoned . Unladylike ! When would girls ever get to be sensible instead of ladylike ? If she had pantaloons on now she could scoot across this stretch of liard-packed crust . At the thought of herself in pantaloons running like a sandhill crane over the tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time she was to laugh that night . It was growing darker , with an uncanny , too early blackness . The low scudding clouds were now coming in from the northwestmore rapidly . They rolled low over the prairie , boiling , hissing their wrath at the land . The giant was no longer merely inflating huge cheeks and pursing angry lips in threatening mood . He was snarling his rage , blowing ice-cold winds , spitting sleet . He bent low over the form of Suzanne Martin , laughed at having her slight body in his grasp , tossed it down as though to have his will of her , covered the daylight with darkness so that no one might see his evil . Suzanne cowered against the frightful venom . The grayishwhitesheep were not far away  --  she could hear their bleating and the tinkling bell of the leader  --  but suddenly they were no longer visible . The darkness and the storm had leagued together to obliterate them . Only by sense of ear could she tell there was anything near but raging wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the underbrush and down the creek bed , the sound of their cries and the bell lost in the roaring gale . There was nothing she could do now but turn and go home . Go home ! " I 'll go in just a minute , " she kept thinking . But the sleet was such a stinging blinding thing that she had to cover her face from its lashing and crouch in a thicket of bare rattling bushes which gave not the slightest protection . P36o As she cowered , a frightened sheep blatted and bumped into her so that she caught at it thinking to hold it to her , but it cried the louder and slipped away . And now she lived in a world of ice and snow in which no other thing existed . Never had she known such penetrating cold . Snow whirled into her nostrils , needles of sleet cut her face . She wanted to cry out with the hurt of it but her breath would not come . The fur of her collar was a sodden mass against her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told herself crazily . " I ought to be able to get there . I know every foot of this prairie . It belongs to me . Right here along this creek bed I 've picked wild grapes and haws . I 've waded here in Deer Run and ridden Queen across this very spot . The prairie ca n't go back on me like this . The creek ca n't treat me so . When you love Nature as I always have , she ca n't turn against you . " She stood up but there came another blinding blast of snowfilledwind so that she crouched and clung to the rattling bush not wanting to leave its familiar shelter . " I 'm in real danger , " she thought more calmly . " I 've got to keep my head . Now think this all out . Try to plan the way Pa would . Think how to pull through . It 's getting even worse and I 've got to get home . The best way to go about ... " A great blast threw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a dull dismay she knew her face was too numb with cold to feel it keenly . That was a far more dangerouscondition than to feel the sharpened glass of sleet cutting into her soft flesh . Her hands , too , were numb  --  the one holding her bundle had no feeling at all . She could still hear the far-off bleating of sheep when the wind blasts died down intermittently , but it was very faint as though they might have gone on in the darkness , or most of them drowned in the open places . Quite suddenly her mind was clear and she knew what top361attempt to do . Follow the creek bed . It might take hours in the darkness of the storm feeling her way along the ice ... but she would make it unless ... like the sheep in those open places ... There was another sound now , one of breaking snow crust and thrashing creature coming close . Horse odor came to her nostrils , so that she rose frantically to meet the animal 's oncomingriderless flounderings , to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was not riderless . A man swung off to bend over her . " Suzanne ... good God ! What are you doing here ? " Wayne Lockwood , trying to trace the path of his sheep through the storm , had run onto her . " Oh , Wayne ! " He had her in his arms and up on the horse , had turned and was trying to retrace his path through the crashing sleet and howling of the wind to the lights in his cabin windows .   W AYNE put the half-frozen girl down in a chair far from the fire until he could see whether her face showed white in the light of the candle 's flame which he brought . Then he took off her galoshes and shoes , but her feet had suffered less than her hands because of her crouching over them during the time by the creek bed . With no words he worked over her , brought a pan of snow for the colorless hand that had grasped the bundle , knelt by her , plunging it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers . Tears which she tried to control , and could not , slipped from her at the pain and mingled with the moisture on her sleet-covered face so that he got up to bring a towel and wipe it , drying her hands , too . " Now you can get close to the fire , " he said , and picked her up in the chair to carry her to the burning logs . He took off her bonnet and scarf and helped peel off the sodden wrap . But she was soaked through and shivering from the icy wetness . Here by the fire , water dripped clammily onto the floor from her long skirt . " You 'll have to get out of the rest of your things , too , " he said matter-of-factly . " I 'll try and get you something . . . " He broke off . " What 's in your bundle ? " " It 's only my ... I was going to stay all night at Sabina 's . " " I see . Put it on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the snow . " Oh , I could n't , Wayne ... not here . " " Put it on , " he said crossly . He was turning down his bed , P363folding back the flannel-lined deerskin and the pieced comforts from his New England home . " And get in here . " And when she only stood , clutching her bundle , shaking still form the wet and cold , he said gruffly , " What are you waiting for ? " He turned on his heel and went over to the cookstove , fed its fire with split wood , and with his back to her , fussed over the iron utensils and his supper . " Tell me when you 're in and I 'll get your wet things , " he said shortly . " I 'm in , " Suzanne said later in a thin little voice from over the comforts and the deerskin . When he came to get her clothes , he asked : " Chilling ? " " A little . " But Suzanne did not know in what proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer thing that was happening . He hung her soggy garments in front of the fireplace . Then he brought her soup  --  a great bowl of it with the huge thick crackers like miniature paving blocks which the Sturgis Falls store sold . " You 'll strangle . Sit up higher , " he said shortly , and pulled her up , thumping the pillows at her back . Suzanne ate her soup  --  mutton broth with bits of potato and onion and dried beans in it  --  and it was very good . It warmed her chilled body and sent the blood racing through her veins . When he came to take the bowl he stopped a moment by the bed and looked down at her . " Now tell me why you did that dangerous darn-fool thing ? " " I saw your sheep heading for the creek . . . and I could n't bear to think of your losing them , too . " It was out before she realized she had said it . That little word " too , " so innocent and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been spoken which never should have been said.  | But he did not question her , did not ask what it meant , merely stood looking down at her as though he did not see her . Then he turned abruptly and walked back to the fireplace , dropped down in his big calico-covered chair , and as long as she kept awake Suzanne could see him there looking into the logs with the firelight on his face . He knew . He had heard . Perhaps he had met Carlie and the man when he came from town , or Mr. Scott and black Hi stopping to ask if he had seen anything of running-away Carlie . However it had been , there was no mistakingthat lie knew . She could tell by his attitude and the strange baffled look on his face and by what her own heart said . For a long while she watched him sitting so . There was no sound in the room  --  only the storm out there like prairie-wolves tearing at the cabin . And then , because of the warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was nameless but vaguely reassuring , she slept . Sometime in the night she woke with a start , incredulous and half frightened to find herself here . He was still there in front of the fire but with his head forward in his hands so that she wished with every fiber of her being she might comfort him . Yes , she believed she would have been willing to bring Carlie Scott back to him if that were possible , so deeply did she want him to be happy . It was of Carlie he was thinking and it was for Carlie he was grieving . Of that Suzanne had no doubt . For how could she know that queer things were running through Wayne 's mind , crazy , confused thoughts he had never harbored before , perplexing questions with no answers . " Oh , Suzanne , what shall I do ? I 've been hurt and disillusioned . I feel sore and bruised . And above all my pride is hurt . I do n't know where to turn but to you . More than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you are and tell you all about it . I want your comfort and your sympathy . And I want you . But you would n't believe that , would you ? You 're the one real thing in life , Suzanne . You 're the girl carrying ap365candle for me to see by . You 're the north star holding up the only light to guide me home . But you would n't understand that . I could never explain . You would have your pride , too ... " In the gray of the early morning after the storm abated , and the white prairie lay as still as a dead man in his shroud , Wayne explained about the previous night , standing in the lean-to at the Martin home . Sarah was upset and nervous . " And we thought she was safe at Sabina 's all the time . I wish Pa was here . There ai n't ever been anything said of one of my girls . Jeanie may have had some talk of her havin ' more than one beau at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wayne stood tall and straight and a little disdainful , confrontingthem all . " There are a lot of people in the world who think a closed door never hides anything but evil , " he said sharply . " Well , I would n't want anything said about Suzanne that you would n't . Thank your lucky stars I set out to get my sheep and found her . Maybe you would n't have had her alive to-day if I had n't . I took her to the nearest shelter  --  my cabin . I could n't have brought her home here through that storm if either her life or her reputation depended on it . I took care of her and brought her safe home here this morning . " His voice rose high and harsh . " Do you believe it or do n't you ? " " Yes . " Little Sarah 's eyes snapped and her voice , too , rose high and harsh . " I believe it . " He swept the staring group with half-scornful glance . " Then say no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his heel and walked out , slamming the lean-to door . Melinda snickered . " I bet if it had been Carlie Scott . . . " " Dry up , " Emily whirled on her . " Dry up and ' tend to your own affairs . "
