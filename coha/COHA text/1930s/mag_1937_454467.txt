ON Faros , island of the gleaming rock , my eyes first caught the light of Helios . Fathered by an impetuous man , my mother a slave , childhood with me was passionate and my youth a storm . Our city 's walls held more hate than love . Breaking away from some fierce dispute , an angry clique might take ship and look for a new home . I , long called a maligner , would speak truth . Our men were united against foes . In peace common prejudices and like pursuits fostered a working fellowship . There was comradeship among those of us who had shared danger together . Strong impulse as well as ingenious thought marked our Ionian towns . Life was eager with each man and with the people when assembled in the market place . My own life , now mirrored in memory , is no longer distracted as when in the flesh . It was cast on circumstance . I recall its rancors and can measure its violence . I can still laugh , as once I jested , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sparta , where they drove me out with jeers . No shame was felt by one who chose to live , knowing how to lose as well as win and raise his head again above the waves . My nature is put best in those iambics spoken to my soul : ' Soul , soul ! stricken with An Ionian Greek poet living in the first half of the seventh century before Christ . The ancients placed him next to Homer . Only casual fragments of his poems remain . They deeply influenced Creek poetry and drama . ? Aumon 554overwhelming troubles , bear up ! Thrust back the onslaught and the ambushed danger , breast to foe . And neither , conquering , foolishly exult , nor , conquered , wail and cry . But in joys rejoice and in evils grieve not overmuch . So learn what rhythm holds men . ' I could endure as well as another . Speaking from myself , I counseled a friend that for irreparable ills the gods had given the medicine of steadfastness . I fought and hated . My verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my limbs . Yet throughout the anger and violence of my life consideration knocked at the door . I could praise valor in a foe , and heeded Odysseus 's chiding of the old nurse not to exult over the dead . The unforeseen might descend on any man , like the darkening of the sun at noon . But Zeus gave mind and mood to meet what might befall , and toil brought forth things useful for mortals . I knew that Father Zeus beheld men 's knavish as well as lawful deeds , and could raise from the black earth those struck down by ills . The best was that I ever followed , cherished , and increased within me , the Muses ' lovely and mighty gift of verse . Knowing and chanting Homer 's poems , I was no imitator . Of myself , above all other men , I moulded those quick iambics to pithy form , made them to sting and bite ; made them beautiful in their power to tell the passions and the fates of men . The poet Homer spoke from himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yet his chant was of what all men might wish for or would shun , with no word of his own chequered lot . I had no song of Zeus-born kings . My verse was of myself ? voicing my hates and longings , the passions of the men about me , which often touched me sore : men like myself entangled , driven , reaching a brief success . It was myself , my setting , my needs , often my own dire lot , I sung . Verse brought me renown in life and fame thereafter . That man called Korax , whose spear let out my breath , might not purify himself before the Pythian priestess , swearing that he killed me fairly . As having slain one sacred to the Muses , he was driven out till he should appease my ghost . I am praised by men in the far times to come ; in my island city is set my monument , and men are still bidden to pause before one whose fame had flown from the rising to the setting sun . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I experience . The lusting , fighting body , which was part of me , could endure its present , look back regretfully , or ahead , dreading yet hopeful of the future . But now occurrences no longer succeed each other . Thought carries what once had seemed to go before , and points to what shall be disclosed more clearly . Though a temporal sequence may order events which feed my mind , past and future are manifested in each other . It is all actualization , a flowering rather than succession . The exertions and endeavors , the turmoil , struggle , and killing that went on through the Ionian islands and coast cities when I was in the body , and the dire times that saw the barbarians enslave our peoples ? this complex of struggling or despairing life , the panorama of it all , is in my thought . Alas ! there seems always to have been some clever Ionian whose grasping selfishness wrecked the fortunes of his city , and ruined those civic liberties which are a springboard for intellectual achievement . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athenians over the Persian foe . And what a flowering followed of civic fullness , and art and drama and philosophy . The mind which now is me takes in the far event and sees the measureless import of Athens for mankind . There is no rancor in me , and scarcely regret for ill fortune ; what seems the past opens to me its why and wherefore reassuringly . Reminiscence as well as thought 's fair prospect brings a genial expansion of spirit . Genial , I say , because , while violence and sense-riot do not enter , I am interested and often moved . Discrimination brings desire for whatever discloses itself as truth . There are sequences in the visible world ; also in human knowledge . I have been turning to the thoughts of mon who were unborn when I was in the flesh . Then the gods were often on my tongue ; I have since queried as to the source of things and their ways of action ? the causes , so to speak . There is a Milesian who foretold that on a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shadowing , once seen by me , seemed to overtop all other wonders . Is it such a wonder if a man can foretell it ? Its cause lies not in my old gods whose action none could guess . This same Milesian says all things come from water , while a friend of his finds a more unlimited and total source . Heat and cold , and the wet and dry things , separate themselves out of this , while living animals are born of moisture and its warm evaporations . This seems to me real thinking and not just accepting what we used to put in poetry and daily speech . I see that men will answer such questions in many ways , which shall show their progress in thinking . For myself I mark that these Milesian schemes take no account of that which I am , OupOs ? soul , mind , will , purpose . So their insufficiency appears . Other thinkers offer me other thoughts . A certain sage makes over this basic matter into numbers and their relationships . He applies like thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to adapt their lives to social needs , eschew violence and gain moderation . I am with him here , little as my bodily life conformed . But as yet my own experience does not agree with his idea of souls passing from a dead body to a live one . This man lives far to the west , where there are others who are showing how insecure is man 's reliance on what his eyes and ears and fingers tell him of the world . One must have thinking , thinking to purge such evidence from contradiction and reach a thought of stable and sure being . I too am drawn to realize how little we can trust the quick message of our senses till thought has gone over and over it , and sifted what they have told us . But what do I hear from Ephesus of still one who denies that there is any stable being to be tested by thought ? He thinks nothing abides ; indeed that nothing is , but only becomes . AU is ceaseless change and flux . Ho calls it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rational principle of the Kosmos . Out of this change and strife comes harmony ! Dark are his words ; but perhaps a new name for his thought comes echoing dimly from the future ? process . From still another I hear there is a power outside the whirl ; a thing of might : he calls it pas , or mind . And still another younger man will solve the dispute between the Ephesian and the western sages , by cutting up matter into an infinitude of infinitesimals moving eternally throughout the void . II Surely my mind has grown thinking these pregnant thoughts of younger men . They shall be called philosophers . Yet all wisdom is not with them . I might have known this while still in the rioting body . For I was myself a poet ; and I knew the wisdom of the epics ; how they fitted life to the ways of things , and the ways of things to life , and called it fate . Fate might be hard , but it had fitness , asit moved along paths made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a terminus not unforeseen . There was wisdom too in that plodding poet of the Works and Days , who died before I was born . Surely the poet has his share of wisdom from the Muse . His inspiration may be a glimpse of the divine ordering , and his verse carry a fuller round of life and truth than the reasonings of my good philosophers . I am thinking of a great choral poet whose songs are sought and well rewarded by the victors in the games . It is given him above other men to show the golden truth of meaning in these triumphs . Magnificent his odes in words and thought , as they sing how men win in the games as in life by the favor of Zeus , themselves not lacking in valor . God and man 's hero nature bring him to the goal of fame , immortalizing him in his passing deed . I am stirred by the lyric wisdom of this great Theban , whose city at this time is far from glorious , to his pain . I am soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? still under Zeus , Fate had been suitable and fit with my first epic teacher . Its justice and righteousness were now to be revealed . From the Attic stage come the words : ' It is the impious act that begets its kind : righteous houses are blest with fair children . The ancient Insolence engenders an offspring of insolence in evil men , an avenging daemon not to be put off . ' I hear the complement and crown of this dread principle : for the man not wholly bad , enlightenment follows retribution ; from suffering , wisdom . First among men an Athenian makes clear the web of crime and punishment held in an old story : ' He is wise who sings in praise of Zeus , Zeus who leads mortals to be wise : whose law it is that suffering shall teach . Mindfulness of past woes drops on the heart in sleep and makes men wise against their will . ' Those fixed unwritten laws of Zeus ? let no man-sprung edict attempt to override them , sings another poet . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime ; he whose ill deeds were sufferings , rather than acts , may gain acquittance in the end ? win through to expiation . Drawing wisdom from these men , I became sentient and perceptive through their minds . With them I moved through those great days when we fought off Persia and slavery . In these experiences human life became weightier and gained a new significance . The need was more insistent to understand the good and ill of it , the worth of its perceptions ; also the reasons of its fateful courses . Insistence upon man himself began to vitalize and humanize the thinking of men I call philosophers . Those who found ultimate being in the atoms tried to draw the principles of human conduct within the atomic whirl ; the ideal of knowledge must include the ideal of life . Philosophy turns to the doer and thinker . I seem to discern man the thinker as henceforth the pivot of his thought , though it embrace the world he lives in ? immense , fate-driven , or God-created . The unity of man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at one with what is true . Philosophy becomes a test , a consistency of thought . A snub-nosed Athenian goes up and down the city streets , pursues men to the nooks and crannies of their business , questioning , arguing on names and words , seeking meanings that will stand sifting . Some men , and I among them , see the foolishness of current talk as well as the pitfalls in the thinking of the old philosophers . We are nearing new heights , and I perceive that the way up is not merely a path but verily a part of whatever height is reached . Now I see that earlier thoughts , and experience from decade to decade enlarging , still work in the conduct of later men , and in later thought become springs of energy and light . I feel around me a careful weighing of conduct , discernment andskill in sculpture , deepened significance in drama and lyric . New verses are sung in music made for them . Music and line and strophe spring from old , still living , forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? no one had used them so cunningly before , ? have made the drama 's dialogue , and more . I am part of it all , and men recite my verses still . And now I listen to the drastic thinking of men moving in our world . Old opinions are sifted , some thrown aside , but more of them given new form and life . Well-thumbed ideas jostle each other and take on a second youth with our philosophers here at Athens , which is my spirit 's home . Above them soars , and sometimes gambols , one who dwells in the conviction that the supreme reality is mind . I possess the proof of this in my own enduring life of thought . Yet I marvel at this philosopher as he fuses the thoughts of former men and of some still living in the flesh . He wields the reasoning power of such as upheld the scheme of being , one and absolute . They are perhaps the springs of his own spiritual truths . But his mind holds also the counter-reasons of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Although repugnant , the atomic doctrines are well understood . Fully appreciating the sense-perceptive and relative nature of knowledge , his reason is steadied by its training in analytic definition from the good snub-nosed teacher . He raises his concepts to principles of life ; would win through to a grasp of the supreme good as the surest reality . The impulse is love , purged of lust , straining on to beauty absolute and unchanging . Alas , perhaps , all of these thoughts are not for me . I have heard the wonderful song of the Phcedrus which , in language almost beyond words , tells the passion of the soul divinely maddened by its yearning to fly upward to the beauty from which it fell at birth . I have also in the Symposium followed this passion from its genesis in lusts , up through the desire for the better , into the yearning for the best , It loves souls rather than bodies , and seeks the beauty of laws , institutions , sciences , and that broadest knowledge , which is knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foul in another , which neither waxes nor wanes , is neither a becoming nor a perishing : beauty absolute in which perishing beauties share without affecting it . This is the ideal beauty , or the beauty of the ideal . All reverence for the soaring thought that has conceived and reached it . But I am still a poet and my thought of beauty lives and moves in poetry , in all art , if one will . In beauty , as I think it , there is &mains,; which is power ; and nvaps is always in action . A mighty thinker , pupil of this high philosopher , opens his talk on Poetry with the words , Let us speak of poetry and its kinds and the Obpaptv of each . ' He discusses the excellence of poetry , the drama especially . Such excellence falls in with the methods of the poets and the best forms of conduct . Without using the word ' beauty , ' he discloses the qualities of tragedy so as to make clear what is its ideal excellence . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by noble striving . Looking further back , I recall the dynamic modes of beauty in the Trojan epic . Helen is most fair to look on and her words are beautiful ; but her beauty is not unmoving and her words speak thought that moves so fitly . My great Athenian would agree that fitness , temperance , and the golden mean of self-control are elements of beauty ; and one must ascribe the quality of power to his changeless beauty , even as this quality is held in the Unmoved Mover , the conception of his pupil . Such thoughts as mine concerning beauty find form and life in the supreme trilogy of the master of tragedy . The story of Agamemnon is in everyone 's memory . That is the aDthas , by some called the plot , of the tragedy . It forms and controls the drama . Each incident isheld to the measure of its contribution to the action . Tho personages act and speak in and for the drama . They are sheer agents . Every line they speak reflects the situation and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tragedy are given in veiled allusion and forebodings understood by all of us . This drama is not invented or composed by the dramatist , but is revealed by him in its causal setting to show how it came to pass . In the energy of its language and the suggestions of its images , in the fitness and right functioning of every incident , the play called Agamemnon possesses the excellence of power ? clismats ? and so is beautiful . Its beauty is manifested in its dynamic being and the action of its qualities . I find the same beauty in the second play of the trilogy , which brings the over-vengeful murderous queen to her fit and proper death . The third play frees Orestes from the horrors of matricide by proving that his deed was guiltless under the prompting and promise of the gods . This trilogy may justify my halting criticism of the Athenian philosopher . Doubtless our minds pass upward , as in his Symposium , from lower to higher beauties or conceived excellences or powers ( Swages ) , and thus may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all beauty is dynamic , an activity working in power . At all events , such seems to me the beauty of art and poetry . The structure of a poem sets its dynamic quality , and metre , rhythm , rhyme , are elements of power . Yet no formula can exhaust the depth and riches of fact ? of our perception or experience of anything . The recognition of this throughout the talks of that great Athenian is one of the sure proofs of his greatness . To say that beauty is power does not exhaust our experience of beauty . If this dictum applies to drama or to oratory or to the epic , does it touch our feeling for an acanthus leaf or the significance of any deed or human form ? Much remains untold , perhaps ineffable . III If an immortal spirit , freed from the rancors of the flesh , could be torn by the nguish of those who are near and dear in mortal kinship , immortality would be intolerable . Yet my sympathies are sadly moved by the long war in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courses of events I foresaw how internecine rivalry was leading to an insatiable war . My grand Athenians need not have been overthrown had they been prudent . Folly in the people and selfish vanity in those who misled them brought on the fatal Sicilian venture . Alas for temperance lost and self-control ! I foresee no end of wars to come : no end to pseudo-patriotism and valor misdirected , all masking cupidity . Foolish mankind will continue even as I was once . Fighting is in the blood ; keen minds do not perceive its futility . Yet people are becoming concerned with feeling , interested in the softer as well as the more violent emotions . Love 's passion and its counterpart of hate are displayed in tragic drama . The art of sculpture is sensitized in statues showing human moods and emotions ; it has abandoned the old calm . The age of Macedon 's semi-barbarian dominance in Greece is here . Hellenism is no longer free . Neither will it liberate itself through Alexander 's conquests , nor in his genial effort to make East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warring dynasties succeeding him make Greeks feel their powerlessness . Doubtless they were never quite masters of their destinies ; now they are conscious of their impotence . The more thoughtful arc trying to establish their souls in a self-determined freedom . Prevailing ways of thinking are looking to the welfare of the man within himself . The impelling mood , if not the constructive thought , of these systems enters into me . Not that I am oppressed by any resistless mortal power , seeing that I am all soul and sub-jcct to no assault . Am I free ? I feel free and yet am a market for whatever human experience comes to my consciousness . I am most deeply affected by what seems truth . It may be that I reflect the minds of men in every passing present . But I am also a growing soul , and feel growing pains . I have needs and yearnings for a larger adjustment with the universe than had touched my immaturity . If afore-time I tried to propitiate sundry gods , that is now too casual . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For I need to think within the compass of his power . I would yearn and think and act in accordance with his will . I am no mere thinker , but a yearner too . So I have nought in common with a certain Epicurus who will have it that the gods take no part in men 's affairs . They are contented and supine and deaf to prayer . Let men also keep to the least disturbing pleasures , leaving the rest to pass undesired . Then there is no place for fear . Such thoughts suit godless men who scarcely look beyond comforts alike ignoble whether of the mind or body . The other system has many reasonings that do not appeal to me ; otherwise with its ideals . It sets man 's peace , even content and happiness , within the conduct of his will , but views his will as part of universal law . With limping arguments it makes that law divine , to wit the will of God ? for men an all-ruling providence . It even looks to God as a helpmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prayer , but with slight rational assurance of response . A sense of human impotence seems to move both these systems . They lack the energy which lifted the thought of the Athenian philosopher to an assured spiritual reality . Not for long will these systems give strength and gladness to their advocates . Even now do they help men widely ? If stronger souls can make a fortress of the human will , that is an empty notion for the masses who have little strength and many fears . They need outer aid and comfort , say from the gods and daemons touching whom they are anxious day and night . Men and women are making a careful stepping anent the gods . They see omens everywhere , and watch the turning of a feather to find what fortune or misfortune awaits their acts . More than formerly they seek their fortunes in the inexorable stars . It is all an anxious stepping . Yet Stoicism , the better one of these two systems , has raised the thought of God . Looking back upon my fellows in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods and would buy their favor by silly acts and gifts . We imagined the gods to be like our own grasping or groveling selves , only secure from mischance . There was too much of man and of the unaccountable ways of natilre in our religion . Even Zeus in Homer was far from fixed and righteous , and could be deceived , lured by his own whims or lusts . There was too much of me , Archilochus , and too little of the divine in Zeus . Only afterwards /Eschylus made him a righteous dispenser of justice . Probably my own thoughts of God are broader still . In these many years after Alexander 's death we Greeks go here and there among the peoples loss disdainfully . Stoicism expresses the new feeling that there is something of the same in men everywhere . It even teaches that all men are brothers ? a shaky kinship , as it still seems to me . The rule of Alexander and his successors is being replaced by the power of a great republic in the west , soon to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made men know the individual 's impotence , the Empire begins to make its subjects behave as citizens of a world . They are governed by a single ruler and a central ministration of law . There is a state religion , somewhat thin . Under its mgis various religious practices andmany curious superstitions minister to the prejudices of races and the wants or weaknesses of men and women . All people borrow religion and rites and superstitions . What is thoughtful blends with the absurd . Religion flourishes through the common need of protection in an all too chancy world . This need reaches out beyond the life of the present body , looking for some ghostly safety for the shade . Hope plots the ways and means of its fulfillment . Our Greek religion gave scanty aid beyond the funeral pyre , only certain mysteries ' lending a rather particular support . Roman religion has nothing more . So we Greeks and dumbly HelIonized Romans , finding our own cults wanting , are willing to try out assurances from the stocks of other nations . The choice is wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . They are unsocial and uncomfortable , not like other men . They call the rest of the world gentiles , just as we Greeks used to call them all barbarians . They pull back their skirts as from defilement with gentile touch , and yet seek converts for their faith . For religion is a faith with them ; there is passion in their relation to their god . I am a Hellene and never cared for Jewish views . They have no thought of natural law ; everything hangs on the will of their Jehovah-god . Reading their books , I find his will was frequently violent and cruel . This people was carried captive into Asia , and suffered dire discipline of body and spirit . Their captivity may have brought new thoughts , possibly some notion of a future life and a conviction that they had a mission in the world . It would seem that the sins of the Jews and their calamities inspired their prophets to elevate Jehovah from a jealous God of one small people to a righteous ruler of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god , and yet is still a person with a will and character having no kinship with natural law . Here was something new for me : that a god should become God universal and supreme and yet continuo sheer personality and not a symbol or element or phase of law , into which the Stoic god was always turning . With all his righteousness and might , Jehovah had also love , at least for his own people . Elements of like thoughts had harbored in my own Greek self , but had never formed a convincing personality . It seems to me that personality is needed in a ruler over human destinies and for the purposeful creation of the world . Renovation and now life for the Jewish faith are emerging out of Judaism itself in its old home of Palestine ; no building out of ceremonies , but a flowering of the spirit likely to burst the old bonds of the Jewish law . Righteousness had lain in its strict fulfillment . Now a man arises , a prophet or perhaps more than a prophet , who declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that destroys its letter . Ho teaches that righteousness does not lie in doing or refraining , but in the spirit of the obedient man and the reason of his conduct . I can look back to a similar spiritualizing of our old Greek morality as stress was laid on the intent with which an act was done . But this man lifts such principles above mere ethics , sees them as final forms of the divine command . He draws two precepts from the Jewish law : Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind . This is the first and great commandment ; And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets . ' This is indeed a spiritualizing of righteousness ? of the entire contents of human conduct . He shows its application among men : ' All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , even so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prophets . ' Our Stoicism was groping towards the love of God and man ; but it lagged far behind the inspiration and command of these living words , which set the spirit of man 's life and filled it with acts of love . Then this man declared the outcome of such living and its reward to be life eternal ? which is what men are looking for with all mortality 's yearnings . If only they could believe it ! As a disembodied spirit I could speak to them : but that is barred . Only I will here set down ? is it for me ; for whom is it ? ? how this doctrine was presented at its best and highest , and how it touched myself . The man wrote nothing , but was always speaking to those about him ; to his followers or to individuals , or to multitudes . When not angrily rejected , his teaching was accepted and afterwards recorded according to the tempers , spiritual aptitudes , and intelligence of his hearers . It survives in different forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will believe and follow Christ ? which he proclaimed himself to be . The Kingdom is set forth in images ? parables , as they arc called . These represent ways of God 's redeeming love and the manner of man 's acceptance of the Kingdom or failure to enter in . They are phases of the relationship between man and God , a relationship that may comprise the sum of human life . The teacher points to himself as the embodiment of the Kingdom of God and as the way to it . Another record gives a profoundly complementary disclosure of the nature of life eternal . Its problems or dilemmas are put in statements that appeal to an educated and intellectual Greek , because of linkages with his philosophy . Such a one had learned that the life of mind is most desirable and that luxury and wealth might well be abandoned for it . We Greeks could understand the words : ' Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . ' Also the command laid on the disciples to love one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as God loved them . We who knew the groat Athenian 's philosophy could understand this . Now the discourse becomes profounder , esoteric perhaps , showing some likeness to what was taught in our own ' mysteries . ' The Son of God was sent as an offer of eternal life : ' For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believoth on him should not perish , but have eternal life . ' Belief begins as the Father draws the man to Christ ; it strengthens through the believer 's love . Life is set forth as knowledge of the truth that frees man from bondage to sin and death ; in fine , as knowing God and him whom He has sent . ' This is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent . ' The record contains further revelation of the believer 's life in Christ and God : ' That they may be one , even as we are one ; I in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfected into one . ' As I consider the tendencies of thought and feeling in the years before and those which followed the appearance of this man , I see how his teaching ? the Gospel , as it came to be called ? carried an answer and fulfillment to prevailing religious yearning . I who am a mind and soul reflecting men 's fervent thoughts find my own religious feeling responded to and satisfied . Tho Stoic god was vague and material , and the thoughts on the divine held by the Athenian philosopher never quite reached a living focus . I needed personality in God , even though one built out of human aspirations . No living divine personality had over been conceived such as was revealed in this Gospel set upon Jewish thought but reaching so far beyond . Besides this , some kind of imperishable existence is desired by all sorts of mortals . The Gospel promised it in promises snatched at and understood in many ways . But the reasoning mind continued in Greeks and Greek-taught Romans ? certainly in me . The Greek philosophic reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at first set forth . Its statements had to be made over in terms acceptable to Hellenic thought . So in my case . I followed sympathetically the disputes and labors of the Christian Fathers to make the relations between the divine Son and Father and mankind thinkable . These modes of Hellenized Christianity appealed to me and satisfied my philosophic nature . What a fortune lay before these dogmas , in which the Gospel core lived on through its appeal to the hearts of men and women . Yet I , who feel the stirrings of what history would call the future time , already know that the reasonings of the Hellenic setting of the Gospel and the arguments of the mighty Apostle to the Gentiles will eventually lose the power to convince . For they will cease to correspond with any sense of reality present in men 's minds . V For the time my religious feeling is satisfied by the Gospel of the Saviour Jesus Christ , and I accept its dogmatic rendering . My reason , unimpaired perhaps , is redirected by a faith that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an intellectual frame . I would never admit that we Greeks lacked the faculty of observing nature as well as man . The promptings of mathematics pushed us to discovery . Personally I have always been drawn to poetry and art and have done my thinking along the ways of reasoning rather than through observation . In my present state observation does not interest me . Mythology and religion find symbols and look for allegorical meanings in history . I may come to recognize that these images turn us from reality . But allegory will dominate the period into which our peoples are passing . The turning of the world to Christianity is affecting intellectual taste as well as mood and feeling in another way . One would hardly call the Greeks unemotional . Passion inspired our art and swayed our history . But we never deified emotion , and looked always to its control . That it might be without limit and absolutely righteous did not occur to us . The Christian love of God is bringing a change . It is an overmastering emotion with those who feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No temperance , no an ( 56 , 5.7av here . The devoted soul can not have too much of that which should embrace its entire nature . This boundless intellectual passion inspires the writings of the bishop of Hippo , whose genius I revere . I foresee the same passion moulding poetry and art . Our old Greek measures imposed emotional limit and control . They are dropped . The Christian hymn is taking on rhythms and rhymes which will gather power to express limitless yearning . Christian prose also will become emotional . Emotion will give new forms to poetry and new qualities to sculpture and painting . Nevertheless , in these earlier centuries of conversion the masses of mankind go on much the same . They have merely redirected their superstitions . Is it not always so ? The intellectually and spiritually chosen are sensitive to the impact of ideals originating in unique individuals or arising from human growth . From the first , such men were reinspired by the Gospel and gained in mental and emotional power . They reached new heights of righteousness of intolerance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Fathers of the Church and saints as well . I feel their power . But I see that common men , with affections and desires good and bad , are unchanged . Wars go on , and internecine struggles among Christians still grasping at the Empire . The birth throes of dogma are violent enough , and bring forth subjects of rancorous dispute . Men hate each other still . I fail to see that bishops and their shouting factions are any better than pagans used to be . They are certainly less pleasant . Yet the tough old world may be about to receive a novel impress . I am thinking of another aspect of this problem . Our antique world held much strength and life when Jesus was born . Its energies seemed to sink while his teachings , more or less altered , were reaching general acceptance . My own experience through this period of spiritual intermingling and renovation impresses me with the impossibility of distinguishing the causes of these two phenomena or even the phenomena themselves ? to wit , the apparent weakening of Grieco-Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new susceptibilities and capacities of feeling , which tend to develop into creative faculty , thus making amends for what is lost . The antique Greek and Roman character , although subject to superstitions , was strong and self-reliant . The staunchness relaxed under a deepening need of religious solace and support . This need brought forth the means of consolation . The times of the Church Fathers were creative of Christian art as well as Christian dogma . The Fathers themselves in the fourth century after Christ were not mentally inferior to Epicurus and the founders of Stoicism in the fourth century before his birth . Christian art was less skillful than the art of our Skopas and Praxiteles , but more original in its accomplishment of the novel task of presenting the Christian epic . Thus I saw new elements of faculty and character replacing the antique strength . One hesitates to speak of a human deterioration . But disasters press upon my thought . I see the resources and population of the Empire wasted by war , disorder , and disease .

VI I am moved by the tendencies of each passing time , and yet consider them detachedly . This is my freedom . I see the world entering a period of downfall and ignorance to be followed by a gradual recovery rich in possibilities . The course of disruption and recovery passes across my vision . Through the centuries I hear the beat of thought and feel the gathering passion of the Faith . I think in terms of the Summa Theologize and almost gain the gift of tears . Then I become aware of a dawning freedom struggling through the need of the antique heritage . Eyes are opening to the natural world . Observation becomes active and experimental , prying into movement and growth . Religion holds a smaller part of human interest . Man 's earthly life bounds forward as if unfettered . There is delight in art ; and the passionately human world asserts itself with glorious violence in Shakespearean plays . Moving on to what seems the present , I am dizzied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirl of opportunity it is humanity that stays the same . What though men talk across the ocean if they have but small things to say ? Inventions are a fool 's test of progress . The cry is for application and utility . But applied science is baneful as well as beneficial : neutral between good and ill . Easement and facility are well when leading to broader purpose and the uplifting of the mind . It is an insult to knowledge to accept surface utility as a criterion of its worth . We Greeks kept the balance between philosophy andscience . Now the efficiency of rational thinking is denied . Men forget that in sifting nature perception is fashioned by the perceiving mind with the concurrence of its reasoning faculties . The gain is valid when harmonized with the background of well-considered thought . This court of last resort passes on every fact . Natural knowledge broadens the basis of that ultimate rational consideration which is philosophy . Though the world perplexes me , I know whither I have come . A touch of the divine in the liberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eternity . I can also view my own experiences as successive . With the passing of mortal breath , the distraction and contentions of composite existence gave way to quietude and gentle tolerance . I became hospitable to others ' thoughts , would consider novel opinions and recognize new drifts of feeling . I absorbed the early philosophers and the laws of conduct declared by the Theban poet and our Athenian drama . Having soared with Plato , my thoughts were sobered as man 's helplessness appeared in the times of Stoicism . The pathos of mortality brought home the need of divine deliverance . I gained a new intelligence from the conviction that God , once the All-mover , now the Father , held human qualities in the divine harmony of his nature . He had made us unto himself . There was scope along that path for human energies , and content and peace . Thus I fared onward . Insistence upon living within the divine purpose remains unshaken . I , Archilochus , have found the peace of God which passeth understanding . And I also am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
