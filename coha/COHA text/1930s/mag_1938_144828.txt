IT 'S ALL ADVENTURE-Peter Freuchen - Farrar &; Rinehart ( $3.50 ) . <P> Other explorers have contributed more to geographical knowledge , but the most picturesque , the heartiest and the biggest storyteller of the lot is 52-year-old Peter Freuchen ( Eskimo , Arctic Adventure ) . A giant , bearded , Danish Jew . Freuchen quit medical school at 20 to join a Greenland expedition , married an Eskimo woman by whom he had two children , lived 18 years among the Eskimos as trader and hunter . <P> It 's All Adventure , sequel to Arctic Adventure , covers the period from 1924 , when Freuchen went home to Denmark , till 1932 , when he went to Alaska with a Hollywood cinema crew to film his novel Eskimo . Domesticated in Denmark , Freuchen had a hard time curbing his grizzly-bear strength . ( Hugged impulsively by Freuchen , the wife of a German cinema director slumped to the floor unconscious , was taken to the hospital with two broken ribs . ) In Denmark Author Freuchen went to work to make money with as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch of seals . Marrying a beautiful margarine heiress , he began lecturing , wrote Polar news for a Copenhagen newspaper , became editor of a magazine started by his in-laws to lend prestige to the margarine business . When Freuchen was gypped , as when he bought his island estate , Enehoje , or when a lecture fell through , or when his money-making schemes ( such as eel and fox farms ) collapsed , he roared with frustration . Absentminded , Freuchen tucked his pencil in his beard when preoccupied . <P> Freuchen went after a good living , but he continued to like freedom and excitement . Confinement and routine cramped him like a vest several sizes too small for his barrel chest . As editor of his in-laws ' magazine , forced to compromise between literature and margarine sales , he tore out his beard by the fistful . As a landowner he relieved the baronial monotony by inviting troops of guests , among them a radical poet who worked for the revolution by urging wealthy landowners to commit suicide . <P> When in 1927 he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Greenland expedition-it looked as if Freuchen would have to take things easier . Informal , he stomped around the house on his peg leg , wore his artificial limb only when he went out in society . But soon he was going stronger than ever . He made two trips to Greenland , where he revisited old friends , brought their stories up-to-date , dug up many a new tale . A special part of his pleasure , the reader suspects , was his wife 's slightly sick astonishment at Eskimo food ( year-old whale , blue-green eggs , etc. ) , at such hospitable Eskimo customs as wife-trading . <P> Most subdued parts of Freuchen 's autobiography are those telling of his son Mequsaq ( now 21 , a hunter ) , first child by his well-beloved Eskimo wife who died in 1920 . An Eskimo to the marrow , he could not , like his sister Pipaluk , now 19 , adapt himself to life in Denmark . When , on one of his visits to Enehoje , Mequsaq set fire to the estate just to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . But although Mequsaq could not learn white men 's ways , neither could he learn to be happy away from his father , who knew , each time they parted , that Mequsaq , for all his poker-faced Eskimo reticence , suffered the special heartbreak of an orphan and an exile .
