txt To those whose memories long antedate these modern days and " new eras , " the recurrent spasms of excitement over " short selling " and " bear raiding " exhale something of an ancient and fishlike smell . So little there is that is said which has not been said many times , and said in almost the same words ! The debate is usually about as satisfying as an inter-collegiate argument as to whether Dickens or Thackeray is the greater novelist . There is here no intention to intervene therein at any length , but before the present spasm dies away , ( as it will ) when the market turns upwards , ( as it will ) a factual suggestion may be offered in the hope that future arguments may possibly touch solid ground in at least one or two places . As we all know , stock prices continually move up and down . We know also that when prices are down fewer people are carrying stocks " on margin " than when prices are up . At the bottom of a decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices rise . borrowings increase so that they are largest when prices are at the top . We know that it is not merely the advance in prices which cause the increase in brokers ' loans , but also the fact that stocks trickle gradually from the boxes of investors into brokers ' loan envelopes as prices rise . trickling back to the boxes as prices decline . We know , too , that speculators have no fancy for stocks when they are down and that their appetite grows as prices rise  --  Vient en rnangcant. as the French say  --  and is most ravenous at the top . Which , indeed , is the main reason why prices move up and down as they do ! And we also know that the ' raft tris3crity of speculators in stocks lose their money . Short Selling Largest at Bottom ' What we do not know , or at least do not so clearly recognize is that the " short seller " is a speculator just as is his ( now indiznant ) brother the " bull , " that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the long run he fares no better than does his species . And here we have perhaps ground for a deduction as to the so-called " function " of " short selling " in determining the course of prices . It is often urged by those who defend It that it tends to brake the market when prices are declining and that it " cushions " it from time to time when a " cushion " is most needed . If we could suppose that the " bear " speculators were most numerous and most active when prices were at the top and their fellow speculators of the " bull ' persuasion were rioting in enthusiasm , then indeed the contention would be valid . But we have every reason to believe that the precise contrary is the case . We have , at least , the authority of the New York Stock Exchange for the statement that in September of last year there were practically no short sellers in the market . The deduction that the " short interest " in the market is smallest when prices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is largest when prices are at the bottom and fades out as prices rise seems inescapable . If it were not so we should have to suppose that the " bear " speculator is as a genus cleverer than the " bull " genus , for which there is no visible support in fact , or in theory . Which being so , the function of short selling as a " cushion " for falling prices comes into play mainly when it is least needed  --  that is when prices have already fallen and have accomplished a large part of the total decline . Suggests Exchange Chart Borrowing Demand There is a very easy way to test the truth of this deduction . Brokers who " carry " stocks on margin for the " bull " genus report their money borrowings and we know from week to week the total of these borrowings . Brokers whose clients sell short borrow stocks to make the necessary deliveries and report  --  or did report ? the amount of those borrowings to the Exchange authorities , but the figures are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekly course of market prices during 1929 , add the weekly " brokers ' loans " and the borrowing of stocks by brokers and if the line of the last named does not tend to move inversely to the other two lines we shall be on the track of something really new in stock speculation  --  a most unlikely thing ! Will the Exchange make the experiment ? It can hurt no one if limited to a past period . In the making of panics in stocks " short selling " plays little part . Panics are bred by the " bull , " not by the " bear , " nor can they be prevented by stiff margins , or , as last year showed , by high interest , so long as money can . in fact , be had . The only sure way to stop them is to close the market altogether . If we are to have a market at all it must be a free market and a free market must be open to " short selling , " and that seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There is no need to drag in the " cushion " argument .
