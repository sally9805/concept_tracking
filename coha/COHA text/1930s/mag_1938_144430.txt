In Charleston last week the President was piped over the side , of the Navy 's sleek , light cruiser Philadelphia , about to put out on a six-day " shakedown cruise . " Across the dock from the Philadelphia lay the ancient battle sloop . Hartford , which Rear Admiral Farragut comm.anded in the Civil War battle of Mobile Bay and the capture of New Orleans . Cried the President to Rear Admiral William Henry Allen , standing with his staff on the pier : <P> " It looks awful . It 's in horrible shape . Why do n't you get a WPA project down here and fix it up ? " <P> Embarrassed , Charleston Navy Yard 's commandant glanced at the historic relic , shouted back : " Well , we have not any money for that sort of thing down here . " <P> Answered the President gaily : " You just send in a request for the appropriation and I 'll put it through . " <P> While Navy cannon boomed a 21-gun salute , the Philadelphia slid out of the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plans called for several days ' Gulf-Stream fishing . <P> For the first time since he moved into the White House , Franklin Roosevelt last week was not its centre of attention . That distinction went to a spindling elderly gentleman who came there to have lunch ( see col. 3 ) . Before and after entertaining his extraordinary visitor , the President prepared for his holiday by getting through a heavy week 's work : <P> Sent to Congress was his long-awaited message on antimonopoly legislation ( see P.13 ) . <P> Approved was a resolution signed by 16 leaders of U. S. industries offering the Administration full co-operation ( see p. 55 ) : <P> Signed was the biggest ( $500,000,000 ) regular Navy appropriation bill in U. S. peacetime history . <P> While the Senate debated his $1,500,000,000 Navy Expansion Bill , the President added a request for an additional $25,000,000 to provide for starting work on two more battleships-which would bring the total currently planned or under construction to nine . <P> At press conference , a reporter asked what the President thought of a proposal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper knowingly to publish a false statement . Jovially Franklin Roosevelt replied that he was trying to pare expenses and did n't want to build any more prisons . <P> In Memphis last week , Secret Service agents held a 35-year-old salesman named Keith H. Rapp for sending the President a letter saying : " I have an overwhelming urge to kill you . " <P> In Washington , Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt frankly discussed the technique whereby , when shaking hands with lines of people , she whisks them along before they have time to start a conversation . Ex- cerpt : <P> " Grasp firmly the ends of the fingers of the guest , never allowing him to take yours , and . as you say ' how do you do , I 'm so glad to see you , ' draw him gently forward and past you .
