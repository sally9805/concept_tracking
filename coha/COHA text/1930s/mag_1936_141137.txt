When Campbell Soupmaker John Thompson Dorrance died in 1930 leaving a $100,000,000 estate , two States greedily claimed him as a native son . New Jersey asserted his residence was Cinnaminson Township , N. J. ; Pennsylvania protested that he officially lived in Radnor , Pa . First to win out in this long litigation was Pennsylvania which last year received a juicy $14,500,000 slice of inheritance taxes . <P> Last week when the U. S. Supreme Court refused the harried estate executors a rehearing , implicitly approved was the first double state death-tax payment on record . To Camden rushed New Jersey 's Inheritance Tax Bureau Supervisor William D. Kelly to pick up a $15,620,793.45 check from the disconsolate executors . Hastily stuffing it in his vest pocket , he bustled off to Trenton , triumphantly deposited it . <P> More than ordinarily grateful for this money was New Jersey . For the first time in 50 years the State faced a deficit , $13,000,000 . Persistently loud has been the demand for additional taxes for Relief ( TIME , May 4 ) . Equally loud has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the Dorrance largess , one-fourth of which was interest on the original amount due , was a beautifully-timed blessing seemed apparent to everyone but State Senator Charles E. Loizeaux . Snapped he : " This is just staving off the evil day . . . . Next year there wo n't be any Dorrance money . "
