Cur d'Ars <P> " Saints get used up very quickly in the eyes of the world , which is why God Who knows all about it-since it is He Who is acting through them-unceasingly reveals new ones . " <P> Thus writes Henri Ghon , pious French Roman Catholic , in the recently published Secret of the Cure d'Ars. * Far from used up is the Cure of Ars : he was canonized only 14 years ago as St. Jean Baptiste Vianney . During most of his lifetime ( 1786-1859 ) the priest of an obscure village near Lyon , the Cur of Ars is today by papal command a model for parish priests the world over . Since it takes more than mere goodness to make a saint , M. Vianney ( as Hagiographer Ghon for brevity calls him ) is easier to admire than imitate . <P> He mortified his flesh with scourges and a hair shirt , ate mostly boiled potatoes , in general mistreated his body so that his doctor said " science could not explain how he remained alive . " For 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , he was visited , tormented and in fact " infested " by the Devil . The Cure read people 's minds in the confessional , performed small miracles such as causing grain to multiply during famine , large ones such as curing illness . His medical miracles M. Vianney modestly attributed to another saint , with whom he said he held periodic converse : a First-Century martyr named St. Philomena . <P> By the time he was 60 , M. Vianney had transformed the life of his village , had converted 100,000 people outside it . At 67 he came as near to backsliding as a saint might : he was on the point of defying his bishop and entering a monastery . <P> Writes Hagiographer Ghon : " The Devil had managed to slide into his conscience the monstrous sophism that a priest of the Church can obey God while disobeying the Church ; it was the one vulnerable spot-and the devil put his finger on it . " M. Vianney cheated his old enemy , however , and remained at Ars . <P> * Sheed &; Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
