WHAT HAVE I ? A STORY BY RUTH SUCKOW CI-DAY the Club met . It was called ? just that , The Club , needed no other name . Of all the women 's organizations in Battle Bluff  --  and they were innumerable  --  this was the most desirable . Membership was a passport to the center of the center of social life in this old Midwestern river town . Except in a few special instances , it was passed on down from mother to daughter , or from grandmother , or grandmother-in-law ; people were just coming to realize that The Club was an old institution . And by tradition The Club had a literary and artistic flavor along with its charming social intimacy . Even The Club had not been immune from the troubles of the times . The Frank Hood affair , that had upset the whole city , had struck right into The Club and shaken its long-established security . Some of Lenora Hood 's old friends had felt they could never bear to meet again without her . The affair had left bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Kitchens , the Butterfields , the Beardsleys  --  had n't known for a while where they stood or what they had . During the worst period of all The Club had suspended meetings , a thing that had never happened since its founding just after the Civil War . But of course for The Club to disband was unthinkable . The meeting this afternoon would be a gala occasion , held at the old Bliss home on the river bluffs , a mile or so from town : one of the most delightful old places in the whole region . Winifred Series  --  Mrs. Alton Series  --  came rightly by her place in The Club . Her mother , Mrs. Dr. Wallingford , had been one of its most dearly loved members ; and her grandmother was one of the founders . It seemed a very long time though since Winifred had gone to a meeting ; not since before the break . She had been ill and forced to drop out of things . This past winter she had spent in Florida . Now as she dressed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she used to feel , eager to show the girls her new outfit and the improvement in her looks generally . She had stopped in Chicago with her married daughter Nancy , and the two of them had shopped wide and handsomely . This gown was a sheer , of dusty pink , with hat and accessories of iris purple . Pink had been Winifred 's color in her girlhood , and it was as becoming now as then , together with the purple shade that went so marvelously with her dark eyes and wavy silver-streaked hair . In the oval-shaped glass above the dressing-table she and her costume were mirrored at their best . The new draperies , in white and deep red , made a rosy light all through the large room . Winifred called , " I 'm going to The Club now , Mrs. Bjornson ? ' The housekeeper came to the door . " I need n't leave you any instructions though . " Mts . Bjornson gave a slight , kindly , professional smile . " Has Mrs. Bolton come ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The den was an odd little room just off the lower landing . Winifred looked in on her way downstairs . Edna Bolton sat there mending . Winifred nodded at her brightly . " How are you ? " " All right , I guess . " Edna stared with a slowly gathering , subtle contempt , as if daring her to follow up that question . Winifred caught the satiric undertone in Edna 's voice . Saying hastily , " I 'm on my way to a meeting . But Mrs. Bjornson knows about everything  --  more than I do nowt " Winifred went on downstairs . In that last admission she had been asking for a little acknowledgment of her own troubles , her illness and all ; but she had felt rather than seen how Edna 's slight grimace in response turned into a contemptuous twist of the lip . Her heart was beating very fast , and she had to stand a moment in the cool paneled hall , waiting for it to calm down . She felt how lightly and quickly she had spoken , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripping downstairs , the high heels of her new slippers shining and unmarred . She could n't meet Edna 's challenge . She had n't dared go farther and ask about Don . She had to skirt round mention of Don 's name as if blandly unaware that he still existed  --  and after she 'd been so sympathetic . She had been glad to try to find work for Don Bolton when he had come over , saying somewhat defiantly that he was out of a job and the whole family almost down to rock bottom . It was the natural thing . Don 's father used to do all the fixing and tinkering for their old neighborhood , and Winifred had known Don since he was a little bit of a fellow . Her mother had got all the Bolton kids to go to Sunday School ? " gathered them in " was Mrs. Wallingford 's phrase . Winifred had n't dreamed she was running into anything ! Now it turned out that Don Bolton had been fired from the Richmond Plow Works and was bringing some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it somehow , but seemingly on Don 's side . Alton was Hal Richmond 's lawyer , as he had been Grover Hurd 's . There were no explanations this time . Both of them remembered too well . But Alton would n't let Winifred employ Don even to mow the lawn . He would give no encouragement to that element . Winifred just could n't think of Don Bolton as a part of a horrifying " element . " But she could when it came to Edna . It was awful having Edna in the house . Winifred felt she would like to go straight back up to the den and have a real set-to with that woman ! Because Edna was mean , Winifred felt she really was , and she found herself almost crying with resentment . She had kept her promise the best she could , had given her household odd jobs to Don 's wife , since she could n't help Don directly  --  paying Edna out of her own money too . She had done everything for the Bnitons that she could . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't her fault . Winifred had learned her ways from her father and mother , " some of the very best people who ever lived " ? those who remembered Dr. and Mrs. Wallingford still spoke of them in just such terms : the kindest people , the most conscientious . She had always been on good terms with her help . There had n't been any barrier except what she thought of as just the natural one . Winifred Series had never in her life  --  no , not even under the scrutiny of a surgeon  --  been forced to meet anything Iike this hostile , cold , implacable stare . It judged and classified her according to some rule she had never learned . It opened an unknown dimension . What was she afraid of ? What could Edna Bolton do , poor thing ? She ought to be pitied , Winifred thought , trying to find her way back to what should be her natural attitude . The clock sounded a mellow chime . Yellow iris glowed in the old stone jar . These were her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real and down-to-earth after the rackety gaieties of a winter playground . She was going to The Club , into the midst of her own old friends , to have a delightful afternoon , to be welcomed back to the pleasant , natural ways of existence . Marlin was waiting out in front with the car . " Hello , Marlin . How are you ? " " Fine . Hello , Mrs. Serles . Swell day , is n't it ? " Alton took the small car downtown nowadays and left Winifred the Packard . Dr. Barnes said she ought n't to have the strain of driving , and so Alton was hiring this boy to be on call for her every afternoon . He was a nice youngster , amusing company as well as a good driver  --  played seven musical instruments and said he was " studying " to be an orchestra leader . Having Marlin was an extravagance , but oh , what a pleasure ! Wini ? fred sank back into the soft retirement of the back seat with luxurious relief . But even now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oak trees out in the semi-rural wooded addition where the Serleses lived , Winifred had not come out from under the cold spell of Edna 's stare . Suppose , she could n't help thinking , I had to go out , if something happened to Alton , and grab what little I could from someone I hated , should I have the bitter resolution just to put it through ? She felt chilled , pampered , feeble , and distraught . There was no reason for thinking about anything of that kind . It was morbid and she must stop . " What 's that , Marlin ? " " I said , they 've sure got swell gardens out this way . " They were driving along the southwest road . It was a highway now and the old farms had been cut up into semi-suburban places , with small trim houses , and landscaped gardens  --  white gates guarded by wooden bulldogs , stony pooh watched over by wooden birds . " Do n't miss the turn , Marlin ! " Marlin leaned forward and peered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the narrow side-road . " Gol-lee . This is sure some road . " " Oh , I 've driven out here , Marlin , when it was lots worse . " " Sure enough ? " She had driven out in all sorts of conveyances and in all seasons  --  in the family surrey , in long-ago autumns , come to pick wild grapes ; in hayricks , through the deep green summer ; in bobsleds , on winter nights ; in carriages , by moonlight , going to dances . The old Bliss place used to be the gathering spot . The road did n't look much different now  --  lonelier , if anything ; for people kept to the highway . There were deep mud holes that Marlin approached with elaborate care . Sometimes the car had to scrape through branches that whipped back and hit the glass . Art old frame house some distance from the road seemed to be deserted . It stood dark and forlorn among its flowering lilacs . Winifred began almost to dread seeing the old Bliss place . Flora Belle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their friends had n't wanted to come out and impose any extra burden . The two of them , brother and sister , had been living here together ever since the old General had died . But the place when she came to it looked almost the same  --  except that Winifred had n't remembered how beautiful it was . She used to take it for granted . The four-storey brick house , one of the few surviving pioneer mansions , was built on a lofty spot overlooking the river . The weathered white cupola rose embowered in great trees . On the sloping grounds , each under his own tree , stood the statues of the Civil War leaders  --  Grant , Sherman , Sheridan , McPherson under whom General Bliss himself had fought . " The greatest loss the Union cause ever suffered was in the death of McPherson . Do you realize that , young lady ' ? " The girls used to think they would perish if they ever had to hear about McPherson again ! The lilacs were blooming , a lofty hedge . Out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since this was too far out for city water . The gasoline engine was pumping . At this distance , in this rural stillness , it had a romantic sound . " Thanks , Marlin . " She let him help her out with great eclat . " You did awfully well over that road . " " Oh , I like to drive something like that once in a while . Gosh . " He stared about him frankly . " I did n't know there was any place like this . " " Why , Marlin ! " Winifred was shocked . " This is one of the oldest places near Battle Bluff . The most his-toric . " " Is that right ? It sure looks historical . Boy , look at the statues . Are they of anybody ? Civil War ! Gee , ' way back then ? " The great front door of carved walnut stood open . Mr. Hawley was holding open the screen . " Why , Mr. Hawley , how are you ? I 'm so glad ? " you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she 'd better not . " You know me , do n't you ? Mrs. Series ? " " Mrs. Series . Oh , yes ! Miss Walling-ford . " Before Winifred had time to ask after Mrs. Hawley  --  and maybe it would n't have been safe anyway ; who knew whether she was still alive ? ? Flora Belle came hurrying . " Winifred ! " They kissed . " I 'm so glad . We 've missed you terribly . You know where to leave your wrap , do n't you ? Darling outfit . You look so nice , you sweet thing . " Winifred went on upstairs to the guest-room . The great rosewood bed was strewn with brightly colored spring coats and scarves ; and in the cool , leafy , springtime light , in the large north room , women were moving about , crowding round the dressers , examining themselves in the wardrobe mirror , picking up and putting down some of the odd old knickknacks . " Winifred ! " How wonderful to have you back ! " Others kept coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in old times , when they had driven out fora dance , a group went out laughing and chattering together , down the broad walnut stairway toward the green-gold light from the open door . Winifred went into the front parlor with Dorothy Kitchen . The new spring hats were all she could see at first ! Then the girls crowded round , saying how joyful they were to have her back , how perfectly grand and absolutely stunning she looked . Mrs. Burnham smilingly rescued her and led her over to the old Victorian chair with the footstool . " Girls , do let her get her breath . There , my dear . You have the place of honor . " Winifred could sit back and enjoy it . She could enjoy being in this house . During the worst period Flora Belle and Kerwin had dosed off most of the rooms . But now all the great doors stood open . The hand-carved cornices , the mantels , the beautiful faded furnishings  --  all were visible in the afternoon light ; and with flowers massed everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two parlors thrown into one . But in holding devoutly to things as they had been in her father 's time she had really preserved the character of the place . This arrangement was more interesting , more in keeping . The girls began coming up to Winifred , telling her she looked marvelous , they did n't believe she 'd ever been sick . She 'd just wanted a winter in Florida . " Yes , " Stella Beardsley croaked , " and get out of serving on our renowned Civic Board . " " Is that so awful , Stel ? " " Is it awful ? " Stella launched into the tale , using gestures freely . The dramatic play of her features and the hoarse animation of her voice did more than justice to her mild story . The cerise of her hat was really too brilliant for her sallow skin . Her thin face was withering . The others laughed with the old indulgence , and Winifred smiled . But her glance wandered uneasily seeking relief among the other groups . The whole scene gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break had been only temporary . The Club seemed just the same  --  except for the new clothes , and they were part of the pleasure . The organization took in all ages of course . There were still a few of the old ladies , her mother 's friends , although these were becoming almost as rare as Civil War veterans . Winifred smiled across to Carol Mann , a chum of Nancy 's , who had come in lately . Winifred 's own crowd , those she called " the girls , " were the matrons now and predominated . But all were of the inmost group where the associations were oldest and the ties strongest in the end ; although one might actually like someone better who did n't fit or belong . Now she was back in her own atmosphere . Here she was accepted at the natural value and needed . to make no assertion . But the program was about to begin . The women round Winifred 's chair finally stopped talking , Stella giving the last of her recital in hoarse whispers .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presiding . She took the chair that Flora Belle had placed beside the mahogany table near the long front windows . A sweet-faced , broad-faced , silver-haired , ample-bosomed woman of a generation older than Winifred 's , she smiled with maternal cornpiacency upon all . She called the meeting together by playfully tapping on the shining table top with the silver thimble she had reached over to borrow from the petit-point in Lucille Countryman 's lap . The Club had none of the official atmosphere of the Federation meetings in the Civic Center . Members sewed or not as they pleased . " Girls  --  most of you are girls to me , " Mrs. Burnham began . " We hoped Marianne would give us the account of her visit to the Scandinavian countries . We 're all so interested in the Scandinavian countries these days as offering really a middle way . Not that I do n't believe the American way is best . As all of us do . But as I suppose you know , Mari-anne left this morning for the East . So I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take advantage of the day and spend most of our time in these beautiful grounds we all love so well and do n't see half often enough . " " Then I 'm let outl " a dark-haired girl cried , springing up . " Oh , no , you are n't ! " Mrs. Burnham waved her back . " Fellow-members , I was about to add that first of all Gail Salisbury has promised to play for us . And we all know what a musical treat that means . " The dark-haired young woman , shaking her fist lightly at Mrs. Burnham , made her way between chairs to the grand piano in the back parlor , where she was invisible to at least half of her audience . " Little girls should be heard and not seen , " a voice cried mockingly . Winifred had thought at first , why , are there people in The Club I do n't know ? But now she could place them both . That rather distinguished-looking girl was Gail Salisbury , young Glenn Salisbury 's wife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young matrons , fully eligible for The Club , although both had entered by the mother-in-law route . The members seemed to wait in their usual complacent , half-attentive hush . There was a slight tension of expectancy however . Gail Salisbury had studied in the East and abroad . If she had n't married Glenn she might have gone on the concert stage . So people said . Winifred sat softly and brightly smiling , thinking of all the times she had listened to music in these rooms . Then this music suddenly sounded , hard and expertly careless , in sharp dissonance . Winifred gave a slight gasp . It was n't at all what she 'd been waiting for or wanted to hear . It was like a rude assault . The discords struck against her tender flesh . All at once without warning she was brought back to the edge of that hour when the ground had opened  --  the solid midland ground her own parents had ell , WHAT HAVE I ? tivated for her benefit  --  and she had looked down in and seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret earthy rot , here in the springtime air of the cool old parlors . Winifred took hold of the smooth walnut arms of her chair . She closed her eyes  --  not for long ; but in that tiny space of darkness she relived at a distance the hour that had been covered up and forgotten , because it was unnatural and could n't have been . Now it was clear how she had come up to it step by step but blindly , and every one of the steps incredible in itself . First there was the shocking news about Frank Hood . She could n't believe it of Frank . But he did n't deny it . Rumors spread that others were implicated . Frank Hood was by no means the worst . Grover Hurd was the big boy who was actually behind the whole thing . It was partly because Frank did n't know so well what he was doing that he had got out in front . The others were better covered . It looked as if Frank would have to take the blow . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbons , who happened to be at the house , ought n't people to tell what they knew  --  those who did know  --  and do what they could to help Frank ? Both the men had looked very strange . Finally Phil ( who had always admired her , always said Winnie Series was his ideal of a lovely woman ) had told her gently : " Well , Winnie , I 'm afraid it 's more complicated than that . " Winifred could n't be satisfied though ? not this time . She could n't bear to see what Lenora was suffering . Frank , it seemed , could n't speak  --  could n't , would n't , she did n't know what . There was something peculiar about it . Winifred had never dreamed of meddling in Alton 's affairs . She was proud of the position he had reached . She confided in him absolutely . But she was driven to go to Alton at last and put it to him outright : if the other men knew anything to Frank 's advantage why did n't theytell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they all back up a dreadful person like Grover Hurd ? It seemed to her they were being almost cowardly . Winifred kept her eyes closed but she was conscious again of the flower-filled rooms . Could the girls ever have dreamed there had been such a scene between her and Alton ? She was n't good at discussing business matters , and the details of this awful affair were still vague to her . All that had clear import was the point they filially came to , the point between Alton and herself . She ought to have been warned by what led up to it , by the glint in Alton 's eyes , by his too carefully explaining tone ; but she was n't . " Win dear , " he had finally said , " you must understand what an attorney 's relation with his client isl We 've gone over that so often , and you 've always seemed to understand . " She thought she did understand ! She had said , " I know that , Alton ! And of course that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had to defend him of course . " And then she had gone on , never dreaming she was driving him into a corner . " But you 've always been Frank 's attorney tool Why could n't you have defended him at the same time if they were both on the same spot ? Why , I should think it would have been good business as well as common decency to defend Frank Hood while you were defending Grover Hurd ! " She had felt righteous saying this , and had n't noticed how Alton 's look had changed . Only afterward she realized that he had got up , taken one or two nervous steps , and then had faced her with a harassed yet grimly determined look , like someone unwillingly turning after being forced against a wall . " Frank Hood , " he said in a biting , deliberate way , " is a fairly decent fellow , if not too bright . I have n't anything against him . But that 's beside the point . The point is , and you 've asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in the room in a sweeping gesture and he had actually glared at her as if she were only part of the surroundings ? " this did n't come from playing ball with Frank Hoodl Not in a town like this , with a man like Grover Hurd where he is in this town . " That was all , but it was the moment that had stood . like something unreal and at the same time too acutely real . The look in Alton 's eyes for that moment had seemed to open the very ground under her . Alton 's whole attitude had quickly changed then , and he was sitting beside her , his voice sounding husky , but still with an undertone of warning . " When I married you , and promised to love and cherish you , and told your dad that was going to be the main object of my life , I meant just what I said . I meant to do the most I could for my family and myself . For you first . All right . I have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you can take it that way or not at all . " No more was said . It had all been covered over , never referred to by either of them . Alton did everything he could to obliterate those words except to speak others . Winifred had somehow recovered herself without showing much hurt . The times were unnatural . Alton was n't his normal self , or perhaps she had n't been ; she hardly knew which . But things would right themselves . All would be as before . That was how it seemed and must be . No catastrophe had struck . She had been ill but she was recovering . Alton was better to her than ever . Their two children were happily married . Their marriage was the most successful in their crowd . They had n't Lost their money . All had turned out as in her happy girlhood dreams , when she was waiting in the warm confidence of the old home nest to be married to the grandest man she knew . No one had a suspicion of that one lurid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been real . Winifred became conscious again of hearing the music which had passed intoa quieter interval . She realized that she was sitting with her eyes closed , and that people might notice and think she was ill . She opened her eyes and glanced round very brightly . But she had a curious feeling of being a looker-on returned from some strange planetary distance . She was seeing everything from a changed refraction of light , in this uncertain flowery springtime . The air was warm and then suddenly chilled in the lofty rooms . The faces under the new hats had become remote . Gail Salisbury 's first selection had ended , and an encore was of course demanded and given . Winifred changed her position slightly . She could n't see the performer , away off in the back parlor , but Mrs. Billy Butterfield was seated not far from her . The two girls did n't look alike  --  Jean Butterfield freckled and fair , while the other was the dark kind always described as " sophisticated . " But Winifred put them together . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she was n't keeping count ; and something about them daunted her . They took things for granted , but not the same things she did . They brought an alien element into The Club . But The Club itself had changed . At first it had seemed to her the same , but now she could see the difference . New members had entered , old ones had dropped out . Old Mrs. Kearns , " Aunt Katie , " The Club 's veteran member , had died just after New Year 's . How was it possible not to have missed Aunt Katie sooner ? Ida Lauermann , Carol 's mother , had moved to California . Lenora flood had dropped her membership . She was gone . Winifred felt her heart beating rapidly and disturbingly again . For a long while she had tried not to think about Lenora . She tried to think of her now as she would of anyone else . Things happened to people . Women in The Club had not been immune . Think of Mary Wilkerson , the terrible thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's wife and baby , all blotted out in an instant when another car had struck theirs . Mary 's friends seldom heard from her now . Not that they did n't care ! It was her own desire . Unhappy things must be dismissed as far as possible . It had been reassuring to know that Lenora would n't be at The Club . But Lenora 's absence only made her more vivid . Lenora 's friends could n't get round her predicament just by not looking at her . It touched them anyway . They were all mixed up in it . Was that what Edna 's contemptuous look bad meant ? The program ended and now they could go outside . Ava Gibbons came up to Winifred and said confidentially , " Do you want to go , Winnie ? I noticed you while Gail was playing and I was afraid you were tired . I do think she plays difficult stuff  --  it 's over my poor head . Well , you and I can go slowly . " " I do n't want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Winnie , I 'm not so young and spry . I do n't want to admit it , but I 'm getting rheumatics . We 'll both lag back and pretend we 're studying the birds and flowers . " Flora Belle of course was leading , with Mrs. Burnham beside her , panting a trifle but smiling and resolute . Groups wandered off and lingered here and there , running to catch up again . Jean Butterfield cried that she must see the Generals . She 'd heard about them ever since she 'd been living in Battle Bluff . She dragged the younger women after her , Gail Salisbury and Carol Mann , running from General to General and staring in rapture ; while the older women , following more slowly , laughed indulgently . They had gone through a period of thinking these statues were perfectly frightful , of saying Flora Belle ought to cart them out of sight . Some thought so still . And now hear these girls raving about them ! " Iron things are all back , " Alma Kite was earnestly insisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . They 're getting terribly valuable . " " Oh , " Stella groaned , " I ca n't keep up with old things getting valuable ! I 'm not getting more valuable , I know that . " " Now my dear , do n't be so sure , " Mrs. Burnham chided . Dorothy Kitchen was crying that she wanted to see the grove . She had n't been out there since they all used to go nutting . " There is n't much to see , " Flora Belle said sighing . " But then one ca n't keep up every-thing . " Ava and Winifred followed the others slowly . The larger group was moving on again when they came to stand at the edge of the grove . It looked denuded and scanty . Ava whispered , asking if she knew they 'd burned this wood during the depression ? ? Kerwin and Flora Belle ? It was actually their only source of fuel . But after all , even this remnant of the grove was lovely , situated so beautifully here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light between lofty trees . Winifred began to wish she could look at what she pleased without this running murmur of explanation . When they went over to the iris Ava said , " You know for a while Flora Belle sold these flowers on the highway . She tried to have a stand . " And as they went down the slope of the great front lawn again , round which the Generals stood in a silent , broken ring , their bronze faces darkly inscrutable under their campaign hatsAva murmured : " She would have taken tourists . But this place is too far from the road . They simply would n't come out here . They 'd rather stay in some little dump . Well , if she and Kerwin can just keep going . . . The place ought to be bought for a museum . " Now and then Winifred caught Flora Belle 's voice . " Oh , we do n't try to do anything new . It 's all Mr. Hawley can keep up , and , girls , you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ? " Mrs. Burnham interrupted warmly : " This is just what we want . To have the old Bliss place remain as it is . Girls , is n't that true ? " Now the women in their fresh spring costumes began trailing , by twos and threes , up the slope to the house . Winifred and Ava were about the last . Candles were lighted and there was a fire of pine in the beautiful old fireplace in the front parlor . Carol ran to get Winifred 's oval-backed chair . She said quickly , " I 'm going to sit near you , " and took the footstool for herself . They always had such marvelous teas at Flora Belie 's . " Does Mrs. Hawley still make all these grand cakes and things herself ? " " Oh , yes . She has to . My dear , we do n't have anyone but the flawleys . " " But to think you still have both of them . And to think of being honored with sherry from the General 's old stock ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Burnham smilingly asked . " Such a band of queenly ladies . " " This is in Winifred 's honor ! " They lifted the glittering small glasses . Stella shouted for a speech , but Dorothy quickly said Winnie need n't do a thing . All they asked was that she should once more grace their meetings with her charming presence . Winifred , sitting smiling , with a worshipping younger woman at her feet  --  adoring her because she was adored by her husband  --  was back in her own world . For a little while she had what she had come to find . The fire crackled with delightful incongruity in this flower-filled room with the deep-green May foliage outside . But Winifred , even while she was having her close little chat with Mrs. Burnham , so soothing and bright ? " How are you , dear ? You do remind me so of your darling mother , more and more " ? had begun to realize that Katherine Burchard was talking about something she wanted to hear . She wanted terribly to know just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask directly . There was a private , secretive air about the group . Helen Redding kept glancing over her shoulder . Katherine spoke with sober earnestness , in lowered tones . Winifred dropped Carol 's soft little hand , murmured something about the fire , and moved her chair . dd Well of course I did n't see muchof her . But I was de-ter-mined . . . " The narrative was lost while Ava told one of her stories about Dick , her young son . Then Winifred , sitting very still in the oval-backed chair , caught it up again . " She has that terrible creature to look after . Oh , I ca n't describe her  --  I do n't want to . Lenora has to be with her night and day . . . . I know my dear , but jobs are n't so easy these days , and Lenora has n't had any training , people have to have training . ... Oh , I admire her too . I admire her ter-ri-fically . . .. We did n't talk about things here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not  --  or was even glad to see me . But girls I just had to .. . " Mrs. Burnham had turned back . " Excuse me , Winifred . " Winifred felt the comfortable plump pressure of her elderly hand . " You do have good help , do n't you ? It 's so hard these days . But I need n't ask whether Alton has everything arranged ! " " I have marvelous help , " Winifred said hastily . " She 's had training . " Her face flushed , but she went on with tales of Mrs. Bjornson 's efficiency . She heard with wonder the self-satisfied sound of her own voice . The girls were impressed . All repeated how lovely she was looking . Those colors were grand for her . " You never got that outfit here ! " Ava said enviously . " Well , Nancy simply forced me to shop . " " Oh , Winnie , tell us about Nancy ! " This she did joyously  --  but still with a nervous attention on Katherine 's group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes she shows it . Girls , I was shocked . She looks really old . Oh , and you know , it was a shame because it did more than anything else to spoil her looks ? but that front tooth of Lenora 's , you remember it was knocked out when she was just a kid  --  well , the peg tooth is gone and there 's that awful gap . . . . " Winifred turned away . She heard Mabel Richmond going on now . " It 's the government . Our own government ! That 's the real enemy . " Ava shrieked , " For heaven 's sake ! Do n't let 's talk politics , economics , labor troubles , or war , or mention the President or the W.P.A. Let 's not bring such things into The Club . I make it a motion ! " " Second ! Second ! " Mabel looked both hard and hurt . " We know how we feel about these things , " Mrs. Burnham told her soothingly . " It 's just that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are any . " Jean Butterfield stared with big solemn blue eyes . Mrs. Burnham felt annoyed however . She too had caught some of Katherine 's words  --  and she did n't feel it was quite right to bring such matters up just now ; it was out of place . She hastened to say to Gail Salisbury , " How do you keep it up , you wonderful child , with your beautiful house , and everything else ? And you and Glenn never miss out on any good times . I think that 's so wonderful . " Gail answered drily , " I do n't keep it up . " " My dear , why say that ? " Ava Gibbons demanded . " Now do n't set your standards impossibly high ! We do n't ask you to be absolutely pro-fes-sional . " " I know you do n't , " Gail answered even more drily . Winifred felt she could n't listen to anything more . She was back in the midst . Her friends were her friends again , close , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not , all were in a sense survivors . All must have experienced , in some degree , the same shaking of their own solid ground . But were things really much different ? Some had gone through bankruptcy but apparently were n't much the worse ; where formerly they had kept two maids they now kept one . Stella 's animation had worn thin , but even Std could n't keep it up forever . Flora Belle looked exactly as she had for years , wearing the same type of printed chiffon dress for afternoon , with her gray hair marcelled , and the marcel flattened down by a net . Mabel Richmond , the girls complained , howled constantly about how frightful conditions were , as if she were standing in her custom-made sandals on the edge of doom , bitterly resentful , and trying to point to the personal enemy who had pushed her there . Here Mabel was sitting though on the Victorian sofa beside a bouquet of white lilacs , ostentatiously youthful , her hair blacker than black , in her red-and-white costume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dreamed that awful time . But she kept having a strange feeling among her group here , her own rightful desirable circle , in the beautiful old house in its romantic seclusion , as if a gulf had widened between these bluffs and the smoky town , and they were set off here by themselves with the candlelight , firelight , and flowers . " Winnie , have n't you your car ? " " Yes , its here , Marlin 's driving up now . " " Oh , I forgot you 're bumming round with a chauffeur these days ! You 're as grand as Mabel , are n't you ? " Winifred laughed . Mabel , in her brilliant red-and-white , was standing at a little distance . She was taking this chance to tell her troubles . Winifred heard the hard , aggrieved voice , caught the glance of the wandering , resentful eyes . But she did n't go over although she realized that she had scarcely spoken to Mabel to-day . Guilt was heavy on her , because she was employing Don Bolton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . And it was perhaps according to some strict division of loyalty . The knowledge hurt Winifred , and she felt sickeningly that she did n't like Mabel Richmond , never had  --  no better than she liked Edna Bolton . She really did like Don . She felt as if she were a tiny , soft , tame animal that had got helplessly into some gigantic trap . " You have room , have n't you , Winnie ? " Flora Belle had come up with Gail and Jean Butterfield . These two reckless girls had driven out without a spare and here was their car with a flat . Winnie quickly and generously offered to drive them home . Please . She was ashamed to have this big car all to herself . " Where do you both live ? Of course I know where Gail lives , but ? " " I should think you would n't know where we live , " Jean said , laughing , and gave the address . Winifred was really taken back . She had n't been through that district for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping-off place . Billy Butterfield  --  Sherman Butterfield 's son ? Would he live in such a part of town , bring his bride there ? The bride seemed to feel no shame . She was still talking about the Generals . " Yes , he was stunning . But I want the little man . He would be sweet under our big oak tree . " Now she turned to explain to Winifred how she and Billy had bought an old house out in the slums . " I want to prepare you for entering our depressed area . Gail 's never recovered from the first shock . She thinks it 's slumming to come to see me . " " It is , " Gail said coldly . " You 're W.P.A. people and I 'm an old royalist . So is Mrs. Series . " " Oh , I 'm not anything , " Winifred protested . " I do n't know enough . " The girls both laughed , and Winifred felt all at once that they approved of her , On close view Gail Salisbury did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as so often with these pared-down girls who smoked too much and nourished themselves on green salads and black coffee . The dissatisfaction in her face was familiar . Jean 's healthy good looks were reassuring in a different way , making it plain to Winifred 's practiced maternal eye that  --  no matter how unorthodox her views  --  she had had the right things to eat during childhood . But it did give Winifred Series a shock to learn that Sherman Butterfield 's son was working for the government . The shock was worse when they drove over ancient railroad tracks , sunk in deep grass , and on into the outlying river section . Then Winifred could scarcely hide her astonished distaste . Jean spoke withenthusiasm . This was the oldest part of town , older than the bluffs  --  as if that made it the best . A few of the original buildings were left . Of course there were the railroad tracks and some factories , but the district had kept a rural wildness . " We can walk right down to the river , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy-water fishes ! " Gail said . The houses , the shacks , the muddy yards , and weedy lots  --  they made Winifred shudder , And she was afraid to look at them for she wondered if Edna and Don might not be living somewhere out here , maybe in some place like that awful trailer . . . . Don had said they were going to lose their house . Jean told now , her eyes big and excited , how interesting it was in this neighborhood . They lived with people on the real bottom level , right among these people , so they got the chance to know them . " What a chance , " Gail drawled . " No wonder I ca n't compete . " Winifred was too courteous to make any comment . And to her relief , she was able to admire the Butterficlds ' house , to agree with the girls that it had good lines . She could say , with her own responsive charm , how interesting it must be to make an old house over  --  reserving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumbing could never be right . The large white house , still needing its second coat of paint , stood in forlorn seedy dignity in a big flat yard that had kept one magnificent tree . Winifred could admire the tree . As Jean stepped from the car she cried , " Look over there in the lot ! That old woman . She 's getting dandelion greens . I 'm going to dig some . There is n't any reason why Bill and I should buy our vitamins . Gail , I invite you to the mess . Greens are a mess , are n't they ? " " Thanks . Yours will be . " Winifred laughed . She felt with tender relief that Jean was a romantic child ? as much a child as Carol Mann , more than Nancy . Yet there was something daunting and disturbing in her eager freshness . Gail looked jaded by comparison . The old woman stood up just then and turned to stare . Winifred looked straight at the sunken old face . The mouth was open showing a few hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comforts of her own lovely room . She was glad to get rid of both the girls , and to reach there . " Gosh that sure smells , down there by the river , " Marlin observed with gusto as he helped her out of the car . Winifred said good-night gaily  --  she 'd call about to-morrow  --  and walked slowly up the flagstone path between the purple and yellow iris in the cool sweet air of early evening . The front door was open , but no one seemed to be about . Alton was probably in the garden surveying his peonies . Thank heaven Edna Bolton was gone . Winifred stood a few moments in the panelled hall looking into the mirror as she took off her purple hat . She saw the lovely faded image of herself that had changed little throughout the years . She recalled the approbation of her friends ; she had always lived and moved in its warmth , and she had n't lost it . A cold memory touched her . What was herself in this image , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self still have sustenance if she were like the old woman out picking greens  --  if her streaked gray hair was cut raggedly with the scissors and a gap in her front teeth gave everyone a shock who saw it ? How much of the " sweetness " and the " dignity " that had always belonged to her , as Winifred Wallingford , and Mrs. Alton Series , was fed by her pleasure in her own physical loveliness ? Could she live without that  --  if , instead of beingpleasing , so that Marlin felt set up to be driving her ... She did n't finish it . But her delight in her new clothes was dimmed . She could n't bear the faint , expensive scent of Nancy 's perfume , that Nancy had given her because it went with the costume . The question rose clear that for all this long while had been aching in her mind beneath the shifting confusions : suppose Alton had come out and told all he knew , paid whatever it would have cost to get clear of Grover Hurd  --  suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Lenora had . What gave her the power ? If she had any particular religion , nobody knew about it . Lenora was like the rest of them in that respect ; went sometimes to the church where her parents used to go . Love of Frank ? But Frank Hood was  --  oh a nice fellow , they all liked him ; but if his wife felt any great devotion nobody knew about that either . The Hoods ' one child had died years ago . Once Winifred would have said  --  as Alton had said  --  that their happiness together was the main object of her life . It had included even her devotion to her children . But her love had been her trust in Alton  --  in his splendid competence and his worshipping care . It had been her security . The smitten ground had closed again but that one vision of old roots and rotted foundations had stayed with her . It might be just that Frank and Lenora had been the ones hit while the others had all escaped . If they had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  something might stand clear , if only for an instant . She might learn what she really had . Whether  --  though having dwelt , with becoming grace , in the pleasant places ordained for her  --  she really had anything .
