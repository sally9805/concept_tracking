Near Boyertown , Pennsylvania 's first iron forge , in 1733 an Englishman named William Bird earned two shillings sixpence daily cutting wood . By 1740 he had accumulated enough capital to set up two charcoal-fired forges of his own where Hay Creek entered the Schuylkill half-dozen miles south of Reading . From these two forges sprang the present town of Birdsboro and the Birdsboro Steel Foundry &; Machine Co . William Bird 's eldest son Mark added other forges , a rolling mill , slitting mill and what is believed to be the first U. S. nail factory . By the Revolution he was wealthy enough to outfit 300 men to aid Washington after the Battle of Brandywine . Continental Congress minutes record fat payments to Birdsboro for munitions of war . In 1783 Mark Bird petitioned Congress that the " chain prepared to throw across the Hudson River " be returned since it was not paid for . Soon thereafter he failed and the iron works were rented to an extraordinary character named Captain John Louis Barde . <P> Born in Geneva , Switzerland in 1756 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Woolwich , England , and war with the Spaniards at Pensacola , Fla. where he wooed and won the 14-year-old daughter of his landlady with a ring chopped from a gold guinea .

Chairman now of the Birdsboro board , which contains six Brookes , is tall , 70-year-old Robert Edward Brooke , grandson of Matthew . President since 1933 has been hard-bitten John Edward McCauley , onetime machinist 's apprentice , who states in his hoarse steelman 's voice that the C. I. O. " has n't got us yet " and that Tom Girdler is " doing a yeoman 's job for all of us " ( see p. 9 ) . With total assets of $2,400,000 , Birdsboro employs 800 men , had gross sales of $3,000,000 last year , net income of $233,000 .
