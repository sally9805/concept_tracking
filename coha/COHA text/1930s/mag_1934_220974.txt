Last week for more than two hours a Pennsylvania Railroad train was " lost " near Philadelphia . <P> The train was a special from Atlantic City to Philadelphia , with three cars attached for Bustleton . This suburb , 17 miles from Philadelphia , is on a short spur off the New York-Philadelphia mainline . Bustleton-bound were 20 delegates returning from the 51st triennial General Convention of the Episcopal Church at Atlantic City . At Philadelphia their cars were attached to a switch engine , shuttled off to Bustleton . From the dispatcher at Holmesburg Junction , 13 miles out , went word that the special had passed " on time . " Then it vanished . <P> Two hours later it was still missing . Philadelphia dispatchers appealed to police . Out to find the train went motorcycle officers and a radio patrol . A block from the Bustleton station they found it stalled . A wheel of the engine had jumped the track . The station , unused for years , had no telephone . The passengers had walked home .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
