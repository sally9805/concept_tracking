NOTHING AT ALL A STORY BY LINCOLN KIRSTEIN T HE first year he went to camp he used to ask his tent counsellor , every other day or so for the first month , " Now is camp in full swing yet ? " For there were physical examinations , preliminary swimming tests , tests for setting one 's ability in riding and marksmanship , shifting of bunks , and a thousand and one necessaries constantly breaking up the hypothetical monotony of camp routine which he so desired . He wanted it in full swing , going along with a secure inevitability , mainly to convince himself he was really in it , a part of the swing , the stream of summer itself . And at about the end of a month his counsellor answered with some consideration , " Why , yes , Billy , I should say camp is in full swing now . " The relief , the exultation , the freedom to immerse himself in a blessed solidity of routine for another month ! Reveille , setting-up exercises , a dip in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work period , a play period , a swim ; lunch , siesta , riding , or shooting or hiking all afternoon ; supper , stories or a marshmallow roast , and lights out . The mournful clarion of taps penetrating the pine sough , and the gracious warmth of one 's body under a rough blanket . If life held more , it had never made it manifest . He was happy in his superiority in power , since he was a little older and a little cleverer than the rest of the boys , and he was just vaguely conscious of his own amiability and pleasantness . He was to be eleven in three weeks , and for the first time in his life he was actually , if vaguely and unconsciously , directing a passionate affection to people outside of his own family . For there was Dan , his own tent counsellor . When Dan said , " Why , yes , Billy , I should say camp was in full swing now , " he looked at him , warmed by the kind freshness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apotheosis of a physical-culture education . He was stronger than any other counsellor , and proved it constantly . They sometimes had supper at home , sometimes canoed to an island or some other point down the lake , and ate out of tin cups . At these times Dan often provided thrills . He could break belts by binding them around his contracted chest . The rattle of tin spoons in the cups stopped short when he filled his hairy breast with the summer air and snapped the strap . Or he would climb one of a pair of small pines up to its fuzzy tip and sway the tree fearlessly back and forth to drop lightly into the other lower branches . Or he would he the base of a very large human pyramid or portage a war canoe by himself for a quarter of a mile . And then also there was the head counsellor , the camp director . Doc was considerably older , that is , about thirty-five . He had been brought up in Texas . He sang cowboy songs and could swing ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean and rangy , slightly bald , with a curious detachment , and a surprising power of apparent abstraction in a crowded room . He was also subject to sudden bursts of petulance . He was very nice to Billy . One night he said , " Do you want to come on an adventure ? " Billy said , " Oh , gee , Doe . " " Well then , get two mattresses and my canoe , and meet me at bedtime here . " They spent the night on the lake . Billy woke often to hear the slap of the light boat against the water . Doc guided the canoe all night by rocks and the pines on the shore , and dozed only at intervals . Billy was extremely stiff in the back , neck , and knees in the morning , but it all increased his attachment to Doc a thousand times . Doe 's wife was called Bobby . She was very large and dark . She dived marvellously . She assumed an authority over the young counsellors and seemed to order them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man and smoked a corncob pipe and read the Song of Hiawatha to the boys in the siesta hour . Billy was wary of her ; she was quite tolerant of his affection for Doe . She kidded his clevernesses and the fact that he could n't dive . He was n't really afraid to , only it hurt his ears terribly and made him belly-flop continually . It was a wonderful summer . Billy never forgot the long stretches of undiluted happiness . He could dash about and throw himself on the grass for pure joy , and he became almost unbearably helpful as the summer drew on to its close and his affection for Dan and Doc increased . But the time came at last for them to leave . In their city clothes , with the city bus waiting to pack them off , they stood for a moment in the dust in front of thebig barn and gave the camp cheers . Tears welled up and fell on his cheek and his throat was full of tongue . " Good-by until next year , good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . The snows dissolved , and he was back at camp again . But there was a curious difference . Billy had never considered the possibility that things might be different . He was an old boy now , and he had an intensely proprietary feeling about the barn , the lake , but mainly about Doc and Dan . He looked over all the new young boys with profound disapproval . He could tell at once that they had practically no camp spirit and , so far as he could see , they never could have . On their first real night at camp , after they had been somewhat unpacked and arranged , the four war canoes were launched to have supper at Beggars Island , about four miles up the lake . Billy was towards the end of his canoe , paddling with great conscience , digging the blade deep into the resistant lake and feeling the ungrateful strain of winter-softened muscles . The round whirlpools swirled whitely back into the dusk . He was vaguely uncomfortable . In the first place , he had failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's canoe . His boat was led by a young man called Ralph , who was long and loose and silly , who was not really a camper at all , but just camped in the summer to pay his way through college . He also smoked cigarettes . But worst of all , when the canoes had been beached and the supper-pails had been taken out and up the little hill for dinner , Billy saw one of the new boys disappear into the bushes . Like a hound he followed him and was astonished . He gasped in as severe a tone as possible , although his blank horror muted the severity . " Why , what do you think you 're doing ? " The new boy glanced back at him with his horrible new-boy leer and said quietly , " I 'm shaving ; what the hell do you think I 'm doing ? " At supper Ralph sang some popular songs and made jazz gestures . This nauseated Billy ; one could at least keep that kind of thing for the city , for the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . The new boys also sang the choruses . But Billy was resentfully still . Dan noticed his quietness , his noble silence , his hurt authority . He said good-naturedly , " Why , give the kids time . They 'll be O.K. " " Oh , I know , Dan , " said Billy , with tears of gratitude , " but I 'm so afraid it wo n't be the same as last year . . . " " Do n't worry , kid , it 'll be a lot better . " Billy kept close to Dan so as to he next to him when they joined arms and said the Lord 's Prayer together in a circle before going to bed . But it did n't get any better , it got worse . Bobby kept taunting Billy because his diving did n't improve . He saw lots of new boys paste more stars on the accomplishment chart than he would ever be able to . Doc seemed to be terribly busy and preoccupied . Whenever Billy hung around and asked him if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run along and pick up nails . The main lodge used to be a barn , and the horses had been shod in front of the great door for fifty years . To save the bare feet , a favorite occupation was to hunt for rusty nails with electro-magnets made out of a dry-cell battery or two and a magnetized rod . Billy would obediently run to the storeroom and get the paraphernalia and hunt desperately for ten or fifteen minutes , until that fool Ralph would come up , his loose fleshy jaw wagging ( and how anybody could think he was attractive was more than Billy , for one , could see ) , and ask , " What'sa matter , sonny , lost something ? " then grin and go away . Dan never called him sonny ; he called him Bill or Billy ; and whenever he had time he gave him boxing lessons or taught him to do gymnastic tricks , They played a game together , Billy pretending he was Dan 's slave , and they went through a ritual often for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands twice and call " Boy . " Billy would dash and throw himself at Dan 's feet and lie prostrate until Dan would say " One . " Then Billy would get up on his knees , at " Two " he 'd put his arms up , at " Three " raise his head , at " Four " stand erect on his tip-toes , and at " Five " jump into Dan 's arms and be lifted over his head . They practiced it a lot at first , and Billy could do the simple performance with some speed and precision . He loved the maneuver , and nobody thought it was silly . But even Dan now seemed to be busy a lot too . He seldom ever called " Boy . " Billy , as a slave no longer in favor , grew to expect little attention . He had his cross to bear and he bore it , and everyone he could show it to knew how very painful it must be to bear . He should have spent more time with the boys themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc and Dan he preferred to be alone . One night , some time later , he was whittling on an arrow , when he suddenly heard Dan cry " Boy . " Billy quickly threw down his arrow and dashed over to where Dan and Ralph and Bobby and Doc were sitting working over the camp accounts . Dan had been bored and had abruptly remembered his slave . Billy threw himself at his master 's feet . " One " said Dan . Billy jack-knifed to his knees . " Two " said Dan . Billy 's arms flew up . " Three " said Ralph , a sudden flicker came between the eyes of Billy and the sun . " Four " said Bobby , and she laughed . Billy was horrified , shocked , and hideously embarrassed . He blushed and boiled with rage and sorrow . It was dastardly of them to spoil his game , to break his beautiful friendship with Dan . He stopped short and looked at Dan . Perhaps he 'd got him over just to make fun of him ; perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy turned quickly and ran as fast as he could to his own tent . He threw himself on his pillow wader the vacant canvas and gave over to hot brackish tears . Then his tears gave out and he lay silent on the moist pillow , waiting for Dan or Doe to come and apologize and comfort him . But it was supper time before he saw them again ; Doc and Dan were getting into the Ford truck to go to the village for the late mail . The sun was low over the lake , and wild birds flew from the forward face of night . Though some of the small boys shouted , their voices were thin in the clear cooling air . It was a suspended moment in the flow of day . Every object , every personality lost its connection with one another and stood sun-lapped and clearly isolate . Some of the young kids were sitting opposite one another on the ground playing mumblety-peg , pricking their earth-stained knees with the pin points of their scout-knives . The clarity of the hour refined Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for friendship . Bobby and Ralph and the rest of the counsellors had charge of supper . Everybody was extremely gay . Ralph sang college songs and everyone seemed excessively friendly . If Billy had n't been so frightfully hungry he would surely have gone without supper to punish them all for their satisfactions . And so the summer slipped by , and there was a constant itch under Billy 's jersey . Things were not going well for him . He was lying down on the job , he was not trying , he was not being a good camper ; he knew it and he knew Doc and Dan knew it , but they were so busy with their duties to the other boys and their own private affairs that they had practically forgotten Billy as Billy ; he was merely a boy to whom they were dutiful counsellors . One night he could n't sleep . The warm sky seemed to be the top blanket of his distress . At least he could kick the corporeal sheet and shift noisily , hoping to wake one tent mate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , under the fading stars , in spite of his signals . Billy got up , put on his sneakers , and decided he would go down to the beach . It was quite bright outside , twigs snapped like distant fire-crackers , and he hurried silently to the shore . Rocking gently fifty yards out was the raft with Bobby 's tent on it . She slept there over the water . Water was her true element . She dived like a kingfisher and severed the water like a fish , and she must sleep upon the bosom of the lake . But Billy sententiously considered that she was a cold fish , a wet bloodless fleshy fish , and it was Bobby he hated as the personification of everything that had spoiled his summer . He stooped down and picked up a large round white flat stone . He fitted it into his palm and skimmed it smartly over the moony water , hoping half-maliciously that it might skip the fifty yards , hit against her tent , and spoil her sleep . It leaped four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and another and then absently tossed stones haphazard into the water . Then he remembered the place , and the time , and that he should be in bed , and turned to go back . He had walked only a few steps when there was a soft splashing in the water . At first it seemed almost as if it had been the last echo of the stones he 'd tossed . But impossible . The interval was too great . He stepped behind the shadow of a birch and strained his eyes against this sight . The moon on the waters splashed a hard mercurial light . A blackness here , a splashing blackness , disengaged itself from the dim locality of the tented raft and seemed to be making for the shore . Perhaps it was an otter , maybe it was a fish . But no , it must be Bobby . She had been awakened by the noise of the stones he 'd thrown and was characteristically swimming to find out what the trouble was . Billy could n't get hack to his tent without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were caught , for there was no explanation , and Bobby in her cold comic way would bait him for it , his little piddling infantile revenge on her for not being able to dive as well as he should . So he waited in the shadow , holding himself tightly together and feeling the dampness of his pajamas against his armpits and around his waist . The splashing came louder and closer . Suddenly a smooth dripping head rose out of the lake , then a pair of shoulders , then a man . Billy was amazed . The water sluiced off him as he walked to the beach . Who could it , who could it be ? . . And just as the figure turned away from the shore to take the path that led up to the tents , the moon slid across the face and belly and the boy in the shadow saw that the face in the light was Ralph . After a while Billy went back to his own bed . He was extremely careful to be silent . The mattress springs hardly even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell asleep almost at once . In the morning the sun came up as usual . But Billy 's day had two sources of illumination , and the other was that he had seen Ralph stride across the beach and quietly disappear into the night before . He focussed his mind on that physical fact . His instinct warned him to go so very slowly because the spreading rings , the overtones , the implications that fact had startled in the pond of his imagination would be terrifying . Well , Ralph had walked across the beach . . . . I never liked Ralph although he 's not a bad sort and I can see what they mean when they say he 's good-looking . Ralph walked across the beach and probably went to bed , and I wish to God he 'd stop singing those dizzy jazz songs instead of " Casey Jones " and " Sam'l Hall " and giving these kids the wrong idea . Ralph walked across the beach . . . I 'm silly about Ralph . . . . I should really not think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft from the raft into the water from the raft . Stop it , on the raft is the tent , under the tent is Bobby asleep , asleep , I 'm not sure what I mean but I 'd better shut And it eventually dawned on Billy that he had stumbled over the most horrible thing in the world , and what was the most horrible of all was that he held the key of the situation absolutely in his hands . Why , he knew everything . . . he could tell everyone , and he would now . Wait . No one will believe you . Wait . Wait , and see how Doc acts towards you . If he is more friendly for the rest of the summer I wo n't tell . If he goes on this way , I will . Wait . That has nothing to do with it . It 's more than that . I ought to tell Dan . Then Dan could tell Doc . But why tell anybody ? Wait . Billy was really upset , bewildered , and lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualness , looking searchingly and significantly first at Ralph then at Bobby . But they looked the same . They bantered each other and splashed each other and ignored Billy in just the same way , just the same as  --  before last night . Then Billy regarded Doc . He was just the same too . Nothing was different . But he , he was different . Before yesterday , the summer was all but lost . Now , it was more than the summer that he had found . " I must think , " he said ; " you can get out of anything if you think about it . " All day he thought ; if perchance his thoughts strayed away from this central problem of his life he forcibly jerked them back . He surely must tell someone , and night seemed to be drawing on again . Perhaps he would tell Dan . Dan used to come into the tent when they were all undressing and ask them questions : how they were getting on , how they were feeling . Sometimes he would sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and ask him if there was anything he wanted to tell him . Dan could always know ; Dan would see it to-night . Billy would simply whisper the whole thing . But , no , wait , I ca n't do that . 1 must ask how to do it . I must pretend I know a boy who wants some advice . I mean , Dan , if you knew something awful about two people ; I mean , if you knew a man whom you cared about a lot and his wife ; I mean and you did n't like the other guy , and suddenly found out that this woman and this man , and Dan would suddenly , why supposing Dan would suddenly jump and say , " You dirty-minded little rat ! " What then ? You 'd better wait . If Billy went to Ralph and Bobby and put it up to them , perfectly honestly , that they must tell Doc or he would tell him . . . No , he could n't do that . Maybe Ralph would kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . Maybe Bobby would drown him . Maybe they would anyway . They could see pretty quickly in his eyes what he was thinking . They could tell . Then they wouldhave to kill him . There would be nothing else left to do , and yet they ca n't kill me . If I go on seeing them I 'll be more and more frightened and I 'll spill the beans anyway . Perhaps I 'd better write Doe an anonymous letter ; but then he would n't believe me . You ca n't trust unsigned letters . Billy was really worried . Sometimes when he hurt himself he still cried , but that was with the hope of soliciting sympathy almost as much as from the pain itself . But he always smiled secretly to show himself that he was not really hurt . Now he did n't smile at all . He went around in a daze . Everything he did seemed to end before he reached the climax of his action . Everyone he spoke to seemed to guess his intention before he finished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . I 'll burst . I think I 'll go crazy and tell everybody . I love Doc though , and it would hurt him more if anyone else knew . I must tell no one . Not even me . Me . But I know . Yes , but shut up . Wait . Then Dan came and said , " You look peaked , kid . What 's the matter ? Been working too hard ? " " No , Dan , I never work too hard . " " Stick out your tongue . " Billy smiled and did so . " It looks green ! " For a second , a wild second , Billy thought , I 'm sick , I 'll go home , I wo n't have to tell , at home . But Dan said , " You 're all right as far as I can see . " " Yes , Dan . " " Do you want to see Nurse , kid ? " Nurse ? If I 'm sick , I 'm really sick . I may have possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . Billy held himself in . He knew how perilously on the verge of tears he was . If he dissolved , the whole thing would come out in the crying . He turned quickly and walked off to his tent . Dan sensed something , and called loudly , " Boy . " Billy heard the an-cient command and turned in his retreat . He walked slowly back to Dan and got down on the ground . " Not much pep in my slave now . You need some whipping . " Dan started to pommel him . " No , Dan . Do n't . Do n't . Not now . " But Dan felt that nothing could cure a tendency to weep so much as a good roughhouse , so he turned the boy over and stuck his foot in his ribs . Flesh could stand only so much . The exquisite pain of the tickling was the last straw . Billy burst into a hysteria of sobbing . He could n't stop . He wept and wept . He gasped convulsively . The tears would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for Doc . He stood Bill up and tried to slap his back . This only accelerated his spasms . Then Doc came . " What 's the matter , Dan ? " " I do n't know , Doc . I was only kidding with Bill . " " What were you doing with him ? " " I was only tickling his ribs . " " You ought to be more careful with these kids . " " But really , Doc , it was n't anything ; I 've done it lots before . " " What'sa matter , Billy , are you hurt ? " Doe 's hands felt his ribs and back . Billy sobbed . " No , no , it 's not that . It 's not that . " " Well , what is it ? Come , tell me . " Dan still looked frightened . He backed away from the boy and from Doc . Then Doc said , " Everything 's all right . You come and tell me . " Dan went off with a glance over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been attracted by the scene . " Come along , Billy , we 'll go for a walk . " Doc took him by the arm and walked down toward the beach where it would be quiet . " You do n't have to tell me anything , you know , if you do n't want to , " he said . " I just saidthat to get you away . " Doc was so kind . He knew everything . " Oh , but , Doc , I want to tell you . I must tell you . " " Well then , shoot . I 'm here to listen . " " You really will believe me ? " " Why of course I 'll believe you ! " " You must promise me . It 's so terribly important . " " Of course I promise . " " Well , Doc , I 'm going crazy . " " Why , Billy , of course you 're not . " " Yes I am , Doc , unless you help me . " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts . Did n't you ever feel you were going crazy ? " Doc breathed easily and prepared himself for his not unaccustomed act of elder brother , combined with old family physician . He had had to lay the ghost of meddling nursemaids time and time before . " Why sure , lots of people , why almost everybody when they 're boys . . " " No , Doc , I 'm really going crazy . " " It 's nothing to worry about . It 's just a stage we ca n't help . We get over it . " " No , Doc . It 's things I see . I see things . " " Sure , " said Doc . " You 'll get over it . Just do n't do it too much . " " No , Doc . You do n't get me . I see things . " " Oh . . . you sec things . " " Yes , I see things . " " Where do you see things ? " Billy pointed out into the lake where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm water . It seemed too easy to Doc , the coincidence of the indicated direction . " Well , what do you see ? " " Mostly people , " said Billy . " What sort of people ? " " Well , like you and me . Only not you and me . " " Like who then ? " Billy felt terribly sick to his stomach . " Like who then ? " I must not cry . . . . I must tell . .. . I must not cry . " Like Ralph and Bobby . " Doc got up from the log he sat on and lighted a cigarette . Then he sat down again . " Come over here . " Billy went over with white horror in his heart and eyes . " Come sit here . " Billy sat on his lap and put his arms around Doe 's neck . He was glad to fee like a baby . " Listen , Billy , I know all about Ralph and Bobby . There 's nothing I do n't know . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head dropped farther on the man 's chest . He was crying again . " You know . . . and you do n't doanything ? " A sobbing pause and then the considered answer : " Well , Billy , what is there to do ? " In the long silence Billy stopped weeping and looked up at Doe . " Is there anything to do ? " " Nothing at all . " And then Billy knew and it was so plain , as plain as everything simple , and all the fuss and fuming slid away , and he felt terribly lonely in spite of Doe 's protection and he was lonelier and lonelier until it amounted to pain , and his heart and his brain seemed to contract and the one thing left in the world changed like a kaleidoscope in front of his eyes , only it was behind his eyes , for he saw , he also , should have done nothing , nothing  --  at all . THE CLIMBER BY CARL CARMER O UT of a world where beauty is desire , A twisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope is hope 's eternal fire , He strives with aching arms and weary feet . Dizzied by time and the dark height before him , Leaving behind him all his sires coiled light , And heedless of the jeering age that bore him , Alone he climbs into the starless night . Almost a song whose echoes never ended , Almost a picture telling all he meant , Almost a poem ultimate and splendid , Almost a love whose first dream never went : Upward he yearns , heartsick and vision blurred , To read in the black sky one finite word .
