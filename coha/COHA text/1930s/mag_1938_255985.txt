Smart-looking , Idaho-born Inez Callaway , known to the 3,000,000 readers of New York 's tabloid Daily News as Nancy Randolph , last week traveled out to her alma mater at Columbia , Mo. , to tell the conferees at Missouri University 's Annual Journalism Week what it takes to be a Manhattan society reporter : <P> " One , a cast-iron constitution , one that can digest a season in Palm Beach , too many rich luncheons at 21 and the Colony , nights out at the Stork and El Morocco and the constant battering of debutantes who are determined to get into the movies via the front page . <P> " Two , a sense of humor . This is probably the most essential of all . A society reporter has to be able to laugh or she 'll go nuts over the gyrations of society 's lunatic fringe , its playboys , its glamor girls . <P> " And , three , a never-ending supply of clean white gloves . A clean white glove is the cachet of respectability in the Four Hundred . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to get past Psychic , the Perfect Butler who guards the threshold of J. P. Morgan on Murray Hill . "
