DESTINY 'S MAN-T . F. Tweed-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . <P> When Publisher John Farrar received from Colonel Tweed in London the manuscript for Gabriel Over the White House , he sensed a good thing . Roosevelt was in the thick of his 1932 campaign . The Bonus Army had set a new pattern for direct action at Washington . The U. S. was groaning and growling for a political miracle to lift it from the depths . The young red-headed Manhattan publisher had the Tweed manuscript extensively reworked by a U. S. hack for a pittance and Gabriel Over the White House became startlingly prophetic of the New Deal 's early endeavors . The new President was so impressed that he had the film made from the book shown twice at the White House and Pundit Walter Lippmann composed a high-minded sermon on its lack of intrinsic importance . Now , without benefit of a rewrite-man , the Briton who learned his political realism under David Lloyd George has tried it again , in another fuzzy apocalyptic novel of the future . <P> Destiny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession of shocks in a Central Europe made uneasy by Hitler , the assassination of Alexander of Yugoslavia , the blows to French ascendancy in the Danube Valley . <P> The Grand Elector Max has succeeded in creating Danubia out of Austria , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Rumania , Bulgaria , Yugoslavia . Upon an economic stage set with starvation wages and rock-bottom farm prices steps a new Messiah . He is Johann Zimri , son of a Hungarian plumber who combines a knowledge of psychotherapy and osteopathy with the perfect bedside manner . Scores take to his simple belief that a little of God is in every man . With this magic , Zimri wins over an important industrialist , the Danubia youth movement , a onetime mistress of the Grand Elector , a leading journalist . In spite of this backing , the Messiah sins against the omnipotent State . Tried for sedition , he is acquitted only to be killed by an enraged urban mob that believes he is hindering the coming war with Italy . The finale is fittingly ironic . <P> When Magda , the ex-mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems about to triumph , for the Minister of Agriculture becomes dictator and summons the Zimri group to power . But after the followers of the late Messiah get one good look at the clever plan of attacking Italy , they turn sternly from peace to war . A satire on the nature of power , Destiny 's Man can be recommended to all surviving anarchists .
