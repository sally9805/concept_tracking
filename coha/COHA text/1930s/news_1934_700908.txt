txt Passage of a 2 per cent city sales tax to raise $40,000,000 for relief was forecast as a certainty in City Hall last night , with the possibility that the Board of Aldermen at its meeting today might increase the utility tax from 1 ' to 3 per cent and impose a city tax on inheritances . Following a two-hour session yesterday of the joint committee of the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen , Mayor La Guardia declined to disclose the committee 's tax plans . Through a secretary he issued a laconic statement to the effect that the committee would reconvene at noon today and the Board of Estimate would meet tomorrow . He would not discuss specific tax plans and left City Hall shortly after 4 o'clock . Presidents of sixteen large department stores met yesterday I and adopted resolutions protesting against the proposed 2 per cent city sales tax . They held that the tax if imposed would cause havoc with their business and declared their intention of fighting it to the limit . Because the tax will not be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they would not attend the Board of Aldermen 's meeting in City Hall this afternoon . Relief Not to Stop . The prospect of a cheerless Thanksgiving for the 400,000 families on city relief was averted when Controller Joseph D. gave assurance that the relief payments would not be stopped . Last week the Controller said he could not possibly divert any more city funds to relief , having already diverted more than $1,200,000 . Unless the administration agreed on a definite tax program by yesterday he said relief would stop today . Yesterday , however , the Controller said he had sufficient money to keep relief going through today . If the administration agreed today on a definite tax program , Mr. said he could use that as a basis for a small short-term loan from the city 's bankers . That loan , he explained , would finance relief until the program was formally adopted , whereupon the city would apply for a loan against the program sufficiently large to carry relief to Dec. 31 , 1935 . Bankers Await Decision . Members of the banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night that the banks were willing to advance a small short-term loan for relief as soon as the administration decided definitely upon a tax that would produce revenue . When the final tax program is in shape , the bankers will be in a position to discuss a larger loan calculated to finance relief over twelve or fourteen months . The bankers would not commit themselves to any course of action , pending definite action on taxes by the administration . The bankers declared weeks ago that they considered either a city sales tax or a payroll tax adequate security for relief loans . Though the administration has passed throtigh a gamut of tax proposals since that time , it has returned to the sales tax as the one levy that will satisfy all parties involved . Aid to Credit Seen . Should the sales tax be legalized by the Aldermen today , it is counted on not only to finance relief but to improve the city 's credit generally . Its proponents have pointed out that with relief provided for the $25,000,000 bankers ' reserve in the 1935 budget may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient . It was also said the municipal securities could be more easily marketed to the banks . The three leading taxes in the program would provide an estimated revenue of $58,000,000 . The sales tax is counted upon to produce $40 , - 000,000 , the inheritance tax $3,000 , - 000 and the utility tax $15,000,000 . Mayor La Guardia has estimated relief needs at $61,000,000 for the fourteen-month period from Nov. 1 , 1934 , to Dec. 31 , 1935 . The city 's tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent on gross business income must be continued because the city has already borrowed money against it . Some Aldermen said yesterday that they would favor a revised city income tax applying a small rate to the higher brackets of income , possibly over $5,000 . It was generally felt , however , that if the sales tax , public utility tax and inheritance tax were approved the search for new revenue would end there . New Bureau Necessary . Enforcement of the city sales tax would require a large administrative bureau , to prevent evasions . Proponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include collection of this tax with its other duties because existing personnel would not be sufficient to handle it . The enforcement bureau would also take over the duty of collecting the utility tax and the inheritance tax should these measures be placed upon the books . Utility companies generally have been paying the 11/2 per cent city tax and deducting their payments from amounts paid under their special franchise taxes . In effect , the payments have been made under protest and are now in litigation . The utilities contend that they are protecting themselves against double taxation by the course they are following . If their tax is doubled they expect to continue deducting tax payments from special franchise payments . The utilities have already warned that additional taxes will result in an application to the Public Service Commission for increased rates . Milo R. Maltbie , chairman of the commission , said last week that ' it must recognize the validity of the claims if the city tax were increased . Mayor La Guardia will find himself in a peculiar position if he advocates the sales tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought bitterly against sales taxes and condemned them as the worst possible form of taxation . It was believed at City Hall that he would explain his position now on the ground that the Aldermen had rejected his original business tax and left him no alternative but to sign the tax presented by the Aldermen . Food Likely to Be Exempt . The city sales tax , it is expected , will be modeled upon the State sales tax of 1 per cent which was imposed for the year ended June 30 last . The tax yielded about $30 , - 000,000 . It exempted sales of food , gasoline , gas , water , steam and electricity , provided the latter four were furnished by public utility companies as part of their regular service . More specifically , the State tax excluded cereals , milk , meat , fish , eggs , vegetables , sugar , coffee , tea , cocoa and all products of these basic goods except candy and confectionery . The possibility that the State might again turn to the sales tax for revenue next year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resumed local consumers might have to pay 3 per cent on their purchases in the form of a tax . Mayor La Guardia 's continued reticence about the city 's tax plans was attributed to his idea that opposition against the taxes could not be organized until the opponents knew the administration 's plan . He said last week that the opposition would be sufficiently strong when the taxes were officially presented , without focusing opposition in advance . Democratic members of the Board of Aldermen have been advised by the five Democratic county leaders to give the Mayor any taxes he wanted , providing he claimed them as his . The Democrats control all but sixteen of the sixty-five votes in the Board of Aldermen , a voting strength of forty-nine . With a twothirds vote required to pass the local sales tax bill , they have more than the forty-five votes needed . The bill will be submitted with an emergency message from the Mayor . If the bill passes the Board of Aldermen today , the Board of Estimate will hear objections to it at a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public hearing was not announced , since the hearing itself is contingent upon what happens today . Before signing the bill , the Mayor is required by statute to hold another public hearing which must be advertised in advance in the City Record .
