txt An extended inquiry in the drive to rid the city of policy and bailbond racketeers , with a special staff of 100 or more volunteer lawyers to examine witnesses and build up cases , was announced yesterday by District Attorney William C. Dodge . The special staff will be the result of a plan he and Samuel D. Marcus . Special Assistant District Attorney and counsel for the Society for the Prevention of Crime , are working out , Mr. Dodge said . Having composed the differences which had threatened a breach between them , both affirmed they were in " perfect harmony , clicking 100 per cent " and settling down for a long , hard investigative pull . The expansion of the investigation as outlined would put it on a scale comparable to the Seabury inquiry into the city government . The announcement was made by Mr. Dodge late in the day while , at the same time , he indicated that , at present , they were not getting ahead very fast . The " big shots , " the ultimate goal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will Press Inquiry . " This investigation is not going to blow over , " he said . " As far as Mr. Marcus and I are concerned , it is not going to blow over . " We 've got the policy leaders on the'run and we will keep them running . I have talked to the grand jury and they are prepared to go on indefinitely . " He complained , however , that publicity had hampered the investigation . " The big trouble , " explained Mr. Marcus , who was present at the same conference , " is that it is more difficult to get the leaders . Until about a year ago it was all one gang , but now there are fifty or seventy-five bankers in control of individual games . It has become so vast it ca n't be cleaned up as easily as in the old days . " The threatened breach , which had originated with Mr. Dodge 's complaint that the society of which Mr. Marcus is counsel had failed to produce any evidence , and his comment that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egbert of Flushing , president of the society , before the grand jury , was all smoothed out . Egbert Willing to Appear . While both Mr. Marcus and the Rev. Mr. Egbert insisted they were still ready to go before the grand jurors , Mr. Dodge made it plain he would not call them . Mr. Marcus declared that the society had never contended it had evidence , but information . He said he had called Mr. Dodge some time ago on another matter and had " laughingly suggested that he appoint me a special assistant . " " ' Ha , ha , ' " Mr. Marcus quoted Mr. Dodge as replying . Later , however , a mutual friend suggested the same thing and the appointment followed . " We 're really doing our best , " intervened Mr. Dodge , " but we 're really handicapped . We have n't enough money . We need special Investigators , about twenty-five of them . " " Are n't the police cooperating ? " he was asked . " Oh , yes . But we need investigators who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared he would not ask the Board of Estimate for a special appropriation , however , but would utilize the special services of the ? volunteer lawyers instead . Polly Adler Held for Trial . Polly Adler , charged with keep- I ing a disorderly place in her apartment , 30 East Fifty-fifth Street , and possessing obscene films , waived examination on the two charges in Women 's Court and Magistrate Jonah J. Goldstein held her for trial in Special Sessions Court next Tuesday . While she complained that she had been the " fall guy in so many investigations I 'm beginning to feel like a rubber ball , " Assistant District Attorney Maurice G. Wahl hinted at a charge of " another crime " against her , with the result that her bail was raised from $500 to a total of $4,000 on the two charges . Afterward Mr. Wahl declined to explain what the " other crime " might be .

After having three times refused to testify she said she got the money ' from her sister , Mrs. Mary Ciano of the same address . Mrs. Ciano , who also went before the grand jury , said she was employed as a housekeeper by John Prendergast of 470 West Twenty-fourth Street , secretary to Supreme Court Justice Timothy A. Leary . Her husband worked in the Fulton Fish Market , said Mrs. Ciano , and between them they saved the $1,500 in thirteen months . Assistant District Attorney Lyon Boston , who conducted the examination , declared the testimony of the two women had " helped us toward the truth . " Seven Indictments Reported . The investigation launched by District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan in Brooklyn yesterday was reported to have resulted in seven indictments against bondsmen . Mr. Geoghan , however , refused to confirm or deny the reports . He did , however , make it plain that he was undertaking no sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand jury was merely a technicality , he sajd , and the magistrates were asked only to identify their signatures on bail bonds . " The grand jury does not propose to make any investigation based on gossip and rumor , " he said . " I have had some experience with those who make wild accusations and fall down miserably when they are called before the grand jury . " Eva Coo , Dorothy Walker and Yvonne Moore , three girls arrested with Polly Adler , and charged with vagrancy , also were brought before Magistrate Goldstein . Patrolman Joseph Michaels of the Fourth Inspection District was on the stand for a short while , and Mr. Wahl indicated he had a number of other witnesses , so Magistrate Goldstein adjourned the cases until next Tuesday . Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine yesterday amended his criticism of city magistrates for failure to cooperate to except Magistrate Goldstein and some others he did not name . " He is one of our magistrates who has evidenced a sincere desire to cooperate with this department , " the commissioner said .

Seery said had netted 636 arrests since March 4 , when they launched actions against landlords who had failed to dispossess tenants arrested on vice or policy charges .
