THE DESCARTE PEARL A STORY BY THOMAS ROURKE cm fathoms down , it was something S like walking along a mountain path picking mushrooms . But the oysters were very hard to break away from the coral rock and the basket you carried in your hand was made of iron and the walking was very slow , dragging the lead shoes through the water . But there was the nice clean path before you , narrow and white , twisting away among piles of rock and overhanging green stuff that swayed as though breezes were playing with it . And there was a green haze over everything too , just as you get sometimes in the woods in the morning when the sunlight slants in through the tree-tops . The green was different though ; there was more blue in it , and it was a pigment of some body too , for it limited your length of vision . It hung a blue-green curtain round you . Everything inside the curtain was quite clear , washed with green , but your vision ended abruptly with the curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oysters , the curtain moved with you , and it was like going along in the center of a circular room hung with green curtains ; a room that managed to manipulate itself so that you were always kept in the center of it . It was very pleasant down there in the first hours before you got cold . You had nothing to do but wander along the paths among the coral rocks , filling your basket with oysters . You couldlook at the scenery to your heart 's content and think about pleasant things if you were able to do that . I thought of Elena and imagined her down there with me . I imagined her running along ahead of me on the white path , losing herself among the high rocks and reappearing somewhere else , her hair drifting off her head in swaying strands , all those queer fish playing around her . Her blue dress would be wet , the pressure of the water holding it tight against her , showing her fine legs and the fine rise of her breasts , and her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green haze . She would be laughing at me because I could n't keep up with her . She would be laughing at me because she knew so much more than I did about everything in the world and she would be laughing at me because she knew I was afraid to love her . There I was , down on the bottom , and Armando was up there , wanting to kill me . Overhead the roof was brilliant gold , almost too gold to look at , and that was the surface of the water and the Holy Infant floated there , making a black ? oval in the gold . You could see her very clearly , up there , moving gently to the swells . You could see the barnacles on her keel and garboard and her rudder flapping and the cable coming off her bow down to the anchor and the short ladder dangling from the stern and the red rubber hose and the rope snaking down to me through the green water . You could see the turn of her sheer when she heeled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , and you could almost see the letters on her bow , El Niiio Santo . Armando was up there , pumping away , wanting to kill me . That 's what Ernesto said anyway . I did n't put much stock in it myself . Ernesto said Armando wanted to kill me because he thought I 'd had Elena . That was ridiculous . Armando would know better . He would know from how we acted that there was nothing in that . You can always tell by the way people act . I did n't put much stock in it . I never saw any signs of it in Armando anyway . He never showed any signs of being suspicious of us or of wanting to kill me ; he just seemed quiet and natural . Well , if he did want to kill me he had me in a nice spot , down there at the bottom , with him in the boat pumping me air . Of course he 'd have to take Ernesto first . Ernesto was there pumping with him , and the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it anyway . Ernesto was the one who was worried . He was always worried about something . He was one of those serious young Germans . It was weeks before this that the thing had begun . One morning the sun woke me , burning my eyeballs , and I turned on my side very slowly and tried to shield my eyes with my arm . I fought away consciousness , clinging to sleep , the way you do ; but it was too hot there in the sun and I gave it up . J opened my eyes carefully , and raised myself up on an elbow , very carefully , so I should n't jar my head . My head felt like a drum and there was the feeling that something was going to sock the drum pretty hard any minute now . I was on the beach at Guaraguao and the German was sitting beside me , running sand through his fingers . " Oh , good morning , sir , " he said . " Why are n't we at the pension ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , sir . You said it would be a shame to waste such a beautiful night in a room all closed in , where they left things standing under the bed for weeks at a time . You said some very beautiful things about the moonlight and the stars last night , sir . Arc you a poet , sir ? " " Ernesto , I knew the first time I saw you that you had no sense of humor . Do n't tell me any more about last night . " " How do you feel , sir ? " " Well , I have the clanks , galloping , and a dago family spent the night in my mouth . " " A dago family ? " " A wop family . " " A wop family ? What is that , sir ? " " A guinny family . " " I do n't understand , sir . What is a guinny family ? " " You 'll never learn English , Ernesto . You have no sense of humor . " " Oh , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . I laughed all evening at the things you said . You said some very amusing things last evening . And I know some very funny jokes , some of which I told last night . Do n't you remember ? Shall I tell you some now , sir ? " " No , no ! Never mind . " I brushed the sand from my ears and shook it out of my hair . It was a gorgeous morning . But all mornings are gorgeous in Margarita . Maybe that 's why I stayed there . The water was the color of a heron 's wing with the sun making little flickering gold sickles on it and the sky was yellow quartz , dusted with fish scales . Down the beach the headland curved out to the crumbled lighthouse and behind it were the houses of Porlamar , all colors , like a patchwork quilt . Up the other way , closer to us , was Guaraguao , the fishing village , sprawled on the beach ; grass huts with nets drying on frames and boats pulled up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the headland you could see it rolling up and smashing , white , on the locks , and the roar of it came over faintly . It was Sunday and the pearl boats lay in the cove . The diving suits were drying in the riggings , hanging by the toes , stretched out , all bright red , like red giants standing on their heads . Ernesto undressed to his undershirt and shorts . " Are n't you coming in , sir ? " he asked . " No , " I said , " and I do n't know if I can stand watching you . Even the contemplation of exertion produces a quivering in my middle . " " Last night you wanted to swim . Do you remember ? You wanted to swim out to the pearl reefs . You said there were mermaids out there . Of course I knew you were joking and anyway it 's a long swim , so I dissuaded you . " " I asked you not to talk about last night . " " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible thing when they christened you . You 've molded your personality to your name . " He ran down to the water and I lay there watching him with my eyes half closed . He dived and snorted and plunged and walked on the sand on his hands . He was a fine-looking young German  --  a fine body and a lot of blond curls and his blue eyes looked out so seriously at you . He came back to where I lay and went through a lot of calisthenics , drying off . " The New German Youth , " I said . " I 'm not a Nazi , sir , " he said , " not exactly . I believe in the absolute equality of man , regardless of race or creed or ? " " Never mind . Look coming up the beach . " It was the first time we ever saw Elena . She was coming toward us , up the beach , carrying a jug of water on her head . She wore a short dress of pale blue , the very beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jug on her head was burnt-orange and her skin was golden . Her legs and feet were bare in the sand . She walked as a pine tree might walk and her high breasts moved in the tight dress . It was Ernesto who spoke to her . I should n't have been able to do it . I 've always been bad at that sort of thing , afraid of a rebuff maybe , but not Ernesto . He had a theory about it  --  something about self-assertion or aggression or something of the sort . He spoke to her very politely . " Good morning , my little daughter , " he said . " Do you carry sweet-water ? " " Buenas dias , senores , " she said . " Yes , sir , at your order . " She swung the jug to the ground and we drank from a totumo , a kind of half-gourd , which she carried on top of the jug . " Do you live near here ? " Ernesto asked . " Por aqui , mismo . Right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jug for you , " he said . She laughed at his efforts to raise the heavy jug to his head . He got it up , holding it tightly with both hands , and the three of us walked toward the fishing village . Ernesto stepped very carefully in the sand , holding the jug tightly , making quite a job of it , being very serious about it . " I passed you early this morning , " she said . " You were both sound as/cep . " We went to pearling then , Ernesto and I and Armando , Elena 's brother . I had been looking about for something to do for the few weeks I 'd been in Porlamar , and when I found out that Manuel , Elena 's father , had a pearling outfit I offered to take out a permit and work on shares . Manuel had lost an arm and could n't work much , and what little Armando could make fishing was all they had to live on , so he seemed glad to accept the offer . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season and it would n't have paid him anyway for he should have had to hire a crew . The pearls were running small . An outfit was doing only about thirty bolivars a day  --  six dollars : an outfit of three men , one diver and two at the pump . Ernesto and I figured it was something anyway , and what money I had was getting low . So , we beached the Nino Santo , careened her at low tide , scraped and painted the bottom , overhauled the sails and gear and the air pump , patched up the diving suit , and went to pearling . We sailed out to the near reefs every morning . We worked the bottom all day till we had a load of pearl oysters and sailed back to Guaraguao about sunset . It was a pretty nice life . Better than hanging round Porlamar drinking anyway , and we made a living . The pearls were running small and ill-shapers , nearly all descarte , and the descarte price was very low . But once in a while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good color , running four or five grains ? that would bring maybe fifty bolivars , and then we 'd celebrate a little . We 'd get some wine and rum and celebrate in the evening at Manuel 's grass but on the beach . The diving fell to me . Armando had bad cars and could n't stand the pressure and Ernesto had that crackpot idea that Armando wanted to kill me because of Elena . He would n't hear of me being in the boat alone with Armando . So I worked on the bottomand he stayed in the boat so he could keep an eye on Armando. it did n't make any difference to me . I 'd just as soon work the bottom , although it got pretty cold down there after the first few hours , even with the wool jumper you wore under the diving suit . I 'd walk along filling the iron basket with oysters , and when it was full I 'd tie the rope to the handle , give the rope a jerk , and they 'd pull the basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would come streaking down through the green , leaving a trail of white bubbles . Ernesto and I moved our stuff from the pension in Porlamar and went to live at Guaraguao to be close to work . We slept in hammocks outside Manuel 's hut , and Elena cooked for us all . You could n't rightly say that Manuel 's family lived in the hut , for they slept outside and took their meals squatting in the sand and Elena cooked at a stone fireplace outside . The dark interior of the but was used only for storing things , and Elena dressed in there , dropping a goat-wool blanket over the doorway . It was a nice life . At least you were busy and you were tired at night and could sleep . You could almost forget those things back home . At first Ernesto made quite a play for Elena . He gave it up suddenly . It was funny how suddenly he gave it up . He was about her all the time and then , suddenly , he would n't go near her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin . He 'd gone straight to the point and she 'd just laughed and told him she was a virgin and he would n't go near her afterward . He had a theory about it . Some sort of theory about virgins : it was n't worth it , the complications , the worries , were n't worth the pleasure received . He had everything weighed out that way , everything he did . All his pleasures and other affairs too were balanced beforehand against the troubles involved , the possible con-THE DESCARTE PEARL sequences , the cost in money , and he gave it up or went ahead doggedly , according to the way his scales dipped . It was funny too how well Elena knew just how to stop him . Armando usually went to town in the evenings to /oaf around the peon gambling places or the dance places , but Ernesto and I stayed at home mostly and listened to old Manuel . Sometimes I 'd walk with Elena on the beach or sit with her on the rocks at the headland , under the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek was there . The Greek wanted to marry Elena and he made us all uncomfortable . On Sundays we stayed in the water nearly all day and those were the best times . The whole village would be playing in the water , men , women , and children . The women , in underslips , stayed by themselves , up the beach a way , and the men , in underwear , played with the naked children , tossing them about or teaching diem to swim . The boys paddled about on shark bladders , using them as water-wings . The fishermen were always bringing in sharks in their nets and they 'd cut them up to get the livers and throw the rest into the water , so there were always flocks of birds swooping , boobies and gulls and frigate-birds . They 'd dive right beside you . You could go under water and watch them coming in , breaking the surface , streaking down through the green , getting a bit of shark-meat or maybe a live fish . The water was cool and calm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the women , but I was always conscious of her . I watched her fine body slip through the water , the black hair gleaming , the teeth flashing . Manuel told us stories of the sea . Sitting by the cook-fire in the evening , he 'd tell us about sailing and fishing , sharks and giant rays and big , fine pearls , and Elena would sit , tailor-fashion , shucking pearl-oysters , scraping out the little descarte pearls , wiping the knife on the heel of her palm where the pearls would stick , looking like a dab of fish-roe . Her hands worked very fast and the pink bodies of the oysters slipped into the bucket at her knee in a quiet procession . Manuel talked like an old man . He was n't old , really . He was still in his fifties . But losing an arm had taken a lot out of him , as a crippling will do when it happens to a man who is getting on . He talked like an old man , rambling along , getting his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not like a man who had lost an arm . His eyes stared ahead , into the fire or out over the water into the dark , as though they were blind . It had taken a lot out of him . Sometimes though when we 'd had a little rum he 'd shake off a few years and the screens would drop from his eyes and he would talk with animation and he would n't seem blind . He would n't even seem like a one-armed man . He 'd talk brightly , like a whole , strong man , and he would begin to gesticulate with his stump of an arm . He would move the stump about as though it were a whole arm . But then , suddenly , he would notice it . He would see it suddenly moving in the air . He would stop for a moment and look at it in surprise . Then he would move the stump down to his side and look at us apologetically , as though something had gone awry and he would go on talking again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old blind man . A moray had bitten his hand . One of those snaky , green and yellow things . Infection set in and they had had to chop off his arm . Armando did it . Armando chopped off his father 's arm with a machete . He got the machete red hot over the charcoal brazier on the deck of the Holy Infant and chopped off Manuel 's arm , just below the elbow . They were pearling in the far reefs and infection started before they could get back to Porlamar . The water is deep on the far reefs  --  round fifteen fathoms  --  and it 's dark down there , feeling round for oysters . Not much light gets down , even in that dear water , in fifteen fathoms . Manuel had n't seen the moray . He was reaching for an oyster growing on a rock and the moray got his hand . He did n't see it twisted up there in all that mess of coral . He did n't feel it either , when the long teeth went into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off at the wrist by the diving suit . He did n't know he 'd been bitten till he climbed up on a big hill of coral rock where it was lighter and he could see his hand . If it had bled a lot at first , if the circulation had n't been stopped at the wrist and the wound had bled , he probably would n't have lost his arm . Armando had tied a rope round the arm above the elbow . He had placed the arm on the gunwale and chopped it off and flicked the severed part overboard . I asked him if the arm floated but he said he had n't looked . The Greek came two or three evenings a week . Everything was strained then , stiff and polite , and Ernesto and I would say good-night and set out for town as soon as we could without being rude . The Greek was n't unpleasant at all or boring . He was very polite and quiet and his remarks were always intelligent and often amusing . It was just that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could n't help knowing that . It stuck out all over . He seemed to radiate that one fact . The air round him seemed charged with it  --  as though a loudspeaker kept constantly repeating it . He wanted Elena . He wanted that girl . It was so loud it made you self-conscious for him . It was in his eyes maybe , the way they followed her , the large , bulging , brown eyes . They followed her lips when she talked and even moved with her breathing , it seemed . Darting from side to side , up and down , slight , quick little movements , like an electrical instrument connected by induction to Elena 's body , responding to the vibrations of it as the diaphragm of a telephone to the surges of current . They almost never blinked , those eyes . It was fascinating to watch them . You could watch them for a long time , the round , white balls with the little brown centers , darting about in slight jerks , and it would seem as though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliberately , the covers would come down over the white balls , hiding the brown circles . The covers would stay down a long time and then , very slowly , move up again . He was the richest man in Margarita . That is , in the sense of ready cash . There were Spaniards , old families , who owned land and cattle , but the Greek had the cash . He had all the paying businesses  --  the botaquin , the sugar mill , the cinema  --  and he owned nearly the whole pearl fleet . He had a Large , tile warehouse on the shore by the seawall and a lot of women working all the time shucking oysters . He sold his whole pearl crop direct to Paris . He was round and smooth and white , even his hands . His head was bare of hair except for gray fuzz at the ears and some damp black strings in the back . He let some of the strings in the back grow very long and he combed them forward over the bare dome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't enough of the black strings to cover but they were spread very evenly over the whole white surface in parallel lines like ruling on white paper . I wondered how he would look when they were out of place , when he 'd slept on them , when the long damp strings fell back off the dome and hung down his neck . I could never tell how Elena felt about him , so I asked her . " Are you going to marry the Greek ? " I asked . " Some day , I guess , " she answered . " Why not ? He 'll be good to me and I wo n't have to work . I wo n't grow old too soon like the other women . And I could no more love one of the peons . There 's no one else I could marry . " " Do n't you ever think of leaving here ? " She laughed . " I should be a sorry figure away from here , " she said . " I should be very unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She understood her condition of life , saw its limitations . She appreciated the full life away from there and knew she would never know it , but she was too wise for bitterness . " Why does n't the Greek help you ? " I asked . " Why did n't he get a permit for your father 's boat ? " " The Greek wants me . " " That 's what I mean . Why does n't he do something for you ? " Elena laughed and touched my hand with her fingers . " You would n't understand that , " she said . " That 's why I Iike you so much . " I think she was the wisest woman I ever knew . Maybe you wo n't believe that . Maybe you wo n't believe that a woman who 'd spent her life there on that island , who could n't read or write , who 'd never known or spoken with another foreigner , who had n't even any deep experiences of her own , could seem wise to an American . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect certain things of girls in those places . You expect shyness , blushes , a deference to your words , a peasant stupidity . But Elena was wise . She had knowledge and opinions of many things and she askedeagerly of things of which she did n't know . Sometimes , sitting on a rock beside her , looking out over the water , I would look up at her , her raised chin , the faint smile about her mouth and I would see contentment and assurance there and feel very clumsy , very ignorant . Maybe , even on Margarita , an intelligent person can learn all there is to know by watching other people . She was always laughing at me . She seemed always to know what was in my mind and she was amused at my disconcertion . One night we were walking along a salina . We had gone beyond the headland , climbing over the jumble of rock that was there and out onto the salina that stretched in a great , fiat curve inland to the foot of the mountains . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shallow pools that streaked it , and the mountains were flat purple ribbons bordering it . The breeze swept in from the sea , crisp with the smell of the sea , and sent little swirls of salt whispering over the hard crust , and a rustling came from the millions of gulls nesting on the pools . The moon seemed very close and the plane we walked on seemed wide as the universe . " You know , " Elena said , " I like you better when you 're drinking . " " I 've noticed you 're always ready to serve me . " " You 're much more fun . You say much nicer things when you 're drinking . ' ' " Do n't pay any attention to anything I say when I 'm drinking , " I said , sharply . I was annoyed and a little startled . " I do n't mean anything I say . " She laughed . " You say very beautiful things sometimes . You told me I was beautiful . Did n't you mean that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm drinking . " " You do n't think I 'm beautiful then ? " I could see her smiling in the moonlight . " I sha n't take another drop to drink so long as I 'm here , " I said . " Then you do think I 'm beautiful but you 're afraid to tell me when you 're sober . What arc you afraid of ? " " I 'm not afraid for myself . " " Oh , you 're so sure I 'd fall that you 're afraid for me . " " I 'm not sure at all . I just talk crazy when I drink , that 's all . " " But I like to hear it . Why do n't you talk crazy when you 're sober ? You 're much happier when you talk crazy . " " If you did fall , as you put it , it would do you a lot of harm and if you did n't , I should just be ridiculous . " Elena laughed again . " Why should you be more afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid for myself at all , you know . And you 're not afraid for me either , really . You 're afraid for yourself . Someone must have hurt you badly . Will you tell me about it ? " " You 're pretty sure of yourself , are n't you ? " " Not at all . I do n't even think about it . I know that I should do anything that I wanted to do badly and that I should n't regret it afterward . " After that I was always very careful what I said to her and she teased me about it , knowing the effort it was . The pearl business began to go badly . For some reason or other the pearls became smaller and fewer . Poor as the hauls had been before , they became worse , till sometimes , after we 'd shucked a whole load and Ernesto and Armando and Elena and I had scraped the roelike dabs of tiny pearls from our hands and put them all together on the scales , there 'd be only ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe ten bolivars  --  two dollars , for a day 's work for three men . It was the same with the other pearlers too . They all had the same story to tell . The Greek said that his boats were averaging about eight bolivars , not enough to pay for the permits . The near reefs had gone bad . You heard lots of different theories about it . There was n't the right sort of food in the currents that swept around the reefs to produce pearls in the oysters ; the water was too warm from the long dry season ; there were too many steamers going by these days and the oil they left on the water killed the germs that produced the pearls . It was n't a grain of sand , you heard , that produced pearls , for natural pearls had hollow centers ; it was a germ , a disease of the oyster , that caused an irritation and made pearls with hollow centers . Anyway the pearls were falling off on the near reefs . From the far reefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the northeast , big pearls were coming . One after another , the Margarita boats were leaving the near reefs and sailing off toward Coche in search of big pearls . We talked it over round Manuel 's cook-fire and decided to go ourselves . We decided on a month 's trip  --  alI that was left of the legal pearling season . We would build a shelter on Coche , for the rains were beginning , fish the reefs alternate days , spending every other day on the island , shucking . Cache was a small island and no one lived there , but there was a sweet-water spring . We should have to take enough food to last us the month , though we could depend somewhat on fish and crawfish . And there were always the pearl oysters to boil and eat if you got really hungry . Elena did n't say anything when we talked it over . She sat quietly , weaving a hammock of moriche palm . It was afterward , when I was alone with her , that she spoke of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'll miss you . " " I 'm rather looking forward to it , " I said . " It will be fun to have a chance at some real pearls . " " You know the water is deep there and it will be cold down there all day . Do you think you 'll be able to stand the pressure ? " " I think so . It has n't bothered me here at all , in six fathoms . I 'll wear two jumpers against the cold . " " When you come back the season will be over . I suppose you 'll be leaving then . " " I suppose so . Ernesto was talking yesterday about the gold strikes in Guiana . Maybe we 'll go down there . " " You 'll be leaving for Coche in two days and when you come back you 'll be leaving for good . We have n't much time , have we ? " She smiled and rose from the bank of sand where we 'd been sitting . She took my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen who were playing guitars and singing around a fire . The day before we were to go we brought the Nino Santo in from her mooring in the cove and loaded her . We brought her up close to the beach at high tide so that we could wade out to her and spent all afternoon putting supplies aboard . All the children from the village helped us and we had a lot of fun , splashing through the water . Elena helped too , wading out to the boat with the rest of us , laughing a lot . There was quite a bit of stuff to be put aboard . There were wooden casks of water , big discs of casabe wrapped in palm leaves , stalks of plantains , net slings of oranges and mangoes , baskets of sapodillas , dates , and guandbanas , sacks of cornmeal and charcoal , bottles of coconut oil , chunks of dried goat meat  --  a mess of stuff that had to be stowed and lashed down onthe little sloop . It was something like preparing for a picnic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after dinner , the fishermen came to Manuel 's but with their guitars . Ernesto had gone into Porlamat for rum and wine and ponche creme , so the fiesta was pretty lively . The purple night was all about , the firelight gleamed on the dark faces of the men and women , on their ragged clothing and bare feet , on the bright guitars and flying marracas , and the sounds went into the night like spray from a fountain  --  the dull rhythm of the guitars , the swish of the marracas , the chants of the Margariteiios , high , cracked voices , clear , young voices , singing , cackling . The bottles went round , the are pas toasted on the fire . You had to drink with everyone . You had to tell everyone what a fine fellow he was and you had to listen interminably while he chanted what a fine fellow you were . You had to tolerate his arm about your shoulder , his dark , snaggle-tooth face against yours ; but after awhile , as the liquor warmed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the songs , you waved your drink , slapped the thighs of the girls , and stood up and tried to jig with the others . Ernesto stood with his arm round a girl , his blond hair mussed , his face red from the sun and the firelight , singing , very seriously , in bass monotone , German words to the music . Armando was stretched out on the sand , dead to the world . Manuel squatted on his haunches , moving his head to the rhythm , a smile on his dark , wrinkled face . Elena was everywhere , laughing and singing and filling cups . She kept mine always full . So it was , the thing came about that night . After everyone had straggled off or fallen asleep , Elena and I were alone in the firelight . It is all confused , just how it happened , but there are some things that I remembered about it , as you will about things that happen at a fiesta like that . I remember that I took her by the hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lighthouse , that little sandy spot with the rocks piled up round it . I remember that I looked at her laughing face and that it came to me then that she 'd planned all this . And I did n't care . I did n't care about anything . My mind refused all control . It cast out what shreds of sober self-control remained there and poured out a wild , happy stream of words . I remember sitting on the sand with my hack against the rocks , talking , talking , singing even , English , Spanish ; and Elena laughing , stroking my face with her fingers , kissing me . I remember her dancing on the bit of sand there . I remember the moonlight on her body , the long curves of her body that I knew so well , that I had never dared think about . I remember her head thrown back , her abandoned laughter . It is dark and cold in fifteen fathoms . Your hands are so cold you can scarcely break an oyster from the rock when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sharpened stakes driven into either side of your head . It seems as though you 'll never get the basket filled . It seems as though the rope will never jerk to tell you it is noon and you can drop the lead belt and drift up to the dangling ladder , feeling those stakes drawing out , drawing the pain with them , as you go up , feeling the warmth of the water soaking into you . The dark-green curtain is still there , in fifteen fathoms , but you are groping around in it , lost in its folds . I stumbled along in the semi-darkness , groping for the rocks that rose round me , feeling for the jagged , protruding shells . I wore leather tips on my fingers , but the sharp shells cutthrough them . I was cold and miserable and worried . I was miserable because of Elena and I was worried because of Armando : because Armando wanted to kill me . I was n't sure of that even now , but Ernesto kept harping on it and at last it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had n't bothered me before , working in the shallow water , but here , in the dark , I kept thinking about it . Of course I 'd been innocent then . That was the answer . When I thought of that I felt relieved . It was all in my mind . Armando was just naturally quiet  --  a big , good-looking , quiet chap , not overly bright . We were getting some big pearls though . The day before , shucking , Ernesto had turned out a nice one  --  a yellow pearl , almost perfectly round . Armando had rolled it to test its roundness and held it on the tip of his finger and judged it ten grains  --  worth forty dollars . There were pearls here all right . And you could make money in Margarita . Not much , but enough to live on and maybe enough to get away once in a while  --  to the States or Europe . There were other things besides pearls too . You could try coconuts and rum and manganese . There was manganese up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lots of it , when we were scouting up on the bare hillsides . It would n't be a bad life at all . Elena was beautiful . She was wise too . It would be fun teaching her and taking her about . She would be beautiful anywhere . And we should never go home . My family , my father and that woman he 'd married would n't know anything about it . I 'd write once in awhile and they would be satisfied . They would be glad to be rid of me . Their consciences would be clear if I wrote them once in a while . They would think they were " keeping in touch " with me . They would be able to say , " Bill ? Oh , yes . He 's doing fine . We just heard from him . He 's in  --  where is he , dear ? " It 's odd how fine you feel when you 've decided upon something that 's been worrying you . I went to Armando 's hammock and shook him awake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to ask Elena to marry me , " I said . His face did n't change at all . He went on blinking . " You do n't say , " he said . " I wish you luck . I was afraid she 'd marry the Greek . " It seemed we 'd never get home . The trade wind was fresh and the Holy Infant put her nose into the billows , throwing a nice spray , foamed down the sides of the billows , making ten knots , the sails bellied out , wing and wing , but we seemed to be going very slowly . The seas rolled astern of us , and it seemed as though we stayed in one place . Then , at last , when we rounded the headland , trimmed the sheets , and came quietly to the mooring in the cove , and the grass huts of Guaraguao were before us , I saw Elena standing on the beach . She was all dressed up so that I scarcely recognized her . The Greek stood beside her , smiling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things when she came into the but . Ernesto swung his cheap , tin trunk onto his shoulder and carried it out to the two-wheeled cart that waited at the door and I went on tamping things into the duffel bag . " Armando told me , " she said . " I expetted that , that 's why I did n't wait till you got back . I thought you 'd think you ought to marry me . " " I did n't think I ought to . I wanted to . " She did n't say anything and I went on packing . It was dark in the but and her body shut out most of the light from the doorway . " I wish you would move out of the light , " I said . " I ca n't see to pack . " " I told the Greek about us . I told him the next day . " " And he married you anyway . " " I knew he would . He raved a little to satisfy his pride . " " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrug of her shoulder by the shadow on the wall . " He 'll always bring it up when he 's angry . But he can never hurt me much . " " You do n't seem to expect much happiness , " I said . " I have had more than I 'd ever expected . " We rode on top of our baggage , piled high on the cart , and lurched along , over the sandy road toward the clock in Porlamar . The burro nodded his head and the driver prodded his narrow little rump with a stick . Ernesto had his nose in the Mining Engineers ' Handbook . " Is the gold alluvial in Guiana ? " he asked . When we got to the dock , I gave the driver a handful of small , misshapen pearls . " You 're paying him too much , " the German said . " They 're only descarte. "
