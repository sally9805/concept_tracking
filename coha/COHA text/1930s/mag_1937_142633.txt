Denver , Colo. has had notorious trouble with Indians , dueling , prostitution and the 16-1 ratio of silver and gold . More lasting than any of these has been Denver 's trouble with transport . Founded in 1858 , this roaring frontier town presently grew into one of the West 's most important cities , with some 300,000 inhabitants . But not until 1934 did it succeed in getting on a transcontinental railroad . That year , with a wild barbecue and great civic jubilation , Denver finally holed through the Moffat Tunnel under the continental divide , got a direct train route to the East. * Meanwhile , all other major U. S. cities were taking places in the spreading network of U. S. airlines and Denver once more found itself shortchanged . <P> Though almost all its traffic and trade are eastwest , Denver has only a north-south airline . To get to either coast a Denverite has a choice of flying north for 97 mi. on Wyoming Air Service to Cheyenne and United Air Lines ' transcontinental route or south for 419 mi. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Albuquerque . Though Denver and the airlines have long been aware that both could profit by altering this uneconomic situation , they have been prevented from doing so by an opposition as steep as the scarp of the Rockies which so long held back the railroads-the attitude of the U. S. Post Office Department . Last week Denver was again jubilant , for it finally succeeded in tunneling through this obstacle too . <P> Ever since the celebrated Farley-Roosevelt airmail cancellation , the Post Office has been as capricious with the airlines as a young girl is with her suitors . This airline application it grants ; that one it turns down , often with no satisfactory explanation . One of its key policies has been to frown on any proposed extension of one airline or creation of a new one if it will compete with an established service ( TIME , March 22 ) . Since the Post Office controls the air mail subsidy , its word is tantamount to law and many a proposed extension has failed to materialize . Denver is such a case . Any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any extension by United or TWA into Denver would compete with Wyoming Air or Varney , which now have all the traffic . Result : a stymie . United reluctantly began to dicker with Wyoming Air to buy its run between Cheyenne and Denver . Last week these negotiations had been dropped , for another solution presented itself . <P> Last month Northwest Airlines got permission from the Post Office to fly 60 mi. south of its run between Seattle and Spokane so it could serve Yakima , Wash. , which had no airline at all . The Denver Chamber of Commerce immediately petitioned the Post Office to allow United to do the same for Denver . TWA and others protested violently , but Wyoming Air , the sole system which would be directly hurt , offered no objection because of an agreement with United . Last week , to everyone 's surprise , Post Office Solicitor Karl A. Crowley decided in favor of the petition , set up a new and important ruling- that an airway was not to be considered a geometric line like train tracks but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to serve communities within a reasonable distance of its regular route .
