COOL , pine-scented nights . Crystal lakes teeming with hungry fish . Forest quiet , far from rasping horns , jangling phones , and humdrum daily routine . That 's the way you pictured your camping trip before you left home last year . But you forgot fly dope , and ravenous insects machine-gunned your defenseless skin . Tight shoes rubbed blisters on your aching feet . Rain poured down in oversize buckets ? and you had n't thought to bring along a rubber poncho . And so you 'll never go camping again ? Do n't you believe it ! In anyone who has ever flipped a flapjack over a glowing camp fire , the urge to hit for the woods crops up annually , like a garden weed , despite the best of efforts to stifle it . But this time , go prepared . Take the oldtimers ' tip : A camping trip is a success or failure before you ever leave your front doorstep . And planning the details beforehand is not only half the fun , but it 's also the best possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camping trip as setting up housekeeping in the wilds . Check through your home and figure how you 'll reproduce all its essentials and many of its conveniences when you 're deep in the tall timber . You 'll need a roof and walls for shelter . That means a good tent or lean-to . You 'll need a kitchen . That means thinking of food , a fire , and cooking utensils . For a bedroom , you 'll require blankets or a sleeping bag , with  | something comfortable underneath . The bathroom brings up questions of toilet necessities , soap , and a first-aid kit to serve as your open-air medicine cabinet . And your living room is the whole outdoors . Volumes can be written and have been ? on every detail of living in the open , but you do n't need to spend a week at the library to have a successful trip . It 's more fun to figure it out for yourself . Follow the main headings below as a framework , mull over the suggestions given , add a generous helping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best vacation you ever had . FOOD . If you can get to camp by boat or car , the sky 's the limit on the food you can take . If you have to tote it for miles , however , choose plain , nourishing food , light in weight . Canned goods are three quarters water , and feel like lead after a ten-mile hike . Bacon , flour , sugar , beans , and coffee are the five essentials . Gelatin supplies quick energy . Allow two pounds of food a day for each camper , and plan the menu of each meal before you leave . Dried fruits , dehydrated vegetables , and powdered milk and coffee weight little and are very palatable in the woods . Nested kits of eating utensils save space . For cooking , a skillet , coffeepot , and kettle for boiling and dishwashing are vital . SHELTER AND CLOTHING . In tents as well as in clothing , remember that lightcolored fabrics are more attractive to insects than dark . Balloon cloth is a practical , light- weight tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a mosquito-net flap door . Experienced woodsmen never court insomnia by sleeping on the ground when it is n't absolutely necessary . A folding cot , or an air mattress blown up only part way , makes the best bed . Take two light blankets instead of one heavy one , and remember to put as many blanket thicknesses under you as over you . Wool is best for clothing . Break in those new camp shoes or boots before you leave . Wear silk socks under wool ones when hiking . Soap rubbed around your heel will help prevent blisters . CAMP FIRE . Do n't bother building an architectural masterpiece of stacked wood before starting your fire . Light it first and build it afterwards . Start with tinder , or shavings made with a hunting knife . Light up , then pile on progressively larger wood . Build up a good bed of hot coals for easy cooking . If rocks are scarce , use four empty tin cans to support the corners of a cooking grill . Green limbs and forked sticks will hold pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emergency supply in a waterproof case , preferably one that will float . WATER . Do n't drink water you 're not absolutely sure of . Boil it fifteen minutes first . LIGHT . Take one flash light for every camper . Do n't forget that extra batteries are useless if you have no replacement for a burned-out bulb . A gasoline or electric lantern is handy . So are candles . GEOGRAPHY . You 'll take a compass , but will you wish you had practiced using it before you got lost ? In a pinch , point the hour hand of your watch at the sun . Half way between the hour hand and twelve on the dial is south . On a hike , turn around and glance back once in a while , to learn how trail landmarks will look when you 're hunting for them on the return trip . For good maps at low prices , write the U. S. Geological Survey , Washington , D. C. ? in Canada , the Canadian Geological Survey , Ottawa . FIRST AID . A complete first-aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed only for first aid . If you need a doctor , get out of the woods and get one . Amateur doctoring is bad business . Take along a good laxative . DO N'T FORGET . Can opener . Axe . Knife . Adhesive tape . Toilet tissue . Spare shoe laces . Toothbrush . A length of strong cord or wire . Extra glasses , if you wear them . Before you leave , collect and spread out everything you think you might take , and then cast nonessentials aside one by one , paring down to a load you can comfortably transport . Make one final check-up to see that you 've forgotten nothing , then hit for the woods . One last thing , though : Did you remember to lock the back door ?  |
