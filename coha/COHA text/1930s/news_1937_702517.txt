txt Another major step in keeping the American economy on an evel keel was taken today . The Federal Reserve System is now ready to buy Government securities in the open market " in such amounts and at such times as may be desirable " to maintain " orderly conditions in the money market . " The purpose of this step , announced after long meetings on Saturday and Sunday by the open market committee of the Federal Reserve System , is to preserve the pressent easy money policy designed to simulate business expansion . In other words , while the Federal Reserve Board is anxious to prevent the dangers of Inflation , it is not willing to pull the brake so hard as to curb desirable expansion and even throw the national machine into the ditch of deflation . The board was confronted with a maldistribution of bank credit , an unsettled bond market , with new treasury borrowing ahead . Its officials believe that " easy money " must be the watchword for some time longer , in order that rising prices be combated not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They believe the answer to high prices is the manufacture of more goods , which in turn stimulates reemployment , facilitates a nearer balance of the budget , and controls inflation by guiding the economic up-curve through moderation to higher levels , rather than abruptly checking it . A temporary tension in money markets seemed threatened , as May 1 approached  --  the date when virtually doubled reserve requirements on all member banks of the Federal Reserve System are to go into effect . The increase in reserve requirements is a real check on inflation : a lusty tug on the governmental brake . Already its effects are being felt beforehand . and In conjunction with drops in anticipated revenues and general uncertainties which were reflected in a falling government bond market . it seemed likely that the check might be too severe ? might throw the national back-seat riders out of their seats . So the Reserve Board eases the brake off appreciably . By purchasing government bonds in the open market , the Federal Reserve System takes bonds out of the hands of the commercial banks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system . A double cushioning effect results : The long-teen bond market is prevented from slipping downward further , while the amount of bank funds available is Increased . It is not clear that many actual purchases will be necessary . The mere etlect of the announcement may be enough to support the bond market , permit ' banks to meet the new reserve requirements , and handle the entire matter " psychologiMoreover , the board 's announcement left open the possibility that while now it would buy in open market operations , later On sales may be more appropriate . In short , the board is acting ? in its own words  --  to preserve " orderly conditions in the money marcet . " What It Is Hoped to Mean That means more than a mere technical development in the counting houses . It means that all the effects of " recovery " already perceptible to men-in-the-street all over America will probably not be rudely checked ; that if the board 's plans work out , a progressive expansion by means of continued " easy money " will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , are to be controlled by such factors as President Roose- velt 's statement last Friday announcing diminution of government purchases in the durable goods industries . Of scarcely less importance than this ' notable effort to smooth out the curves of economic rise and fall , was the second report today of the Treasury 's study in foreign investments into the United States . This report , covering the last two calendar years by the addition of the Oct. ** 30 quarter , showed the following striking facts . Foreigners trebled their buying of American securities in the three months immediately following the tri-partite monetary agreement of last September . But foreigners practically ceased transferring short-term and brokerage balances to this country following the agreement . And capital failed to return from the United States to gold bloc countries that had devalued their currencies . A total foreign investment in the United States of about $7,400 , - 000,000 was revealed at the end of 1936 . When Money " Got Hot " Net foreign purchases of American securities totaled $600,693,000 during 1936 ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 684.391,000 . This total amouln , which represents the gross funds available to foreigners to transfer to the United States , is many times the volume of annual war-debt payments which axe in default . The phenomenal increase in foreign purchases of American securities following the tripartite monetary agreement  --  the very period during which President Roosevelt was issuing his warnings about " hot money " ? is shown in these figures for the first time . Net foreign buying in the last three months of 1936 totaled $284,103,000 , while totali for the preceding three quarters were $109,103 , - 000 , $106,526,000 , and $110.961,000 , or not much more for the nine months than for the last three months . This enormous flood of foreign buying pextly explains the rocketing stock market and rising prices . Great Britain was the heaviest buyer , taking $132,000,000 worth of American securities during the last three I months of 1936 and $217.915,000 for the entire year . Switzerland took $145,036,000 for the year , and the Netherlands took $107,149,000 for the year ? in second and third place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two small neutral countries , but probably reflect a large amount of expatriate money from Germany .
