 | stepped into the room was still sitting alone . His eyes hesitated in a brief moment of study as they found her , then moved on to the grand piano . The present entertainer , a tired-looking girl with nice legs and a fair voice , was just finishing her song . Because most hands were otherwise occupied , there was little applause ; apparently none was expected . The blond youth at the piano transposed in a series of soft , full chords and continued idly on another chorus when the girl sat down beside him on the bench . Nate Girard moved into the living-room from the terrace windows on the left . He held two champagne glasses in one hand , a cigarette in the other . As he walked diagonally across to the dining-room steps , he smiled and said something to the foursome on the modernistic sofa . He came straight to the bar and Leon said : " Two more of the same , Mr. Girard ? " " If you please , Leon . " Girard put down his glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it . " " Hestor here ? " Murdock asked casually . " Yes . With me . Do you mind ? " " You do n't have to be that polite , Nate . " Murdock 's tone was sardonic . " Where would I be , minding ? " " Well ? " Girard 's hands moved in a suggestion of a shrug . He glanced over his shoulder . Leon had not finished with the order and he looked back at Murdock . " Not drinking ? " " I 've got to work in the morning . " Murdock hesitated , his dark eyes speculative ; then he took Girard by the elbow and drew him to one corner of the room , letting go of the elbow as he took another half-step to face him .  | He said : " I like the party , but I do n't know yet who 's giving it . Are we celebrating your acquittal or Redfield 's fifty-thousand fee ? " Girard smiled . " Call it a co-operative affair . I 'm throwing it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small . " " It 's an idea . " Murdock nodded in amused approval . " You 've got something to celebrate . It must seem good to be out . " " You 'll never know how good . " " A party tonight , " mused Murdock , glancing down at the end of his cigarette , " and this afternoon ? " " A cold sweat , " Girard cut in grimly , " while twelve good men and true argued for four hours and finally got the best of their natural sadistic impulses to send me to t ' the chair . " Girard 's mouth dipped at the corners , pulling his mustache ends with it . His voice took on an undertone of cynicism . " It would n't have surprised me much . , Most of the newspaper men , most of the wise money , thought I 'd get it . " " A lot of them did , " Murdock agreed . " The police and the District Attorney " ? Girard 's lips flexed in a wry grin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brows lifted . " That 's their job . Somebody did and ? " " You think so too , huh ? " Girard 's deep-set eyes were fixed , fathomless . " I did n't follow the trial very closely . " Murdock 's glance touched some remote object , and his momentary frown was thoughtful . " But I 've got plenty of gall and ill-mannered curiosity , " he added dryly . " I have to have  | in my business , and I 've known you quite a while . So when I pulled you over here , I had an idea  --  since you 've had your acquittal and can never be tried again  --  I might ask you for the truth . " He dropped the cigarette in a pedestal ash-tray . " And now that I 've gone this far , I think I would ask except that , as I think of it , it 's sort of a stupid question . There 's only one answer , is n't there ? " Nate Girard did not speak at once . Murdock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , both waiting , each sizing up the other . Murdock was nearly as tall as Girard , with a lean flatmuscled body that was loose , yet well knit . His brows were straight above brown eyes that were sometimes like copper  --  only harder , sometimes dark enough to be called black . Now shadows made them black . Girard was ten years older , a few pounds heavier . A close-up revealed the muscular leanness of a man who keeps fit and does not have to worry about his waistline . The ruggedness of his rectangular face , the close-cropped mustache , the black hair , gray-streaked at the sides , gave him a distinguished look that was both handsome and intelligent . The intangible thing common to both , and as apparent as a physical characteristic , was that each had about him a certain hardness that varied only in type ; apparent because there was no shifting of eyes , no fumbling with hands or nervous reactions as the tension grew . Murdock broke it without removing his gaze . " It 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should I ? " Girard 's mustache twitched . His tone seemed rather grimly amused . " That question is so hack-  | neyed I 'm used to it . I 've been asked it by experts  --  in the District Attorney 's office . " Girard paused . Murdock seemed to relax , and his eyes narrowed with his smile . " The answer is still the same , " Girard added evenly . " And if I seem bitter about this trial it 's because the answer happens to be the truth .. I never killed a man in my life . " " But you know who did ? " Leon 's anxious voice reached the corner of the room . " Ready , Mr. Girard . " Nate Girard glanced over Murdock 's shoulder . " Do n't ; be morbid , " he counseled . " This is a celebration . " He lapped the side of Murdock 's shoulder smartly , stepped ound him , adding : " What you need is another drink . " Kent Murdock moved to the bar and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda . While e waited he leaned wide-spread elbows on the imitation ahogany edge and idly surveyed Leon 's innovation , which was fast becoming an institution . The whole rig was clever . The mirror on the wall ectly behind the bar was plastered with a soapy scrollork , and on the neat shelves that bordered this display as the usual motley assortment of bottles : whiskies , ns , liqueurs . There was a length of brass rail , portable ike the bar , which was made in sections so that Leon uld do a made-to-measure business , like a tailor , and . tisfy the demands of all comers whether the occasion ? , . emanded a kitchenette bar or a dance-hall set-up . It was all quite authentic  --  except Leon 's name , which should have been Gus . He was bald , short , with a balloon-  | tire waist and fat dimpled hands that were red , like plums . Mark Redfield joined Murdock as he finished his inspection . " Making out all right ? " " Yeh . " Murdock turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see so many lawyers hanging around the courthouse . It 's these fifty-thousand-dollar fees . " " Sounds good , huh ? " Redfield grunted disparagingly . " Maybe I 'm a second Clarence Darrow , or a Max Steuer . " " You do pretty well for a city like this . " Mark Redfield spread his hands , let them flop on the bar , palms down . With his florid , big-nosed face and pompous , well-fed figure he looked more like a successful politician than a criminal lawyer . His voice , carefully nurtured for courtroom use , had a booming , confident timbre regardless of pitch . Shrewd , spectacular , an artist at innuendo and repartee , he was a showman whose color , personality , and reputation were such that many a case was half won the moment he stepped into a courtroom . Flushed with victory , stimulated by drink , his attitude towards Murdock became fraternal , confiding . The bars were down . He forgot his pose and spoke as one insider to another , his voice thick , a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; more'n that I guess . I 've made a lot of money from routine stuff . But ' his is the first big fee . And why ? Because Girard is smart . He never was a killer . " Redfield shook his head . " It 's funny . Ten years in the liquor racket and never mixed in a killing . For two years now he goes around minding his own business , legitimate . And then , blooiel " Redfield  | blew out his breath . " I damn near missed ; the toughest case I ever drew . But fifty thousand sounds big , huh ? Well , I can use it , and I earned it and ? " He broke off and pushed back from the bar . " What is this , " he growled , " a lecture ? " He made noises in his throat . " How do you like the party ? " Murdock said he liked it and , picking up the remainder of his drink , moved to the wrought-iron balcony railing . The piano-player was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blue dress was still in the same air , her position unchanged . Even her attitude seemed e same : aloof , superior . She acted as if she were sulking , et did not look the type . And she was still alone . For a moment Murdock watched her , noticing that her ze was fixed upon Howard Archer , who stood in one the open windows , his arm linked with Mrs. Redeld 's ; then he turned and went down five steps , carpeted green , with an exaggerated thickness . Most of the living-room furniture was modern , either arp-cornered or flagrantly rounded . The chair the girl d chosen , in the corner behind the piano , was , however , ore conventional and so deeply cushioned he could not 11 how tall she was . As he approached he saw that he . d been right about her hair . Ash-blond , it escaped ing straight by the merest trace of a natural wave . It as pulled back , hiding two-thirds of the ears , so that e was not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pale-blue dress looked soft and heavy and shiny . here was a little jacket which reminded him of a vest ithout buttons .  | In the artificial light her skin had an outdoor , an almost dusky tan . The cheek-bones were prominent and made shadow spots ; the mouth was wide , full-lipped . In spite of the good clean jaw-bone he saw that the mouth was sulky , had about it a set expression that seemed to complement the fixed and smoldering stare . She did not seem to see the people or be conscious of the group . Certainly she did not see Murdock as he stopped beside the , chair . " Hello . " He bowed slightly . " Hello . " The girl did not look up ; her voice was flat , disinterested . Murdock 's brows lifted . He noticed that she had nice hands . Her nails were natural . " Can I get you a drink ? " " No , thanks . " Still the girl did not look up . This time her voice was cold , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown started to work at the corners of his eyes . " Are you alone by choice or ? " " By choice . " This time the voice held a definite undercurrent of annoyance . The eyes did not shift their gaze . Murdock felt the flush that tinged his lean face . His eyes narrowed slightly . There it was . He asked for it and he got it . He did not mind the answer , the implication that he was intruding and unwelcome ; but he resented the tone . The brief thought of trying to laugh off his admitted embarrassment fled before this resentment . He straightened up , found his voice stiff , sardonic , when he spoke .  | " Sorry . I should n't have made the mistake . But , you see , I came late . I thought it was one of those parties where you can speak to anyone and at least be sure of a reasonable courtesy . " The girl 's eyes , sullen , then uncertain , came up and caught his . He saw that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was something sharp and clean and honest in her face which the make-up could not hide . Then he turned and moved towards the terrace windows . Howard Archer spoke and stepped aside to let Murdock pass . Rita Redfield offered her hand . Murdock hel it and said : " Mark did a swell job today . " " It 's about time . What we need is bigger and better crime waves . " Archer , tall and blond above his gleaming shirt-front , . oking like something out of a polite drawing-room ovie , touched his pointed mustache with a thumb-nail d said : " It 's the Shylock in her , " in a languid drawl . , . Rita Redfield was beautiful , dark , and society  --  or merly so . Dressed in a brown velvet gown that molded 11 , high-breasted figure and set off her well-modeled , rrogant , neck and shoulders , she was a showy brunette , een years younger than her husband . Beautiful in perficial , jaded way , her make-up was the work of expert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguising the selfish mouth , e haughty lift of the trim brows . Murdock smiled , turned his head . The girl in the blue ess had returned her stare to Archer , but as Murdock atched , the eyes shifted to meet his . The nod he gave r was like his smile : good-humored now , but with a  | touch of mockery . He let go of Rita Redfield 's hand and moved out to the terrace . The night was cool , yet soft . There was no moon , but countless stars combated the darkness and made it blue instead of black . Below , the river was wide and shiny black , splashed here and there with a sheen from the light-studded arcs of Harvard and Longfellow bridges , the huge electric clock on the other bank . Murdock moved slowly down the length of the terrace , working his way through a confusion of wicker chairs and having a hard time identifying their temporary occupants . He found Nate Girard leaning against the railing at the far end . There was a woman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that , with her dark dress , the only discernible feature was her blond bobbed hair . Moving to the rail , Murdock leaned there beside her . " Hello , Hestor . " " Oh , hello . " There was no welcome or interest in the voice . Girard turned . " I told Hestor you were here . " Murdock did not answer . He took out his cigarettecase , offered it to the woman , who refused . Girard was smoking a cigar . Murdock lit his cigarette , inhaled . An awkward silence closed in and he let his thoughts idle for a minute or so as he smoked ; finally he jerked them back to the focusing-point he had decided upon . He did not feel like arguing . Neither did he intend to drift like this indefinitely . His thoughts shot off on a tangent and touched briefly the girl in the blue dress . Something about her attracted him ; he felt this in spite  | of his irritation at her manner , regretted somehow his stiff , churlish speech . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably argue about going with him ; before he got through she 'd lose her temper . It would be difficult , he knew that . Seeing her here with Girard was what had made up his mind to try again . Perhaps she would be more inclined to agree this time . Anyway He said : " Could I borrow my wife for a while ? " Girard laughed softly . " Why  --  certainly . " " I 'll bring her back , " Murdock added dryly . Hestor Murdock turned towards her husband , but he could not read the expression in her face , which in this light was just a flesh-colored oval . He thought she was going to speak , but she remained silent until Girard withdrew ; then she said , indifferently : " Is it a game ? " with an accent obviously cultivated . Murdock took her by the arm . " I want to talk to you . " " All right . " Then , as he drew her towards the nearest window , her voice showed pique . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , where , then ? " " Downstairs . In my apartment . " Murdock kept the pressure on her elbow and they stepped into the living-room . She moved more readily there until they reached the entrance foyer . Here she stopped short , faced him . " If you think I 'm going down there to talk about divorce ? " " Listen . " Murdock 's lean face was sombre , his eyes humid . " I want to talk to you , and I 'm not going to do it  | here . " He glanced at his strap-watch . The hands showed two-twenty and he said : " This party is good for a couple hours . You wo n't miss anything . Fifteen minutes or so is not going to spoil your night , is it ? Or am I unreasonable to suppose ? " " Oh , all right . " Hestor Murdock flashed a look of impatient exasperation , whirled away from him . Murdock stepped in front of her and opened the door . 3 MURDOCK 'S APARTMENT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor , rear . Hestor stopped just inside the door as Murdock closed it , and it was apparent that her impatience had not lessened as she spoke . " Well ? " Murdock achieved a grin , made an effort to be pleasant . " Relax , " he said . " I ca n't talk to you this way . How about a drink ? " " I 've been drinking champagne . I 'll wait . " Murdock 's brows lifted ; then suddenly the grin broadened and it paid dividends in the form of a grudging smile from Hestor . She shrugged , moved across the room to the worn , comfortable-looking divan , and sat down . " All right , " she continued . " I 'm relaxed  --  or I will be when you give me a cigarette . " Murdock held a light for her , blew out the flame , and bent the paper match between his thumb and first two  | fingers . He walked across the room , wheeled , returned to the divan , and stood there spread-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nee Schultz , came from a coal-mining town in Pennsylvania . By virtue of a figure which would have done for a torso by Gaudier , by practice in dancing , plus a fair voice , she had worked herself up through burlesque to the front row of the chorus . It was there that Murdock had first seen her . He realized she had changed but little since then . Thirty , he thought . Plump , but upon close inspection , plump in the right places . And the gown , black and of a material that was something like sequins only finer  --  a sort of metallic cloth  --  was typical , somehow . Showy . Like Rita Redfield . The difference was that Rita 's showiness was on a higher plane because she was born that way and did not have to work her way up from small-town squalor . Hestor 's hair was yellow-blond , real yellow ; and it had been waved so that it seemed to stick sleekly to her head . But it was frowsy in the morning ; he remembered that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensuous character of her face , the droop of her lips . And she was smart , with the smartness of a woman who had been around in the world and had suffered somewhat from the contact . Yet it was her body that remained her chief asset . The tightness of the gown , and the way the light reflected from the metal cloth , accentuated the mounds of her breasts and reminded him that it was this body , dancing in the front row of a musical-comedy chorus , that had attracted him . He was aware of it now . " Well ? "  | She broke in on his thoughts and he realized that she was watching him with a tolerant , half-amused gaze . He colored slightly , but spoke doggedly of the idea which was again foremost in his mind . " Why not call it off ? A divorce will ? " Hestor Murdock stiffened slightly . " I was enjoying myself , " she said irritably and her eyes were sulky . " You pick a nice time to bring that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it is . " " You may not always be so well satisfied . " " It will be time enough then . " She started to get up . Murdock reached out and , without pushing , kept her from rising . He said : " Wait . " She did not force the issue . Instead she settled herself again , puffed lazily at her cigarette , and watched him through the blue haze that hung between them . To Hestor , Kent Murdock was a paradox . He was hard , yet mixed with this hardness was a certain refinement of feeling that she could not understand . He was intelligent , well educated ; yet he was a newspaper photographer and he liked his job . She hated him , yet she liked him . Even now he was attractive to her . Good-looking , with a knack of wearing clothes well , he had a masculine vitality that had found a responsive chord in her from the first . Their marriage had been a mistake . But she did not regret it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that she could not hold him . Not that it mattered . She was better off now , much better off . His weekly payments added to what she made with her radio program enabled her to live as she had dreamed of living  | in her burlesque days . And  --  she had told herself this before  --  this marriage was only an experiment ; an expedient , rather . She had known girls in the chorus who had married well , profitably . Such had been her intention  --  to wait until she could be sure of the financial success of such a venture . If she could have the thrill of it at the same time , so much the better . But given the security , she could find other outlets for a nature high-strung with passion . Circumstances changed her plans decisively . When Love Song opened in Boston , an immediate marriage had no place in Hestor 's thoughts . But when it closed on Saturday night after a week 's try-out and the company disbanded , she had seized the only chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette to her mouth  --  she did not seize it , she made that chance . She had met Kent Murdock at a party after the opening performance on the preceding Monday . She liked him , and she encouraged him ; during that week he had taken her out nearly every night after the performance . Yet she had no false ideas about his interest . He wanted a good time ; he had sufficient money to spend . She made herself good company . But she had experienced that sort of thing before . When the show moved on , the affair would be forgotten . Only this time the show would not move on . And at the time she had her rent paid in New York for a month , and little else . The show business was in the doldrums . There were no angels , no suitable offers of marriage in sight . She remembered that Saturday night the show closed . They 'd had supper after the performance and gone on  | to a speak-easy . She had taken the reins from her affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , she remembered . And it had been she who suggested they get married  --  after she was sure that the half-dozen drinks and her methods had made him forget any resolve or inhibition about her he may have had sober . . . . His voice checked her thoughts abruptly . " I 'm perfectly willing to keep on paying you  --  as alimony . " Hestor Murdock ground out her cigarette in an ashtray . " What , " she drawled , " is the reason for the rush ? " " Rush ? " Murdock scowled wrinkles into the bridge of his nose . " We 've been separated over a year . I 've asked you before . " " I know . But casually . Maybe you 've lined up number two . " Murdock waited a moment before he answered . When he continued , his voice was level . " There 's no one else . The point is , I want to know where I stand . We made a mess of things . We both may want another chance some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation rising again as she reflected how she could not hold him . The marriage was an expedient , yes ; but with Murdock , because his virile hardness had attracted her , she had looked upon the venture with some excitement . It was to be a thrill . And into marriage she had brought a magnificent body , a well-sexed nature , and nothing at all of the giveand-take attitude . To her it was a physical , sexual thing ; that and nothing more . Murdock had failed her there . She knew that he looked with only partly concealed disdain upon her repeated demands , and she hated him  | for it . For the last month of their life together he had not slept with her . And there was no other woman at the time . Well  --  she tightened her lips and moved erect on the davenport  --  let him squirm . She was in no hurry . She could be free of him soon enough if it became necessary . Meanwhile she found that her married status helped her with other men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attentive . Murdock knew he was losing his plea . He had long since accepted his part in the fiasco . He did not blame her for the failure . He had never been quite sure who had suggested the crazy idea of running off to get married in the first place . Probably he did . It did not matter now . In any case it had been an impulsive act . He regretted it and he expected to pay . But he saw no reason for continuing an arrangement that held no advantage , in his mind , for either of them . He held stubbornly to his plan . " Why nurse it along ? " Hestor stood up , her expression bored , weary . " I 've missed enough of the party already . I want to get back . Nate 'll be looking for me . " Murdock did not move . He just stood there facing her , standing close to her now that she had risen . His lean face was sullen , his eyes brooding . He said : " Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice was cynical ? " you get thirty-five . That part is okay , but if you think I 'm going to keep paying without getting anything for it ? " " You get your freedom , do n't you ? " Hestor 's voice thinned out . " No . I get the right to live alone , but ? "  | " That ought to be enough . It 's what you wanted . " " Only partly . I 've tried to be fair , to do the decent thing , to give you grounds and pay all expenses  --  and what does it get me ? Spite . " Hestor 's blue eyes blazed . " I  --  m entitled to something , " she snapped , and her accent slipped back to the chorus . " I do n't want a compromise . " " All right . " Hestor hesitated , measured him with her eyes , and one penciled brow arched as she studied him . " If you want to pay , I 'll give you your divorce . " Murdock waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You expect to pay , do n't you ? " Hestor pressed . " Certainly . I told you I 'd keep on ? " " You 'll do better than that . Suppose you lose your job ? I 'm not taking any chances . But I 'll sell you the divorce . For ten thousand in cash we 'll forget about the alimony and ? " " I have n't got that much , and you know it . " " Get it , then . It ought to be a bargain . " " It is , " Murdock said , and his voice was sharp with anger and exasperation . " But how ? " " Oh , it is ? " Hestor smiled at him , but her eyes were bright and glaring . " Then either get it or let it ride , and you 'll pay anyway . Mark Redfield drew the contract , and it ought to be good . I do n't need the money , but I like getting it , because " ? her voice rose ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I married you . " Murdock 's jaws went white at the corners , and his lips drew tight . " Do n't be cheap . " " Cheap ? " Hestor was white and shaking and her accent  | was somewhere between the coal mines and burlesque . " You go to hell ! " She seemed to choke on the sentence . Her hands drew into fists at her sides , and Murdock thought for a moment she was going to strike out at him . He stared at her , incredulous . " Who do you think you are ? " she demanded , her white , rigid face thrust close to his . " I 'm not good enough for you , is that it ? " Murdock said : " That is n't what I ? " " Oh , yes it is . I 'm cheap . Because I gave you what I thought most men wanted ? " " Hestor ! " Murdock 's face was taut . " What you need is a woman with the same narrow ideas as yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will make you sleep alone and let you come to her once a month to ? " Hestor 's voice shrilled . The sort of voice which held all its nuances in the early stages , it had nothing left for emphasis but to talk louder and louder . And Murdock stood there rigidly , his face gray and stiff-lipped until Hestor ran out of breath . Still shaking and infuriated , her outburst stopped as abruptly as it had begun . As she caught her breath , there was a silent instant when she seemed to relax from reaction ; then she twisted , shouldered past him . Murdock caught her at the door and got his hand on the knob . Those two or three seconds ' respite were enough to tighten his grip on himself . He had failed again . He always failed  --  with her . No matter how he approached her , he was wrong . Regardless of his intentions to argue reasonably , he ended up saying the wrong  | things . Or would that make the difference ? She held the whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not take it . Perhaps because he had never , from the first week or so , respected her . Wrongly or rightly , that was the case . And maybe she sensed this . Probably she did . Then there was nothing to be gained by mere talk . She held the advantage and she could continue to hold it until such a time as it pleased her to compromise for reasons of her own . He took a breath and stiffened there as he took his last chance . " I 'm going to get clear . " His voice was a bit thick , but level enough to surprise himself as he heard it . " Open the door ! " Her stare was glaring , poisonous . " So far , " he went on slowly , ignoring her command , " I 've sort of taken my medicine . I 'm tired of the taste . If I ca n't give you grounds , maybe I can get them from you . You 've gone about with no interference from me . How often I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper . There were three or four before Girard . And during the trial it was Andrew Sprague . And now Girard is free , he 's back . Well " ? Murdock opened the door ? " if I get evidence I 'll use it . Watch yourself , Hestorl " Hestor Murdock stopped in the hall , turned , and gave him a sweet , bitter smile that was as deliberate as the contempt in the voice , which had recaptured its accent . " Thanks for the advice  --  and the cigarette , darling . " Murdock stood in the open doorway for several seconds after Hestor left . His threat , born of no preconceived idea , stirred his imagination , and a thin little smile re-  | lieved the grim cast of his lean , angular face . He knew Hestor had been chasing around  --  would have known it even if he had not seen her frequent companions , because he knew Hestor . She still wanted a thrill , any kind of a thrill . For the past year she had become a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took on enchantment through the microphone and the manipulations of the radio engineer . He did not know what she earned  --  probably twice what he did . And she could always wear clothes . Now she had the money to buy them . It was absurd to think of her without the companionship of men . Yet heretofore Murdock had not cared . He did not care now . But the idea was worth considering ; in fact ... He stepped into the hall . Hestor was just disappearing in one of the self-operating elevators . He watched it until the door clanged shut . Then , as he stood there , groping for the next step in his new-found idea , a man moved into view at the far end of the hall . The fellow was swinging round the newel post of the front stairs . He was in view but a second , and in that second his eyes caught Murdock 's as he continued his climb . The thin , scrawny figure , something about the momentary glimpse of the white face , brought identification to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose murder Nate Girard had just been acquitted . Murdock pursed his lips , seemed undecided for a moment . There was nothing actually out of the way in Cusick 's being here , and Murdock was so selfishly wound up in his own problem that he abruptly dismissed the  | man from his thoughts . He stepped back into the room , crossed to the telephone stand near the doorway leading to the bedroom hall . He found the number he wanted in the telephone book , asked for it abruptly . He had to wait two or three minutes before a sleepy voice answered . He said : " Fenner ? Kent Murdock  --  yeah . Listen , you busy ? " The voice muttered a curse , growled : " I 'm in bed , you cluck . " Murdock grunted impatiently . " Sure , but are you busy ? " " How can I be busy when ? " " Skip it and listen . I 've got a little job for you . " " For yourself ? " This incredulously . " Now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get over here  --  right away . " Fenner groaned , finally said : " All right , all right . Keep your pants on . " " Right away ! " Murdock repeated sharply , then an undertone of grim amusement crept into his voice . " And listen . I 'm expecting a cut rate . " 4 JACK FENNER WAS a slim , wiry young man with a pale , wedge-shaped face and alert agate eyes . When Murdock let him into his apartment twenty minutes later , his newlooking blue suit showed no signs of hurried dressing ; his red and blue striped tie sat neatly on a clean shirt ,  | and his black oxfords were well polished . He pulled up the tails of a worn gray topcoat and dropped a somewhat battered felt hat in his lap as he sat down in the wing chair . " What 's the job ? " Murdock moved in front of the chair and looked down at Fenner for a moment without speaking . Then he took the cigarette from his mouth , studied the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh . " Fenner looked down at his hat , back at Murdock . " And what 's the sweat ? You know where she is tonight ? " " She 's upstairs . Girard is throwing a little party at Redfield 's place . She 's with him . " Fenner pursed his lips thoughtfully . " I thought you were divorced . " " Just separated . " " Pay her anything ? " " Sure . " " And you want to get out from under . " " I do n't mind paying , but I want the divorce . " " Why wo n't she give you one ? " " Damned if I know ; maybe it 's a complex . " Murdock walked across the room , turned , and came back . He pulled a straight-backed chair around to face Fenner and sat down . " Maybe it 's a lousy trick , putting a private dick on her , but ? " Fenner 's lips twitched in a smile . " I resent that . You do n't think much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a bunch of chiselers . " Murdock smiled . " But you 're the best of the bunch and ? "  | " All right , all right . " Fenner returned the smile . " You want evidence . " He cocked one eyebrow . " We do n't have to frame anything ? " Murdock shook his head . " Framing is out . Straight or not at all . " Fenner looked relieved . " What did you marry her for in the first place ? " Murdock did not resent the question because he knew Fenner 's interest was friendly rather than professional . They had known each other for a long time and each had helped the other at times in the past . He found himself unburdening some of the tangled thoughts that , pent up for so long , sought and accepted an outlet . " I do n't know . It was just one of those things where you do something and then wish to hell you had n't the next day . A mistake , that 's all , and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , fastened there . " She came here with the Love Song  --  it opened here . I happened to get in on the first night and there was a party afterwards . I met her , and I gave her a rush . It was just a good time  --  so I thought . And she , well ? " " I know , " Fenner said dryly . " I saw the show . She was a looker and she was built . " " I had a good time , all right , " Murdock went on , " but that 's all I figured on . I knew the show was moving on to New York and I thought that would be the end of it . Understand , I never was serious about her . I had a date with her Saturday night . The show folded . She was sort of worked up , down . And I picked that time to go soft . We had a few drinks and somebody  --  probably me  --  said :  | ' Let 's get married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone grew amused in a grim sort of way . " We tried it for three months . But it just did n't work . She was a damn good-looking woman , and she was built . When you say that , you 're through . " " You 're kinda bitter about it , " Fenner said . " Not about that part . It was my mistake . I 'm bitter about the rest of it . I told her I 'd give her grounds . She did n't want it that way . So we got Redfield to draw up a little agreement  --  you can see what a sap I was in those days  --  and we separated . " " She wo n't sell out ? " " For ten thousand , and I do n't think she 's interested in the installment plan . " Fenner looked down at the polished tips of his oxfords , spoke without lifting his head . " What 've you been waiting for ? You got another girl that ? " " No ! " rapped Murdock . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But to hell with all this ! What 's the matter , you guys got a new code of ethics or something ? I give you a job and ? " " Okay ! " Fenner grinned and stood up . " I 've seen her around . She 's been stepping some . We can do . Only I was just interested , Kent . For a photographer , you 're not a bad guy , and I wondered how you tangled in the first place . " Murdock glanced at his strap-watch . " It 's five of three . The party wo n't last much longer , so you 'd better go downstairs and wait . " He moved to the door with Fenner , and the detective said :  | " I 'll see what happens when she goes home and call you . Murdock went back to the wing chair , picked up a copy of the Courier from the magazine stand . A fourcolumn head said : GIRARD ACQUITTED JURY OUT 4 HOURS He took out a cigarette , put it in his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , dropped it in an ash-tray . He picked up a stubby brier with a scarred bowl and a mouthpiece nearly obliterated by tooth marks . Filling the pipe from a silk and rubber pouch , he struck a match , sucked slowly in deep puffs until he had an even light . Then , tamping the top with a match-box , he puffed gently , cuddling the smoke in his lips , and pushed down in the chair . The shrill of the telephone woke Murdock some time later . He saw he had remembered to put aside his pipe , but he had no recollection of falling asleep . Pulling himself erect with a groan , he arched his neck to eliminate the kinks and crossed to the telephone . When he growled : " Hello , " Fenner said : " They 're over at her apartment . " Murdock glanced at his watch , saw that it was nearly five o'clock . " They left Redfield 's at three-thirty and came straight here . " Murdock said : " What 's the rest of it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girard has n't come out . " " Stick around another half-hour and then go on home . " " Okay , " said Fenner . " It looks like we 're making  | some progress . " Murdock hung up , went back to the chair , and sat down . He did not feel the satisfaction he expected . To suspect Hestor was one thing , to have proof another . And he was uneasy in his mind now that he had taken the first step . There was something cheap and tawdry about the whole thing . That he was a party to the plot irritated him . He hoped he would not have to go through with it . Perhaps if he could build up a case-book of several such instances , Hestor would change her mind ; they would not have to drag the evidence  --  his part of it  --  into court . He leaned forward in the chair and ran lean fingers through his thick , straight , brown hair . It was tousled now , standing on end at the back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his collar ; his shirtfront was buckled and wrinkled . For several minutes he sat there like that , immobile ; then he stood up and went out to the kitchenette . From a pantry shelf he took a bottle of Scotch , nearly full , and a glass . He turned on the faucet in the sink , let it run while he poured an inch and a half of whisky into the glass . He tossed this down with a single movement , took a swallow of water , and then replaced the bottle . He began to unbutton his waistcoat with one hand and pull at his tie with the other as he moved towards the bedroom . The whisky felt warm in his stomach . It erased the thick , sticky taste in his mouth , but his head was still fogged . As soon as he undressed he went into the bathroom , stood there for a moment like a man drugged and incapable of thought .  | He brushed his teeth , then scowled at himself in the medicine-cabinet mirror . He finally took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not go to bed at all . He never got any rest that way ; such a procedure always made him feel logy for the balance of the day . His thoughts stalled while he shaved , and then , with the remains of the lather still on his face , he turned on the shower , adjusted the spray to the proper warmth . The shower bath was a combination arrangement , set in the tub , which was placed in one corner of the room . Murdock , facing the doorway , drew the circular-hung shower curtain just enough to keep the floor dry and stood there with his hands behind him , soaking up the warmth until he heard a sudden clicking noise , the sound of a door opening . His first thought was that he had not locked the apartment door . His eyes darted to the full-length mirror which made one side of the bathroom door and which reflected , from its present angle , a narrow rectangle of the living-room . He heard the door slam , and reached back to turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of a girl  --  a bareheaded girl with a blue evening dress and a loose wrap that was open and swirled around her as she stopped abruptly and stared about . Sheer surprise robbed Murdock of logical thought . For a moment he just stood there and stared at the blond vision he had last seen in Redfield 's apartment . Then the girl 's eyes met his in the mirror . The eyes widened . She turned and ran out of his range of vision . Murdock managed to turn off the shower . He heard  | the soft thud of running feet and pulled the shower curtain about him just as she dashed through the bathroom door . For a long moment they stared at each other , the girl white-faced , frightened , Murdock holding the shower curtain at his waist and peering incredulously at her through the V opening at his face . He had no warning at all for what happened next . He opened his mouth , started to speak . The mouth stayed open . The girl leaped directly towards him , stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continuous movement that he made no effort to forestall , she yanked the wet curtain from his grasp , ducked in behind him , her body close to his ; then she pulled the curtain around them both . " Turn the water on ! " she gasped . " Please ! " Murdock obeyed without conscious thought . The water came down in a deluge . He heard it pounding on the girl 's wrap and she leaned close , her folded hands touching his back . In spite of the warmth of the shower the hands felt like ice and there was a tingle , a quick contraction of Murdock 's skin all over his body before she said : " The curtain ! " Murdock took a new hold on the gaping curtain and pulled it together just as the living-room door banged back against the wall . He heard a man 's voice an instant before a tall , stiff-looking fellow in a loose-fitting topcoat dashed across the living-room and was mirrored briefly in the bathroom door . The man disappeared , came back a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , his glance touched Murdock , fastened upon him .  | Seconds later Lieutenant Bacon of the Homicide Squad rushed into the bathroom , slid to a stop on the tile threshold . " You seen a girl , Kent ? " he lipped . " When ? " Murdock said , and with the recovery of his composure his tone was guileless . " Now , damn it ! She got off at this floor and ? " Bacon broke off , dashed down the little hall . Murdock heard him barking profane commands to some unseen associates until the pounding of the water obliterated the voice . Murdock stood there rigidly and felt the chilled pressure of the girl 's hand on his shoulders . Not until now did he feel any embarrassment . But it did not last and he finally managed to say : " Well , what do we do now ? " " Wait , " the girl whispered . " What happened ? " " I do n't know . " " You do n't know ? " " No . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body tense against his as Bacon 's voice cut in on them again . The Lieutenant stopped in the doorway . " I 'm gon na take a look around . She might 've sneaked in while you were here . You wouldn't 've heard her . " Murdock said : " Go ahead . " But when Bacon disappeared he did not dare risk speaking again , so he waited until the Lieutenant returned . " Well , she ai n't here , that 's a cinch . " Bacon hesitated , pushed back his felt hat , and surveyed Murdock with eyes that were steady , and gray , like his hair . " You 're one  | of those early risers , huh ? " he said . " I have n't been to bed . " " There was a party upstairs in Redfield 's place . " Bacon pushed aside his coat-tails and put balled fists on his hips . " Maybe you were in on it ? " " I was there for a while , yes . " " Hah . " Bacon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked . " That 's swell . I want to talk to you . " " And I want to talk to you , " Murdock said , and made his voice flat . " What 's this girl gag ? Ca n't I take a bath without some cop busting in and ? " " Come on , " Bacon cut in . " This ought to interest you , it 's right down your alley . " Murdock nodded , unperturbed . " Okay . " The girl was all right now . He did not have any answers , but he found room amid the race of his disordered thoughts to remember his last conversational exchange with this girl upstairs . Now a sliver of grim humor knifed through his brain . " Okay . Wait 'll I take a cold one . " He reached for the shower control as he spoke and turned it to COLD . The result was an icy torrent that stiffened him and pushed his breath through his teeth . He heard the girl gasp , felt her fingers contract . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Bacon lingered in the doorway . Murdock said : " There 's some Scotch in the kitchen cupboard . Pour one if you like while I 'm getting dressed . " Bacon grunted , and disappeared in the hall . Murdock pulled open the shower curtain , stepped out of the tub , and caught up a towel . The girl yanked the curtain  | around her as he turned and moved out of her sight to one side of the opening . When he had rubbed down , he wrapped the towel around his waist and went into the bedroom . When Murdock stepped into the living-room a few minutes later , Bacon got up from the davenport . He waited silently , his eyes slightly narrowed as Murdock approached . " So you were at the party ? What time did you leave ? " " Around two-thirty  --  two-twenty , I guess it was . What about it ? " " But you have n't been to bed ? " Bacon 's tone was skeptical , but not unpleasant . " I fell asleep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued irritably : " And I do n't like riddles . " " Neither do I , but ? " " Then why do n't you speak your piece ? Who 's the girl ? What ? " " I do n't know yet , " Bacon said slowly , " but I 'll find out . You got a camera here ? " " I got one I can use in a pinch . " Murdock 's scowl remained fixed and he reached for a cigarette . " Get it . " " Why ? " " Because I 'm going to get big-hearted and give you the break you 're all the time yelling for . Somebody knocked off Mark Redfield in his apartment . " " When ? " Murdock 's eyes widened as doubt and uncertainty surged through him . " Tonight  --  this morning . " " Murdered . " The word was more of a statement than  | a question , and Bacon nodded , adding dryly : " Get the camera and come on . " 5 SHE WAITED THERE in the shower for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shivering now . The dress was a clammy , clinging mass weighed down by the pressure of the water-soaked wrap . And it was not alone this that made her shiver . The chill was mental , built squarely upon fear and panic and desperation . Under pressure the nerves held their necessary taut pitch . With the reaction they were frayed . She felt weak and more frightened than ever . She finally pulled aside the shower curtain with a slow deliberate movement that was soundless . Water trickled from the soaked mass of her hair , oozed into her brows and down the back of her neck . She could hear the dripdrip of the drops in the residue in the tub , could feel them splash on her ankles . There was no other sound but her own breathing , and her courage returned slowly , warming her and bringing assurance . She finally moved out from under the curtain and , still standing in the tub , peeled the sodden wrap from her shoulders . The little jacket stuck . She had to twist out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she undid the shoulder-fastening . She stepped out of it , avoiding its touch as if it were the only wet thing about her .  | Looking about the white , bare confines of the room , she saw there was a clean face-towel on a rack beside the washbowl , but no bath-towel . Doing the best she could with what she had , she began to rub her hair , continuing until the little towel was soaked . She shook her head then , neck arched back , until the hair settled to her satisfaction ; then she sat down on the edge of the tub , pulled off her pumps , and peeled down her stockings . Dressed now in a brassiere and brief silken shorts that were as tight as her skin , she started to remove them , thought better of it , and stepped down to the bath-mat . She pattered into the hall , found a narrow closet between the bathroom and bedroom doors . Armed with a turkish towel of huge proportions , she went back to the bathroom and stripped off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance then , spending most of the time on her hair , rubbing it , massaging it until her arms were tired and she was out of breath . When she had finished she moved to the medicinecabinet and peered into its glass . Her face had a ruddy , freshly scrubbed look about it and she continued to study herself until she was able to smile . It was not much of a smile , but it helped . Even when she stepped back , traces of it remained at the corners of her eyes . She glanced into the tub , frowned , and , remembering the outer door , ran into the livingroom holding the towel about her breasts with one hand . She opened the door a crack , pressed the locking button . When she closed it she gave a little sigh of relief and relaxed her hold on the towel . Slowly she moved into the bedroom and opened the  | closet door . On a hook on the inside of the panel was a dressing-gown of green flannel . Tossing the towel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of her , measuring it . Poised there , her feet a few inches apart and her arms stiff and angling upwards , the even thoroughness of her tan was at once apparent . Only at the hips and for an inch or so at the small of her back , was the skin white . From a little distance she looked like an i Indian with a brief white bathing-suit . She turned quickly and slipped into the robe , knotting the wide strap tightly and turning up the sleeves until she found her hands . Then she faced the mirror on top of the maple chest of drawers and grinned at herself . The grin died abruptly as her thoughts leaped from the moment to the reason for her being here . Her eyes widened . Trouble filmed them and settled over her . She had come back , but even now she did not know She spun quickly about , searched the room with a quick glance , and moved into the hall and living-room . Her eyes found the telephone just inside the door . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jerky voice . i . ' Fear , cold and gnawing , seeped into her brain . The operator said : " I 'm ringing Charlesgate 8974 . " " Keep ringing . There must be someone there . " She waited and tension gripped her until her muscles ached and her breath caught in her throat . She could hear the distant intermittent buzzing of the other telephone and began to count the rings . Then a sharp click knifed through one of those silent pauses . She said : " Hello , hello , " breathlessly . An interminable second or two later a man 's voice ,  | which was low and sounded irritable and thick with sleep , said : " Hello . " She gasped : " Howard ? " The voice said : " Hello . Yes  --  what  --  " She clicked down the receiver arm with her index finger and relaxed , propped there against the wall , lowering the two parts of the instrument until her arms were straight down . For a moment or two she stood there while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became regular again . Then she lifted the instrument , replaced the receiver , and gently set it on the stand . Even then she remained standing and the sequence of the drama unrolled before her mind quickly , but with the clearness of a slow-motion film . The whole idea had been silly , an impulsive course of action born of anger and worry . It would have been better , she told herself , if she had not come back . Luck  --  that and nothing else had allowed her to escape . She exhaled slowly and in relief , let her eyes drift around the room . In spite of her keyed-up nerves she was aware that she liked it , and this thought led her to Kent Murdock . She had learned his name before she left Redfield 's apartment ; there was a touch of shame in her memory that brought back the details of their first meeting . She had been a boor , an unmannerly little brat . She walked to the windows at the end of the room . Over the river the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings on the other bank with a leaden , colorless brush ; the Technology buildings looked gray and cold and austere . Turning , she moved  | back to the wing chair and switched off the floor lamp I beside it . From a jade box she took a cigarette , lit it , and sank into the chair . She drew her feet up under her and snuggled down in the robe . She liked the way he reacted to the emergency . e had been perfect , natural and at ease with the policesnan . Even that cold shower . She felt warm and safe enough now to look upon that Impish gesture with amusement , to understand the sense of humor which prompted him to take advantage of her . 6 THE PLAIN-CLOTHESMAN at the door stood aside and Murdock followed Lieutenant Bacon through the entrance foyer and into the living-room . Another plainclothesman , who was walking idly about , stopped idling ' long enough to notice them , then he continued to the terrace windows and looked out . The place was otherwise deserted , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bar still stood in the dining-room , its mirror and decorative bottles intact . Apparently no effort had been made to tidy up : glasses of all shapes and sizes were everywhere , glasses and overflowing ash-trays . Bacon continued on to a doorway on the right wall , and Murdock found himself in a comfortably furnished pine-paneled and book-filled room . He put his little camera-case and tripod just inside the door . Mark Redfield lay on his side , one arm doubled under  | him and the other outstretched above him , pillowing his head . There was something horribly unfamiliar about the limp and boneless set of the limbs that spoke of death as surely as a coroner 's verdict . His heavy face , curiously white now , was relaxed , peaceful . Upon the wrinkled shirt-front was a wide red stain reaching down towards the floor and disappearing in his waistcoat . At the upper edges of the stain was a gray-black smudge . Murdock took in the picture of death at a glance and caught his lower lip between his teeth as he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a fingerprint man and a photographer from headquarters , Sergeant Keogh , and a thickset , sullen-looking fellow who sat on the window-seat between the bookcases , nursing a grudge and a somewhat battered face . Keogh said , " Where 'd you pick him up ? " and nodded a greeting to Murdock . " He lives here , " grunted Bacon . Murdock said : " Hello , Tom . " Keogh grinned , added : " That 's swell , another suspect already , huh ? " Bacon took off his hat , wiped his forehead , put the hat on again , and pushed it back . He nodded to Keogh . " Take this down . " Then , to Murdock : " Now , who was here ? " Keogh took out a little black notebook and a pencil . Murdock named those he knew at the party , and Bacon asked : " That all ? " Murdock shook his head . " Another half-dozen or so besides the entertainers , but I do n't know their names . " Bacon grunted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bothering him ; he was careful to speak casually , a bit lightly . " What 's the girl trouble you were all steamed up about ? " " I wish I knew . " Bacon shook his head . " The telephone operator on the desk downstairs saw her come in about four-thirty , maybe a little later . She had a blue dress and a dark cloak ; a blonde and a looker . But we did n't know about it until it was too late . She was hiding in a closet in the foyer . Mahady , out in the other room , caught a glimpse of her sneaking past the door . She caught the elevator and went down to the lobby . I was down there and she must 've figured me as a copper because she jumped right back in the car . It stopped at your floor . I think she 's still in the building . " Bacon grunted and his lips tightened . " If she is , she wo n't get out today . " Murdock 's voice got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he killed ? " " Between four and four-thirty , we think . " Murdock exhaled slowly , but it must have sounded something like a sigh of relief , because Bacon eyed him sharply and said : " That 's all right with you , huh ? " Murdock avoided his gaze . " Where 's the gun ? " " Have n't found it . " Murdock moved around the body and took out a cigarette as he stopped in front of the thickset man . " Been working you over , Spike ? " " Do n't they always ? " the fellow growled . " He ran into a door , " Keogh said . " Did n't you , Spike ? We found him hiding in a closet in the outside hall . " Keogh cocked one eyebrow at Murdock and spread his  | hands , an expression of mock resignation on his broad Irish face . " He tried to run and when we chased him he goes smack into a door . He ought a know better . " A small man with pince-nez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room with a smile and a cheery " Hello , boys , what 's all this ? " He put down the bag and opened it , glancing at Redfield 's body as he did so . Bacon and Keogh grunted acknowledgments . Murdock nodded . The examiner , sinking to one knee beside the body , spoke as his fingers went through their practiced routine . " Girard got out just in time . Anybody lined up for this ? " " Naw , " growled Bacon . " We just got here . " Keogh moved over to Murdock 's side . " One thing , " he confided , " it 's a break for the force . Without him to defend ' em there 's a lot of mugs around town that 're gon na end up in a cell . He sprung more guilty guys than any three other lawyers in town . " Murdock smiled wryly . " A noble thought . " Keogh said : " Utsnay , " hesitated , added : " Where 's the camera ? " Murdock moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a square leather case . Opening it , he took out a flash-gun , a bulb , and a little camera in its own case , about the size of a fifteen-cent can of tobacco . Keogh , who had followed him , asked : " What the hell 's that ? Can you take pictures with it ? " Murdock nodded . " My newspaper stuff is at the office . This is some of my own rig . It 'll take anything . You have  | to enlarge ' em , but it 's twice as fast and ? " " Then why do n't you quit carrying that trunk around and use it all the time ? " " Because " ? Murdock pulled out the tripod ? " never mind . Will you take my word for it or do we have to argue it out ? " Keogh grinned and subsided . Murdock glanced at the examiner , then back at Keogh . He liked the stocky Ser ; geant , liked Bacon , too . They made a good pair , complementing each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray , stiff , with a dry , laconic manner . Keogh had a box-like face , a tough appearance ; he was self-confident , loud , and suspicious of everyone . Neither man was brilliant , neither was spectacular , unduly imaginative , or blessed with more than average intelligence . But in their own line of work , which was often dull and almost always of a routine nature , both were hard , competent , and so honest they leaned over backwards . " It looks like a contact wound , " the examiner said as he straightened up . " I 'll give you the bullet and a full report in the morning  --  today . " " When 'd he get it ? " asked Bacon . " I 'll guess for you . Between three-thirty and fourthirty ; probably about four . It could be suicide except for one thing . " " We have n't got the gun yet , " Keogh broke in . " That is n't what I mean . " The examiner snapped shut his bag and delivered his ultimatum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger of his right hand is broken . Looks as if it had been snapped back . That 's the trigger finger , is n't it ? "  | " Oh . " Bacon scowled , then his eyebrows came up . " We figured there was a scuffle . That cinches it . " Murdock set up his tripod when the examiner left . Bacon cautioned : " Take a couple . The room is okay ; I do n't mind the body , but no close-ups or anything . " He stepped back and his eyes fell on Spike Tripp . " Move , " he added dryly . " Get your picture and the first thing we know you 'll be sayin ' we beat you up . " " I 'll say it anyway , and do n't you forget it . " Murdock took three pictures of the room from various angles , got two more shots of the living-room and diningbalcony from the doorway . As he put away his paraphernalia he said : " Well , I 'm much obliged and ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You got your pictures and now I 'm going to tell you what I know , and I 'll tell you why . " He hesitated , seemed to weigh his words . " In the first place , you 're the only button-pusher  --  the only newspaper guy I know , who do n't clown around with the idea that he can outsmart the whole detective bureau ; you can keep your mouth shut and sometimes you get an idea . In the second place , you were here ; you know most of the people who were here , and you 're already in this mess . But the main reason is that I know you 've got the sort of luck that falls smack into the breaks . And it looks like we 're going to need plenty of it . Come here . " He took Murdock by the arm , led him to the livingroom . Keogh followed them , called to the plain-clothesman and told him to watch Tripp . They moved across  | the living-room to a hallway to the left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the second door on the left . It was a beautifully appointed bedroom done in cream and silver but Murdock was only vaguely aware of this . His eyes fastened on Rita Redfield , who lay fully dressed and sprawled across the modern , low-slung bed . Murdock said : " What 's the matter with her ? " but his gaze did not shift . His lean dark face was somber . " Passed out , if you ask me , " Keogh said . " Do we get the breaks ? " Bacon blew out his breath in an impatient snort . " We could n't wake her . The manager here called in for a doctor . He has n't shown up yet . Come on . " Again he took Murdock 's arm , pulling him down the hall to an adjoining room . The color scheme here was blue : hangings , furniture , walls . On a huge period bed lay another woman  --  a girl , rather . She lay face-down so that the back of a sleek bobbed head , and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief features of her appearance . Murdock recognized her at once as one of the entertainers , a singer , and he was immediately aware from the utterly relaxed position that her trouble was the same as Rita Redfield 's . " Two , huh ? " he said absently , and when Bacon asked who she was , he told what he knew . " Boy , " Keogh breathed , " would I like to get in on a party like this some day . " " Sure , " growled Bacon . " Who would n't ? " He led Murdock back to the library and nodded at the plain-  | clothesman , who withdrew . " Here 's what we got , " he began . " I 'll play ball with you . You 'd better come clean with me . " He began to pace back and forth across the library , head down , chin on chest , talking as he walked . " We get the call from the operator downstairs . He thinks the party broke up about three-thirty . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early mornings , that he 's trained to wake up if anyone comes in or anything . Anyway , the first thing he noticed was the buzz of the switchboard . The light flashed from this apartment . That was about five after four . Now here 's the funny part . " Bacon stopped pacing and faced Murdock , his gray eyes narrowed , thoughtful . " The operator was dozing , see ? Leaning back in his chair . It took him maybe fifteen seconds or so to sit up and reach for the plug , but before he could make the connection the light went out . " Bacon hesitated . Murdock 's gaze slid to the carved , Jacobean desk placed diagonally across one corner of the room , then to Redfield , who lay with his feet about a foot from the edge of the desk . The telephone was placed at this corner . " The kid waited a bit , " Bacon went on , " but the light did n't flash again . He wanted to show that he was there on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't get a connection , so he plugged in , gave the phone a quick ring . Nobody answered . " Bacon moved his right hand in a resigned arc . " So the kid figured it was a mistake . " " You think , " Murdock said slowly , eyes still on the desk , that the phone was knocked off in the scuffle  --  or  | maybe when Redfield was killed ? That the killer picked it up as quick as he could ? " " That 's what I think now . " Murdock nodded at the telephone , then stared at Bacon , who guessed immediately what he meant and shook his head . " No prints . " " How 'd you learn about this ? Who found him ? " " That , " sighed Bacon , " is even funnier . " He doubled his right fist , looked at it , then swung his arm down and clasped both hands behind his back . His voice held an undertone of weary exasperation as he continued . " About four-thirty , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , asked for Redfield 's apartment . He said it was important , so the operator plugged in . He could n't get an answer . The fellow on the wire was insistent . He kept after the kid to ring . And the kid did ring , for about five minutes . He says he could hear Redfield 's phone buzzing . Well , this was only about thirty minutes after the other flash from the apartment . The kid got kind of worried . He finally argued himself into waking the manager . The manager went upstairs and could n't get an answer to the door-buzzer ; he tried the door . It was open and he took a look . " Murdock frowned . " He had a lot of nerve . " " Not so much . He knew that Redfield had let the servants go for the night , and the operator told him about this girl that come in . He was sure she had been at the party in the first place , and he thought she went back there . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that . But still no one answered the phone . "  | Murdock moved to the desk , slid one thigh over the corner , and took out his cigarettes . Keogh had knelt beside Redfield and was looking at the bluish , fractured index finger . Murdock offered him a cigarette , passed the pack to Bacon , who shook his head and kept scowling . " Well , what else have you got ? " Murdock wanted to know . " Besides the girl , " Bacon chafed , " besides the girl and Spike , here " ? he nodded at the still glowering Tripp ? " one other guy came back here . Your friend Howard Archer . " " My friend ? " Murdock 's brows came up . " He came up here , or anyway he came through the downstairs lobby ahead of the girl  --  around four-fifteen . The kid downstairs just got one eye open in time to see him . And get this , the Kid did n't see him go out and ? " Bacon broke off as Mahady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stretcher . The room was silent until the body had been removed . During that time Murdock thought briefly of Archer . A typical man-about-town type , a play-boy , Archer was born to a position in society . His parents had been killed in an automobile accident six months previous , so that he had a small fortune and more freedom than ever to follow his own inclinations , which seemed to revolve about a penchant for first nights , floor tables , and night life in general . There had been at least one breachof-promise suit . It was common knowledge that he had been unduly attentive to Rita Redfield for some time .  | Belonging to the same social set , these two had , in a sense , grown up together . : There had been an interim when Archer was in Europe , and during that time Rita had suddenly married Redfield . The fact that this marriage coincided quite closely with the acquittal of her father from a fraud charge in which he was brilliantly defended by Mark Redfield  --  this fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , gave the gossips something to talk about . Now " So there we are , " Bacon broke in on Murdock 's thoughts . " We 're gon na question everybody that was on this party . But Tripp and ? " " Where does he fit ? " Murdock asked . " Tell him , Spike , " Bacon said . " Nuts , " gasped Tripp . " See ? " Keogh shook his head sadly . " That 's the kind of co-operation we get . " Bacon said , " He 's got a girl friend , " and eyed Tripp sardonically . " He says he came to take her home . I do n't know how he happened to come at four-forty-five , but " Could you check on that ? " Murdock cut in . " Yeah . " " Then how can you hook him up with the job ? " " Plenty of ways , and it 'll work for some of these others , maybe . " Bacon 's voice got thin , sharp , like his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire stairs . And Spike 's just dumb enough  --  if he did have something to do with this  --  to come back in the front way and try and pull it as an alibi or something . " Murdock grinned . " What did you run for ? "  | Tripp lifted sullen eyes . " Who would n't ? " he snarled . " What 's the take in being a punching-bag for a flock of dumb coppers ? I 'm waiting out in the hall when a load of ' em spill out of the elevator . What the hell ? I 'm right by the maid 's closet and I duck . I want to know what it 's about before I get tangled for a fall guy or something . " " Who was this girl you came for ? What did she do ? " " She was a singer . " " What did she look like ? " " Look like ? " For a moment it appeared that the question was beyond Tripp 's powers of comprehension . " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hell , I ? " " What kind of a dress ? " " I do n't know . I did n't bring her . I was just gon na take her home . " Murdock turned to Bacon . " Has he seen that girl out there ? " " No . You do n't believe him , do you ? " " He could be right , " Murdock said dryly . " Why do n't you give him a look . " Mahady stuck his head in the door . " The doc 's out here , the one for the dames . " " Take him out there . Tell him to see if he ca n't snap them out of it so we can talk to them . " He turned to Tripp . " Go on out and take a look . " Bacon muttered a throaty curse , took off his hat again , and mopped his forehead . " You birds , " he fumed , looking at Murdock , " will eat this up . But for us it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hesitated , slapped his hat back on ? " say , whose party was this , anyway ? I got the idea that Girard was so  | tickled he missed the chair that he threw it for Redfield . Or was Redfield all het up about the fifty-thousand fee he tucked away ? " " It was Girard 's party . " " Then what 's it doing here ? " " Have you been through the place ? " Murdock asked flatly . " Sure , " interrupted Keogh . " And what a lay-out . Eight rooms and three baths . " " Well , " Murdock shrugged , " there 's your answer . Room . Girard 's a bachelor and he 's got a small place . " " Yeah . " Bacon pulled at his straight nose . " And I wish , " he added thoughtfully , " I could tie Girard in with this . I 'll check him , all right , but it ca n't be figured . He never spent fifty thousand any better in his life . He owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. A. 'd had his name on the chair just as sure as hell . " Then , and not until then , did Murdock remember . The thought slashed into his brain and left chagrin in its wake . He should have remembered it before and He took a breath , said : " There 's one thing more . " He grinned a bit sheepishly , continued defensively : " And do n't tell me I 've been holding out on you , because it is n't that . I 'm just dumb . Sam Cusick was here tonight . " " Sam ? " Keogh went slack-jawed with amazement . " Well , for ? " Bacon 's face flushed . " Spill it ! " Murdock hurriedly told about the trip to his apartment with Hestor , of seeing Cusick in the hall . " I did n't tie it up , that 's all , " he finished , and meant what he said . " I was thinking about something else then and it did n't  | register much . That 's the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in red leather , dropped into it , a weary and exasperated figure . He took off his hat again , turned it around , shaking his head sadly at it for a moment . Then he looked up at Murdock from under his brows . " All right , " he growled , and clapped the hat back on his head . " I guess I 've got to believe you . And it makes a difference . " He straightened in the chair , and his voice got crisp , decisive . " It hooks up . Girard murders Joe Cusick  --  or , anyway , he got tried for it . And both Cusicks have been after him because he 's the guy that put them away for four years on the extortion rap . And the main reason they got the four years is that Redfield would not take their case . So they hate him for that . They get out a couple of months ago . Girard kills Joe . . . in self-defense , we 'll say . But Redfield is the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never was anything else . So why not ? It 's Girard 's first night out of jail . Sam figures to get Redfield for two things : not taking his case , and springing Girard . By gawd , he 's liable to go gunning for Girard , too . " Bacon came out of the chair , strode to the telephone , and swept it from the desk . A moment later he was barking commands to someone at headquarters . When he hung up he spun about , his face flushed and holding a satisfied expression . " What 'd I tell you about that luck of yours ? " Keogh grunted : " If I had it I 'd ? " but Bacon ignored him and hurried on . " Now we 're getting some place . We 'll pick him up ,  | and when we do ? " He broke off suddenly as Mahady appeared in the doorway . The detective jerked his head backward to ' indicate the presence of someone behind him and came into the room , stepping aside . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the opening . Beside him , and leaning on one arm , was Rita Redfield . Her face was worn and haggard  --  so deathly pale that the lips glared scarlet and the rouge stood out on her cheeks like fever spots . Her eyes were wide , but dull ? the eyes of a woman struggling against extreme weariness or impending sickness . Yet for all of this her chin was up and , somehow , defiant . Bacon moved towards her , took off his hat . " I 'm sorry we " What is it ? " Her voice was flat , lifeless . " You 're from the police ? " Bacon nodded . She said : " But what 's happened ? " and her voice rose . Bacon tightened his lips and took a breath . " It 's your husband . He was shot  --  about an hour ago . " " Shot ? " The word was a husky whisper , but the tone was still flat , indicating that she had not grasped the significance of Bacon 's statement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The body 's been removed . " " Body ? " she echoed hollowly . And then her eyes went very wide , her voice shrilled hysterically . " He 's dead ! " Bacon nodded and Rita Redfield stared at him , spoke just one word . She did not exactly speak it , she whispered it , faintly , almost inaudibly . But the room was so still  | that both syllables were clear-cut , definite : " Howard . " Then her eyelids fluttered . She sighed and Mahady and the doctor caught her as she swayed and slumped forward , unconscious . 7 MURDOCK LET HIMSELF into his apartment with his key . The girl he had left in the shower was curled up in the wing chair , and he saw her facial expression relax with recognition . She waited , motionless , while he set down his photographic gear . He walked over to her , said : " Do you want a drink ? " " If I can have a very short one . " He went into the kitchen and mixed two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , offered her the jade cigarette-box . She accepted and he held a light , then moved the club chair by the windows and sat down . She followed him with her eyes , finally spoke . " Have they found out ? " she said jerkily . " Do they know who did it ? " Murdock shook his head negatively . He put his halfempty glass on a window-sill . " You 'd better tell me about it . " The girl hesitated , looked away . " You mean , how ? why I came here the way I did ? " Murdock did not answer . His face was somber , but there was a trace of a smile at the corners of his eyes as he watched her , sized her up .  | She was more attractive now than she had been upstairs . Her tanned face was clean now , without make-up . ' The lips were just as red , but now they looked soft and ' moist ; her teeth , surrounded by the darkness of her ; ' ; skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ' coldness , had vanished . She was a little girl now , or ; maybe it was the green dressing-gown which swallowed her and made her seem so . She was not a pretty , fluffy , pastel type ; slim , tailored , rather . Young , fresh-looking now , vital , with a vitality that seemed to be smoldering and threatening to break its bonds . For all this , she was utterly feminine ; the folds of his dressing-gown could not hide the curves of her body . It was caught tightly at the waist , he saw , and the long V of the neckline was deep . Shadows played there at the base , softened the rising arches of her firm breast , which , barely visible , curved off into the green flannel . He did not think she was aware that the V was so deep , because when he did not answer and she looked S at him her pose remained natural , completely unaffected . " I came back to the Redfield apartment for my bag , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose it was silly . It was terribly late , I know , but I thought someone would be up . I pressed the buzzer and tried the door . It was open and I stepped inside and ? " Murdock stood up , crossed to the telephone . As he lifted the instrument , the girl sat up in the chair , alarm flooding her face . " What are you going to do ? " " Call the Lieutenant . " " No . You ? "  | " So far I 've trusted you , have n't I ? " Murdock asked flatly . " Of course and ? " " But I ca n't take any more chances if you 're going to lie about it . I 've got to know where I stand . " The flush in the girl 's face was evident in spite of the tan . " All right , " she said weakly . " I thought  --  how did you know ? " Murdock put down the telephone and went back to his chair . He took another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he spoke . " You did n't have a bag when you came here . And the police did n't find anything like that lying around upstairs . " He put down his glass , inhaled , and smoke came out with his words . " You went back and you saw Redfield and you got trapped up there . All right . Now I want to know why you came back . " " To see if Howard was there . " This simply , a statement of fact . " Howard Archer ? " Murdock leaned forward , stared . " Yes . " " Why ? " " Because " ? the girl sighed and her resignation was evident ? " because he 's my brother . I 'm Joyce . " " Oh . " Murdock dragged out the word and leaned back . " I did n't know he had a sister . " Joyce Archer 's shoulders lifted , dropped back . Her tone was slightly bitter . " You would n't , I suppose . I guess I 've been pretty thoroughly forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of humor in the effort . " I 've been abroad for three years . Went to school there . It 's a  | family complex . An uncle in England gave the idea to Mother . Howard was at Cambridge , you know . But I did n't mind being away , because I knew how little my friends got out of staying here and ? " She moved one hand on the chair arm , looked down at it . " But that 's not important . I came back after Father and Mother were killed in the accident . Since then I have n't been in town at all , there was no reason for staying here . Most of my friends are married , and those who are n't " ? she shrugged again ? " bridge and cocktails and dances and a lot of talk about men and sex . " She was genuinely bitter now , her voice sullen , a bit contemptuous . " And none of them doing anything about it . And the men just as bad  --  those that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went to Bermuda , to Block Island , to Oyster Harbors , and had a good time doing nothing but swimming and riding and playing golf . Then a week ago I came back and found Howard running around with Rita Redfield . I know her . " Joyce Archer leaned across the chair arm . She could not have put more emphatic disgust into her words if she had shaken her finger at Murdock . " She 's shallow , she 's mercenary , she 's ? a nymphomaniac . " " You 're pretty positive about it , " Murdock said sardonically . " I understood they were old friends . She never thought much of Redfield , anyway , did she ? " He waited for an answer , but when none came , he added : " If you were so disgusted about it , why did you go to her party ? " " I would n't have , " the girl flared , " if it was n't for  | Howard . I would n't think of going . It was disgusting . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of prison . And the people ! " " Yeh , " Murdock said dryly . " A flashy criminal lawyer , an ex-bootlegger , a newspaper photographer  --  a button-pusher ? " " That is n't what I meant . " The girl colored . " Perhaps not , but ? " " You 're different . " " How ? " " Well , you look like the sort of men I know ; your clothes and  --  well , appearance . But you 're not . You 're different ; maybe it 's because you do things . You even talk ? " " Like a bum , you mean , " Murdock said , grinning . " No . I mean you talk to me one way , and you talked differently to that detective . And upstairs ? " " I 'm versatile that way , " Murdock said dryly . " To you , now , I talk in my own natural jargon . If you heard me when I 'm out on a job you 'd think my antecedents traced back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity  --  when I get out the tails and white tie . But it never gets me anywhere . " He broke off with a sardonic grunt , brought his thoughts back to Joyce Archer 's story . " So you went to the party because he wanted you to . " " I went because he did n't want me to . We had a fight about Rita . I came to cramp his style if I could  --  anyway to see just how bad it was . Howard 's a beast . It was sickening . Actually fighting over her . "  | " Fighting ? " Murdock snapped the word , and his brows came up . " Well ? " The sharpness of his tone broke the girl 's mood . She continued defensively : " Almost . Mark Redfield was drunk , you saw that much . But I did n't blame ; , him . The way Howard was fawning over her . I do n't know what he said , but I know the other men almost had ' 31 o pull them apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appalling . " And of course Howard got meloe ramatic about it . He said the thing was n't finished ? ' he 'd settle it in private  --  that sort of talk . " " I see , " Murdock said . And as his mind fought to re , construct the facts he had learned from Bacon , he added dryly : " So you tagged along with your brother and brought your grudge and nursed it all the time you ere there . You did n't want to miss anything ; that 's ? a by you were alone by choice , huh ? " Joyce Archer colored , dropped her eyes . " You do n't ike me much , do you ? " Murdock did not answer . It is doubtful if he heard her , because he was struggling with the time element of the murder . Bacon would learn of this argument and hreat easily enough . And with this knowledge he would ave a motive sufficient to embroil Archer thoroughly . Joyce Archer glanced up , saw that Murdock was lookg out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , to study him . She wondered if she liked him because he was differt . That she liked him she accepted without conscious ought , had accepted it from the moment he played  | his part in the shower . And this liking increased with association . A newspaper photographer ? He did not look it , at least not like her conception of a newspaper man , certainly like no reporters she had ever seen . Perhaps the first reason for this attraction was that he was clean , scrupulously so ; she had noticed this upstairs . And there was a virile hardness about him that spoke of competence and honesty towards himself . And his dress . The brown business suit , the polished oxfords , the knot in his tie and the way it nestled firmly against his collar , the fresh handkerchief in the breast pocket . The keynote of it all was a conservative , careless correctness with no trace of foppishness , without the stiff perfection of a magazine advertisement . She had not been able to decide about the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at her when he spoke . And his peculiar little smile that crinkled the corners of those eyes and lifted two-thirds of his mouth and gave a glimpse of his teeth . But perhaps it was not his appearance at all . Perhaps it was just that he seemed dependable , competent . And most of the men she knew did nothing well ; they drank too much and talked too much about it and the women they made . . . . " So you went out together ? Then what ? " Joyce Archer 's thoughts jerked back to reality . Not until then did she realize that she had been staring at him and that he had been watching her stare . She looked down at her hand on the chair arm and said : " We came downstairs and started to get in the roadster.  | Then Howard changed his mind and said he was going to walk home and try to think things out . I could n't argue with him . He just got stubborn and started off down the street by himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed ; so I sat up for him , and when he did n't come , I got worried and decided to come back and make sure . " " So you came back , " Murdock added , " and went upstairs . The door was unlocked and you went in . " " The library door was open and I looked in and ? " Joyce Archer broke off as suddenly as though she were rewitnessing the scene . " Was there a gun ? " pressed Murdock . " Yes . " " What did you do with it ? " " Why , I ? " she looked startled ? " how did you know ? " Murdock told her to never mind , and she continued : " I picked it up . Do n't ask me why . I do n't know , do n't know anything except that I was terribly afraid . I do n't know how long I stood there . I could n't seem to move . I would have been there yet if it had n't been for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foyer , heard a key in the lock , and hid in the closet . Not until then did I know I had the gun . " " Could n't you get out when ? " " No . Somebody kept pacing back and forth in the foyer  --  the manager , I think . And then the police came . Finally things got quiet and I " ? she hesitated and a sense of shame settled over her and she avoided Murdock 's eyes as she continued ? " I know I should n't have tried to run , but ? "  | " But you were scared , " Murdock said . " I know . " She was grateful for this and looked up at him . The queer little smile was at his lips . " So you did n't find Howard after all ? " he said . " No . " She sighed with relief . " He 's home . I called him from here . And " ? her voice grew soft , hesitant ? " will I have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't , will I ? " " Not now , unless ? " A knock on the door that continued loudly brought Murdock to his feet . The girl clutched at her robe , a frightened , uncertain gesture . She stood up , her face paling , blue eyes wide . Murdock jerked his head towards the bedroom , whispered : " And stay in there . " Joyce Archer whirled , started towards the inner hall . Murdock 's eyes swept the room , found her empty glass . He grabbed her arm , picked up the glass , and handed it to her . Waiting until the bedroom door closed , he felt of his tie ; then he stepped to the hall door and opened it . A plump , round-faced youth with pale-blue eyes , baggy clothing , and a shapeless hat stood in the hall . Murdock blew out his breath and said : " How 'd you get here ? " " Me ? " The youth looked surprised . " I 'm tryin ' to get a story . " Murdock sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cub reporter whose life was a perpetual struggle to hold his job , he was a good-natured , happy-go-lucky fellow who , nervy , persistent , and habitually broke , was afflicted with hero-worship , directed towards Murdock .  | " You were n't on the story , " Murdock said . " Brady was upstairs with the rest of the gang when I came out in the hall . Nobody assigned you , did they ? " " Hell , no . " " And you 're not on the lobster shift . How come you were prowling around at six o'clock ? " " I was late , " Doane said , his round face cracking wide in an infectious grin . " Late ? " " Yeah . I did n't get off till three and there was a poker game and  --  well , I was goin ' home and I saw two police cars out front , so I ? " " So you horned in , " Murdock grunted . " And you did n't get anything . " " It 's that Keogh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate that guy ! Just a thick-headed copper with an ingrown grudge . He would n't let me in . " Doane 's smile returned and his eyes got hopeful . " But you were there . Ca n't you give me ? " " No . Brady 's got the story . " " Well ? " Doane cocked one brow . " You can at least let me in here . " " No , " said Murdock , but he was weakening ; he always did before the youth 's guileless assault . " Ca n't you give me a drink ? " pleaded Doane . " Hell , I been up all night and ? " " All right , all right , " sighed Murdock , standing aside . " But one quick one and out you go . I got things to do . " He went out to the kitchenette , poured Scotch and soda , brought the drink to the living-room , and found Doane lying on the davenport , a picture of utter con-  | tentment , his knees in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sitting position , handed him the drink . Doane said : " Thanks , " as he accepted the glass ; then : " What , no ice ? " Murdock reached forward . " Gim me ! " " No ! " Doane recoiled , panicky . " I was only foolin ' . " Murdock grinned , but he stood there and made Doane pour down the drink , took the glass , and guided him forcibly but gently to the door . When he finally worked the youth into the hall in spite of the fervent protestations , Doane said : " Now listen . If you run into anything ? " " Will you do me a favor ? " Murdock asked wearily . " Sure , Kent . " Doane was quickly serious . " Anything you say . " " That 's swell , " Murdock said . " Then go ' way . Go anywhere  --  as long as it 's away from here . " " But ? " " You 're wearing me down . " Murdock put one lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed on Doane 's wail . Murdock shook his head for a moment and continued to grin at his thoughts . Then the grin faded . He shrugged , went over to the window and tasted the remainder of his drink . The soda was flat and he crossed to the davenport , picked up Doane 's empty glass , and took them both to the kitchenette , knocking at the bedroom door as he passed . Opening the cupboard , he took out the Scotch-bottle , uncorked it . Then , glaring at it , he put the cork back in ,  | replaced the bottle , and muttered a soft curse as he stared at the empty glasses . He was in a jam and he knew it . She did not know about Howard . He did not want to tell her  --  yet . But she ought to go and tell her story to Bacon . He knew it , felt guilty with this knowledge . Never one to kid himself that he was able to do police and detective work on the side , Murdock had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his business  --  the taking of pictures . One reason why he was successful at his job was that he enjoyed the confidence of the headquarters men and most of the precinct commanders he knew . He was holdy ing out now , and he knew it . And let Bacon find out and ? He cursed again and went into the bathroom . Pink silk shorts and brassiere were wadded on the bath-mat ; the sodden mass of dress , jacket , and wrap lay in the center of the tub , the slippers on top of them , the stockings draped over the rounded sides . The sight brought an unconscious grin to his face and he stepped into the living-room , saw that Joyce Archer was again in the wing chair . She said : " Who was that ? " " A friend of mine . " Murdock hesitated . " We 'd better get some breakfast up here . " " I 'm not hungry . " She looked at him over her shoulder . " You will be before you get out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean I 'm to stay here until ? " " I mean you 've got to stay here  --  today anyway . " Murdock advanced , stood over her , his expression faintly amused . " You 're not counting on wearing that outfit  | you splashed all over the bathroom , are you ? " She smiled at him . " I was too comfortable to pick up . " Murdock said : " I 'll take them out when I go , get them dried and cleaned for you . " " How long will that take ? " " That 's not the point . The police are looking for you . Fortunately they do n't know you are here  --  yet . But they 'll watch this building for a while and ? " " Could n't I get out the back way ? " Murdock jammed his hands in his pockets and looked annoyed . " You 'll stay here and do as I say . I 'm in this thing , and I want to help ; but that is n't all of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . But if I did n't have a few friends on the police force I 'd be looking for another job . " " You mean you 're afraid ? " Joyce Archer stopped uncertainly . Murdock grunted impatiently , stepped to the straightbacked chair , and sat down . For a moment he studied the girl and then , hands still in pockets , he stretched out his legs and studied the polished wing-tips of his oxfords . " Bacon and some of those fellows have got the idea that I 'm a square shooter and on the level with them . Maybe they 're funny that way , but I think they sort of like me . And this is the first time I 've ever double-crossed them . " Joyce Archer said : " Oh . " Murdock stood up . " Yeh . So you either stay here and do as I say  --  until tonight  --  or you call headquarters and  | tell them your story . I 'll try and pacify Bacon while I 've ' still got a chance . " 1 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and smiled at him . " But I 'm not hungry . " . Murdock grinned and moved over to a hall closet , got out a brown felt and a brown tweed topcoat . Toss " ing them on a chair-back , he went into the bathroom and a moment later Joyce heard him say : " What do I do with ' em ? Wring ' em out or what ? " She laughed and got out of the chair . The bathrobe nearly fell off , did slip from the shoulders . She snatched it back , tightened the belt , and went into the bathroom . Five minutes later Murdock had a newspaper-wrapped bundle under his arm . " I was going to have breakfast with you , " he said , stopping near the door and taking his little camera from the larger case . " But if you must be difficult about it ? " " I 'd like it , " Joyce Archer said quickly . " It 's too late , " Murdock said . " My second thought is better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped the bundle ? " and get down to work . " He turned the door-knob . " I 'll have some orange juice and toast and coffee sent up from the corner drug-store  --  and a sandwich for this noon . What do you like ? Chicken ? Ham and cheese ? " " With tomato . " " And I 'll pay for it , " Murdock added crisply , " so when the stuff comes you can tell the boy to leave it outside the door . Do n't open up until he leaves . "  | 8 DETECTIVE MAHADY WAS on duty in the lobby when Murdock stepped from the elevator . He nodded to the desk clerk , angled round a potted palm and a stone urn , stopped in front of the detective , a sour-looking man with an expression of acute displeasure . " Bacon still up there ? " " No . Only I got to stay and watch for that dame . " " Nothing new ? " " How would I know ? " muttered Mahady . " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tough , " and slapped through the revolving door , turned left under the marquee , with a " Good morning " to the doorman . The early autumn morning was fresh , crisp under a bright new sun that had thrown off daylight 's muddy screen . Murdock breathed deeply without knowing it and lengthened his stride . He waved a hand at the traffic officer on the Avenue , continued on to Newbury Street , and turned into the drug-store . He ordered tomato juice and coffee , drank unhurriedly , then gave the order for Joyce Archer and paid for it . The tailor-shop he sought was near by , a one-room , second-floor shop . Murdock climbed through a dustysmelling half-light , his feet clicking sharply on the narrow wooden stairs , worn in smooth hollows by a generation or more of use . The frosted glass panel of the door at the far end of  | e drab hall said : " A. Abramson , " and Murdock went to a square , high-ceilinged room that had a long rack , lied with neatly pressed suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making , in the aggregate , an almost hopesly snarled mass ; a steam-table , and two spindly chairs . A tall , gaunt man was at work at this pressing-table. e continued to work without looking up , and the escapg steam kept the room filled with its moist stale odor. urdock walked over to the fat little Jew with the three ays ' growth of beard who sat cross-legged on a bench ear the two windows . " Listen , Abe " ? Murdock tossed his bundle on the felw 's lap ? " when can I get this back ? " " When do you want it ? " parried Abe , attacking the apping . When he drew out the dress he said : " Oy , " nd squeezed it with both hands , like a sponge . " Soaked . " e separated the rest of the garment4 , held up the bras- " So , " he said finally , nodding his head up and down . You 're doing all right by yourself now-days . " Murdock grunted to repress a grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get them . " " Tomorrow . " " Today . " " Am I a miracle man ? Feel . Silk . Soaked . " " Today , " Murdock argued . " Or else . " " I ca n't guarantee it , " Abe said , weakening . " I 'll be back at five  --  or six . " Murdock took the subway at Copley and ten minutes . ter swung into the photographic department on the third floor of the Courier-Herald building . Nodding a  | greeting to two other camera men who lounged in the anteroom , he took off his coat , hung it on an oak hatrack , and went down the darkened corridor to one of the cubby-hole-like dark-rooms . He had developed his film and was putting it through the fixing bath when someone called down the hall : " Hey , Kent ! Wyman wants to see you . " Murdock called the fellow into the dark-room , held the film up to the ruby light . " The five at the end , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five if they 'll stand it . " He went upstairs , through the city room , and into a corridor at the rear , stopping in front of a door which said : " T. A. Wyman . " Knocking once , he went in . The office was small , simply furnished with a brown rug , a massive , new-looking desk , a filing-cabinet , and three chairs , all made of metal which was supposed to imitate wood . Wyman glanced up from the desk as Murdock entered , took the cigar from his mouth , and said : " Sit down , Kent . " Murdock took a chair at one end of the desk , settled into it , and crossed one leg over the other knee , waiting while Wyman gave his attention to some papers on the desk . The Courier-Herald Publishing Company had morning , evening , and Sunday editions . Theoretically Wyman was managing editor of the Morning Herald ; actually he was the Courier-Herald Publishing Company . He did not own much stock , his financial interest was comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a stocky man , partly bald , with a heavy face  | at looked fatty , but on close inspection became musular , hard . Thick-necked , wide across the jaws , with . rk brown eyes that were steady , searching , he was a ynamic , aggressive driver . Unlike most editorial men , e had a background in both advertising and circulation romotion , but he stuck to the editorial side now be . use it gave him a better perspective of the property a whole . The happy combination of a business man ho knew news values , Wyman had the training , the xperience , and the essential knack of handling men , ' ? lus a drive which had made the Courier-Herald the ost important newspaper property in the city . When he finished shuffling the papers to his satisfacion , he tossed them into a wire basket and leaned back his chair , making a cradle of his hands for the nape f his neck . The cigar swiveled to one corner of his mouth ' efore he spoke . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uitting ? " " It was just an idea of mine , " Murdock said . " You 're crazy , " grunted Wyman . ; What 's the matter ? ou got a grudge against somebody or something ? Do n't we treat you right ? " " Yes , but ? " " Forget it . " Wyman leaned over , his forearms flat on e desk . " You 're the best camera in town , and you get he most money . Where can you beat that set-up ? " ' Maybe I ca n't , " Murdock said , frowning . " But what oes it get me ? There 's no future in it . You carry around a camera and a plate-case until you get round-shouldered ' and your legs quit on you and then what ? You get fired ,  | or laid off , or your salary cut . " Murdock sat up and warmed to his subject . " Look at Breen , and Lanning . They were pretty good , were n't they ? And what did it get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living , " cut in Wyman . " While it lasted , " snorted Murdock . " How old are they ? Fifty or so , and where are they now ? Breen 's in the art department , Lanning 's in classified . Thirty-five a week maybe . They 'd been out entirely if it was n't for you . " " That 's not the whole reason , " Wyman said thoughtfully . " It would n't stop a guy like you . You 're not that soft . You got a bug somewhere that 's biting you . Maybe it 's wife trouble . That 's none of my business , but if that 's it , you 're crazier than ever . " Murdock slipped down in his chair and straightened out so that his only points of contact were hips and shoulder-blades . His dark , good-looking face held a faint , sullen smile ; when he did not speak , Wyman took his cigar out , studied the end of it . " There ought to be future enough in newspapers for anyone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got experience , and you 've got the newspaper knack . A college graduate like you ? " " No graduate , " Murdock said wearily , shifting his shoulder-blades ; " I left by request in the third year . " Wyman , unruffled , said : " You had enough . You had practically a college education and ? " " And what did it do for me ? " Murdock cut in . " I 'll tell you . " The sardonic smile etched itself deeper in his  | glean face . He spoke in slow , almost absent tones . " It taught me to like nice clothes and how to drink ; it taught e to appreciate good books and good pictures and  --  in hort , it taught me to like most of the things money an buy . The hell of iit is , I never was able to pick up y very good ideas of just how to go about getting this ? " " Have it your way , " Wyman said shortly . " Where you oing to get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man 's game . " " It 's anybody 's game that can take it . I thought you could . " Murdock flushed , and Wyman continued : " You would n't be satisfied if you could n't take picures . " " Probably not . " Murdock flexed his crossed ankles . ' But there are other fields besides newspapers . I thought Ei might go to New York and see if I could n't get in with me advertising photographer  --  maybe even portrait tuff . Do some real camera work . There 's money in it . 1 would n't be any Steichen or Nelson maybe , but I ould n't need to be . Look at Bourke-White  --  a girl . Look ? t this guy Lohse  --  Remie Lohse . He 's got an outfit like mine and look what he 's done with it  --  Vanity Fair stuff . " I 've been interested in cameras ever since my father lave me a box outfit for my twelfth birthday . A hobby . It helped me through college  --  I had a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good business with sports pic'tures . But I thought I wanted to be a newspaper man .  | , Was I dumb ? " Murdock 's smile was disparaging and he kept his eyes on his shoes . This time Wyman remained silent . It was not entirely newspaper experience that put him at the top of the heap . He could never have climbed there if he had not been a keen judge of men . And his interest in Murdock was both personal and selfishly business . He knew he had not exaggerated when he said Murdock was the best camera in the city . He was popular . He had a wide acquaintance in all levels of society , because he was the sort of fellow who could talk nearly everyone 's language ; he was equally proficient at balancing a cup of tea and a piece of cake on his knee and acting as if it belonged there , or busting his way through a crowd with a camera and plate-case . He was loyal , square , intelligent . He could fight . He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got pictures if anyone did , and a lot more that other photographers missed . " So I tried it , " Murdock went on , " for three years . " He looked up and grinned . " I was a damn good leg man , too . But I could n't write . So I came over on the picture side . I guess that 's worse than the other . But I 've done some nice work with a camera ; I 've got an idea I could cash in on it better if I- " " Wait a minute , " Wyman said . He looked at his cigar , turned it between thumb and forefinger , and stuck it in one corner of his mouth . " I 've been thinking about this for a long time . It 's not original ; plenty of papers are doing it . See how it sounds . We 've got two papers  --  fourteen cameras ; and it 's about time we made a regular department ; put a man in as the  | d of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editors give out assignments . Of course he 'd ve to work hand in hand with the news men , but ere 'd be more freedom , plenty of latitude to work with . at do you think ? A photographer running the photo partment. , Do n't that sound better than having a news an give all the orders ? " " Sure . " " Then take the job , try it out . If it works you can ite your own ticket ; I 'll give you a contract . " " An inside job , " Murdock muttered . " Take the blame r every camera and get no credit and not much chance work on anything of my own . " " Ah ? " Wyman clamped his heavy jaws on the cigar d pushed back in the chair . " You cry because you 're aid your legs 'll give out , but when you ca n't get out d dig , you cry about that too . What you ought a do is ? out and get drunk . Take a couple days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murdock pulled in his legs . " I 've anged my mind about quitting anyway  --  since last " ght . I want a leave of absence  --  a couple of weeks . " " What for ? " " Well " ? Murdock spread his hands ? " you were partly right . I 've had some wife trouble and I can buy her off . I understand the Bar Association is putting up a fivethousand reward on that killing last night . I was in at the start and I might get lucky . I 'd like to ? " " How much of the five would you get even if you were lucky ? You 'd have to split with a half-dozen detectives and ? "  | " That 's just part of it . The Eagle is offering five thousand for the exclusive story of the arrest and conviction of ? " " Oh , " Wyman said . " You 're that kind of a chiseler , huh ? " " That 's the kind I 'm going to be until I get a divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for the leave ? " " All right , " snapped Wyman . He snatched the cigar from his mouth and threw it into a brass cuspidor . " I can think of some guys that would take salary checks from the business office and then , if they did get the story , sell out to the Eagle under an assumed name . You at least asked for the leave . So go get the story . You have n't got a prayer  --  not even you  --  but go get it . Get it and I 'll match the Eagle . But this is just between you and me  --  and I 've got to have pictures . " Murdock sighed in satisfaction and reached for the telephone . When he got the photo department , he said : " Bring those prints to Wyman 's office , Eddy . Mac blew them up and they ought to be on the drying-rack . " Wyman 's eyes snapped as Murdock hung up . " Got something ? " Murdock said : " Bacon gave me a break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in with five damp prints . Murdock glanced at them and passed them to Wyman . The managing editor 's eyes went wide and there was a sudden feverish cast to his face as he grabbed for the telephone . He kept pawing at the pictures with his free hand until he got his connection . Then he bawled : " Stop the presses ! "  | Murdock jerked to his feet . " No ! " he rapped , and mped his palm over the mouthpiece . Quick anger flooded Wyman 's heavy face , flashed in is eyes . He fumed : " What the hell do you mean , not " d tried to wrench the telephone free . " Why did n't you ring ' em up before ? " Eddy stood in the doorway , goggle-eyed . Murdock said : " Wait ! You 're only running the bullog . " What of it ? " Wyman ceased struggling , as though he sensed that there was a real reason for Murdock 's tardiness . " Pictures in mail editions have been stolen before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a job with ' em , but it 's been done . You wo n't lose any circulation in the country whether you run ' em or not . You 'll pick , , up twenty-five thousand in city circulation if you have those , shots exclusive . " Wyman banged down the receiver and glared at Eddy , who hastily withdrew . He took out a fresh cigar and stuck it in his mouth without biting the end . " That 's what burns me up about you , " he growled finally . " You can think . You 're not just a photographer , your a newspaper man . But there 's no future , huh ? Well , get the hell out of here , I got work to do . " Murdock smiled , and moved towards the door . " Okay .. I just wanted to give you the first installment on this private assignment . " Wyman 's brows came down . " Wait , " he said skeptically . " How 'd you get these ? Have the outfit at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig . On the side .  | For the glory of the good old Courier-Herald and ? " The shrill of the telephone interrupted him , and Wyman said : " For you . " Murdock leaned across the desk and accepted the instrument . The voice at the other end was hoarse , jerky . " Murdock ? This is Sam Cusick . Did you tip off the cops about seeing me last night ? " Murdock felt his pulse quicken , but he kept his voice level as he answered : " I might have mentioned it . " " Oh ? " The word was a sneer . " You might have , huh ? Well , get a load of this . You forget you saw me . You made a mistake , see ? " " I hear you , if that 's what you mean , " Murdock told him . " You hear me , and you 'll do what I say . I 'm not gon na let ' em frame me for that job just because you saw me there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'm gon na stay in the clear until I 'm damn sure you ca n't do me any harm . " " What am I supposed to do ? " growled Murdock , " Go down and ? " " Figure it out for yourself . You made a mistake . " The receiver clicked in Murdock 's ear . He replaced the telephone and straightened up . Wyman , watching him suspiciously , asked : " Who was that ? " " Just a pal of mine , " Murdock said . A grim little smile pulled back his lips as he opened the door and stepped into the hall .  | 9 TOM DOANE WAS loitering in the main corridor of police headquarters when Murdock arrived at three that afternoon . The young reporter grabbed Murdock 's arm , started to accompany him to the elevators . " What you down here on ? " " Bacon wants to see me , " Murdock said . " Hah ! " Doane grinned , and stepped into the elevator , bnging against the plate-case slung over Murdock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into the hall , and walked down to the far end where an open door led to a small anteroom . A uniformed officer at the desk nodded to Murdock , who crossed to the door in the right wall and knocked . Keogh opened the door . Murdock stepped past him with Doane at his heels . The Sergeant scowled and grabbed the youth by the arm . " Hey , you , " he growled . " I 'm with him , " protested Doane , reeling back through the doorway under Keogh 's unrelenting propulsion . " Not now you 're not , " Keogh said , and his broad face took on a satisfied grin . " He 's all right , " Murdock said . " He 's a pest , " Keogh said , and slammed the door . The room was not an office , really ; it was more like a conference room . The walls were bare ; there was a long table of golden oak , scarred along the edges by official  | and unofficial heels . A half-dozen chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the far end of the table , was the only one in the room . He said : " Sit down , " and Murdock moved to a chair beside him . The photographer unbuttoned his coat , shrugged off the plate-case , and put the box-like camera on the table . Bacon asked : " You got anything new ? " " Not much , " Murdock said . " Only Cusick made a friendly call . " " Cusick ? " Bacon was all interest . Keogh circled the end of the table and sat down opposite Murdock . " When ? What did he want ? " Murdock told of the telephone conversation , then lit a cigarette and pushed back his hat . " We 'll get him , " Bacon said grimly . " And I want to be there when we do , " Keogh added . " He blackjacked a guy from Station 6 early this morning . That was before we knew about this other and the fellow met Cusick and started to question him about something else . " Keogh scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na have a lot of fun when we get him . " Bacon hooked his thumbs in his lower vest pockets and studied Murdock a moment before he spoke . " Archer and Redfield had a quarrel  --  a fight , last night . " " So ? " Murdock said , and tried to look interested while Bacon gave familiar details . " And we know who that dame is now , " the Lieutenant finished . " Archer 's sister . I ca n't hook her up  --  unless she helped somebody else . "  | Murdock asked : " Did you find the gun ? " Bacon nodded . " A twenty-five . It was in an overcoat , in that closet where we think the girl was hiding . " Murdock 's brows lifted . " Prints ? " " Smudged . " The brows came down and Murdock , pulling thoughtfu I ly on the cigarette , finally asked : " How about Spike Tripp ? " " We 're letting him out on bail . We worked him over a bit , but it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed out was the one all right . Her story 's the same as his : he was supposed to call for her . And anyway he 's nothing but a cheap punk . He never was a killer and I ca n't find any motive . Right now we ca n't score any runs with him , and we can always pick him up if we want him . " Bacon rubbed the side of his nose with a bony index finger , pulled at a thick gold chain until a thick gold watch came into view . " We 're waiting for Archer  --  and Girard . I said I 'd give you a break . You can sit in . " The uniformed policeman on duty in the anteroom opened the door as though Bacon 's speech was a prearranged signal . Nodding his head briefly , Bacon moved aside and Howard Archer stepped across the threshold , stopped there , and surveyed the room with cold blue eyes and a distasteful expression . Murdock stood up , said : " Hello , Archer , " and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picked up his plate-case , and moved it beside the chair which was farthest from Bacon . Archer nodded and the Lieutenant said : " Sit down ,  | Mr. Archer  --  over here . " He indicated the chair Murdock had left . Howard Archer strode forward . Keogh moved his chair so that he could lean back against the wall , and propped himself there , his feet dangling . Archer sat down , frowned , and said : " Well , " with a bored , patronizing inflection . " You had a fight with Redfield last night , " Bacon said . " An argument , " Archer corrected coldly . " I heard different , " Bacon said , " but let it pass . Anyway , you made a threat . " " That 's right . " " And the fi  --  the argument was over Mrs. Redfield . It 's true , is n't it , that you 've been pretty friendly ? " " I 've known her for years . " " But more so than ever lately , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than friendly . " Archer 's thin , tanned face flushed and his blue eyes were hostile and narrowed . " I resent that remark and I resent your attitude . " " That 's too bad , " said Bacon , unperturbed . " But maybe you 've forgotten that this is a murder case we 're talking about . I want information and I 'm going to get it . We 're not going to bulldoze you or high-pressure you . " He waved his hand to indicate the room at large . " There 's no stenographer . If you want to get your lawyer , that 's all right with me . But if I were you , I 'd take it easy and try and help us out . We 're making no formal charge , and we 're not going to arrest you  --  yet . We may have to if you hold us up . " Archer stroked his blond mustache and waited , his  | eyes still hostile , disdainful . Bacon went on in the same level tones . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no interruption , " I believe you considered the idea of running off with Mrs. Redfield . " Archer colored , snapped : " Have you talked with her ? " Bacon nodded and Archer added : " Then why bother asking me about it ? I 've been friendly , yes . To be exact , I 'm in love with her . She was practically forced into marrying Redfield , and she was sick of her bargain . Redfield was drunk last night , and he ended by making a scene . I left at about three o'clock . " " With your sister . " Archer hesitated uncertainly , then finally said : " Yes , with my sister . " " Where is she now ? " " I do n't know . " " She go home with you ? " " Certainly . " This sharply . " Then , " said Bacon wearily , " how come we find your car parked round the corner from Redfield 's place at sixthirty this morning ? " " I left it there , " Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archer lied very well and very promptly . He liked him for that , the first time he had ever liked anything about him at all . " But you did n't drive it away . " " I forgot I left it there . I was thinking about other things . " " Then you came to the apartment house and went upstairs . What happened then ? "  | " I tried the door and it was locked , so ? " " So you sneaked out the back way , " Bacon cut in dryly . " You must have or the operator would have seen you come out . " Archer took a deep breath , made an obvious effort to control his annoyance . " All right , " he said . " You seem to know more than I thought . " " We have to , " Bacon said . " I came back , " Archer lipped , " to see Ri  --  Mrs. Redfield , and to have it out with Mark then and there if necessary . I had been waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt about each other . We could have gone away together , but I preferred to tell him first . I was angry enough to want to do it last night and have it over . " I came through the lobby and the operator looked as if he was asleep . I went upstairs and pressed the buzzer . When no one answered , I went in . I found Redfield dead in the library , found Rita in the bedroom . I could n't rouse her . I did n't have any alternative ; I had to get away . " But I remembered the boy in the lobby . I thought if he was asleep I 'd be a fool to take a chance of his waking when I went out . I knew if I was seen I 'd be implicated . So I went downstairs and out the back way . " " What time did you come back ? " Bacon asked . " About four-fifteen , I think , but I 'm not sure exactly . " Murdock had opened his plate-case and camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his synchronized flash-gun , adjusted the shutter and focus . When he put the camera to his shoulder and glanced through the metal frame of the finder , he saw Bacon 's eyes shift to  | him . But for once Murdock was getting one-hundred-percent co-operation from the police . The Lieutenant gave no sign that he saw anything out of the ordinary and , glancing at Archer , said : " All right . Thanks very much . You 'd better plan to remain in town for a few days ; we may need you again . " Archer smiled and stood up . As he turned , Murdock pressed the button , and the flash-bulb exploded light into the room . Archer 's facial reaction was instantaneous . Anger flooded his cheeks , and he opened his mouth , closed it , finally spoke contemptuously . " That 's just about the sort of cheap trick I 'd expect of you , Murdock . " Red spots jumped out on Murdock 's cheek-bones . It was the one thing about the job he hated  --  having to take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plate-holder to give himself something to do while he got control of his voice ; then he said : " Would you have given me the shot if I 'd asked for it ? " " I should say not . " " That 's what I thought . " Murdock placed the camera on the table . " And it 's my job to take pictures . So for fellows like you who have an exaggerated idea of the importance of their privacy , I get them the best way I can . " When Archer went out , Keogh spat out a curse and bounced the front legs of his chair down on the floor . " I hate guys like that . Smart . Throwin ' that high-hat stuff around . " He glared at Bacon . " You were too easy on him . A couple slaps in the mouth would soften him up a bit . "  | " Sure , " Bacon said , sucking his lips . " And then I 'd wake up out in the sticks and you 'd be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't  --  and you do too much thinking with your mouth . Damn it ! I do n't even dare hold him but ? " " He looks good to me , " Keogh snorted , " next to Cusick . If I was going to make a choice between them I 'd have to toss a coin . His story 's screwy . Going out the back way . Hell ! He was nuts about Redfield 's wife and he came back looking for trouble . " Murdock 's resentment still smoldered from Archer 's attitude . But he thought of something in the man 's favor and he spoke his mind . " Do n't forget about the telephone flash from Redfield 's apartment at five after four . Archer did n't come in till fifteen after , the kid downstairs told you that . " " It can be figured , " Bacon said , and scratched behind his ear . " If he went out the back way , he coulda come in that way before . " He twisted in the chair , drummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's got me worried . A woman can pull a trigger and ? " " I doubt like hell , " Murdock sniffed , " if she could bust Redfield 's finger like that . " Bacon looked up quickly , caught Murdock 's sardonic gaze . He took a deep breath , blew it out resignedly , seemed about to speak when a knock sounded on the door and Nate Girard came into the room followed by two well-dressed , somber-faced men . One was tall , slightly stooped ; the other , thickset and swarthy . The eyes of both were the same : alert , hard , a bit cruel as they swiveled about the room .  | Keogh said : " Well , well , " sarcastically ; " you got your cowboys back again , huh ? " " I 'm going to keep them , " Girard said , " until you fellows get on your jobs and round up Sam Cusick . " " Yeah ? " Keogh said . " Well , leave ' em outside , you wo n't need ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Girard said easily , " okay . " He turned to the two bodyguards and grinned . " You stay outside , boys ; it seems the Sergeant objects to your company . " Nate Girard was an unusual figure , both in personality and in matter of record . It would have been difficult to convince the average man that during prohibition he was the most successful operator in the illicit liquor traffic in that part of the country . And this difficulty was not hard to understand . Girard had nothing in common with the run-of-the-mill bootlegger except the nature of his business . Physically he was a handsome , striking figure , a man who dressed like a banker and whose conversation , manners , and general conduct  --  when necessary and advisable ? were above reproach . In addition he was shrewd , intelligent , well-educated  --  probably the only college graduate in his line of business . Even his police record was innocuous enough . Until the recent murder charge , resulting in his acquittal , he had just two counts against him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past ten years of his operations he had never been accused of murder or hijacking . Perhaps the strangest thing of all was that , among those who had business dealings with him , he had  | a reputation for honesty , a business word that was scrupulously kept . During the recent trial reporters had scoured every available source to uncover facts about his personal life and habits . Always the sort of personality that makes news , he had received much publicity in the past , not all of it unfavorable . But his private life was cloudy , kept under cover . Just one new side of him came to light , unearthed by a sob sister on the Courier . As a human interest yarn , the story had everything : Girard the philanthropist . And he had not been cheap or flashy about it either . He did not scatter nickels to poor children nor get his picture taken delivering Christmas baskets to the needy ; but he had , for several years , kept a dozen families on his payroll , sending them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no ulterior motive or obligation , no grandstanding about it ; Girard did this for the satisfaction and enjoyment it gave him . Murdock thought of all this as he studied the man and watched him move up alongside the table and sit down in the same chair Archer had used . " Well " ? Girard smiled at Murdock , glanced at Keogh , turned back to Bacon ? " let 's get on with the inquisition . " The Lieutenant leaned back , his gray eyes thoughtful . " Where were you last night between three-thirty and five ? That 's all the inquisition there is . " " Why ? " " Because I want to know . You 've read the afternoon papers . " " In other words , you want to know if I have an alibi . "  | Girard rubbed his clipped mustache with his thumb . " Well , fortunately I 've got one . Unfortunately I 'm not at liberty to disclose it . " " There are ways of making you tell it , " Bacon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on : " Understand , I 'm not saying you killed Redfield , but ? " " There 's no reason why I should . " " There could have been . " " What is it ? " " You paid Redfield twenty-five thousand when he took the case ; you gave him the other half yesterday . Luckily f for you , we found that twenty-five in his apartment safe or there might have been a reason . But we do n't pretend to know everything . You  --  anyone at that party might 've had plenty of reason for putting him away . We suspect everybody . I want to know where you were after threethirty . The man we sent to check on you found you at your place at six o'clock . Did anyone see you come in ? " " No . " " When did you get there ? " " I do n't believe I want to tell that now , either , " Girard said calmly . " Not until I find out whether I 've got to tell the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Utsnay ! " snapped Keogh irritably . " We 've heard that one before . You get an alibi . Then spill it . We 've made tougher guys than you talk . " Girard was unimpressed . " Maybe . But I do n't have to tell you here , and you know it . If you want to make a pinch , I 'll get hold of a lawyer and ? " " And you wo n't have Redfield to spring you , either . "  | " ? and find out where we stand , " Girard finished , ignoring Keogh 's interruption . " I can tell if I have to , but if you make me and ca n't justify your arrest ? " " When did you hire those bodyguards ? " Bacon said , giving Keogh an angry sidewise glance . " This morning . " " Why ? " " I told you . Cusick and his brother tried to take me for twenty thousand and they got four years . Redfield and I put them away  --  Redfield because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuted . I did n't kill Joe Cusick and ? " " You were acquitted anyway , " Keogh leered . Girard 's profile was sharp against the light from the windows , and Murdock saw the jaw stick out , saw the neck redden and bulge with anger that could no longer be controlled . Girard stood up , walked to the door , opened it , and looked out . Closing it softly , he came back and stood spread-legged , looking down at Bacon . Finally he took out a cigar , bit it once or twice , and sat down . " No dictograph hooked up here ? " Bacon shook his head , his thin face puzzled , wary . Girard grabbed his chair , spun it about , and straddled it as he sat down , turning slightly so he could see all three men . He crossed his forearms on the chair-back , leaned on them . " Here 's something I never told anybody , " he said and it was apparent that he was still angry . " I could n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to make any confidences since . But you fellows are beginning to wear me down and " ? he glanced at Bacon . " Oh , you 're all right .  | I know you 've got a job to do , and you 're a good copper in your way . If there were more like you it would be different . But this one " ? he jerked a thumb at the scowling Keogh without looking at him ? " is just a tough mug that with a little different break in environment or circumstances would 've made a first-class thug . And ? " Keogh came to his feet with a bound . " Listen , you ! " he grated . Girard untangled his arms and Stood up . " I 'm listenin ' , smarty , " he said , and he said it insultingly . Keogh cursed and his quick temper got the best of him . He struck out with his left . Girard either moved with astonishing speed or he anticipated the blow . In any case he took it on hunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean hard smash that landed on Keogh 's cheekbone . Girard 's punch had timing and power . Keogh bounced back against the wall and sat down . Sheer surprise kept him there a moment ; then he was up , eager to continue . Bacon yelled : " Lay off ! " and jumping in front of the Sergeant , jammed him down on his chair . Keogh started to struggle , stopped suddenly as he realized whom he was struggling with . Bacon sat down again and shook his head , his eyes exasperated as they met Murdock 's interested gaze . " Jesus ! " he groaned , " do I get co-operation ? " He eyed Keogh wrathfully . " Sometimes I wonder why I put up with you . " " He ca n't pull that stuff with me , " Keogh growled . Girard adjusted his cuffs , glanced at Murdock . " You were a witness if anybody wants to make anything of it . "  | " Take it easy , " Bacon begged . " Who wants to make anything out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded his arms over the chair-back again . The cigar was crushed and broken now , but he did not seem to notice it ; he chewed on it and began his story as though nothing had happened . " I was brought up on a farm in a part of the country where newspapers are a luxury . We were poor  --  poor as hell . But I had the luck to have a mother who had ideas . She talked college to me from the time I was old enough to walk four miles to the country school . And she did n't know anything about college either . It was just an idea . She 'd read something about it some place . She worked and slaved and saved her pennies and made me work out summers and bring every cent I made home to her . It got so I hated the idea of college , but her will was stronger than mine . Anyway , I went  --  to a cheap State affair . And I worked there , and she helped me . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything but house dresses . Maybe you can imagine how I felt when I got out . I was old enough then to realize , to appreciate , what she had done . And there was only one thing I wanted : to make some money and repay her . And what happened ? " Girard broke off with a little grunt , chewed on his cigar . No one spoke , and when he continued , his voice was absent , its keynote a grim bitterness that was unmistakable . " I could n't get a job , that 's what happened . " He hesitated again and looked out the windows , then went on as though reliving that part of his life .  | " I was broke , and I could n't let her know . I washed dishes , and kept furnaces and mowed lawns for my room . I waited on table and ran elevators and mopped out offices ; finally I got a job as helper on a truck . For over two years I had just enough cash to keep going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken ten years off her life working for me . I could tell from her letters she was tired out . And I could n't do anything about it . I was afraid I could n't get that money in time . " Girard seemed to snap his reverie . " That 's why I was a bootlegger . It never bothered my conscience . I had a lot of public sentiment on my side -I because the public was a partner in the whole damn works . But even if they 'd been against me , it would have made no difference . And I made money ; and the more I made , the more I could grow . " But I ran my business with brains instead of machineguns , and you know it . I lost some money that way ; I lost plenty of truckloads to hijackers . But I worked out a system whereby my own drivers did n't know where they were going half the time . Sealed-order stuff . It worked . And I found out there were some surprisingly honest men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money with a gun ; I made enough for me without it . None of my drivers ever carried a gun . When they were stuck up , they just got down off the seat and walked in . There was no shooting . " And if I had it all to do over again , I 'd follow the same groove . Because my mother had the things I wanted to give her before she died . My name is not Girard . As far as I know , she , or her few friends , never knew my busi-  | ness . My reputation was local , sectional anyway . My picture would never make the newspapers she finally had time to read . A sob story , huh ? " Girard laughed , but there was no mirth in his tones . " Do n't get the idea I 'm trying to justify my actions to you ; in my own mind I do n't need justification . But to tell you what I wanted , I had to tell it all . And here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and was tangled up with killers and crooked cops and government men . The gun ruled , generally . Yet in all that time I never used one or put the finger on a man . Then I turn legitimate ; I try to live a moral law-abiding life . And what does it get me ? A lot of grief . " I 've got money ; I 've invested it as wisely as anyone can these days . I like a good time , but I mind my own business . And what 's the result ? Twice you 've had me down here on gang killings . The Cusicks try to take me for twenty thousand and land in jail . One of them is killed and for that you did your damnedest to get me the chair . And now this Redfield thing . " Girard took out his cigar , looked at it , threw it on the floor , and stood up . " Well , I 'm fed up . Through . I 'm sick of having you fellows push me around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some answer . But no one said anything . There was nothing to say , because Girard was convincing ; when he talked like that , you believed him . Bacon had not moved since Girard began ; neither had the glowering Keogh . Murdock realized he was holding his breath and let it out softly .  | Girard put on his coat , picked up his hat , and glanced around once more , then walked to the door . " If the reason for this forensic display is cloudy , put it down to lack of practice . If it gives you the idea that I 'm sick of the whole God-damned business , you 've caught my meaning . " He put on his hat , his other hand on the door-knob . " If you want me again , subpoena me and I 'll come down with my lawyer . But if you 're figuring on building me up for this Redfield job , you 'd better work fast . Because I 'm going down and see when I can get a good boat to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while and see if they 'll accept me at face value or try and pin the Stavisky job on me . " Girard opened the door . " I 'll call you up , Bacon , and let you know what day I 'm sailing . " The slam of the door broke the spell . Keogh stood up , went to the windows , and looked out . He cursed softly for a moment , then turned , said : " Damned if he did n't sound as if he meant it . " Murdock stirred in his chair , grinned at Bacon . " He kinda told you off , huh ? " " Yeah , " Bacon sighed , " did n't he ? " He stood up , continued dryly . " The hell of it is , I still ca n't think of any answers .  | 10 KENT MURDOCK STOPPED at the office on his way home , but there was no assignment for him and there was also no story to be passed along about the confidential questioning of the afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce Archer 's clothes and arriving at his apartment before six . Joyce Archer was still curled up in the wing chair as he had left her . She put aside the book she had been reading as he entered , and when he moved closer he saw it was Green Mansions . " Like it ? " he asked . " I do n't know  --  I think I do . It 's so different . But it 's a beautiful thing , is n't it ? " Murdock said it was and took off his coat , laying it across the back of the davenport , placing his hat on top , the package of her clothes beside it . He thrust his hands in his trousers pockets , walked over to the windows and glanced out across the hammered steel surface of the river , frowned at it unconsciously as his doubt-filled mind picked out one thought and turned it over and over , reluctant to drop it . " I like your place . " Murdock turned . The frown vanished , but the eyes remained troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless ? " She hesitated and he watched her glance slide about the room , touching the davenport  | with its coffee-table , the simple curtains , the heavy-lookiiig secretary in the corner . She looked at each of the four prints  --  three etchings and a lithograph  --  in turn . He t hought she liked them , particularly the Benson and one of Morgan Dennis 's dogs . " Well , " she continued slowly , " the few bachelor places I 've seen are either disorderly or too fastidiously neat . " " And what 's this ? " " Why " ? she smiled at him ? " neat and disorderly . " He returned the smile now . " You 've been snooping . " " I 've been looking around . " He came towards her slowly , stopped in front of her . The dressing-gown had apparently settled to a fixed position with wearing . The V at the neck , curved and rounded by her breasts , was still in soft focus . Her face still looked fresh and alive and healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sandwich , lay on the reading-table . He saw that the generous bronze ash-tray was filled to overflowing with cigarette stubs . He gave her a sidewise glance , opened the jade cigarette-box . It still held a half-dozen cigarettes , but he was not satisfied and crossed to the red enamel box on the mantle . This one was empty ; the one on the stand by the club chair , a carved rosewood affair , held but a single cigarette . He grunted , said : " You smoke too much , " and went over to the secretary , where he took a fresh carton from the top drawer . He tore off the wrapping , took out a halfdozen packs , and replaced the carton . " I 'll help you . " Joyce Archer straightened her legs , and when she stood up , the robe fell away and there was a flash of bronzed thigh .  | " You get dressed , " Murdock said , and nodded towards the bundle on the davenport . When Joyce Archer re-entered the room , she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there was no make-up to spoil the natural red of her lips , the freshness of her skin . And , he realized for the first time , she was tall for a girl ; the shoes helped make her so , he thought . He said : " That 's better . " She grimaced and looked at her feet . " The shoes , " she said , and he saw then that they had a stiff , cracked look about them . He said : " I want to talk to you . " Her brows lifted , but when he did not add to the remark , she came forward , this time sitting on the davenport . Murdock dropped down on the opposite arm and she said : " You act as if you were getting ready to scold me . " Murdock 's grin came and went quickly . When the girl looked away , he studied the profile , admiring again the long clean line of her jaw . For a moment he thought about the girl herself . He liked her being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not belong . She was , he told himself , too young and irresponsible and spoiled , yet  --  and he admitted it grudgingly  --  unspoiled in some ways that he liked . Genuine , that was it . And she bothered him and  --  with no warning , his mind jumped off on a tangent , bringing with it a new bitterness that had lain dormant since last night . Hestor . Trouble settled over him . He cleared his throat and  | plunged ahead with the speech he had originally intended , his voice brusque , hard . " I 've been down to headquarters . They had your brother down there . He went back to Redfield 's after he h.1 t you . " Joyce Archer 's " Oh ! " was a sucking sound . Murdock hurried on , telling what he knew in short , clipped sentences . There was not much color in the girl 's face when he finished . " Have they ? " she managed to say ? " is he ar-rested ? " Murdock shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you how it was . He 's under suspicion ? and you ca n't blame the police much for it . A murder case  --  particularly a case like this one  --  brings the public and the newspapers down on them with a hue and cry that they ca n't escape . They have to do the best they can . " Murdock shrugged and stood up . " He did n't involve you in any way , but they do n't believe all of his story . I think you 'd better go down to headquarters and talk with Bacon . " Joyce Archer 's chin came up and there was something deep in her eyes that he could not fathom , something determined , like a little boy making up his mind to face a whipping . " Do you think they will make me stay there  --  arrest me ? " " No . " " Then what good can it do ? " " No good probably , " said Murdock sharply . " But they know who you are . They 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry your brother , and all the time you 'll be taking the chance of having some tough cop picking you up and dragging you down . " " Of course , " she said , standing . Murdock nodded . " I 'll go with you if you like . " " But you said if the police found out what you 'd done , they would n't trust you any more . " " I can probably laugh it off , " Murdock said shortly , " talk them out of it . " Joyce Archer shook her head . " There 's no sense in that . I can go alone just as well . And I can tell them that I was able to sneak out the back way last night ; I do n't have to answer all of their questions . " " They 'll trip you up , " Murdock said . " You might as well tell the truth . You 've got to explain the car you left round the corner and ? " Joyce Archer 's hand went to her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I forgot . " " Your brother said he brought it . Those fellows down at headquarters are pretty good ; it 's their business to be . They 'll make liars out of both of you . " " Then , " her tone was stiff , annoyed , " I 'll tell them I came in a taxi . You need n't worry . " " I do n't , " Murdock said . " I appreciate what you 've done . " Her tone was accusing . " I 've been a bother , have n't I ? " Murdock shrugged wearily and some of the harshness went out of his voice . " Do n't mind me , " he said , " I 'm just a photographer ; a mug with a lot on his mind . " Joyce Archer stopped with her hand on the door-knob.  | , ! Why are you a photographer ? " Murdock lifted one hand . " I like cameras and taking pictures  --  or maybe I 'm just funny that way . " She opened the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me ? " " Maybe I do , " Murdock told her , then added : " There 's no detective downstairs now . You 'd better go home and change those clothes before you talk to Bacon . " Murdock picked up the wadded sandwich wrapper , tossed it up , caught it , and then clenched it in his fist . He crossed over to the windows ; he looked out for several minutes and saw nothing . She bothered him . From the time he had begun to earn his own living until he married Hestor , he had , in retrospective moods , thought about the girl he would some day marry . Always the girl had been like Joyce Archer . Lately his thoughts had focused upon being free ; that and nothing more . Within twenty-four hours it had become the all-important thing . Because if there ever was another girl , he did not want to wait , to make her suffer from past liaisons . Once free He was eight or ten years older than Joyce Archer . And his mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few illusions left , and even those were beginning to fray around the edges . He was a newspaper photographer . He might go to New York anyway , try to find a different sort of opening . But even then there was nothing much he could offer a girl . Certainly not bridge and horses and houses in the country .  | " Nuts , " he muttered , and spun away from the window . Why in hell did he have to think about her anyway ? What started it ? Could n't he meet a girl , have her in his rooms , without fighting to build dreams and knock them down all at the same time . There had been other girls sitting in that wing chair . Not many , and not often , and not for long . But what of j it ? He did n't start worrying about them , did he ? He did n't want them there all the time , did he ? He reached for a cigarette , saw the tightly wadded sandwich paper in his fist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , inhaled once , and moved over to the chair . He sat there for a minute or so , immobile , one hand and forearm stretched on the curving arm of the chair . The cigarette ash lengthened and fell off , made a scattered heap on the dark rough fabric . His eyes caught the ashes finally and he grunted , blew them off , and went over to his coat . Taking the folded copy of the Courier from a pocket , he came back to the chair and sat down . The late-edition head was smaller than the previous ones : LAWYER SLAIN AFTER PARTY He read the story , which jumped over to page three . It contained nothing new . There was a smaller onecolumn head adjoining the account . GANGSTER SOUGHT IN REDFIELD SLAYING Sam Cusick , notorious South End gangster , listed in the District Attorney 's office as Public Enemy number 14 and  | wanted by police for questioning in the Redfield murder , was still at large late this afternoon . Through a statement offered by a man whose identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely established that Cusick was at the scene of the crime in the early hours of the morning . Detective Fallon of Station 6 , who recognized Cusick on the street before the killing was discovered , and attempted to question him .. . Murdock snorted impatiently and threw the paper aside . He stood up , crushed out his cigarette , and started towards the kitchenette . He was about half-way across the room when he heard the door open , and he turned quickly , then stiffened there as his muscles tensed . A small , scrawny-looking man stood on the threshold , a heavy automatic in his hand . He had a thin sallow face with close-set eyes and a long , drooping nose that looked boneless . His blue coat was tight-fitting , his felt hat was the lightest of grays , and his gloves matched the hat . In the moment that he stood there motionless , the rat-like eyes flicked about the room , seemed to move in all directions at once . And they seemed satisfied with what they saw . He spoke over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed in behind him . " Looks like it 's okay , Hymie , " he grunted . He put the automatic in the coat pocket , where it pulled the cloth out of shape and made a threatening forward bulge . He came slowly forward as Hymie closed the door . Murdock made his voice casual . " Hello , Cusick. "  | 11 PHIL DOANE PROWLED around police headquarters for some time after Keogh slammed the door in his face , but his prowling , from the standpoint of news values , was fruitless and he finally returned to the press-room on the first floor . He watched the penny-ante game for a while and was tempted . He went into the washroom and counted his change . Twenty-eight cents . Might as well be broke as this way . Well , maybe not . He had to get some supper and there had been some trouble about credit at the Greasy Spoon . He went back , sat down on a window-sill , and watched the play . Larkin of the Globe picked at his nose , screwed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his left , finally said : " I wonder has he got ' em . " Mason lifted the cigarette from the charred groove in the long table ; he puffed once on it with a bored , uninterested lift of the brows . " For a nickel , " he said airily , " you can find out . " " Somebody 's got to keep him honest ? " Doane looked away , stared out on the parked cars in the walled courtyard with sultry eyes . Damn Keogh . Why the hell did he have to be on homicide ? A guy as unreasonable and thick-headed as that ought to be out walking a beat . Eight months Doane had been working for the Herald ,  | and he had made out fairly well until he had that trouble . I le flattered Keogh , kidded him along , gave him cigan Ues , bought him beers , finally got in his good graces . And then Keogh had given him a little break and let him iu a cheap room in the South End where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see that he got some publicity . And so he had written the story . It was a honey . Good for a column , anyway . He turned and spat on the floor . how the hell could he know Van Husan would queer everything ? " Very nice , " the city editor had said when Doane put the neatly typed story on the desk . Van Husan had nodded his head without looking up , so that all Doane could see was the sandy hair and green eyeshade bobbing up and down . " Very nice . You 've got some swell adjectives ; the spelling is good . Real human interest , too . But " ? Doane remembered how the voice cracked ? " who the hell ever heard of this dame ? Nobody living at that address is worth more than a paragraph , and I 'm probably double-crossing the public at that ! " But you could n't explain that to Keogh . His name was n't in that paragraph and that was all that mattered . To hear him tell it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing him for a sucker . He looked over Mason 's shoulder . Why , the nut was holding a kicker to a pair of jacks and drawing two cards ! Well , to hell with it ; let him get burned . Doane stood up and went into the adjoining press-room , now deserted . He took off his sweat-stained felt , tried to put a new crease in it , and found the task impossible . Searching the  | pockets of his old herring-bone suit , he found a crumpled pack of cigarettes . There were three left and he took the one that looked the loosest , straightened it out , and lit it . He dropped into a chair , tilted it back , cocked his heels on the table , and let his eyes wander . There was a brown steel locker in the corner . He wondered what the hell it was for and quit wondering when he realized he did n't give a damn . Murdock . Now , there was a guy with something on the ball . The only thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into something , and this Redfield thing  --  why , he 'd even been on the party . The conviction grew without much assistance . Murdock got peeved and grouchy and he bawled a guy out sometimes ; but he did not do it in a nasty way . And he 'd give you a break if you were around . It would be better to stick with him , maybe even follow him around , than go back to the office and have Van Husan stick him on some Ladies ' Debating Society meeting . One good story was all he needed  --  just one good enough to make Van Husan push up that green eyeshade . A story like that would put him right . The thought grew , and the more he considered it , the more delightful it became . The prospect lulled his worries . He yawned and slipped farther down in the chair and pulled the hat down over his eyes . Only he ought to get more sleep nights . . . . " Come on , snap out of it ! Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair as he started to rise . Finally stumbling erect , he blinked into the grinning face of Tyler , the Courier 's regular police reporter .  | Doane said : " What ? " stupidly . " You got ta cut out the snorin ' , " Tyler said , going back to the other room , " you 're spoiling the game . We ca n't concentrate . " Doane looked out the window , and a sudden chill settled over him , brought with it the weakness of dismay . It was still light out , but it was getting darker ; the gloom within the room was thick . Then the return of the thought which had put him to sleep jerked him to sudden action . He slid into the corridor and ran down its length , heels rapping on the tiled flooring , coat-tails flying . At the little information desk just inside the entrance , he flung to the uniformed policeman on duty : " You see Kent Murdock ? He come out yet ? " " Murdock ? " The policeman scowled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doane groaned and his spirits collapsed . He went down the steps and out into the cool shadows of late afternoon , walked down to Boylston Street , and found a public telephone . He counted his change , finally dropped the nickel into the slot with the grudging , desperate manner of a man spending his last penny . The Courier-Herald operator informed him Murdock had been there and left , and Doane set out in the direction of Murdock 's apartment , a stocky figure tramping sightlessly down the street , his head down , oblivious of the bustle and rush of the home-going crowds . He approached Embankment Arms from the opposite side of the street and stopped there on the curb to light a cigarette and reconsider . As he tossed aside the match , a taxi pulled up in front of the marquee , and the door-  | man opened the door . Doane was half-way across the street before he recognized the smaller of the two men who started through the revolving doors . The effect of this recognition was instantaneous , breath-taking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavement , trying to conquer the panicky excitement which gripped him . Uncertainty held him there until the driver of a speeding taxi which ticked his coat-tails as it passed told him to get out of the street with concise and explicit profanity . " Boy ! " breathed Doane as he gained the safety of the curb , " Sam Cusick ! " Murdock remained motionless , a tight fixed smile on his lips , until Cusick gained the center of the room ; then he moved forward . Hymie continued to lean against the door , and Murdock gave him a quick , searching glance . The glance was sufficient to show the type . A squarish face given over almost entirely to jaw ; a flattened nose , and ears that were bent ; long arms and a practiced scowl , as though the fellow had learned the routine in the wrestling ring . Cusick 's lips twitched in what might have been his conception of a grin . " You see the papers ? " Murdock did not answer , but he nodded his head . Cusick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast aside . " It had been definitely established ' , " he leered , " that Cusick was at the scene of the crime in the early hours of the morning ' . " He threw the paper from him . " Now , " he said grimly , " I wonder how they found that out . "  | Murdock picked his coat and hat from the davenport . Moving diagonally in front of Cusick and ignoring the man , he opened the jade box , took out a cigarette . He flung the coat on the chair arm , still clung to the hat . The movement seemed to anger Cusick . " I told you about that over the phone . " " I remember , " Murdock said , and struck flame to a match . He sat down on the chair arm on his coat before he lit the cigarette ; he inhaled and blew out the match before he spoke . " But I 'd already spilled the story and you know it . " " You went down to headquarters this afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there to take pictures  --  not that long . " Murdock looked at the end of his cigarette , and his face was somber . He could not kid himself about Cusick . He might mean trouble and he might not . He would eventually if the police did not pick him up . He looked up at Cusick , spoke flatly . " Why do n't you get wise to yourself ? You ca n't run around loose forever . They 'll pick you up , and the longer you wait , the tougher it 'll be for you . " " It 'll be plenty tough anyway . " Cusick shifted his position , moving slightly away from the door . " I 'm in a spot and I know it . They 're gon na try and hang this thing on me . There are two guys who know where I was last night . You 're one of ' em . I 'm gon na treat you both alike . Know what I mean ? " " Not exactly , " Murdock said . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm clear . I can go down and take my licking  | for putting the slug on that dick this morning , but that 'll be all . So you 're not gon na talk . If you ever ? " The knock on the door was startling , so loud it seemed to shake the room . An explosion of hushed silence followed . No one moved . It was as if in a second they had all been struck dumb and immobile . Then Cusick 's gun came out . Hymie sprang away from the door ; a gruff voice called : " Open up in there ! " Cusick , now standing about six feet from Murdock , recoiled into a quick crouch and the forty-five automatic bulked enormous in his skinny hand as it swung to cover the photographer . Murdock sensed the trend of the man 's reaction . The eyes squinted , widened , and again seemed to look in all directions at once as the irises dilated into whites . Cusick may not have come to kill , but the impulse , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakably , and Murdock knew it . He whipped out : " There 's a back door . " Hymie started for the inner hall . Cusick set himself with a shuffling movement of his feet and lipped : " Why , you bastard ! " Murdock was too far away from the gun to hope to reach it . He did the only thing he could think of in that instant 's respite . He snapped the hat with a quick flip of the wrist , sailed it into Cusick 's face as the trigger finger tensed , then threw himself backwards into the chair . He did not see the hat strike , but he did see Cusick 's instinctive duck . The gun roared as he fell . He went dear over , struck the floor on the back of his neck , carry-  | ing the chair on top of him . He huddled there until he heard the pound of racing feet , the slam of the back door ; then he pushed the chair aside , rolled to his knees , and stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . His face was pallid , glistening with sweat ; the hand trembled on the knob . And then , curiously enough , he remembered . The door was not locked . Why the hell ? He jerked it open . Doane , white-faced and slack-jawed , stood in the hall . There was no one else , but Murdock had to step out and look down the corridor before he would believe it . He went back into the room and straightened the chair without saying a word . By the time he finished , the tremble had gone from his hands . He took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his forehead . Doane looked just as scared as ever , and the sight of him relieved Murdock 's tension , brought a grudging smile to his lips . He said : " How come ? " thickly . " I saw him come in , " Doane said huskily , and color began to seep into his round , youthful face . " I came up the stairs and found he 'd stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to get the police and ? well , hell , I had to do something . " " Yeh , " Murdock admitted , " and you sure as hell put the pressure on me . But you had an idea and the guts to try it . You were in there swinging , and that counts for plenty . " He went over and picked up his hat and coat . " Come on , I 'll buy a dinner . " Doane 's face cracked wide open in a grin . " With cock-tails ? "  | " And a liqueur . " " Hall ! " Doane cried . Then as his face sobered : " But ? I mean , how about the story ? Could n't I make something out of it or ? " " Call Van Husan when we get out , " Murdock said . " I do n't think he can fire you for this sort of thing . " Kent Murdock was reading when Joyce Archer came into the apartment at ten o'clock . A slim blond vision in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the door , her hand on the knob . Murdock put down the magazine and stood up before he noticed the small black overnight case in her other hand . Surprise was in his lean face , and when the surprise subsided he became conscious of something else , a definite tingling of his skin and a certain warmth of body as though he were meeting an old friend . This feeling persisted until she drew closer and the light revealed her face more clearly . It was not make-up this time ; it was a genuine flush . The lips were pressed into a thin line , and the eyes were smoky , as though to give warning of smoldering , hidden fires . She said , finally : " Can I stay here ? " and her voice was jerky , low . Murdock 's warmth died away . His face got impassive and he said : " No , " a bit sharply , because he meant it . Joyce Archer paled and seemed to catch her breath , but her eyes met Murdock 's defiantly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started past him . He took her arm , reaching down with the other hand to grasp  | the bag . When she let go of it he drew her over to the davenport , eased her down on it . " Tell me about it . " " There 's nothing to tell . I 'm sick of my way of living . " " Maybe you are , but you ca n't stay here and you know it . You 're too young to be carrying around that kind of a reputation . " " Reputation ? " The word flared out . " Who cares about it ? It 's mine , is n't it ? " Murdock moved to the mantelpiece , offered her the red-lacquered cigarette-box , held a light . The first inhale seemed to help her . Her words were less sharp . She had control now , but she went ahead with her idea . " What 's the matter with me ? I 'm as good-looking as the average ; I 'm supposed to have a reasonably good mind ; I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got nice legs . " " You 've got a lot more than that , but there are some things you ca n't waste . " " You mean you do n't like me well enough . " " I mean I 'm married , for one thing , and ? " " Oh . Then I 'm the one doing the compromising . " The tone was contemptuous now and Murdock , stung by it , flushed darkly . He tried to go on , to speak reasonably . " You could at least be consistent . You 're not coming here like a girl offering herself on the altar of love . " The sarcasm crept in in spite of himself . " You came here with a grouch and you want me to ? " " I came here because I liked you and the decent way  | you acted today . I thought I could get a little kindness and perhaps some understanding . I 'm old enough to know what I 'm doing , what I want . " " What did they do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were courteous and  --  it 's not that . I want a friend , that 's all . It 's been a long time since I 've had one , and no one can ask me to believe the world is kind and good to everyone . I 'm not equipped for an idealist . " Murdock said : " Suppose I make a drink . Maybe you can be honest with me then . But whether you can or not , you ca n't stay here this way . " He saw her color rise and he felt awkward before the hurt look in her eyes . He wanted to help , but he knew there was something behind the girl 's outburst , something that had possessed her temporarily and destroyed reason . He wanted her to stay , hated himself for it so that he became more determined than ever to make her see things as they were . He turned towards the kitchenette , but the knock came at the door before he had taken a step . Lifting the startled girl and her overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom and closed the door . The knock sounded again as he went back to the wing chair . He settled himself , called : " Come in . " Howard Archer came into the room like a whirlwind , slammed the door , and stopped so quickly his coat curled around his legs . Unmistakable anger suffused his thin face , and he gave Murdock no chance to speak .  | " I suppose you know you 're a dirty swine , Murdock , " lie lipped . " Yeh ? " Murdock returned easily . " Sit down and tell me about it . " Archer ignored the invitation . He strode forward , glancing suspiciously about the room as he moved , and finally stopped directly in front of the chair . " Where 's my sister ? " he growled . " Your sister ? " It was the best Murdock could offer then , because he knew now why Joyce had come to him , why she had seemed so overwrought . An accepted sliver of bitterness followed on the heels of his disappointment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but " Your innocence amazes me , " leered Archer . " Well , I 've come to get her . " " You 're taking a lot for granted , " Murdock said flatly , " and I 'm not sure I like your tone . " Archer 's eyes fastened on the doorway to the inner hall . They swung to Murdock , back to the hall . He started forward . Murdock came out of the chair and intercepted him before he reached the doorway . Stubbornness rose within him . He had argued to make the girl leave , now he was arguing with her brother to prevent his taking her . He said : " Where did you get the idea you could break in this apartment and search it as you pleased ? " Archer 's look was angry , contemptuous , so that his upper lip curled as he spoke . " I know what happened last night and this morning . That was n't enough , I suppose . You had to keep her here all day . And now , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like the spoiled kid she is , and you take her in . " Murdock kept silent with an effort . It was not his fight . He had to keep his head  --  accept this because Howard was her brother . " Well , " Archer went on , " that part does n't surprise me . It 's just the sort of thing you 're looking for , is n't it ? The sort of cheap rotten trick I could expect from a fellow with your background . A newspaper photographer . " The words were deliberately insulting and Murdock 's face went gray and stiff . " You 're the kind , " Archer flared , " that would take anything he could get and ? " The bedroom door opened violently . Joyce Archer 's angry face appeared in the opening and her eyes were blazing . " Howard , you 're a beast ! An obnoxious beast ! " The effect of this was to rob Archer of further speech . Murdock just turned and stared at the girl for a moment , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " Archer finally muttered , pulling himself together . He stepped towards her , seized her wrist roughly . " Well , young lady , you 're going home with me . " " I am not ! " she tried to pull away . " Are you out of your head ? " She set her lips . " I ought to whale hell out of you . You ca n't do a thing like this and ? " " I ca n't ? Why ca n't I ? I 'm of age . If you can chase around after Rita Redfield  --  and behind her husband 's  | back  --  I can do the same thing . You would n't listen to ' he ; why should I listen to you ? Who do you think you are to ? " " That 's different , " fumed Archer . " It 's just that narrow , double-standard mind of yours . " Joyce Archer freed her wrist . She drew back into the doorway . Archer grunted savagely and grabbed for her again . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . Then the door slammed , the lock clicked sharply . Archer turned on Murdock , started to speak , then grabbed the door-knob , jerked at it , pounding the panels with his fist . Joyce Archer 's muffled voice came through the panels . " Pound ! Go ahead and pound ! I 'm here and I 'm going to stay here until you get some of the sense you think I ought to have . " Archer began to curse softly and continued to tug at the door until Murdock grabbed him , spun him about . In the shadows of the hall the two men faced each other , Archer furious , breathing hard ; Murdock calm , cold . " I do n't believe I like you , Archer , " he said , and there was an enigmatic menace in the metallic ring of his words . " I do n't think I ever liked you . And right now you 're intruding . Your sister seems to have something of the same idea , so it goes for both of us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want it in plain American , " Murdock interrupted , " beat it ! " Archer met his gaze for a moment , finally turned  | stiffly away and went into the lighted living-room . By the time he reached the door , his voice was once more bitter , disdainful . " If you think you can get away with this , you 're mistaken . I 'll be back with the police . She 'd better not be here when ? " " The police ? " Murdock 's brows lifted in mock surprise . " She 's of age , is n't she ? " " But you 're married and ? " " That 's right . " Murdock 's seriousness was sheer mockery . " But under the circumstances  --  she came here of her own accord  --  the one thing I can think of is circumstantial evidence of what the papers call a statutory offense . Drag her through that sort of a mess if that 's the sort of a heel you are . " Murdock stepped round Archer and opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek-bones white and taut . " So far , " he warned , " I 'm the only one here who 's kept his temper . Get out before I lose it . " He stood staring at the panels for some seconds after Archer had slammed out of the room , and his sigh was like a shrug as he turned and started slowly across the room . He went down the hall , knocking at the bedroom door and calling : " All right , he 's gone , " as he passed . At the kitchenette cupboard he took out the Scotchbottle and a glass . He poured a drink and took it neat in an absent sort of way , not bothering to replace the bottle . When he came back down the hall , the bedroom door was still closed and he knocked again . This time  | her voice called : " Come in . " Murdock hesitated wonderingly , then took the knob . It turned freely and the door opened . He took a step forward , stopped on the threshold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins with an accelerated speed and left his ears pounding . Joyce Archer was in bed . She had pulled the covers up under her armpits so that there was exposed only the tanned shoulders , two thin straps of heavy-looking tearose silk . Her blond hair , fanned out on the pillow , framed a face that seemed unnaturally pale . " You ca n't ? " Murdock began . " I can . " This stubbornly . He did not answer then . He looked away , saw the tweed suit draped on the chair-back , some silken things on top of it . He took out a cigarette , but he did not light it . After a while he stepped to the bed , sat down on the near side , away from her . " So that was the reason , " he said and made his voice casually humorous . " Spite . " " It 's nauseating , " she answered quickly . " The way he 's been chasing her . Oh , I suppose it 's not his fault entirely . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night ? You 'd think this was the one thing they had been waiting for . " " You 're not very complimentary , " Murdock mused . " He would n't listen to you , and you had a fight , and you got a mad on and came rushing over here with your dramatics . " " I hate you ! " Joyce Archer flushed and flipped over in bed , her head turned away from him .  | " And , " Murdock went on , unperturbed , " I almost thought you came here because you wanted to . Suppose I had believed you ? Suppose your brother had not come to explain for you ? " She turned back . " Well ? " " Oh ! " Murdock smiled a little then . " So you were willing to go that far to spite him . " " I 'm going to stay right here , " she said obstinately . " All right . " Murdock stood up . " You 're going to stay right here until you bring him to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer he went on slowly as though to accent his words : " Well , if that 's the way it is ? " He came round the foot of the bed to the closet door , opened it . He took off his coat and waistcoat , hung them on a clothes-hanger . He pulled out the knot of his tie , took it off , and began to unbutton his shirt . Then he reached into the closet and brought out a pair of tan pyjamas and the green dressing-gown . In all this time he had not looked at her . Then he turned suddenly , in time to catch her expression before it changed . The blue eyes were very round . The bedside lamp made non-existent hollows with the shadows of her cheek-bones ; the red , full mouth was slightly open . When it closed under his glance the effect of her face was an unnatural tenseness and he grinned , genuinely then , and sat down on the bed . " You 're scared , are n't you ? " " W-well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm glad you are . " The corners of Murdock 's eyes wrinkled in a grin that was unusual for him  --  it seemed  | a bit wistful . " And you 're a good egg , and I hope I 'm not that much of a mug . The odds have got to be more even . " There may have been a trace of disappointment along with the relieved surprise in Joyce Archer 's glance . Murdock could not be sure . He stood up , reached into the closet again , and hauled out a blanket . At the door he stopped . " The davenport is long enough . I measured it before I bought it . " He opened the door . " You know , I think I 'm beginning to like you . " 12 MEN KENT MURDOCK reached the office the next morning , Phil Doane waylaid him and tagged along to the photographic department . " Got anything new ? " he asked . " On what ? " " Why , the Redfield thing . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting anything . " He stretched out in the chair . That davenport was n't as good as he thought . His neck was stiff . Joyce had been fast asleep when he left  --  and the door was unlocked . He had peeked in at her , then tiptoed in for another suit , but she had not wakened . He realized Doane was talking and the interruption on his more  | pleasurable thoughts irked him . " You 're getting to be a pest . " " Aw , now ? " Doane pleaded . " I just want to play along . You 're one of those guys that 's always stumbling onto hot pictures  --  and there 's always got ta be a story , ai n't there ? If I ? " " All right , all right , " Murdock cut in impatiently , but not unkindly . " If I get anything , I 'll let you know . And if you 've really got enough drive to help out , go find Spike Tripp for me . I want to talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doane said . This statement was a gross exaggeration . For the next two days developments in the Redfield murder were of no importance . Newspapers were filled with stories headed with variations of : CUSICK STILL AT LARGE and ARREST EXPECTED IN REDFIELD CASE . Murdock 's assignments were routine : a fire , the results of automobile accidents , the arrival of an Italian cruiser . Then on the third morning Doane had barged into the office , his face flushed and eager . " I found Tripp , " he gasped . Murdock snapped aside his newspaper . " Where ? " " Down at Teddy 's place . " Murdock stood up , grabbed for his hat and coat . Undecided upon taking his regular camera and bulky plate-case , he compromised by taking his small camera , which was still in his desk . Doane said : " Can I go ? " " I suppose so , " Murdock answered , but paid little attention to him . They went out to the corridor , started down towards the elevators side by side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting into the car . " Hey ! " He grabbed Doane . " Van Husan 's looking for you . " The young reporter went all to pieces . He sputtered , looked pleadingly at Murdock , who had entered the car . The office boy said : " He 's waiting . " The elevator boy said : " Make up your mind . " Doane turned away , a forlorn figure , his rubicund face melancholy , dejected . " Do n't forget , now , " he begged , " if you run into anything . " Teddy 's place , just off Stuart Street , between Broadi way and Eliott , is a long , narrow , gloomy room opening on an alley . The bar is old , heavy-looking ; the floor is a linoleum imitation of tile , and the half-dozen tables at the rear are of the kitchen variety with no covering . The brightness of daylight was in Murdock 's eyes when he entered the place , and at first the only thing he was conscious of was the smell of stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw that aside from a solitary beer-drinker who was scowling into his glass at the bar , the only other customer was a man at the rearmost table next to the door . That man was Spike Tripp , and he looked suspiciously at Murdock , seemed uncertain about his next move . Murdock 's attitude was confidence itself . He said : " Hello , Spike , " cordially and pulled out a chair . " What 're you drinking ? " The invitation helped . Spike thawed out a bit , grunted a greeting , adding : " The same  --  rye . " Murdock called the order , taking a beer himself . He said : " Where you been hiding ? " as he sat down .  | " Me ? I 've been around . Why ? " Murdock reached for a cigarette . He was not ready to say why until Tripp 's suspicions were allayed . The main reason , he admitted to himself , was little more than a hunch . Just something that Cusick had said that night when Doane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who know where I was last night . " If Spike Tripp was one of them A waiter with a dirty white apron and long pointed mustaches brought the drinks , and Murdock paid him . Ile gestured a silent toast to Tripp , tasted the beer , and studied the fellow over the top of his glass . Born Tsiknas , Spike Tripp had been a fair welterweight until the grind of training became too much of an ordeal . Then , because work was anathema to him , he had drifted about , trying whatever easy-money chance presented itself . His activities in past years had been many and varied , all of them questionable . It is doubtful if any one person knew the extent of his endeavors , but his police record  --  a not particularly vicious one as police records go  --  gave some indication of his natural talents . He had been a bootlegger of the split-case variety . He had been a collector for a nigger pool impresario ; he had served an apprenticeship with slot machines until two rival factions went to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got out . More recently he had been a racetrack tout and his current venture was on his own : running a tipster sheet on the Rockingham meeting . The police and the underworld have a word for the type : punk . Ordinarily good-natured , reasonably harmless , he was a slow-witted , thickset fellow in his middle  | thirties , broad-jawed , with no bridge to his nose , and the leathery skin of his face decorated at one cheek-bone with a strip of adhesive tape . " Why ? " Murdock repeated the word as he put down his glass . " Because I did n't get a chance to talk to you that night at Redfield 's place . I heard you were out on bail and " Sure . They got nothing on me . I told ' em that . But those guys ai n't happy unless they 're workin ' over some poor mug like me that ai n't got any influence . Take a gander at this " ? he pointed to the strip of tape on his cheek-bone ? " always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a raw deal , " Murdock said , making his voice sympathetic . " But , at that , it must 've looked fishy , your hiding up in that hall closet . " " You 've got to hide from guys like Keogh . How the hell did I know somebody had bumped Redfield off ? Would I been hangin ' around there waitin ' to get picked up if I 'd known it ? What do they use for brains down there at headquarters , anyway ? " Murdock took another sip of beer . " Did you try to run out on them ? " " Well ? " Spike shrugged . " I see all these dicks swarmin ' over the place ? " " From that closet you could see Redfield 's door okay , huh ? " " Sure . I could see the door and the elevator and the back stairs , and when I lamp the coppers , I lay low till things quiet down . As soon as the hall is empty , I take a sneak for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never gets a break . Keogh sticks his pan into the hall just  | as I pass Redfield 's door , and there I am . " " They 'd probably got you anyway , " Murdock said . " They would have searched the halls and closets . " He hesitated , continued casually : " But from where you were , you could see everybody that went in and out of the party , huh ? " " Sure , I ? " Spike broke off as though he had chewed off the next word . He picked up his whisky glass , tossed down the drink , and reached for the chaser of water . When he looked up again , his little eyes were shifty , wary . His voice was suddenly suspicious . " You 're tryin ' to prove something , huh ? What ? " Murdock sought another answer , picked up an idea out of thin air , and went ahead with it , his voice confidential . " Listen . Do n't get me wrong . I 'm not a cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 've had some trouble with my wife . I was at that party for a while . Girard was there with her . I thought maybe you saw them come out . " Tripp seemed to relax , and his voice sounded relieved . " Oh , I get it . Well ? " He hesitated , fiddled with his glass , and seemed undecided . When he went on , however , there was no trace of uncertainty in his manner . " I did n't see ' em . It 's like I told the cops . I did n't come in till quarter of five and I ? " The suddenness with which Tripp stopped the sentence jerked Murdock 's eyes from the table . The man 's gaze was riveted on some distant object over his shoulder ; his feet shifted and both hands were on the table edge , white-knuckled , tense . He sucked in his breath and  | pushed up before Murdock could turn around , pushed ( II ) and spun away from the table into the adjoining doorway with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doorway was empty when Murdock said : " Hey ! " ! ! e grunted disgustedly and turned around . A tall and rather thin silhouette was moving through the street ent rance . Murdock recognized the outlines after a moment and went to meet the man who was moving slowly towards him . He said : " He saw you coming . " " Tripp ? " Lieutenant Bacon stopped dead still , fairly shouted the word . Then , cursing under his breath , he ran down the length of the room and out the back door . Murdock was waiting at the bar when Bacon returned two or three minutes later , and the Lieutenant took him by the arm . " Why did n't you stop him ? " he charged . " Damn it all ! What the hell good are you if you ca n't ? " " Wait a minute , " Murdock said flatly , and pulled his arm free . " He was facing the door ; I was n't . He saw you first and he was out before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help , okay . But I 'm a photographer , not a cop . " Bacon spun about without a word , glared at the bartender , and started for the door . Murdock followed him out , and when Bacon got in the rear seat of the police phaeton , Murdock crowded in behind him without waiting for an invitation . Bacon did not seem to object , did not seem conscious that Murdock was beside him until after he had given the uniformed chauffeur an address on Hemenway Street . The car pulled out from the curb sharply , rolled down  | the one-way street and round the block to Stuart Street . Neither man spoke until they crossed the railroad bridge and angled into Huntington Avenue . Then Bacon , whose annoyance had subsided somewhat , leaving his lean face impassive , turned and spoke suspiciously . " What were you talking to him for ? " " I had a hunch , " Murdock said evenly , " a hunch that maybe he saw more than he told you about . I wanted to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs hall at any time before a quarter of five . " " How long you had the hunch ? " pressed Bacon sharply . " A couple days . But I could n't locate him and ? " " You held out . " Bacon 's tone was irritated , accusing . " Held out ? " exploded Murdock . " Do n't be silly . It was just a half-baked idea . If I ran to you with every one I got , I 'd run myself ragged ; you too . " " Maybe , " Bacon said morosely , " only this time you were right . " " Oh . " Murdock 's brows knotted at the bridge of his nose . " Yeah . " Bacon leaned back on the seat , hesitated as they turned right on Massachusetts Avenue . " If I could do all the checking myself I could get some place , maybe . But no , I let some fat-head do routine stuff and where does it get me ? In jams . " Bacon did not elaborate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in front of a gray brick apartment house of four stories , one of a long row that , no longer trying to be smart , now seemed content  | to rest upon its uncertain age and a reputation of reasonable respectability . The girl who opened the door of Apartment 3-B was the entertainer whom Murdock had last seen lying on the bed in the blue room of Redfield 's apartment . She was small , trim-figured , and young - looking . Her black hair was cut short so that it lay upon her round head like enamel . The face , pinched slightly , powdered a bit too heavily , was pretty in a common sort of way . She said : " What do you want ? " and her dark eyes were wary . " We want to come in a minute , " Bacon said . He said it so casually that the girl did not realize that he was putting his words into action until he had eased her aside and was half-way through the door . The girl 's eyes glazed angrily then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady pressure of Bacon 's shoulder on the panel . " You ca n't bust in here , " she raged . " I 've got friends and ? " Bacon said : " Hello , Spike , " and then Murdock caught a glimpse of the fellow over Bacon 's shoulder . The girl quieted down immediately . Murdock shut the door and she followed Bacon , who moved over to the plush-covered , hot-looking sofa and sat down on one arm at the opposite end from Spike Tripp . Murdock glanced around a small , over-furnished living-room that tried hard to be smart and failed miserably . He circled around by the windows at the right side ,  | dropped down in an imitation Windsor chair in front of a cheaply veneered Governor Winthrop desk . The girl remained standing , but the rise and fall of her solidlooking bosom was rapid , spasmodic . Tripp shook his head wearily . " Christ ! You guys are worse'n the itch ! " Bacon said : " What did you run out on me for down at Teddy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted and made an expression of surprise . " It was n't that . Only I had a date with Marie " ? he glanced at the girl and grinned ? " and I thought you might start askin ' me a lot of questions , and then I 'd be late , and Marie always makes trouble when I 'm late . " Bacon 's face got red . He looked at Murdock and shook his head . Tripp continued innocently : " What was it you wanted , Lieutenant ? " Bacon said : " Let 's take a ride . " " Ride ? " Tripp forgot his act . " What for ? " he growled . " I 'm out on bail , ai n't I ? You ca n't ? " " Who says so ? " Bacon rapped . " That night operator at Redfield 's place said you came in at four-forty-five and we let it go at that . The guy I had checkin ' the building muffed one  --  as usual . I only just found out today that they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go up the fire stairs at three-fifteen that mornin ' . She was in the fifth-floor hall and she saw you go round the corner and start up . And then I found that my friend the operator remembered he had to go to the can at just about that time . He was off the desk fdr about five minutes . We  | were concentrating too much on the time after threethirty to follow through . What were you walkin ' up for ? " " Because I did n't know how the sixth floor was laid out . For all I knew , the elevator might 've gone right to Redfield 's entrance . I just thought I ought to get off at the fifth and walk up ; then I 'd be sure not to get thrown cit . " " That 's all right . " Bacon nodded in satisfaction . " I just wanted to know if you were there . " " But I went right out again , " Tripp protested . " When I heard the music , I knew the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went out and came back at a quarter of five . " " So you say , " Bacon grunted . " But if you did you went out the back way . And that 's one I called right . Remember ? I said you came back for an alibi . " " I did n't , " Tripp argued , " I came back in to get Marie . " Bacon stood up . " Maybe I can make you remember better down at my place . I got a room that was built for guys like you . And I 'll tell you what really happened ; let 's see if I can guess right twice . You hung around up on the sixth floor until some time after the party broke up  --  waiting for her " ? he nodded towards the girl , whose face had gone white . " And while you were there you stuck in that closet and saw what you could see . Because you 're that kind of a guy . We 've had a tip before that you made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might mean business , huh ? And you stayed right there . And I want to know who came back after that party broke up  --  and what time and all about it . "  | Tripp 's little eyes shifted from Bacon , sought the girl . As they fastened upon her he shook his head . It was just a slight , almost imperceptible movement , yet it was enough for one with her schooling . She was standing less than two feet from the Lieutenant , and he was not looking at her . So when she jabbed out with both arms stiff and all her weight behind them , he slid off the end of the davenport and fell over towards the middle of it with his face on the cushions . Murdock was on his feet in an instant , but the flash of Tripp 's arm as he sprang from the davenport was even quicker . The small automatic appeared from nowhere and swung to cover him . Tripp backed into the inner doorway just as Bacon recovered and regained his feet . Bacon cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble ! " He took a step forward . " Lay off ! " rasped Tripp . " You 're not gon na take me down and beat the pants off me . Not till I get a chance to ? " " Put it down ! " Bacon 's voice was sharp with the ring of authority . If he felt any uncertainty , he did not show it . He did not reach for his own gun ; he just moved slowly forward , his manner assured , confident . Tripp stopped in the doorway . His face went gray and his gun arm stiffened ; the knuckles of his hand got white . Murdock held his breath , was the first to notice the blur of motion behind Bacon . In those four or five seconds no one had paid any attention to Marie , and for the second time she did her part . She cursed shrilly and threw herself upon Bacon 's back , her arms around his neck , her hands clenched under  | his chin . Bacon spun angrily , whirling the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway . From somewhere beyond , a door slammed as Murdock leaped forward and Bacon threw the girl roughly to the davenport . Murdock and Bacon reached the locked door together . Bacon hammered at it , and Marie was upon him again , pulling at his arm . " Break it ! " she shrilled . " Break it , you lousy police bastard , and I 'll have you ? " Bacon jerked away from the door , bumping into the girl and knocking her to the floor . He continued down the short hall to the kitchen , with Murdock right behind him . There was a single window here and Bacon threw it up , leaned out . Murdock squeezed into the frame beside him . There was a fire-escape touching the adjoining window of the locked room . Murdock saw that this window was open . Then , looking down , he saw Tripp just disappearing round the corner of the building into the alley . Bacon pulled his head in and closed the window . He looked at Murdock , groaned from deep down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool thing to do . We 'll pick him up , all right . But now we 'll have to get real rough with him . " Marie was lighting a cigarette in the living-room when they went back . Her face was still flushed , her eyes hard , gloating . Bacon picked up his hat and she said : " If you want to make anything of it ? " Bacon said : " So far you 've done all right . " He stepped towards her , his wrist cocking . " But how would you like  | a slap in the mouth for yourself ? " Marie completely forgot her bravado . She squealed and threw up a protecting hand as she cringed . Bacon grunted and strode to the door . " Come on , " he said to Murdock . " There 's a way of handling tarts like her too . But what 's the use ? I shoulda got tough before . " 13 STOPPING IN AT his apartment as he did at three o'clock that afternoon was something that Murdock would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way back to the office with some unimportant pictures of an Industrial Exhibit he passed within two blocks of his apartment . And just about that time he decided he was thirsty . For the first time in three days there was no one to greet him as he opened the door . Ever since the night Howard had come to take his sister home , the argument between Murdock and the girl had continued . But each time she won out , at least to the extent of staying on . She was , he realized , as stubborn about this one thing as he was . It had become a complex . She would stay , she ruled , until Howard had the decency to drop his affair with Rita Redfield . It was no longer a question open to reason . Howard Archer 's actions could be justified or not , but Joyce had determined her own course and she hewed to the line . So far it had done no good . Howard Archer had not come back .  | Murdock placed the camera and plate-case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat into the wing chair , and lit a cigarette . He was , he realized , no longer thirsty . He sat down , crossed his legs . The past three days had been much the same as before . He worked ; he did not know how she spent her time . It was the evenings that made the difference . They had dinner together each night . After that they came home and read  --  except the time when they went to the movies and stopped for a few dances at the Copley . There was no longer any uncertainty about the ending of the evening . Each time she was the first to uncurl from her spot on the davenport and go into the bedroom . And , after the first night , she brought out a sheet and a blanket and a pillow and made a bed for him . Nothing was said , directly or by inference , about that first night . " I hope she took her bag with her , " Murdock said , and straightened his legs . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood up and went out to the kitchen , resisting the almost overpowering impulse to look in the bedroom . He 'd done his part , had n't he ? He had given in to her all along the line , treated her decently , considerately . He knew she liked him for this acceptance , this manner of treatment . But the thing could n't go on indefinitely . She was old enough to know that . He spent a long time with the drink , dumping the ice cubes , rinsing three of them , pouring the Scotch , and squirting in the foaming soda from the siphon . It was a relief , all right , to be alone and feel he could do as he pleased , forget everything else . Newspaper work and liv-  | ing alone were making him crusty , set in his ways . He had II to watch his language when she was around or he 'd be talking like a photographer . Tasting the drink , he went into the living-room . It seemed empty . He 'd been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virulent mood sought an outlet in criticism and he glanced around , an expression of distaste on his wide mouth . Nearly two years now . Since Hestor . One thing : nothing of her influence remained . She had taken most of their things with her . The few she had left he had gradually replaced . But he needed a change . Rents were a lot cheaper now . He could do better with a quieter place , or one higher up . Get a bigger place for the same money . He drank some more of his drink , paced the floor with the glass in his hand , finally stopped at the davenport and stared morosely at the print of Cameron 's Whitby Bridge which hung above it . A newspaper photographer , huh ? A button-pusher . Even some high-hat reporters disdained the craft . The college training . What good was it ? Taught him how to be dissatisfied , taught him to like good clothes , to appreciate good books and pictures ; taught him very little about how to get these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless ? Then the answer which had repeatedly pounded against his consciousness broke through and he grunted softly , his lips dipping at the corners . " Watch yourself , fella ! " he said under his breath . The object of this cautionary soliloquy burst into the room and startled him as he finished . She had on a dark , tight-fitting dress , a mannish polo coat , a trim dark brown  | hat . Her face was quite pale ; her eyes were bright , glaring . Murdock started to grin . " Hello . " Joyce Archer began to peel off her gloves . She put them together and slapped them against her palm and turned on him . She seemed to have trouble speaking . In that moment Murdock had a hard time remaining where he was . To try to live up to his resolve , he raised his glass , finished his drink , and made his voice casual . " I was on my way to the office and decided I was thirsty . " If Joyce Archer heard him she gave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words were throaty , sharp . " Who ? " asked Murdock although he knew what she meant . " Howard  --  Rita . " She came to him , held out her wrists . Red finger-marks stood out across them above the tan of her skin . She jerked her hands back , spun about , and started to pace the floor . " He had to drag me out before I 'd go . He 's beastly , insane . He does n't know what he 's doing . I went home and saw his trunk packed , two of his bags gone . I found them upstairs . And Mark Redfield buried yesterday . " Trouble settled over Murdock . He sat down on the davenport , put his empty glass at his feet , his forearms on his knees so that the wrists were limp , dangling the hands between his knees . " I told him what I thought . I ca n't understand him . It is n't only Rita . He 's been this way ever since he came back from England . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's estate to have the good time he wants . He 's mad . And she ? " The girl broke off , stopped pacing to face Murdock . " It 's her fault too . I told her so . And if Howard had kept his hands off me I ? " She checked herself . " You 've got to stop them . " Murdock looked at her without raising his head , and in looking his brows furrowed , giving him a hard , quizzical expression . " He ought to know better . He 's a witness , a material witness . If he runs out , the police will drag him back . Let him go . " " I ca n't . Not that way . And have him hunted as if he were a criminal ? He knows nothing of the murder . " " He has n't convinced Bacon of that yet . " " But you do n't think ? " Her mouth went slack . " It makes damn little difference what I think . If you want to stop him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roughness in his voice ? " call police headquarters . " She gasped at that and he crossed to the telephone . " No ! " she said , frightened now . " Please . " Murdock did not pick up the instrument . He stood there waiting . ' Listen , Kent . " Joyce Archer came to him and took both of his arms above the elbows . " Do this for me , will you ? He 's running away . You can stop him . But I ca n't call the police . If they see that he 's going , it will make it all the harder ; it will make him look guilty . You see that ? " Murdock just nodded , watched her humidly . Traces of resentment appeared among his thoughts . He felt jealous of Archer and his hold on the girl ; and then he  | felt ashamed of his jealousy . She spoke first . " It 's not just this . I never had many friends . Travel . Packed off to school , and kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off my parents ' hands . But Howard was close to me . There 's seven years ' difference in our ages , and that matters a lot to a girl growing up . And he was sweet to me . He 'd come to Paris on his vacations . He made me feel as though I was his girl . He had lots of others , yes , but he had a little time for me too . I think he knew I was lonely . And now he 's changed and I 've changed and I know he 's beastly and acted like a cad to you , and yet , next to you , he 's the only one . Maybe if I could make him see this other thing through he 'd have time to ? " Her voice choked slightly as it trailed off . Murdock 's palms were damp and he rubbed them against the outside of his coat pockets . There was an unnatural thickness in his throat , a lumpy something t hat made it hard to swallow . A faint perfume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently from her grasp , stepped over to the wing chair , and picked up his hat . She followed him . " You 'll try ? " " Yes , " Murdock said , and because he felt a certain helplessness before the unashamed display of her emotions , because he could not cope with the genuine reaction set up within him , his voice was unnecessarily gruff . " But even if you have the right to meddle with his life , with two lives , this way ; even if you have  --  and you have n't  --  I think you are overconfident about my powers of persuasion . Why should I succeed with him when he failed with you the other night ? " Her eyes , fixed upon his as he began to speak , were  | trusting ; and then , when he finished , he read the hurt in their depths . He forgot about everything else . His arms went around her waist . They were standing close together and he drew her tight against him with a quick rough embrace . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stiff for a fraction of a second ; then they were alive and hot and her arms were around his neck , straining so that the hardness of her muscles surprised him and he felt a twinge of pain in the cords of his neck . He dropped his hands , pushed her away , and caught his breath . His face was hot . He stooped , snatched up the camera and plate-case . He had to look at her as he opened the door . Her eyes held him . They were bright and shiny , just a little frightened from reaction . Or it may have been something else ; he could not be sure . The maid who opened the door , a small , sandy-haired girl with a generous waist and plump arms , said : " Mrs. Redfield is not in . " Murdock slipped through the doorway in front of her , put the camera and plate-case on the foyer floor . " I 'll go in and wait . " The maid closed the door hurriedly and then had to run to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she wo n't be ? " " I know , " Murdock said , reaching for the door-knob ; " I 'll wait . " His confidence shattered the maid 's resistance . He opened the door and stepped into the huge living-room beyond . Rita Redfield and Howard Archer were at the opposite side . His arm was about her waist , her hand on  | his arm , and , facing the terrace windows , they turned their heads and looked at Murdock over their shoulders . Archer dropped his arm . Murdock kept coming across the room . There was a silver tray on a small table , a tall cocktail-shaker , two glasses . Beside the grand piano four compact , light-weight traveling-cases stood in a row . Archer stopped stiffly in front of Murdock , blocking his path . The thin , tanned face was angry , the pale-blue eyes hard , like steel disks . " Sorry , " he said curtly . " We were just going out . " " Yes , " Murdock said . " Your sister told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought I might be able to persuade you to postpone the trip until this  --  this murder case is cleared up a bit . " " Sweet of her , " Archer said irritably . " But in the light of what happened the other night ? " " I understand she had a reason for that too . " Archer turned . " Ready , Rita ? " Rita Redfield came towards him , stopped to one side and slightly behind Archer . Murdock 's eyes moved to her ; it was difficult to look elsewhere . Her beauty , in spite of its showiness , the vital fullness of the figure beneath the severe line of her oxford-gray two-piece suit , was commanding . Her dark eyes , full on Murdock now , were expressionless  --  or so they seemed . The expression came from the droop of the painted mouth , the lifted arch of her brows over the upward-slanting eyes . Here was a woman . Murdock was at once aware of her allure , could understand better now than before just why Archer had planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had time in  | his study of her to think of this , he did not blame the fellow . One thing : they had much in common . They might get along . " And waiting , " Rita Redfield answered without taking her eyes from Murdock . " I 'll have Williams take the bags down . " " Never mind , " Archer said . " I 'll take them myself . " He turned , juggled them up so he had one under each arm , one in each hand . Murdock moved back to the door , stood in front of it . Archer had to put down the bags again . His voice snapped dangerously . " You 're being damned obnoxious and ? " Murdock said : " Wait just a minute . Let 's leave out all personalities . Let 's see if there is any logic in this business . " He looked at the woman . " Your husband was buried yesterday , and , passing over any moral question , are your affairs in shape to run out so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Indefinitely , " Archer snapped . " There is very little to be cleared up , " Rita Redfield said , and there seemed to be something of amusement in her gaze , as though , somehow , she enjoyed this set-to between the two men . " And fortunately I insisted upon a trust fund when I married him . " The complete assurance of the woman 's manner ruffled Murdock and he went on stubbornly : " It 's not so simple with you , Archer . If it 's of any interest to you , I 've been pretty close to the police on this thing . They 're not at all satisfied with your story . I know this . Run out on them like this  --  even if you get away with it  --  and they 'll bring you back . "  | Archer 's chin came out . " Get out of the way ! " " Understand , " Murdock went on grimly , " it 's nothing to me personally . I do n't like you and I never did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , is it ? " Archer leered . " Well , get this , M urdock : You practically threw me out of your place the other night . There was nothing I could do . If she wants to give herself to a fellow of your class , a newspaper photographer ? " " Watch your words ! " " ? I suppose it 's her affair . But for you to presume that you can come up here and ? " Archer broke off as his rage got the better of him . " Get out of the way ! " Murdock 's lips pulled back in a weird little smile . Then Archer hit him , a quick straight punch full on the mouth . The blow was not hard , but coming as it did , with Murdock off balance and unable to get set , it staggered him . He took a backward step . Blood came out on his lips , and his face darkened . His reaction was instinctive and he caught himself in time to stop his counter-punch . He dropped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . He was afraid of what he had done or what he thought might happen . It was in his eyes ; he was afraid . As though he realized there was more to follow , he moved back a step and whipped a small automatic from the pocket of his raglan topcoat . " Get out of that doorway or I 'll shoot ! " he said huskily . " They 'd bring you back for that , too , " Murdock said , trying to keep a check on his temper and natural anger .  | " I would n't have to kill you . A bullet or two in the leg ? " " They 'd bring you back . " " They 'll probably try and bring me back anyway . " Murdock held Archer 's furious gaze a moment , then shrugged and stepped aside . " You 're not scaring anyone , " he said as he took a handkerchief from his breast pocket and wiped his bleeding lips , " waving that gun . But if you should be fool enough to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly for Joyce . " Archer turned to Rita . " Can you carry one of the bags ? " She picked up one and he managed the other three since they were neither heavy nor bulky . He still clung to the gun . " Do n't try to follow us . You stay here until ? " " You might have some justification for shooting here , " Murdock said disdainfully , " since I rather broke in on you . But outside , Archer , I 'll do as I please . " He waited until the two of them left the room ; then he followed . At the outer door he picked up his camera , slung the plate-case over his shoulder . All three waited for the elevator . Murdock cocked one eyebrow at Rita Redfield , smiled . " I hope the rest of your trip is less melodramatic . " She returned his smile with a certain hauteur , more than a little amusement . Murdock glanced at the still glowering Archer , who was looking somewhat ridiculous and beginning to sense it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby with that thing in your hand , " he said dryly . " Suppose it went off ? "  | 14 KENT MURDOCK OPENED his camera as he followed Aicller and Rita Redfield through the downstairs lobby . As he stepped under the marquee , he saw that there was a taxi at the curb , but no other in the block . While the doorman pitched baggage into the front seat , Murdock adjusted his shutter , focused the camera , and threw it up to his shoulder . He called : " Archer ! " Rita Redfield had one foot on the running board , one foot on the floor of the tonneau . Archer was right behind her , his right hand on the door-handle . Both turned at the call , and in that instant Murdock pressed the shutterrelease . Rita Redfield disappeared in the cab ; Archer 's mouth worked silently and his blond mustache twitched like a thing alive . Then the mouth clamped shut . He flung himself into the cab and slammed the door . The little smile on Murdock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static . He reversed his plate-holder and again put the camera to his shoulder as the cab slanted into the middle of the street . His next picture caught the back end of the car  --  and Rita Redfield 's face pressed against the rear window . Murdock had to walk to Commonwealth Avenue before he caught a taxi . He said " Courier-Herald , " and flopped back on the seat . The smile disappeared . The reason was not that he had failed with Howard Archer . He felt sure , when he had promised Joyce , that there was  | small chance of success . He had done the best he could under the circumstances , but the only sure way to stop Archer was to call Bacon  --  to have called him before he left his apartment . It was this thought that erased his smile and filmed his eyes with trouble . For the first time he was not playing ball with the police . And Bacon ? Damn it ! He justified his actions , tried to justify them , with the thought that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out to collect something in the way of a reward , at least a part payment to Hestor  --  if he was lucky . In the second place , there was Joyce . He had crossed Bacon by hiding her at his apartment . True , it had not mattered in the end . And he was crossing Bacon again . With this sort of information about a stranger , Murdock would surely have tipped off the police . And Archer could have killed Mark Redfield . He grunted savagely and stared morosely out through the cab window at the traffic jam on Tremont and Boylston . " For a guy who 's supposed to be on the level , " he I ! ! II ' grunted in his throat , " you 're turning into a lousy , double-crossing heel . " By the time he had reached the office , Murdock had 11 made his decision . He could check up himself and see just what Archer was going to do ; and he could go part way with Bacon , do a little something to salve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached his desk . " Anything new ? " " Naw , " Bacon grunted . " Pick up Tripp ?  | " Did n't I say there was nothing new ? " Bacon was almost petulant . " Then get a load of this and do n't say I 'm holding out on you . Archer skipped out this afternoon  --  with Rita Redfield . " Murdock waited until Bacon 's explosion subsided . " I ca n't tell you , " he said in answer to the Lieutenant 's demand for more information . " All I know is that they pulled out of the Embankment Arms about ten minutes ago with four bags . Maybe they 're going to hide out ; maybe they 're leaving town . " " But what ? " " How do I know ? " Murdock cut him off before he could state the question . " Do I have to do all the leg work for the police department ? Check it  --  and quit crabbin ' ! " He hung up on Bacon 's " Thanks . " Staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best I can do . " Wixon , another camera man , who had his feet cocked on a desk across the room and was reading the sports page , said : " What ? " Murdock said : " I was thinking out loud . " " It 's possible then , huh ? " Wixon asked , grinning . Murdock opened his plate-case and took out his exposed plates of Archer , of the Industrial Exhibit . He went down the narrow corridor connecting a row of adjoining dark-rooms . He turned into the black cubicle at the end and set to work . All of the pictures were good , and when he had made the prints , he took them into the photoengraving room and dried them over a flame . The assignment pictures he sent upstairs ; the two of Archer and the  | taxi he studied a moment , then put in a call for the Green and White Taxi Company . It was dark when Murdock located the driver of Archer 's taxi in a stand at the corner of Boylston and Providence Streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , was suspicious , surly , when Murdock started to question him . " Sure , " he blustered , " sure I had a fare from the Embankment Arms . What about it ? " Murdock described Archer and Rita Redfield . " Suppose it was them ? " " I want to know where you took them , " Murdock rapped , irritated by the man 's manner . " All right , " scoffed the driver , " you want to know . So what ? You 're no copper . " " Listen , " Murdock said , " you 're not smart  --  just dumb . And it bores me to hear you talk . But I want some information . I work for the Courier-Herald . I 'm willing to give you a fin , but if you 're not interested I 'll go to headquarters and you 'll tell them for nothing . So make up your mind . " " That 's different , " the driver said . " Hell , why' n't you say you was a newspaper guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They went over to the airport . " Murdock climbed into the cab . " Let 's go . " When the driver skidded the wheels to a stop on the cinder bed of the airport , Murdock went into the administration building , showed his press card , said : " You keep the names of passengers , do n't you ? " The clerk said they did , that the last plane had left  | an hour ago . Murdock asked for the passenger list , found only one woman in the group . He asked the clerk what she looked like . " Middle-aged , " he said . " Sort of fat and wore glasses . " Murdock lit a cigarette , frowned thoughtfully . " Who rents planes around here ? I mean for fairly long trips ? The people I 'm looking for hired one around four-thirty or so and ? " " Sure , " the clerk said , brightening . " I remember . A Tri-State outfit job . They 're down in that second hangar , that blue one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Murdock went out before the clerk finished . An east wind whipping in from the ocean tucked his coat-tails between his legs and he had to buck it all the way to the blue hangar , which , in the shadows of the floodlight on the peak of the roof , looked all black . There was no one there except a mechanic , but he gave freely the information Murdock sought . " Yeah . Shorty Regan took off with ' em in a three-place Eagle . He was supposed to take ' em to Newark . Funny , too . If they 'd waited a half-hour they coulda got the transport . I had a hunch maybe they were honeymooners or something . " Murdock passed the man a dollar bill and snapped up the collar of his coat . " Not a bad hunch either . " Phil Doane slid off of Murdock 's desk in the photographic department anteroom , his round , good-natured face eager , flushed with excitement . " Hey , you know what ? " " Yeah . What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah ? " Murdock looked surprised . " How did you tumble ? " " I was lookin ' for you at the Embankment Arms ? Where the hell you been ? " Doane did not expect an answer . " And Bacon and Keogh and a couple others swarmed into the place . For once I was right there when it happened and Bacon gave me a break . Told me to get a coupla pics from the morgue and run them too . And Van Husan , " Doane continued elatedly , " was tickled silly . " " Did he say so ? " Murdock asked dryly . " Well , no , " Doane said , sobering a little . " He said : It 's about time . ' But all he did to the yarn was put a head on it and make a couple minor changes . " " That 's swell , " Murdock said . " You 're safe for another week . Now beat it , will you ? I got things to do . " Doane did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " But do n't forget  --  on this other thing . You 're gon na let me in on it if ? " " Go ' way ! " Murdock said , but the way he said it amounted to yes , and Doane knew this and went out , picking up the whistle contentedly . Murdock took off his coat and hat , hung both on the yellow-oak hat-rack . He sat down at his desk , slouched there for some minutes , staring at the practically nude figure of a dancer that someone had cut out of an old Police Gazette and pasted on the wall . His eyes followed the generous lines of the figure automatically , but he was not aware of what he saw , of anything but his thoughts .  | He stood up and began to walk around in circles , his head down , hands jammed in his coat pockets so that the fabric was tight across the buttocks . He stopped the cirfilar pacing abruptly after a minute or so , went to his desk , and swept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes intense , fixed straight ahead . When he got his connection he said : " Fenner ? Murdock . " A pause . " Yeah , and I 've got another job for you . " Another pause . " No , this is n't about her . This is easy . But listen , Jack , you and me . " Another pause . " Sure , I know , but this is important enough to me to make sure you got it straight . Here it is . An Eagle plane from Tri-State Airways took off from the airport about four-thirty this afternoon . A private job , see ? The pilot was a lad named Shorty Regan and he was hired to go to Newark . I want you to find out if he did go there . Get him when he gets back  --  I do n't know when it 'll be  --  and find out where he went . " Another pause . " That 's all . I told you it was easy . Call me when " " ou find out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Joyce Archer , flashed through Kent Murdock 's brain as this is confidential as hell . It 's got to be that way . Between  | he crossed the lobby of the Embankment Arms and stepped into the elevator . He would have to tell her about her brother and how he had failed . But he could do that , and she would understand he had done his best for her . He would also have to tell her exactly what the situation was , tell her how much he had told the police and why ; tell her about Fenner and the plane . Maybe she would think he had double-crossed her . He hoped not , but in any case he would have to risk it . She deserved the truth and he could give her that much . This was decided when he stepped from the elevator . But the other ? It all came back to him so that he practically relived the moment . The scent from her hair was in his throat . He could feel the warmth , the sweetness of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck . And the thought tormented him . That first night , when he had found her in his bed . The subsequent nights . On the surface , casual , with a friendly intimacy and understanding ; below the surface , a strained , unnatural surging and quickening of the pulse that was almost constantly accelerated until it had become a torrent of desire , ungovernable without the strictest concentration . And if the thing had happened before , if he had not resisted until the impulse broke through his restraint that afternoon . . . He stopped in front of his door and took out his keys . He unsnapped the button of the pigskin case , thrust forward the door-key , then stopped it an inch from the keyhole . He stood there rigidly a moment until he realized his breath was short , that he was sweating from the pressure of his coat and his thoughts .  | he waited until the operator answered , realized finally that he did not know his own number . The interval while he hung up and looked through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice finally came over the wire he had control of himself , and his voice was normal  --  or just a shade brusque . He said : " I drew a blank . " " You what ? " Murdock laughed shortly . " That was the buttonpusher talking . What I mean is , I failed you with Howard . " " Oh . " The voice was dull . " It was a case of a brawl or nothing . I could n't quite see it that way . They were at the point where a little thing like reason is inconsequential . I 'm beginning to think I know how it is . " " How what is ? " Turning suddenly with an almost savage movement , Ise jammed the keys into his pocket , glanced around . The corridor was quiet , deserted . He knelt quickly , lowered his head until he could see the crack between the bottom of the door and the sill . The yellow sliver of light from the room told him what he wanted to know . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His pace was jerky , stiff-kneed ; his lean face was twisted somehow from the tightly pressed lips so that it looked worn and haggard , with a tautness that was reflected in eyes that did not seem quite well . There was a drug-store two blocks away . Murdock turned in there and walked back to the telephone booth at the far end of the soda counter . Lifting the receiver ,  | " I had to tell the police , " Murdock said , ignoring the question . " But you could n't do that . You ? " The voice was frightened and trailed off miserably . " I could n't hold out on Bacon entirely . Try to understand that . But I did not tell all I knew . They would have found out anyway . They were bound to check on him . All I did was to tell them a little ahead of time . " " Yes , " the voice said listlessly , " I see . " " There 's something else , " Murdock went on doggedly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I traced it to the airport . They hired a plane to take them to Newark . I 'm having a friend hunt up the pilot when he returns and find out for sure where they went . " " You did n't tell ? " " That 's just for our own information . " There was a pause then and Murdock pushed back his hat and reached for a handkerchief . The stuffiness of the booth was oppressive ; the air was getting hot and sticky . " That 's why I did n't call sooner , " he added . " I thought a lot about it while you were gone . I was worried when I did n't hear from you . But I 'm not surprised really . Disappointed . But it was too much to expect . I guess I set the example . " " They may hit it off together if ? " He did not add : " the police do n't find them . " " Where are you now ? " " Downtown . " " Are we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though shrugging off its disappointment . Not tonight . I 've got work to do , " lied Murdock .  | " Oh . Well  --  when will you be out ? " " When you go . " " When I ? " " He 's gone now . " There was no answer . " That 's what you came for , was n't it ? " Murdock sressed stubbornly . A new bitterness crept into his voice . ' You wanted to make him see reason ; sauce for the ? ose , inverted . And we 've both botched the thing some ay . I mean , you can go home now . You did all you could . o . There was no answer to this either . " You ca n't use that as an excuse any longer , " Murdock 1urted . " I did n't think I needed an excuse . " Joyce Archer 's , voice was stiff now , cold . " What I told you was a long ' me ago  --  it seems a long time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , this afternoon . " " It was a mistake with things as they are with me. " urdock wiped his face , crumpled the handkerchief in is fist . " Then why do n't you come here and tell me so to my cc ? " " Because I 'm scared . " " Of me ? " " Yes . Of me , too . Of both of us . " " Need you be ? " The voice was relieved now , low , ? vibrant . " You know . I 'm old enough to know when to be scared .  | I 'm just a mug , a newspaper man . I 've had most of my illusions knocked out of me . But I 'm not that much of a mug  --  or if I am , not with your kind of a girl . " " Then you still have an illusion or two left . " " I know what it is to do a thing impulsively and regret it . " " It would n't be impulsive now , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wo n't . " " Go home and stay there and think it over and then ? " " It would n't make any difference unless ? " " Unless what ? " " It would n't make any difference . " Murdock wiped the handkerchief across his face again . " If you stay there , " he said sharply , " you 'll stay there for good . And here 's something else . You 've been there three nights . I 've tried to be polite and considerate and decent because you 're young and temporarily dissatisfied , and disgusted with your brother and life in general . You 'll react to all this emotional drive some time and see things as they are . Then you 'll hate me and yourself and ? " " I hate myself now , most of the time . " Murdock cursed softly in his exasperation . " Anyway , I think I 'm going to New York . " " Why ? " " I 'm fed up with my job . " " I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ca n't know how well until I get away from it . I want to try some advertising work , some portrait stuff , and see ? " " Well , why not ? Could n't I go ? " " No. "  | A woman 's purring voice broke in . " Deposit another five cents , puleeze . " " Wait a minute , " growled Murdock and he fished for the handful of coins in his pocket . He had one five-cent piece left , jammed it into the proper slot , and the gong , like bell rang in his ear . " Hello . " " Thank you . " " Hello . " " Why ca n't I go ? " Murdock felt momentary relief at the sound of the familiar voice again ; then his face grew taut and his eyes were miserable in the shadows . " Because I wo n't take you . I 'm married and until ? " " I know that . " This impatiently . " You 're not seducing me . I 'll be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if only for a short while , who will try to understand and maybe be a little kind . " " I wo n't take you . " " I do n't blame you for not respecting me . But do you hate me as well ? " " Hate you ? " exploded Murdock . " Then why ? " " All right . " Murdock felt the pounding of the blood at his eardrums , the hot stifling pressure of the little booth . His mouth , his throat , seemed dry and parched . He went on in a quick , almost savage voice : " If you want to know , I love you . I do n't know what else could make me this way . You 're what I want , what I 've always wanted . I like the way you talk ; I like your mind and your spirit and the nerve that made you run away and break into my room . I like the way you feel  | about your brother and your naturalness and frankness and the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I like ? Damn it ! I like it all . But I do n't want a sample . I want it for good . If you want to wait , maybe I can work the thing out . I 've got to work it out . But ? " " It took you a long time to say so . " Joyce Archer 's voice was alive and throaty , joyful . " If that 's what you wanted , you 've got it , " Murdock snapped . " I thought I was right . It 's so much nicer to be sure . Because I 'm that way . And that 's why I said things had changed and why I do n't want any excuse any more . If we are honest with ourselves , we do n't have to wait . It 's silly . " " Not to me . Because I 've sat there in my place three nights and thought about you and fought with myself , knowing that whether you liked me or not you were a good enough sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spite your brother and you would have carried on rather than back out . I 've gone this far . I 'm going to wait until we can start out right . It 's worth it . We can see each other , all right , and go places and do things , but ? " " How long will it take to get your divorce ? " Murdock groaned . " Hestor knows how to spite , too . " With the weight of his confession off his mind , with the knowledge that Joyce had accepted it and felt as he did , his tone was lighter . Some of the stiffness went out of his lips and he forgot about the sweat on his face and forehead . " I 'm beginning to think it 's a woman 's complex . " " You mean she wo n't give you one ? On any grounds ? " " No , " Murdock said flatly . " Not till she 's ready . I can  | buy her off ; that 's the only way . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce Archer 's laugh , distorted by the instrument , shrilled in his ear and he flared : " What 's funny ? " " Nothing . I 'm not rich enough to scare you off , but I 've a little . Enough to ? " " Oh , no , " Murdock cut in . " It 's my mess . I 've got to clean it up . " " But I 'm in it now . " " Yes , but at best I 'll probably be a lousy guy to have around the house . I balled things up once before . Maybe I 've learned something . But at best I 'm no bargain  --  even without cost . You 're entitled to something better  --  to the best break I can give you . " " But what does it matter if ? " " No ! " warned Murdock . " A bought husband , huh ? " " Do n't be a grouch ! " The silky-voiced operator broke in upon him again . " Your time is up . Deposit five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no other nickel in his pocket . He said : " Wait ! " Then , fairly shouting : " You go on home because ? " He heard Joyce 's laugh again , heard : " I suppose I 'll have ? " and then the line went dead .  | 16 HESTOR MURDOCK LAY in the perfumed depths of her bath and parboiled herself blissfully . Her legs were stretched out . She had a rubber-covered and luxuriantly soft pillow behind her head so that she could lean comfortably against the slightly sloping head of the tub . Her arms lay idly along the sides and the steaming water , a pinkish color now , came to her armpits ; her back was slightly arched , bringing her breasts close to the surface so that the occasional movement of her body set up miniature ripples which threatened to bare them at any moment . This , the first five minutes , was always the best . She did not want to stir herself . The warmth , the lift of the water , gave her an ethereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless , in hot , lush space . But it did not last . It was never until she felt chilled that she realized the water had cooled . Then it was too late to recapture the ecstatic mood ; too late to do anything but hurry out of the tub and take a brisk rub-down and tell herself she would not make the same mistake next time . But there was time enough tonight ; the water had nearly scalded her . And Girard would not call until ten o'clock . He had wanted to pick her up at the studio . But to get the most enjoyment out of these hours with him , she had to start off right . The broadcasts always left her nerves ragged and high-  | strung . It was not like the stage . Nothing to judge how she was going over except by the dead-pan audience beyond the glass panels . Trained seals . Polite . Clapping when it was expected of them . Filing in and out like a jury . It was time , she told herself , she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been broadcasting . Not an important program , but the hundred and fifty a week was three times what she had made in the chorus . It was that time-clock efficiency with which everything was conducted that keyed her up like this . A hot bath , though , a cocktail , and a change of clothes ? these made a difference . She stirred in the tub , and the pillow slipped down her back into the water . She picked it out and tossed it on the floor , sat up , and reached for the lavender-colored soap . When she had finished she called : " Anna , " and a moment later a stout Negress with a good-natured face and gold ear-rings in pierced ears came into the room . She had a towel over her arm , which she unfolded and held up in front of her . The towel was so long she had to peer over the top to see that her position was correct to receive her mistress . When Hestor stepped from the tub , she turned her back and Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The orchid bath-mat was as thick as a rug . Hestor seemed to flatten her feet on it . When she had the towel adjusted to suit her , she turned around . " Did you bring the shaker in ? " " Yes , m 'm . " Anna bobbed her head up and down . " Then lay out my black velvet . " Anna 's head bobbed again . " Anything else , m 'm ? "  | " That 's all . " Hestor started to dry herself , and Anna moved to the door . " Oh , Anna , and leave the door unlocked . " Anna went out . She was a good investment . Lucky to get one as good for part-time work . She had no need of a full-time girl . She was never up until noon , was she ? And she never needed Anna after nine o'clock or so at night . Of course , it would be nice to have a full-time maid ; she 'd have one some day . Hestor dropped the towel at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue crepe negligee on the white chair . As she started to go out , she caught her reflection in the full-length mirror and stopped in front of it . Facing herself this way , she studied her image for a few seconds , then replaced the negligee and presented her left side to the glass . She cocked her head with the chin up and surveyed herself from the corner of her eye . Not bad at all . In fact ? Her hands moved up to her breasts , moved under them to support them . They were still firm , the skin smooth and rounded . And they did not need support . Her hands came away . Thank goodness , she had not yet lost her figure . She was thirty . If she watched herself , took a little exercise , and ate sensibly she would be just as good at forty . But why not ? Her figure had never been anything but a source of pleasure . It had never troubled her ; she had never had to baby herself . Her hands moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the flapper type . Slender enough , but not depending upon a dress to proclaim her sex .  | She smiled , turned away , and picked up the negligee . She did not put it on ; she carried it into the bedroom and tossed it upon the ivory four-poster . Opening a round , flowered box of powder , she reached for the puff . The handle was eighteen inches long , gently curving ; the puff itself was about the size of half a cantaloupe . What , she wondered as a cloud of powder settled about her , would be the upshot of Girard 's attention . He was a i bachelor ; there might be a possibility of marriage . But if not , if the affair was of any duration , he would probably make some sort of settlement . She had heard he was generous . And certainly there was money enough . Besides , he was a gentleman . An ex-bootlegger , but a gentleman . Until she had met him , six months before , that line of ' business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated , polished . She liked the way he talked , the way he wore his clothes , the way he ordered dinner . And there was a deference , an almost inborn deference , in his manner towards her . She smiled at herself and put down the powder-puff . The black velvet lay on the bed . It would be a job getting into it , but it was worth the effort and , once on , its sleek tightness made a girdle unnecessary , and the effect was ? she had seen men look at her in night clubs  --  well , adequate , certainly . She contemplated the dress a moment , then stepped over to the bedside table and picked up the cocktail-shaker , a severe cylinder of chromium and black enamel . She shook it five or six times , poured dark red liquid into the single silver cocktail cup . Manhattans were her favorite . She liked the sweetness of the Italian vermouth , the jolt of the rye whisky . But she had to be  | careful . They were heavy . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or she felt sleepy and thick-headed . She drank the first cocktail quickly , poured the second and carried it to her dressing-table , sat down on the cushioned bench . Her make-up did not take long , because she was an expert , her training and experience dating to pre-burlesque days . Fortunately her eyelashes were good-long and with a natural sharp upward curve ; mascara was unnecessary . Stroking them with a tiny brush for a few seconds , she surveyed her handiwork with satisfaction , touched the stopper of the perfume-bottle under each ear , then finished the second cocktail . She sat down on the bed , picked up the sheer silk stockings , her thoughts reverting to Girard . Then , as she crossed her legs , the sound of the door-buzzer broke her reverie . She stood up , slipped a foot into the mule which had fallen to the floor . He was early ; too early . She caught up the negligee , shrugged into it , and tied the sash tightly about her waist as she moved into the living-room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had intended , she turned and went back to the inner hall , turned again , and called : " Come . " The smile died on her lips as the door swung inward . Kent Murdock stepped through the opening , stopped there with one hand on the knob , the other removing his brown felt . Irritation and resentment flared up in Hestor 's face . The lips dipped at the corners , and her shoulders sagged slightly . For a second or two they stood there staring at each other ; then Murdock closed the door and Hestor started towards him .  | " I 'm going out , " she said flatly . " All right , " Murdock said , just as flatly . " I wo n't stay , " ong . " Hestor stopped in the center of the room , seemed about o speak . Instead she shrugged , took a cigarette from a ' lain silver box , and spun flame from a lighter . She forygot about holding the negligee . It gaped open at the , throat and friction loosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair arm , let both hands and the hat hang loosely between spread knees . Hestor turned and threw herself down on a chaise-longue with a striped silk ' damask covering . " You can stay five minutes , " she said , " but it wo n't ' take me that long to say no . " Murdock 's thin smile was mirthless . " Who is it , Nate Girard ? " Hestor did not answer immediately ; she simply watched Murdock through the spiraling smoke from the cigarette and did a lot of thinking in a very short time . Suppose she gave him his divorce . She would have to give him one eventually ; she would want one herself . And if she was not careful ? She knew him well enough to realize that , comparatively easy to get along with up to a certain point , Murdock was not the sort to take too much from anyone without fighting back . So far she had been careful , and lucky , in that Murdock apparently did not care what she did . Men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as food . Yet until Girard there had been none ' sufficiently important or attractive to warrant even a semi-permanent liaison . During the time Girard 's trial was in progress Andrew  | Sprague had seemed attractive to her , but now that Girard was out again She said : " I 'm going out with him tonight , if that 's what you mean . " Murdock nodded , turned the hat between his hands . " Why do n't you do something about it ? It might cramp your style some time , being tied up to me . " " I like it that way now . " Hestor felt her irritation mount . " What 's your trouble , the Archer girl ? " Murdock 's eyes narrowed slightly . He hesitated . To tell the truth would only serve to rekindle Hestor 's already smoldering spite ; to deny ? His chin came up ; he spoke sullenly . " Yes . " Hestor smiled with taunting sweetness . " Really ? " Her voice thinned out . " Well , what can you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze defiantly . Let him wait , then . She was in no hurry . She liked to see him squirm . Damn him , anyway ! There was something about him , even now , that attracted her . Perhaps it was his similarity to Girard  --  or perhaps Girard 's similarity to Kent furnished the spark for this new affair . They had much in common . Something vital and clean ; a hardness , but an innate fairness ; intelligence and educated minds that she did not entirely understand , but which she knew enough to respect . And she had come a long way herself . These last two years had made a difference . With her present knowledge , with the right sort of handling , she could have held Murdock  --  at least longer . But it was just as well . If he was still attractive to her , so was Girard . And Girard had money . He was older ; he  | would probably demand but little and she could find er outlets , given money and leisure , for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ith Girard . She would know how to handle him now . ' 0 e 'd know when to hold back . And  --  she revived the ought with sudden bitterness  --  she could never bring urdock back , even if she wanted him . What did he expect in marriage , anyway ? Look what e had given him . And he had spurned it ; that was it , ' tuned her . Well , let him wait . Let him see how it felt . hat if she really tricked him into marrying her ? Had n't e done her best to fulfill her obligations ? She brought im youth and a beautiful body , an intensity of feeling at he could not get from one woman in a hundred . And had not been enough  --  or , paradoxically , it had been .. much . She had tried too hard . She could not tune him . her pitch . The thought of the quick cooling of his rdor  --  what little he had  --  infuriated her and Let him wait . Awhile longer anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , she did not know hether she could get him or not . If she kept her hold , urdock might get that ten thousand , or part of it . It as worth the effort , because if he did get nasty , she ' mould always " I can think of two things , " Murdock said grimly , cutting in on her thoughts . " What two ? " " I can run out on you . I 've been thinking of it anyway . I do n't have to stay here , and without your weekly tax you would n't be so keen on holding me . " " Oh , " Hestor said , and her lip curled . " And how about  | your girl friend ? She 'd run away with you , I suppose . And will she be surprised when she finds out what she 's run off with ? When you let her down like you did me . " " She 's different from you , Hestor , " Murdock said , and his voice was thready . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The criterion would not be the same . " " Is that so ? " Hestor flashed , and twisted on the chaiselongue so that the robe slipped from the legs stretched straight out and crossed at the ankles . " Well , you wo n't run out . You 've got too good a job right here . You could n't pick up another like it , and you know it . If you want your freedom , get the ten thousand . The girl ought to be worth that much . Just because you got me for nothing ? " " I 've paid plenty . " Murdock stood up , walked stiffly around the room , came back to the foot of the chaise-longue . He stopped there , spread-legged , hands on hips , fanning out the tails of his topcoat . " But there 's another way , " he said finally . " So far you 've been lucky . When we separated I made up my mind to let you live your own life , do as you pleased . You have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't been interested . But I am now . " His face was dark , determined ; the lips were stiff . " I think if I cramp your style from now on you may change your mind . " " You ? Cramp my style ? How ? " " I 'll have you watched . And I 'll be big-hearted about it and tell you in advance . You 'll stop chasing or get caught . Either way is all right with me . Because I know you , and you ca n't stop . And with the odds the same  | r both of us , I can stand it better than you can . " Hestor 's face flushed with sudden anger . Her lips drew ck against her teeth and she seemed about to speak . was with an apparent effort that she controlled the imIse . She tossed her hips petulantly and one side of the , . be trailed off on the floor . Thigh , hip , one firm breast ere suddenly bare . She made no move to retrieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes flicked to the nude side of her body d he jerked them up to her face . It was he who colored. estor lay there watching him , her pose natural , indolent , her gaze mocking . She said : " You ca n't bluff me . " " I do n't have to bluff . " Murdock held her eyes . " In ct " ? he let his hands slip from his hips and tapped his t against one leg ? " I 've already started . " Hestor sat up , yanking the negligee about her shoulers with an automatic and unconscious movement . " You lie ! " Her eyes were glaring slits . " No , " Murdock said levelly . " I 've had an idea all long about you . I may have been wrong before , but I 've " . t proof this time . " " Of what ? " she challenged . " You went to Redfield 's party with Girard . You left at ree-thirty and I had you followed . " it " You dirty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she could finish . " I told you , earlier that same night , to watch yourself . " Hestor glowered at him , crushed out the cigarette stub in an amber ash-tray , then gathered the negligee about her , completely covering her body . One eyebrow lifted  | as she studied him . When she spoke , her voice was like a sneer . " All right . What about it ? " " Just this . You came here , and Girard came in with you . He was still here at five-thirty . " To Murdock 's surprise , Hestor made no immediate answer . For several seconds she merely stared at him . Then , slowly , her eyes widened slightly and there was a curious , enigmatic expression in their depths . The trace of a weird little smile tugged at her sullen mouth . " You ca n't prove it . " " I think I can . " " Suppose I said he was n't here . My word is as good as yours or any private detective 's . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe not . I could try  --  but I do n't know that I shall . Maybe I 'll just let it ride as the first step . " Murdock watched her closely , aware of her peculiar , wary reaction , but unable quite to diagnose the mood . He buttoned his coat . " But a couple more of those little incidents might make the difference ; I might be able to do some good . " Hestor Murdock spoke as he reached the door . " I 'm going out with him tonight . Call up your detective and see what he can do for you . " Murdock opened the door and turned to face her , his hand on the knob . She was smiling at him , smiling with a taunting and superior twist of her mouth . And yet that enigmatic expression remained , as though her brain was puzzling over something that had so far escaped diagnosis . He thought she was going to speak , but when she  | continued to smile silently , , he put on his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the anteroom wall ade a focal point for Murdock 's gaze as he slouched own in his desk chair . His study of the figure was unconscious , troubled , and if he was aware of the picture at all , it was because of an automatic association set up by is brain between this photographic reproduction and estor . His new attempt to persuade her to give him a divorce had failed utterly . And she had accepted his announcement of Fenner 's finding with an equanimity that surprised him . Perhaps she was becoming more expert at disguising her feelings . In any case he had , however , planted the seed of doubt . He was sure of that much , and he wondered if he might have shaken her confidence so that , if he could raise part of the ten thousand , say half of it , she would be willing to compromise in her demand . His mind hung suspended on this thought until , after a while , he laughed aloud , a short brittle explosion that held no mirth . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder and he could collect . Not ten thousand , but perhaps half of it . The Bar Association offer was just one of those things that sound good , but are sel-  | dom realized . For the arrest and conviction . That , with luck , would mean an indefinite wait ; any money would undoubtedly be split several ways . Wyman 's offer was different . Here he could collect , but  --  the contingency was the same : Solve the case . Murdock stirred in the chair and lit a cigarette . The smile became fixed on his lips . " Fat chance , " he said half-aloud . Exclusive stories of this nature were much like action pictures . It was generally some amateur who collected . Stories resulting in arrests came from insiders , or neighbors , or friends of the criminal who doublecrossed him . Any pictures of violence , bank robbery , accidents , generally came from some fellow with a box camera who was taking a picture of the building across the street when it happened . Actually to go out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the story and pictures , seemed ridiculous . Yet what else had he left ? If he failed , and he probably would , he would at least have the knowledge that he had tried . And he did n't get pictures sitting around the office wishing for them . The point was that for the past two or three days he had thought about the case , but not constructively . He had an idea or two ; but these ideas were hazy , general , with more hope than reason behind them . But now he was sure about Joyce , and Hestor remained adamant and . . . The combination of thoughts spurred Murdock 's brain to a receptive clearness . He sat up , puffed smoke clouds around his head and began to review each single incident of the case , until the germ of an idea crept into his brain , began to blossom . By the time he crushed out  | his cigarette he thought he had a starting-point . Any general investigation , any attempt to solve each angle of the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fiction , the police department of any large city is an efficient organization . It has the manpower , the equipment , the specialists , the right channels of information , the authority to go out and do things . Murdock lacked all of these . What he did extract from the mass of facts and incidents that unwound in his brain was one feature that , so far as he knew , the police either had ignored or , more probably , had passed up temporarily in favor of more important clues . Concentrating on this point , he began to see the importance of an answer . The more he thought , the more interested he became . Then , finally convinced of the importance of this potential clue , he struck a snag in visualizing some method to run it down . Single-handed , it would take him weeks . . . . The answer  --  surprisingly simple when it arrived in completed form  --  came a half-hour later . The means lay within the organization of the Courier-Herald . Murdock 's dark eyes were bright when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself on his lips began to narrow the corners of his eyes . Determination had kept pace with his prodding thoughts ; his interest was keen and made hopeful by imagination . Opening a desk drawer , he pulled out the picture of Archer , taken at headquarters on the afternoon of the questioning . It had not been used , but he was glad , now , that he had it . He slipped it into his pocket , went up-  | stairs to the morgue and library adjoining the front corner of the city room , which was now blazing with light , reverberating with the sharp , persistent clatter of a halfdozen typewriters . With the help of Jerry , the librarian , a stoopshouldered veteran , Murdock collected a picture of Nate Girard , one of Sam Cusick , another of Spike Tripp . He went back down to his department and out into the photo-engraving room . Squinting his way past the bluewhite brightness of the high-watt bulbs , he found the foreman . " Ben . " Murdock drew the foreman over to a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs in a row . " Make me a plate of these . " The foreman , a thick-chested husky in overalls and a blue shirt , pulled at a heavy red nose and scowled . " It ai n't gon na look good . They 're all different focus . " " Who cares ? " grunted Murdock . " What do you want ' em for ? " " For my own use . I want one plate  --  say four inches high and let the width come . They do n't have to be jammed right together , just so they 're reproduced on one sheet . " " If you say so , " Ben said , shrugging and picking up the prints . " Thanks , Ben . " Murdock slapped the foreman 's shoulder . " And when you get it done , get about six or eight good proofs and leave them on my desk  --  with the plate . " The mezzanine floor was deserted , gloomily lighted  | by a single bulb in the hall ceiling . At the far end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite wall from the frosted glass pane of a private office . Murdock entered here without knocking . The office was small and bare , boasting one desk , two chairs , a filing-cabinet , and a large map of the city which hung on one wall . Lolling far back in a spring chair , his heels cocked on the desk , was a short , plump man with black hair and eyes , and jowls made blue by a heavy beard . His coat was off , and his sleeves were rolled up ; the unlighted stump of a cigar was wedged in one corner of his mouth , and his discolored felt hat was pushed forward so that it did not seem possible that he could read the newspaper he held spread out before him . He did not look around until Murdock said : " Hello , Mac . " MacShane , city circulator of the Morning Herald , glanced over his shoulder , and his black eyes slid up and down Murdock 's figure with a sort of surprised indifference before he spoke . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the hell did you find your way down here ? " " I heard , " Murdock said , grinning , " I heard there was a circulation department some place in the building . I wanted to be sure . Carson around ? " MacShane swung his feet down from the desk , swiveled around in the chair . " No . He 's got sense . He goes home when he 's through . " " Well , " Murdock said , " you 'll do . " " I was afraid of it . I 'll bet it 's trouble . " Murdock shook his head and sat down on the other  | chair at the end of the desk . " I want a little help . " " It 's the same thing , " MacShane groaned . " The only time you guys on the news end know we 're alive down here is when you need help  --  or when you got a complaint that some friend of your Aunt Emma 's did n't get his paper . " Murdock said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map on the wall . He stood up , crossed to it . Locating his own apartment house , he put his finger on it and , taking out a pencil , made four dots . One of these was in the Hill section , one was in Brookline , one was near Westland Avenue , and the fourth was off Arlington , near Columbus . He beckoned MacShane with a nod of his head . " Come here . " MacShane stood up wearily and scowled . " I do n't like the looks of this . " Murdock said : " How many district men you got ? " " Eighteen on carriers , six news-stand men , four ? " " Never mind . " Murdock grunted good-naturedly . " I did n't ask the right question . Take a look . " He pointed to the apartment location , indicated the four dots . " How many men have you got in that territory ? " " All of it ? " MacShane asked . " Four . " " Hah ! " Murdock breathed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll bet it 's plenty tough , " MacShane said . He came back to the desk . " And I do n't like the way you say it . " " Listen , Mac . " Murdock leaned across the desk , and the grin evaporated . " Can you get these four fellows down here tonight ? "  | " I doubt it , " MacShane grumbled . " What the hell do you think we do , work all the time ? What do you want ? " " I want to check on the telephone pay-stations in that territory . " MacShane threw up his hands . " There are thousands of ' em ! Christ ! You must be nuts ! " " Wait , " Murdock snapped , and the crispness of his voice held MacShane . " It 's not as bad as you think . All I want is the places that are open at four o'clack in the morning . Your circulation birds know a city upside down and backwards . Those district men ought to know every brick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung out , " but what ? " " I 'll bet there are n't more than fifty places in that whole district that stay open all night . A few drug stores , a few lunch-rooms , and ? " " Hotels , " MacShane rapped . " Yeah . " Murdock 's tone was momentarily discouraged . " Well , they 're probably out . If he went in a hotel ? " " Who ? " lipped MacShane , clamping thick jaws on the cigar so that the muscles rippled below his cheek-bones . " What the hell is this ? " Murdock explained tersely . " I 'll give you pictures of four men . You get these district men here and I 'll have copies for each of them . What they 've got to do is find the all-night places , find the fellow on duty , and show him the pictures . I want to know if any of the four made a pay-station call at four-thirty in the morning . If one of them did , the guy ought to remember it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . It wo n't be so  | hard . I tell you there wo n't be fifty places open and ? " " It 's hard , even the way you tell it , " MacShane muttered . " Suppose my boys locate all these places , that do n't mean the guy on duty is gon na remember ? " " I know that , " snapped Murdock . " I 'll need some luck . But it 's the only way I can think of . It 's a chance and ? " " What night ? " " Last Friday . " " So ? " MacShane 's eyes narrowed . " Who are the four guys ? " " Cusick , Girard , Tripp , and Archer . " " Redfield ? " Murdock nodded . " These dots are where they live ? " Murdock nodded again . " Why just pay-stations ? " " I do n't think a man would take a chance on his own phone . It might be checked . " " What 're you tryin ' to prove ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then what difference does it make ? " Murdock asked . " It 's got to be confidential anyway . I want you to talk to those four district men separately . If they do n't recognize the pictures , so much the better . I 'm working alone on this . It 's just a hunch . You can give me a break , Mac . How about it ? " MacShane rubbed one blue jowl and scowled down at the desk ; but even with the scowl the eyes were alert , interested . He was a circulation man , MacShane . As such he was accustomed to handling , and on time , the most  | perishable product in the world : a big city newspaper , which , with five editions , is conceived , born , and forgotten in a few hours . Time was the all-important element . The answer to the problem , an organization so highly geared that there was no waste motion . When the editor and his reporters and camera men put the paper to bed and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it a day ? MacShane and his crew went to work . It was dirty , strenuous , nerve-racking , thankless work . But to a circulation man , it was his job . District men , carriers , street hustlers , truck-drivers , these were MacShane 's tools ; and he knew how to use them . The process made a pessimist out of him , but it did not decrease his effectiveness . " Well " ? he looked up at Murdock and grinned so that the dead cigar butt angled up sharply ? " maybe we can do it . " Murdock exhaled noisily ; his lean face broadened with his grin . " Atta boy . " " Do n't get all hot about it , " MacShane cautioned glumly . " It do n't mean you 'll get what you want . " " If you ca n't do it , " Murdock said , standing up , " it ca n't be done . I 'll put a case of liquor in the hat . You can split it with the boys , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But here 's something . If it 's a story you 're after , and you get it , damn you if you do n't make it break right for me . Do n't forget , I work for the Herald . Next to that I guess the Courier 's all right . But I do n't want none of these other rags stealin ' our stuff ? "  | " Give me what I want and I 'll break it right . " MacShane grunted and reached for the telephone . " Bring in your pictures . I do n't know if I can get these guys tonight , but I 'll have something by tomorrow afternoon  --  probably a blank . " Murdock saw the first police car when he swung out of the taxi . It was near the mouth of an alley . As he shouldered his plate-case and started into the sidewalk shadows he saw that a second car had been driven into the alley proper so that its headlights splashed a weird yellow glow down the length of the walled canyon . The policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bacon sent for me . What 's up ? " The policeman grunted , leaned close . " Oh , hello , Murdock . He sent for you , huh ? " He hesitated uncertainly . " Then how come you do n't know what 's up ? " " Bacon 's funny that way . He said : Never mind why , get the hell down here . ' " The policeman turned and called to Bacon . The answer came back profanely and the policeman said : " Yeah , I guess you 're right . " Murdock squeezed between the car and the rear wall , stepped into the light-rays . A little knot of men were grouped about some object at the far end of the alley and over to one side . By the time he was half-way to the group , Murdock saw that this object was a man . Instinct , the urgency of Bacon 's telephone conversation , which he received just after he had sent MacShane the halftone proofs Ben had made for him , told him the man was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he  | pushed in between Bacon and Sergeant Keogh . Spike Tripp lay on his back , his arms outstretched , his eyes open and staring . The examiner was still making a cursory inspection of the body , and the vest had been unbuttoned , disclosing a reddish blotch that extended clear across one side of the chest . This red-stained part of the shirt was stiff ; the limbs , the set of the body , made an impression of complete rigidity that was unnatural , grotesque . Bacon turned , glared at Murdock , spoke angrily . " A smart trick , huh ? " he growled . " Run out on us yesterday and this is what it got him . " He began to curse , stepped back from the body , and tugged savagely at the brim of his hat . Murdock let the plate-case slide from his shoulder . He watched the examiner for a moment ; then he , too , looked away . For some moments the thoughts which surged in a vortexing jumble through his brain made him forget his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been right . Tripp had been upstairs in the hall outside Redfield 's apartment for a longer period than he had admitted . And apparently he had seen someone come back after the party had broken up . He had seen Archer and probably Joyce . Who else ? Sam Cusick 's words came back to him on a rush of memory : " There are two guys who know where I was last night . " Murdock exhaled through loose lips , thought : " I guess there 's only one who knows now . " He glanced about . Night hung pitch-black over the alley . The windows facing it and extending up the side of the four-story loft building opposite caught this black-  | ness , exaggerating and reflecting it . Surrounded by a neighborhood that was sordid and decadent , this manmade crevasse was abandoned . Dust , refuse , old papers , staves and hoops from a shattered barrel , littered the ancient cobblestone floor . And along this floor there swept a breeze which stirred the papers , giving them life , and spread a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it infused his thoughts . Bacon turned back to him . " One slug , right in the ticker . He was in the doorway here . " He turned and waved an arm at the shadows beyond the body . Murdock had not noticed it before , but he saw now that there was a doorway set deep in the wall of the building . The door was closed . The examiner stood up and spoke irritably . " I ca n't do much more here . I 'll have to get him where I can work on him . But he 's been dead quite a while , probably around noon . " " It was n't tough enough before , " Keogh growled irrelevantly . " He has to go get himself knocked off and make it tougher . " He began to swear . Murdock , speaking to Bacon , asked : " Just found him , huh ? " ? " Some kid found him . The killer tucked him in the doorway out of sight . " Murdock opened his plate-case and took out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of this . I 'm chiseling on the other button-pushers to give you a break , and what do I get out of it ? Hell , get lucky or something ! " Murdock said : " It looks as if you 'd have to find Cusick. "  | " It 's his kind of a job , " Bacon said . " And if we get some decent idea of when he was killed ? " " Decent ? " exploded the examiner , who was just starting to leave . " What do you want , a miracle ? You let him lay around for twelve hours and then expect me to work out the time of death by a mathematical formula . " Bacon held himself in check until the doctor left ; then he snarled : " Noon , huh ? And Archer skipped out at four-thirty . " " I told you he looked good to me , " Keogh said . " He looks good to me now , " Bacon said sharply . " We found out he hired a plane at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will  --  I got an idea I 'm going to persuade him to tell us where he was at noon today . " Murdock did not say anything ; he just busied himself with his camera and flash-bulbs and felt more worried about Tripp 's death than he cared to admit . Maybe Joyce could give Howard Archer an alibi . But it would take something more than lack of an alibi to get convictions and he knew it . And here he was kidding himself that he could solve the Redfield case . Murdock called MacShane when he got back to the office , told him about Tripp , and said that he had some pictures as first payment on the job MacShane was doing . He reached his apartment a half-hour later . The door was locked , and when he stepped into the darkened room and snapped on the light , he was aware of just one thing : the chilled , complete emptiness of the place .  | 18 THE POLICE DRAGNET was out . When Murdock arrived at headquarters the next morning at Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoodlums of varied experience and reputation in the hold-over . All leaves and vacations were suspended ; every plainclothesman in the city was out on the street checking , or trying to check , Tripp 's movements and looking for Sam Cusick . The Commissioner of Public Safety had a long telephone conversation with the Mayor . His Honor had added his sentiments to those received , and passed them along to the District Attorney and the Police Commissioner . The main hall of headquarters buzzed with activity  --  the hum of voices , the rap of feet on the bare stone floors . Plain-clothesmen hurried in and out of the main entrance , rode the elevators , and occasionally brought in a suspicious character . The Bureau of Records clerks were pawing through fingerprint cards ; the photographers and fingerprint men were still combing the alley for a worth-while clue . The upshot of the whole thing , Murdock learned when he entered Bacon 's office , was nothing . There were two newspapers on his desk . The News said : TRIPP MURDERED IN ALLEY . The Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a more conservative head reading : REDFIELD WITNESS SLAIN .  | Bacon chewed on a cigar and nursed a grouch . Keogh sat disconsolately in one corner . Quinn , from the District Attorney 's office , glanced at Murdock as he entered , and then took up his former position and stared gloomily out the window . Murdock said : " Well , I guess there is n't anything new , huh ? " He dropped his plate-case beside the doorframe , put the camera on an old sectional bookcase , his hat on top of the camera . " Nothing new ? " snapped Bacon . " No , damn it ! But to read these lousy rags you 'd think somebody 'd murdered the Governor . What 's the matter with me , anyway ? " Murdock waited . " I give you a break and then your paper starts to yell for my job , for all of our jobs . " " The Herald ? " Murdock snapped , frowning . " We did n't ? " " Well , " growled Bacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crucify us , huh ? " He broke off , took out his cigar , glared at it , and slammed it into the battered cuspidor with a curse . The gesture made an essential outlet for his feelings and he continued more evenly : " The Super was just in and he kinda laid it on to me . From now on newspaper guys are out till we know where we stand . " Bacon hesitated and Quinn turned to look at him . Murdock took his hat down , put it on . He appreciated Bacon 's position . In fact , he felt a certain sense of guilt that bothered him . He 'd gone along on his own hook and given Bacon or the police no help at all . True , what he had held back  | had no apparent importance . The Tripp thing yesterday morning had only been a hunch . Certainly he had not hindered the case , and he had not yet heard from MacShane . He continued stubbornly : " You got Cusick yet ? " " No , damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath and looked at Quinn . " Girard , " he said regretfully , " is in the clear . We could n't figure him for the Redfield job anyway , and now we know he did n't do it . " " How ? " pressed Murdock , stifling his interest . " The examiner 's turned in his report , " Bacon said sourly . " He says Tripp was shot once in the heart with a forty-five slug . He was shot some time around yesterday noon  --  and before two o'clock , and ? " " A couple hours after he ran out on us , " Murdock broke in. " ? neither Girard nor those two hoods he hired could 've done it , " Bacon continued , ignoring the interruption . " All three of them had lunch with McGurk and his secretary . " Murdock nodded and arched his brows . " The Repre-sentative ? " " Yeah . They had lunch early , so they could go to a double-header out at Braves Field . They ate at eleventhirty and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Murdock said , " that leaves Cusick . " " And Archer , " rapped Keogh . " Hell , " pressed Murdock , " have n't you turned up anything that ? "  | " No , " groaned Bacon . Then , forgetting in his despair that he was to give no further information , he added : " Nothing but this . " He opened a desk drawer , took out a roll of bills , and tossed them on the desk . Murdock stepped forward , straightened out the once folded sheaf of greenbacks . Bacon said : " Twelve hundred and forty bucks , " but Murdock paid no attention to him , his interest held by the fact that of the total amount the greater part was in crisp new bills  --  fifties . He picked up the money , counted it . The new bills amounted to one thousand dollars and he saw that the numbers ran consecutively . The rest of the amount was in old fifties and twenties . " Figure it for me , " he said dryly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tripp always had money . It coulda been his or ? " " Or , " cut in Quinn , stepping away from the window , " he blackmailed somebody for that thousand  --  he 's done it before . Somebody paid him so they could get a chance to turn around and knock him off . " Murdock stared at the new fifties for some seconds , finally stepped back and lit a cigarette . " If he blackmailed somebody on the Redfield job , why would n't this guy take back the thousand after he 'd killed him ? " " It can be figured , " Bacon said . " Look . " He sat up and put a fresh cigar in his mouth without biting off the end . " Tripp was in that upstairs hall all the time that party was going on . He hung around after it broke up , waiting for that dame of his . And he saw something . When we let him go he probably starts promoting the  | shakedown . Maybe that 's one reason why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date to collect . This guy  --  Cusick or Archer  --  says he 'll pay . Why ? To make Tripp think it 's okay and get him out where he can crack down on him . " Bacon spread his hands , and the cigar swiveled with his grimace of disgust . " Tripp falls for it and gets one in the vest . " " That does n't explain why the money was left , " Murdock said . " What of it ? Maybe the gun was scared off after he shot him ; maybe he did n't dare wait around searching the body . Maybe he 'd rather lose the thousand than take a chance ; and maybe he left it on purpose just to try and ball us up . " Bacon bit the end from the cigar , struck a match , and puffed a smoke-screen about his scowling face . " Well , to hell with that part . I do n't care a damn about that thousand . It do n't mean anything . Tripp was blackmailing the guy that killed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to know . Cusick  --  Archer . Gim me those two and you can worry about the money . " " I doubt like hell , " Murdock said sardonically , " if you could get a conviction if you had the two of them right here now  --  unless one of them had the murder gun . " " Yeah ? " leered Quinn . " Well , ten 'll get you twenty we convict . We 've got a few things , but we ca n't connect ' em up right till we get a chance to work over Cusick ? or this lad Archer . It makes a difference when we 've got a fellow here . There 's ways of persuading him , and once he starts to talk , things tie in fast . "  | " You could be right , " Murdock said , pulling his camera from the bookcase and moving to the door . " Tried to check up on that money  --  those new fifties ? " " Starting from scratch , " Bacon said , " it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a record of who they gave ' em to  --  and they might 've been drawn out for weeks . To hell with the money . " He broke off suddenly as though just remembering his former instructions . " G'wan , " he grated sharply , but not unkindly . " Get out ! Did n't I say no more inside dope ? Show something and we 'll play ball with you ; otherwise you and all the rest of you calamity howlers are out . " Phil Doane , patrolling the main-floor corridors , spotted Murdock as he stepped from the elevator . " Boy ! " he cheered . " How you take ' em ! " " What ? " said Murdock absently , still trying to put together the information he had received in Bacon 's office . " You did it again , " Doane wheezed . " Those pictures of Tripp . And I just missed you last night . " He sighed and went on disgustedly : " Know where I was ? At the Somersett getting some red-hot crap from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Husan 's bright ideas . " Doane cursed , and followed Murdock out to the street . " You 'd just left when I got back . Nobody knew where you 'd gone . Why did n't you ? " " Bacon called me , " Murdock said , hailing a taxi . " He would n't tell me what it was over the phone . I did n't know what it was all about till I got there . "  | Murdock got in the taxi , and Doane crowded in behind him . Murdock gave the driver his instructions and turned to the youth at his side . " Where the hell you go-ing ? " " With you . I ai n't supposed to be down here anyway . " " You 'd better stick to Van Husan , " Murdock told him good-naturedly , " or he 'll tie the can to you . " " If I do n't turn in something big pretty soon , " Doane moaned , " I wo n't have any more job than a rabbit anyway . Murdock got rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic paraphernalia he went directly to the library and called Jerry . He was a man grabbing at straws now . The police activities rested upon the capture of Cusick and Archer . There was nothing Murdock could do about that end . All that remained was to follow his lead with MacShane ? if he had any luck in finding the information he wanted . And he was not content to sit around and do nothing while he waited . He had to keep busy . Anything to keep his mind occupied . The only thing he could think of was to review the murder of Joe Cusick , Sam 's brother , and the Girard trial . At the time , he had not been particularly interested , had not followed the case as closely as he might have done . But there might be something , some bit of information that would furnish a lead or Jerry shuffled into view round the corner of a bookcase , stopped in front of Murdock , and pulled steelrimmed spectacles down from his forehead .  | " Can you get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Jerry nodded . " Do n't know why not . " " And I want it all , Jerry , from the time the two Cusicks tried to give Girard the shakedown . " As Jerry turned away , the telephone rang . The call was for Murdock . " I got the dope on that plane Archer hired , " Jack Fenner said . " I thought you 'd died , " Murdock said . " Yeah ? Well the lead was n't so very exclusive . The police turned it up . They had a guy over here waiting for the pilot . He stayed overnight in Washington . " " Where 'd he go ? " " Washington , you cluck ! " " Did n't know what happened to Archer ? " " Nope . Paid him off and took a cab . " " Okay , Jack . " Murdock grinned at the telephone . " Send me a bill  --  and do n't forget the cut rate . " Murdock pressed the receiver arm , held it a moment without hanging up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house in Brookline , asked to speak to Joyce . She was in and her voice did things to him , made him forget , for a moment or two , his worries . " How did it seem , " she asked , " to have your apartment back ? " " Empty , " Murdock said . " I did n't like it . You spoiled it for me . " " That 's encouraging . " " Why do n't you be nice and say you missed being there ? "  | " I do n't want to pamper you . " " All right . " Murdock hesitated and his voice got casual . " I found out something about your brother . They went to Washington . " " Oh , " the voice was dull . " Have the police ? " " They do n't know any more than I do . " He hesitated again , deciding against telling her about Tripp . She might read about it in the paper , but He asked : " When did you see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is there any servant there who can tell you where he was in the morning ? " She said : " I 'll see , " and left the telephone . When she came back a minute or so later , she added : " He went out about ten ; he came back about a quarter after one and started to pack furiously . Why ? Is there ? " " I was just wondering , " Murdock said , and trouble clogged his brain . He talked awhile longer , changing the subject immediately , and hung up . Again he got the office operator and asked for MacShane . " Got anything ? " he asked . " Not yet , " MacShane said . " Two of ' em have come back . Did n't find anything . And say , should n't we cross Tripp 's picture off that gallery ? " " Leave it . He could have called , " Murdock said flatly . " We got to make sure . Ring me up when those other two men come in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you . " Jerry came back with a half-dozen large envelopes in his hands . Murdock moved over to an oak table , pulled out a chair , and sat down . He began his work systemati-  | cally by emptying all the envelopes and sorting out his material in chronological order . When he had finished his preparations he began to read , starting back four years previous when the Cusick brothers tried their extortion scheme on Girard . By noon he had read little more than a quarter of the story . He rang for Jerry and asked him when he ate . Jerry said any time . Murdock got an office boy and sent him out for sandwiches and beer and pie . Murdock liked Jerry . An old-time newspaper man who had become stuck on the copy desk , he had retired only to become irked with the sudden idleness . A job had been found for him in the library and , according to Jerry , he intended to keep within smelling-distance of printer 's ink , within sight of the city room , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the library 's worn leather divan , and then , shortly after one , Murdock resumed his study of the clippings . He made notes as he read , jotting down the salient features of the story . Always one sentence kept cropping up in his mind , a sentence that , even when he finished the last clipping , shortly after six o'clock , was still unanswered : " Acting on an anonymous tip , Captain Keller , Sergeant Anthony , and Detectives Reed and Crosetti of police headquarters found Girtcrd alone in his apartment .... " Murdock repacked the envelopes and stood up . He stretched , put both hands in the small of his back , arched it , and yawned . He said : " Acting on an anonymous tip , " softly , and his lean face got somber , his eyes brooding  | and thoughtful . Then , driven by the impulse of inspiration , he went out into the city room and walked over to a desk near the windows . A small man with a black mustache and prematurely gray hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown eyes , and said : " Hy , Kent . " Murdock answered : " Hello , Naylor . " He slid one thigh over.a corner of the desk . " You busy ? " " Not too busy . What 's on your mind ? " " You 're the one who followed through on Joe Cusick and the Girard trial , huh ? " " One of the ones , " Naylor grunted . " Come in the library for about five minutes . " Naylor looked puzzled , but he stood up and followed Murdock across the room and through the swinging wooden gate . Murdock offered a cigarette and Naylor accepted as he sat down on the divan . When they both had lights , Murdock said : " I 've been reading up on that job until I 'm blearyeyed . Listen while I unload , and check me if I 'm wrong . I want to be sure I got the story right . " Naylor leaned back , smiling wryly . " Shoot . " " Four years ago the Cusicks tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backfired . Girard saw the thing through . Redfield refused to take their case and they went up . The night after they were released from prison , Joe Cusick was found dead in an automobile three blocks from Girard 's apartment , shot once through the head . A roundsman found him at eleven o'clock , and about the same time he was calling in , headquarters got a tip . They beat it right down to  | Girard 's place , found him alone in the apartment , and searched the place . They found just two things . " Murdock hesitated , turned on the divan to face Naylor . " They found a gun with Cusick 's fingerprints on it , and they found what looked like bloodstains on the rug . " He glanced down at the slip of paper containing his notes and read what had been a headline : " Blood Clue in Cusick Slaying . " " On the strength of this they took him down , questioned him while they built up a case , booked him . A specialist testified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the trial the defense experts offered a rebuttal to show that this blood could not be definitely proved to be Cusick 's . They found out that Cusick 's fingerprints were on the gun picked up in Girard 's place , but the hitch was that this gun had not been fired  --  it was a different caliber from the slug found in Cusick 's head . " The D. A. built up a good case , but it was circumstantial . Cusick had been seen in front of Girard 's apartment , and the D. A. 's case was that Cusick came back to give Girard another shakedown , that Girard shot him and then lugged the body down the back way , put it in a car , and drove three blocks , to where the cop found it . " Naylor puffed on his cigarette and said nothing . Murdock frowned at his slip of paper , read : " Absence of Clues Aids Defense . " " Redfield 's defense , " he continued , " was merely a complete denial . No one had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly before the stated time of Cusick 's death . His story was that someone must have tried to frame him and had planted the gun in his apart
