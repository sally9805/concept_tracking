When Tom Mooney was tried in 1917 for the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade bombing that killed ten people , most of the U. S. was inclined to agree with the court that found him guilty . In the 21 years since , U. S. opinion and Tom Mooney have changed considerably . Time , and doubt about his guilt , have made Mooney , to a majority of the U. S. ( as revealed by a Gallup Poll last January ) , seem the victim of an outrageous miscarriage of justice . In San Quentin jail . Convict Mooney has come to see himself clearly in the role of the nation 's No. 1 martyr . In his 21-year fight to prove his innocence , Tom Mooney has thrice emerged from San Quentin to tell his story of the bombing to California courts in San Francisco . Last week , he made his fourth and longest excursion , this time to tell the same story to the California State Assembly . <P> By a narrow margin ( 37-to-30 ) the Assembly had voted down a proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever chagrin he felt at this . Convict Mooney , dressed in the neat blue suit he wears on such occasions , began his story quietly into a loudspeaker which promptly required adjustment . While it was being repaired , newspaper and newsreel cameramen flocked about the celebrity . Said Convict Mooney : " I hope you people in the room will bear with me but after being buried for 21 years ... I sort of take to all this . " <P> Into the loudspeaker when it was working again Convict Mooney poured the sorry tale that has become his lifework . ( In his San Quentin cell the walls are lined with 20 volumes of legal records in his case . ) Rambling back to his childhood , he explained how a beating when he played hookey from school " made Tom Mooney rebel " ; how his activities as an agitator caused San Francisco 's Pacific Gas &; Electric Co. to take " possession of the District Attorney 's Office " ; how when the Preparedness Day bomb exploded he and his wife were elsewhere . Said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Mrs. Mooney and I were in her studio on the fifth floor of the Eilers Building . A large flag covered the window . We could not see the parade so we went up on the roof . <P> " On the roof was Wade Hamilton , an Eilers ' employe with a small camera , mak-ing pictures . In the sweep of his camera he caught us as well as the parade . A clock down on the street also was in the picture . In three of his pictures , the clock showed the time to be 1:58 p. m. , 2:01 p. m. , and 2:04 p.m . <P> " The time of the explosion was 2:06 p. m . " <P> Whenever Tom Mooney tells the story of his martyrdom he has at least one new fact to freshen it up . Last week , this concerned the famed photograph-in which the State claims the clock hands were retouched-which is the strongest piece of circumstantial evidence in Mooney 's favor . Said Convict Mooney : <P> " I shall now tell you something which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a man in the photo-engraving business in San Francisco who told me that District Attorney Charles Fickert came to him and wanted him to change the time on the clock , as it was shown in the picture . The man refused . I asked him to testify for me , but he said that would ruin his business . "
