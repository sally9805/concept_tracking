Unless it be the backstage of the Woodlawn Neighborhood Playhouse an hour before the opening curtain of The TorchBearers , there is no scene of such dithering excitement as the office of a brand new magazine about to be published by amateurs . The A. S. Gilman Printing Co. of Cleveland gyrated last week when a group of smart young people of the town brought forth the first issue of Parade , a " social , semi-humorous and pictorial " weekly . <P> But in Parade , Clevelanders found no puerile product of juveniles writing about their friends , but a trim , well-mounted magazine which came creditably close to its aim : a smartchart for Cleveland . <P> In vitality of photograph it easily equaled Town &; Country . Text and drawing exhibited well the New Yorker technique but missed the master 's polished cough and sigh . Only false note was a great photograph of , and leading article by , Randolph Churchill , jejune son of Winston , whose relation to Cleveland , if any , was nowhere explained . After that each page went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions without printed answers , e. g. : " Who is the minister who has the most complete collection of pornography in the city ? " " Who is the financial power whose wife remarked when a maid complained of the master 's attentions : ' Is n't that splendid ! Between us both possibly we can keep him at home for a few evenings of the week , ' " etc . <P> The Birth of Parade was the big moment in the youthful career of W. Holden White , 25 , publisher and chairman of the board , and his good friend Winsor B. French , 25 , cofounders . Publisher White is the polo-playing scion of the family which founded The White Co . Director French is a vivacious adman , versifier , socialite . For excellence of photography and art , credit is given to a young Clevelander , Jerome Brainerd Zerbe Jr. , himself an able sketcher.
