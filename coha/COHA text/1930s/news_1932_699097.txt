txt Drafting of men into industry by the Federal Government through its power of taxation was proposed today by Mr. Roger ? W. Babson , head of the Babson Institute . His proposition would give employers the option of supporting the unemployed by taxes or putting them to work . Speaking at the nineteenth annual national business conference of the Babson Statistical Organization , Mr. Babson espoused the Quota Plan of employment to ... head off the dole and to reverse the vicious circle of unemployment and waning purchasing power . Estimating that there are 6,000,000 jobless after the normally unemployed are deducted , he said about $10,600 would have to be assessed against each average business concern as # special tax to support the jobless this winter unless work is made available . Option for Employers According to the Quota Plan , each concern would receive the choice of paying the tax or of putting a certain number of men to work . Preference would , he declared , extend to the latter option , for not only would the tinployer get the benefit of men working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed by the widely expanding purchasing power . " The millions of dollars which these ' quota ' employees would spend each Saturday night would , ' he said , " immediately return to industry in increased business for the benefit of employers , and investors , as well as the wage earners . " Holding that the increase in purchasing power is the essential contribution of the plan to business , he stressed the resultant necessity for effecting it on a wide scale . The action of a single employer in returning men to work would only burden him and in no way augment the general purchasing power , he said . Illustrating by application to Boston , he said : " It was estimated that the unemployed in Boston on July 1 , 1932 , was about 50,000 , of which one-half were receiving aid aggregating $1,000,000 a month . About 20 per cent of all Boston 's taxes goes to take care of the abnormally uneinployed . If taxpayers were given the option of paying this 20 per cent either in cash or by proportionately increasing the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced and as other cities cooperated abnormal unemployment would be eliminated entirely . " Self-Liquidating The quota plan in contradistinction to the English dole is , he continued self-liquidating , while the dole is self-perpetuating . As bust  --  ness revives , the quota plan would automatically pass out of existence according to him , and with it the bureau it might temporarily have established . The plan , according to Mr. Babson , is of sufficient practicality to make unwarranted any further inaction by public officials or continuance of the present suffering through idleness . A super-express transcontinental highway should be built immediately to give employment and provide transportation facilities that are sorely needed , Mr. Charles F. Abbott , executive director of the American Institute of Steel Construction , declared . He stated that such a road would be made to pay for itself from revenue derived from proper taxes on buses and cars using It . The proposed highway in addition to giving work and paying for Itself , would , he said , yield economies through the saving of wear and tear on the other roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every state was held forth as guaranteeing a steady increase in the country 's purchasing power .
