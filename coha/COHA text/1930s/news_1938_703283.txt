txt The statement by President Roosevelt that the Federal Reserve Board had I agreed to liberalize reserve requirements of the members banks so as to add an additional $750,000,000 to the excess reserves which on April 13 were already about $1,723,000,000 was interpreted to mean that the board would in effect restore the reserve requirements which were applicable before May 1 , 1937 . The action then , which raised reserve requirements by one-seventh and completed the program of doubling the requirements begun on Aug. 15 , 1936 , was intended to decrease the excess reserves by about the figure of $750,000,000 mentioned by President Roosevelt . The actual effect was to cut them by $700,000 , - 000 , leaving the total as of May 1 " 11 .. t about $890,000,000 . Just prior to May 1 the Reserve requirements by percentages on classes of deposits were as follows : Net demand deposits  --  central Reserve city banks , 23/4 . ; Reserve city banks , 171k ; country banks , 121/4 . Time deposits , all member banks , 51/4 . The increase made May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in effect , 26 , 20 , 14 and 6 . Details Wait Discussion If the Federal Reserve Board , as expected , restores the rates effective just prior to May 1 and adds about $750,000,000 to the excess reserves this would be added to the $1,703,000,000 as of April 14 for a total of $2,473 ; 000,000 . The latter agreement would further be increased as the . $1,392,000 , - 000 of inactive gold was made the base for expenditures and if all the desterilized gold was used the aggregate of the excess reserves would go to $3,873,000,000 , a high record . On Dec. 11 , 1935 , the earlier high mark , excess reserves were $3,304,000,000 and en Aug. 11 , 1936 , just before the Federal Reserve made its initial raise in reserve requirements , the excess reserves were $3 ; 167,000,000 . At the offices ' of the Federal Reserve Board it was stated today that formal action had not yet been taken by the board and that exact details . of what " was to be done would await discussion by the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve requirements which existed just prior to May 1 would be restored . Whatever may be the exact policy adopted , the step will mark a direct reversal of Reserve Board policy which was initiated on Aug. 15 , 1936 , when excess reserves were approximately $3,000,000,000 . Then the boa increased the reserve requirements by 50 per cent , stating that this action eliminated " as a possible basis of injurious credit expansion " a part of the huge total of excess reserves . Actually its effect was a reduction from around $3,000,000,000 to about $1,900,000,000 . To Remove Unnecessary Reserves Under the law the board was au- ? thorized to double the reserve requirements , and it brought this program to accomplishment by the increased requirements effective as of March 1 , 1937 , and May 1 , 1937 . After the final increase of reserve requirements on May 1 the board in a statement issued May 9 , said that the action was taken " for the Ipurpose of removing from the credit , base a large volume of un1 necessary reserves arising from the inflow of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit expansion . " In each instance when the reserve requirements were raised the board stressed that this did not mean an abandonment of the board 's easy money policy , pointing out that the remaining excess reserves were more than sufficient for all needs of business and industry and that if it felt such a course essential to public interest the system could at any time add to excess reserves by open market operations which would add to the portf9ho holdings of government securities by regional banks . With the excess reserves at the present high level , therefore , the proposal to increase the excess reserves by liberalization of reserve requirements was interpreted in some quarters as a step largely for the psychological effect in. a general program which has inflationary tendencies . Whether it will induce banks to liberalize lending policies by piling up their excess reserves is conjectural in the present situation . When it took the last step on May 1 , 1937 , the board had exercised the full , authority in that direction vested in it by the present law . Whether it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the reserves has not been made known . The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks hold in their portfolios about $2,565,000,000 of government securities , some or all of which they could sell to tighten up the money market if a runaway inflationary credit movedient should get under way . Likewise , if as proposed the reserve requirements are decreased , the board could at any time attempt ' to control overexpansion by raising the requirements again to the limit now permitted by the law . Until the latest spending-lending program was set in motion the , general understanding here was that the Reserve Board was strongly opposed to any retreat in its reserve requirement policy and also had been in accord with the Treasury policy of gold sterilization . The proposed switch in policy , so far as the easing of the reserve requirements in any event , therefore , came as somewhat of a surprise to ob- , servers here .
