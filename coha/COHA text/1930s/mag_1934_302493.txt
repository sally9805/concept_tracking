" Names make news . " Last week these ' names made this news : <P> Onto the stage of a Manhattan theatre walked gruff , chubby George White Rogers , chief radio operator of the T. E. L. Morro Castle , to greet an apathetic audience with : " You people have made a hero out of me . . . . " For his appearances " Sparks " Rogers expected to receive $1,000 a week . <P> To beg the autograph of Negro Bandmaster Cab Galloway ( " ho-de-ho " ' ) , 100 white girls and their tipsy escorts crowded about the platform of Memphis ' Casino Ballroom . While they pawed his trousers , grabbed at his coat , Galloway , whose skin is much lighter than his players ' , referred to his " boys " as " Mr. Payne . Mr. Maxey . . . . " At the first " Mister " the crowd grumbled . At the second chairs began to fly . Off the stage scuttled resplendent Bandmaster Galloway and his frightened blacks . Up over the platform swarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police cleared the Casino . <P> Sailing to attend the Paris Automobile Show , Signius Wilhelm Poul ( William ) Knudsen , executive vice president of General Motors Corp. , who wonders why grass is green , predicted : " This country will never submit to regimentation and it will emerge from the Depression because it has too many Charles M. Schwabs . " <P> Back from Europe and ready to leave for Hyde Park , Bernard Mannes Baruch gazed out upon Manhattan , philosophized darkly : " They were all crazy and I think a lot of them still are . They have the same delusions they had in 1927 to 1929 . They are striving to restore the same values that were in existence during those years , not realizing that such a thing is impossible . Do you see those buildings over there ? They are the pyramids of today . Nobody knows exactly why the pyramids were built but they were used as tombs for ancient kings . Those pyramids of today are also tombs , only they are the tombs of the public . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Sovereign Gates of the University of Pennsylvania , Mrs. Virginia Gates McCafferty took her new hitchhiking husband Dan on a motor honeymoon to California . Near Dixon they crashed head-on into another car , fatally injuring a young girl , suffering head injuries themselves . <P> In the early-morning darkness on a lonely New Jersey road President George D. Strohmeyer of Child 's Restaurants ( " The Nation 's Host " ) focused his eyes on a roadside sign : Maridell Inn . Restaurateur Strohmeyer and two companions made their way to the sign , yanked it down , drove on in high spirits . On a street corner in Spring Lake a patrolman found them few minutes later gazing happily at a bonfire blazing from the splinters of the sign . For their prank Funster Strohmeyer &; friends divided a fine of $75 and $19.50 costs .
