txt Not a single bid was received by the Board of Transportation yesterday on its proposed Contract No. 5 for private operation of the new city subway system . The board immediately sent to the Board of Estimate a request for a $700,000 appropriation to cover the cost of starting municipal operation of the Eighth Avenue subway , the first link of the new system , about July 1 . Simultaneously it announced that it would receive on May 27 proposals on a revised private operating contract whose financial provisions might answer the objections of those who regarded as too harsh the terms of the contract which failed to elicit a single bid . The revised draft will be made public today and a hearing on its form will be held May 12 . By its action the Board of Transportation made it virtually certain that early in June the Board of Estimate will be called upon , in case the revised contract attracts one or more bidders , to choose definitely between municipal operation and privat. : operation under a contract and lease . In transit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Transportation to receive bids on the revised contract would increase tremendously the pressure to plunge the city into direct operation of its new lines in connection with the B. M. T. and Interborough . Redrafting the Agreement . Anticipating the lack of bids on Contract No. 5 the Board of Transportation began recently to redraft its operating agreement , paying particular attention to the provisions governing the compensation to be paid to the operator and the return to be provided on its invested capital . Members of the board were confident yesterday that these terms have been sufficiently " liberalized " to assure bids . The revised draft , in other respects , including the provision for termination in the event of unification , is substantially the same as Contract No. 5 . At a conference with John H. Delaney , chairman of the board , representatives of Ford , Bacon &; Davis , engineers , submitted details of a modified form of contract . These were taken under consideration . When the board met to open bids on Contract No. 5 earlier in the day Mr. Delaney read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bid because " the risks involved , principally in the early years of operation while the system is so largely in the construction stage , are such that any bid properly protecting ourselves , would , we fear , be unacceptable to the city . " The request for an appropriation of $700,000 to initiate , if necessary , municipal operation . will appear on the Board of Estimate calendar on Friday and will be referred to the committee of the whole . Although the communication embodying the request/contains estimates of cost of preliminary operation between May 15 and June 30 , it is not believed that the matter will be taken up until after the Board of Transportation has either notified the Board of Estimate that no bids have been received on the revised contract or submitted for approval an award of that contract to a successful bidder . The revised contract will not be submitted to the Board of Estimate for approval before bids are received and an award made . It was said by Mr. Delaney that Contract No. 5 was so submitted because official approval was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease and contract . Contract Held Too Harsh In its letter to the Board of Estimate the Board of Transportation recited the failure to receive bids on Contract No. 5 and revealed the decision to revise that contract " in order to meet criticism that the form of contract under which proposals were invited today was too harsh . " " If the making of such a contract is found by your honorable board to be inexpedient , impracticable or prejudicial to the public interest , " the letter continued , " the Board of Transportation is charged with the duty of devising and preparing a plan for the maintenance and operation of the new independent rapid transit system . In order to meet this situation , should it arise , the Board of Transportation has prepared a plan for such maintenance and operation . " After reciting the provisions of the rapid transit act covering municipal operation the letter estimated that at least $675,000 would be required to cover the expenses for " organization and training of operating forces , preparing structure for operation and the first month of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asserted , would be more than enough to meet costs of all operating and maintenance charges , power and all other costs exclusive of capital charges . The board 's estimate of the first month 's expenses was as follows : For preliminary operation and preparation of structure for operation ... $150,000 For additional equipment . spare parts . electrical energy , &c.; . 200,000 For payment of operating force sufficient for one month 's operation 325,000 Total $675.000 The letter , which was signed by Mr. Delaney , asked that the $700,000 be made available by sale of revenue bonds or tax notes . Line Virtually Completed . Declaring that the Eighth Avenue line is now virtually complete and ready for operation Mr. Delaney submitted estimates covering the cost of preliminary operation between May 15 and June 30 and revenue operation between July 1 and Dec. 31 in the event that the city should undertake to operate the lines directly . He placed the cost of preliminary operation at $148,271.49 and that of revenue operation for the six months ' period at $1,898,469.61 . Estimates of passenger revenue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,300,000 , exclusive of revenues from advertising and merchandising privileges . Mr. Delaney 's estimate was predicated upon the carrying of 46,000,000 passengers during the six-month period .

Removing barricades and recovering and repairing h a a d rail , dic. 3,000.00 Totals $148,271.49 41,898,469.61 B. M. T. in Good Position . It was believed in transit circles that if the revised operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private operators the B. M. T. would be in a favored position to submit proposals , partly because of the physical conformation of the new subway with its own structure , partly because of its long experience in the type of operation required and partly because of its admitted stake in the pending transit unification plan . Resort by the city to municipal operation , it was said , would probably mean that there would be little hope left for a unity plan because the city , once embarked upon direct operation , would be forced to continue . For this reason close observers of the transit situation are confident that future developments will bring the B. M. T. to the fore as the most likely operator of the new system if it is turned over to private interests . By revising the contract the Board of Transportation is now in a position to answer those critics who may protest at hearings before the Board of Estimate on approval of an award that the terms are too favorable to the operator . The answer , it is expected , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's interests and later " softened " to provide additional financial assurances for the operator , failed to attract a single proposal . The original contract provided that the operator would be paid its annual allowance only if it was earned , with no cumulative deficits . Then it was amended to guarantee the operator a 6 per cent return on invested capital and additional equipment , providing also that any deficit on such a return , if not earned in a given year , would be cumulative , but not payable in subsequent periods unless actually earned . No preferential was established for the operator 's benefit , however . Mr. Delaney did not disclose the additional changes in financial provisions which will be embodied In the revised contract to be published today , but it was indicated that still more leeway would be given the operator , so that it would have stronger assurance of a minimum return , especially in the initial periods of operation . New Attack on Delaney . The West Side Association of Commerce , which has persistently assailed Mr. Delaney and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , renewed its attack yesterday when it was known that no bids had been received on Contract No. 5 . " Once again the Board of Transportation , with its high-salaried commissioners and its staffs of legal and engineering experts has failed , " declared James W. Danahy , the association 's managing director , reiterating his earlier charge that " the contract was never drawn with the idea of interesting bidders . " The contract , he declared , was merely a " stall " to delay operation until there was definite assurance that unification would be achieved within the next three years . The revised contract , Mr. Danahy charged , was being drawn merely to provide an excuse for still further delay . " There may be a few persons who are optimistic enough to believe the statement that the city will operate the line itself about ' July 1 if the new contract does not produce better results , " Mr. Danahy said . " None of these persons , however , lives on Eighth Avenue . They have heard . too many promises of operation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , the Board of Transportation is perfectly safe in asking the Board of Estimate to appropriate the sum of $700,000 to permit municipal operation , since the board knows that the city has not the sum of $700,000 available for this or any other purpose .
