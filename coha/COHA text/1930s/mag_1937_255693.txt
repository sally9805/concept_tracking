Glumly on the first day of spring last week , Celestials read almost unanimous forecasts by China 's most esteemed soothsayers that in 1937 will break " The Big War " between their country and Japan . What clinched this soothsaying in many Chinese minds last week was the appointment in Tokyo of a sword-handy Cabinet which proceeded to squelch the Japanese Diet . New Japanese Premier General Hayashi is known and hated throughout China as " The Border Crosser . " Reason : in 1931 his troops were the first Japanese unit to cross the border from Korea , invading Chinese Manchuria , the larger part of which Japan has now turned into her puppet Empire of Manchukuo . <P> Optimistic were the 1937 economic surveys of China 's great Shanghai banks . They pointed out that New Year 's is the day on which Chinese businessmen expect each other to have all outstanding debts settled , rejoiced that 1937 's dread " settlement day " last week brought not a single Shanghai business or bank failure . As every Chinese shivers to recall , the 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but China , like England , always muddles through . " <P> The muddling through in northwest China last week was more a case of bloodling through . For the past five years China has had a compact , mobile , self-styled " Red State " -a vast semi-bandit group of Chinese Communists under able native Red generals , propagandists and administrators who in 1931 had established a Provisional Government in a large splotch of China some 200 miles in diameter , perilously close to the Chinese Government at Nanking ( see map ) . This Red State today can be roughly compared to those of such old-time Asiatic nomad conquerors as Genghis Khan , whose traveling bureaucrats pitched their tents and unraveled their red tape wherever the Great Khan 's soldiers had blazed the way . Since 1934 the Red State has been " driven " or has " advanced " - according to the point of view-ahead of so-called Anti-Communist Bandit Suppression Forces dispatched by Chinese Premier &; Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek . <P> The Red State , twisting and turning in its 2,000 miles of migration , arrived more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit many of these Chinese Communists , mostly farmers , to take some welcome respite and more or less settle down in three large blotches with a total area today of perhaps 80,000 sq . mi . Last week this Red State was spectacularly absorbing many soldiers once commanded by Young Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang , recently kidnapper of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ( TIME , Dec. 21 et seq. ) and war lord of Manchuria until the Japanese drove him out ( TIME , Sept. 28 , 1931 ) . Worse still , last week the deserters of the Young Marshal 's standard were killing their officers , as many of these were not so eager as their men to go Red . <P> Butchered by his soldiers at Sian last week was memorable General Wang Ichi . In 1931 he was one of the very few Manchurian generals to offer brave resistance to the battling and bribing Japanese . Butchered too last week were Colonels Chiang Pin , Hsu Fang and Sung Hsueh-li while others of the Young Marshal 's officers escaped or were held " in custody " at Sian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
