txt Federal efforts to stop ' the merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York ( Socony ) and the Vacuum Oil Company were abandoned today when the Department of Justice announced it would not appeal to the Supreme Court on the adverse decision handed down in the Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis in February . This action left unhampered the first union of two units of the old Standard Oil Company , which was broken up in 1911 , and the consequent formation of t ? corporation with assets said to exceed $900,000 , - 000 . In argument by the government special action in such cases , volumithat the merger of these two oil companies would create the second or third largest corporation in the United States . The government 's war on this merger was begun in March , 1930 , when it filed suit for an injunction restraining it in the District Court at St. Louis . Under a law permitting special action in such cases , voluminous testimony was taken by a special master and the injunction was argtied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circuit Court of Appeals , who sat as a special three-judge District Court . Their decision was handed down in St. Louis Feb. 6 , and they granted the Department of Justice time to file notice of appeal expiring tomorrow . Saw Possible Reunion of All . The argument of the government 's case was made in Omaha by John Lord O'Brien , assistant to Attorney General Mitchell , who was opposed to G. H. Orr , a New York attorney . Each was supported by a score of assistants , and the case was termed the most important oil litigation since the original Standard Oil dissolution suit in 1911 . Mr. O'Brien argued that the granting of permission for this merger might open the way for a reunion of the various Standard Oil companies and would thwart the intent of the old dissolution order , - which aimed at perpetuating competition in the oil business . Mr. Orr replied that the oil business had become highly competitive and cited statistics showing that both of the companies involved controlled together only a fraction of the oil and gasoline business of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not involved in direct competition to any large extent , inasmuch as Soconoy 's principal business was the sale of gasoline , while the Vacuum company specialized in lubricating oils . Both have large interests abroad . According to opinions unofficially expressed here , the recent decision will makes it possible for other mergers of oil companies to take place , providing It can be shown in each case individually that competition will not be restrained . The exception to this rule is believed to be the Standard of New Jersey , which , as direct descendant of the parent company , may be bound by . the ruling of 1911 that the old company could never recapture its severed branches . Appeal Is Held Futile . Although the Department of Justice named no individual in announcing its decision , the final word was left with Thomas ' Day Thacher , solicitor general of the department , who handles all questions of appeals . Mr. O'Brian was thought to wish to carry on the case , arguing it before the Supreme Court , but apparently he acquiesced to the judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the department , after reviewing the history of the case , said : " The controlling facts which establish the propriety and validity of the merger as a legitimate business arrangement of importance to the companies concerned have been judicially determined upon evidence sufficient to support the conclusion . In the Supreme Court the facts found in the lower court would undoubtedly be accepted as established by the evidence . " It has been determined that the government is not justified in prolonging this litigation by a futile appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States . " ; Merger Plans Held to Need Change , Peter M. Speer , vice president of the Standard Oil Company of New York , declined to comment on the decision of the government to abandon its action to prevent merger of that company with the Vacuum Oil Company , but it was presumed in Wall Street yesterday that efforts to put through the transaction would be resumed , although not immediately . The plan of merger , announced Feb. 21 , 1930 , provided that a new company , to be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the older companies , giving three of its shares for each Vacuum share and one of its shares for each Standard of New York share . In February , 1930 , Standard of New York stock ranged from 31% to 33% . Vacuum stock ranged from 88% to 96% . The high for Standard of New York this year was 26 and it reached a new low of 14% yesterday . Vacuum sold as high as 69% on the Curb Exchange this year and dropped yesterday to a new low of 221 , x , closing down 4% points at 22% . In view of the discrepancy in the prices of Standard of New York and Vacuum - 'ocks In February , 1930 , and those now current , it is thought likely that the terms would have to be revised if the merger were to be consummated in the immediate future . Wall Street revived the question of a merger of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the Standard Oil Company of California , but inquiry yesterday elicited the opinion that there was no intention to move now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard Oil Company of Ohio and the Ohio Oil Company might unite , but informed circles held that the present was not an auspicious time for mergers . -
