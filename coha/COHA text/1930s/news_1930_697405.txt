txt Abolition of the personal property tax , which amounts to $807,161,935 on the tentative assessment rolls of New York City for 1931 , has been recommended to the Mayor 's committee on taxation by its special committee on tax administration . Scrapping of this arbitrary system of taxation , which keeps taxicab drivers , elevator boys and doormen busy swearing that they are not possessed of $30,000 worth of personal property and which is said to cause even the wealthy to hurry to the tax offices seeking an equitable adjustment of their assessments , is advocated also by State Senator Seabury C. Mastick of Westchester , chairman of the State tax revision commission . Peter Grimm , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , Inc. , and head of the M , yor 's committee on taxation , after explaining that the Mayor 's committee had taken no action , and that he spoke for himself , said he advocated abolition of the personal estate tax .

So strong is the opposition to the city 's continued levy of a tax which is called haphazard and unscientific that attaches of the Department of Taxes and Assessments freely predict that they will have made up the last personal property tax records when they complete the final assessment rolls early next year . In the Department of Taxes and Assessments it was said that the city had seen the writing on the wall , when it decided to make an enormous cut in the personal estate tentative assessments for 1931 . The tentative personal property assessments for 1930 amounted to $1,245 , - 839,475 , so that the tentative assessment for 1931 represents a slash of $438,677,540 . The city , however , collected only a small fraction of the tentative levy on personal property for 1930 , as the , final assessment rolls showed a shrinkage to $380,439,630 . The tentative personal estate assessments for 1931 , however , still represent an increase of $426,722,305 over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal property rolls is that of $1,100 , - 000 against John D.

" The $1,600,000 personal estate tax paid by the Rockefellers amounts to a gift to the city , and they have paid it for years , " explained one of the city tax officials . " An individual can be taxed for . personal property only where he has his residence . If the Rockefellers , who both have homes in Pocantico Hills , should claim Tarry town as their , residence the city of New York would be unable to- collect that tax . " The Rockefellers have never made an effort to escape that tax , further explained the official , regardless of all that has been said in public print concerning tax favors shown to them by the city . Gives Reasons for Proposal . The reasons why the Mayor's-committee on taxation , Special Committee on Tax Administration , is advocating the abolition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the special committee , in a letter to Martin Saxe , chairman of the executive committee of the Mayor 's committee , which has taken no action on the report . The Mayor 's committee comprises several subcommittees or special committees which are at work trying to find a solution to the whole problem of city taxation . The report of the Special Committee on Tax Administration is its first . It follows : ? Sept. 2 , 1930 . Martin Saxe , Esq. , Chairman . Executive Committee , Mayor 's Committee on Taxation , New York , N. Y .. Dear . Mr. Saxe : The Special Committee on Tax Administration has considered the problem presented by the ad valorem tax on tangible personal property and reports in favor of its abolition and , until it shall have been abolished , that the Department of Taxes and Assessments should give more careful attention to the elimination from the assessments rolls of all persons from whom no tax can be collected . We summarize the reasons for our conclusions . Since the valuable report to the Legislature about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wells was . chairman , it has been recognized by economists and students of taxation that an ad valorem tax on personal property is impracticable , unequal and unjust . The State of New York was never afflicted by this tax in the extreme form in which , it has been applied in many other States . To the extent to which we have suffered from this tax , the- results ' have . always been bad .. - . To greater : and greater degree this has been- recognized , and from - time to time classes of property have been- removed from its operation . Finally , when the State income tax- was adopted in 1919 , intangible personal property was- exempted from ad valorem taxation , and is now exempt by Section 4A of the tax law . The effect of this legislation - was to leave taxable at the local tax rate tangible personal property , but all corporations required to pay a franchise tax based on net income are exempt from taxation in respect of their personal property . - We are therefore concerned almost exclusively with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The classes of corporations liable to this tax are few , and property of this nature is inconsiderable , and but few of them are , in fact , assessed . Dropped Outside City . For many years there has been very little effort made outside of the city of New York to assess personal property . For the year 1927 the total assessment of personal property in the State was $334 , - 000,000 , of which the city of New York contributed $308,000,000 . In many of the cities and towns there was no assessment of personal property at all . The efforts of the Tax Department of the city , of New York to assess personal property have frequently been the subject of ridicule because they assess watchmen , janitors , coachmen and the like for large sums of money when , if the circumstances of the persons were known , it would be obvious that they would not be liable to any such assessment . That is not the fault of the department , ' but the fault of the law . People say jeeringly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random . It is true that they did use the City Directory when there was a directory . Now they use the telephone book , the Social Register and such other sources of information as may be available . They do not make assessments at random . They are very painstaking about it .. They assess few persons in the borough of Manhattan who reside east of Third Avenue , unless it be at Suton Place and Tudor City . When a man moves from a side street to Riverside Drive his assessment is " increased . Likewise , when he moves to Park Avenue he ' is favored with a substantial assess. - ment . This is madness , but a madness imposed by law , and there ' is careful . method in the madness . In view of the problem presented , it is not surprising that the assessment of personal estate on the annual record for 1929 was $1,154,000 , - 000 , and after the grievance period was over , there remained but $311 , - 000,000 . Ninety-one thousand persons were assessed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levied against persons owning this personal estate to the amount of $7,953,000 , Collections to date ' on account of that levy have been $1,737,562 , which is lees than 25 per cent of the levy . This is not surprising in view of the inevitable conditions under which the assessments were made . But if more diligence were exercised in eliminating the names of persons who should not have been assessed , and in cutting down the names that are added to the record of persons concerning whom the department has no knowledge , the percentage of uncollectibles might be less . We submit a table showing for each borough the levy of personal - taxes , and the collections to date , for ' each Year , and for each borough - from 1920 through 1930 . It appears that Manhattan bears the brunt of the assessment and pays the larger proportion of the levy . Consider the levy and the collection for 1929 ? Manhattan paid about 25 per . cent , Bronx paid less than 10 per cent of its levy ; Brooklyn paid less than 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond paid.about 25 per cent . . The result of all the labor - and effort is very little revenue , and the effect upon the public of being harassed- and annoyed in this way must be exceedingly bad . Besides that , the effect upon the public mind of making a pretense of levying a tax which can not be collected is to discredit --  the power of- the State . One of the fundamental principles of taxation is that it shall be inevitable and unescapable . This so-called tax is not entitled to the name . . Yours very truly , LAWSON PURDY . No Action . by State Group . State Senator Mastick , explaining that the State Tax Revision Commission had no views on the subject , because it had not met as yet for its first conference , said he personally . advocated the abolition of the personal property tax on the ground that it was unscientific , arbitrary and that only New York City and a few scattering townships up State , including Erie County , still clung to the obsolete system of collecting a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mastick , introduced the bill creating the committee to study the whole question of taxation ' in New York State , is a member of the State .

Preston , chairman of the Association of State Tax Commissions ; G. William Magly , president of the New York State Association of Real Estate Boards . When the New York State Tax Revision Commission recently was - organized under the chairmanship of Senator Mastick it retained as experts and consultants Professor Robert M. Haig , chairman of Governor Roosevelt 's Water Power Cone mission , and Professor Charles J. Bullard of Harvard . According to Senator Mastick the abolition of the personal property tax was never accomplished by legislation because : of- opposition by ' the - City of Now York . through- the De- ; partment of Taxes and Assessments .
