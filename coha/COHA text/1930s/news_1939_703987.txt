txt With considerable chagrin , officials of the Canadian Pacific Railroad conceded today that its ship , the Empress of Australia , had been delayed so greatly by fog and ice on its trip here with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth that it could not possibly arrive in time for a reception Tuesday . It was announced that if all now went well the first visit of a reigning sovereign to any of Britain 's dominions would begin formally Wednesday and that the reception here , originally planned for Monday , would be carried out in full . By the time news came that arrival of the royal visitors would be delayed another day , plans had been made to compress Ottawa 's fourday celebration into three . Further telescoping of the Dominion capital 's festivities was believed impossible and , as it is unlikely that Dominion officials would dare risk affronting the sensitive French by curtailing the brief visits of the sovereigns to Quebec and Montreal , it was suggested that the scheduled stop at Kingston , Ont. , next Sunday might be eliminated . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still permit them to arrive in Toronto on schedule without traveling at night . Without giving the exact position of the Empress of Australia it was announced officially at 4 P. M. that she was 200 miles east of Cape Race and about 1,086 miles from Quebec . The ship reported that , while she was still in floating ice , visibility was improving . For the first time in two days the ship was proceeding at full speed ahead . At 9:30 tonight the liner radioed that she was 915 miles from this city and expected to arrive by midnight Tuesday . She reported that weather conditions at last were excellent . Normally the Empress of Australia makes the crossing from Southampton to Quebec in six and a half days . This time she has been at sea for eight days , and it will be at least ten before her trip is ended . Should she fulfill her expectation of arriving before midnight Tuesday , the royal visitors would remain aboard until the next morning at 10:30 , when the reception is scheduled to begin . The Duchess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 5 , the day before the departure of the King and Queen , docked here last night , having followed a more northerly route than the royal ship and missing the icebergs and shore ice . While Captain A. R. Meikle is nominally in command of the Empress of Australia , Vice Admiral Sir Dudley North is aboard representing the Admiralty , which actually is dictating every detail of the voyage . Safety Is Major Factor To the Admiralty , of course , schedules for civic receptions mean nothing . Safety is the major factor where the lives of Great Britain 's sovereigns are concerned . The continued delays and the secrecy about the exact position of the ship , in addition to causing great inconvenience and disappointment to the ' throngs which have flocked here from all parts of Eastern Canada , started a bumper crop of rumors today in this city , where no newspapers are published on Sunday . One was that the King was ill . Another had it that the Skeena , one of the escorting Canadian cruisers , had struck an iceberg . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her course because of information that German submarines were lurking off the coast . There were others just as fantastic as the last , but there was not a word from the ship to indicate that anything but bad weather conditions were responsible for her slow progress . Prayers were said in the churches today for the safe arrival of the King and Queen . School children practiced singing " God Save the King " in French and English , for the sovereigns will be greeted on their arrival with the anthem in the language of this bit of France in the New World and serenaded on their departure with the same hymn sung in English . Red-coated troops marched up and down the winding cobblestone streets . Everywhere , on homes , office buildings and hotels , the Union Jack waved in the breeze and bunting covered the fronts of most of the buildings of the city .

Already this city and Montreal are gleaming examples of spotlessness , with fresh paint on houses , lamp posts , letter boxes and fences . On the dock where the King and Queen will step ashore to receive the formal welcome of Dominion and Provincial authorities , every ugly steel beam and girder is wrapped up like a gift package in gay-colored bunting and from somewhere a huge crystal chandelier was obtained further to decorate the landing shed . The Citadel , where King George and Queen Elizabeth will sleep their first night on Canadian soil , has been dusted and scrubbed  --  and inspected microscopically by agents of Scotland Yard and Dominion and Provincial police . The part which will be occupied by the royal visitors is now almost hermetically sealed . The Citadel , which tops the rock on which Quebec is built 350 feet above the broad blue St. Lawrence , is the first bomb-proof structure erected in the New World . Its old walls are nearly forty feet thick and the only entrance is by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from St. Louis Street in the heart of Quebec . The royal suite contains two bedrooms , two sitting rooms , a dining room and a ballroom big enough for 300 persons . There is a lounge and supper room large enough for sixty-four guests , a library and a terrace room . Hanging above the main staircase are portraits of Albert and Victoria . of King George V , of the Queen Mother and of Edward , whose abdication elevated the present King to the throne . A few years ago when Lord Willingdon , later Viceroy of India , was Governor General of Canada , Lady Willingdon had the interior of the vice-regal quarters redecorated at a cost of nearly $500,000 . While they sleep England 's King and Queen will be guarded by their French-speaking Canadian subjects , the men of the Royal Canadian Twenty-second Regiment . the liner Empress of Australia hurried the King and Queen of England toward Quebec tonight , two days late for the start of their tour of North America .

" The people I am sorry for are all those who have been making plans to see us in Canada and perhaps have traveled miles to do so . " said Queen Elizabeth as she leaned on the rail of the promenade deck gazing forward through fast-disappearing clouds of fog . After the fog had lifted and the liner had bucked her way through an ice field half a mile across and stretching north and south as far as the eye could see , she started full speed ahead in midafternoon today . It seemed certain she would be able to reach Quebec Wednesday morning . From daybreak today , Captain A. R. Meikle shifted his course southward in an attempt to shake the big vessel free of the fog and ice . But the two enemies of the ship 's progress seemed to be working in cooperation . When the water became free of ice the fog would settle down , forcing the Empress to stop . And when the fog lifted it was only to show fields of ice ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty miles . At 3 P. M. , New York time , the Empress approached the last big barrier , a field of ice a half-mile across . The liner was hardly moving when it nudged into the ice .

Pierces Floe Field with Ease The Empress pushed a path through the-field with ease , nosing the small chunks of ice aside . The convoy cruisers Southampton and Glasgow were in the liner 's wake , finding the going comfortable . The ice was so thick in stretches that those aboard could have got out and walked . The Queen went up to the bridge and stood with Captain Meikle , while the liner operated as an icecutter . The King went to the extreme point of the forecastle and , standing beside a lookout , took motion pictures of the ship 's prow as it broke through the ice .

One was for the royal family , the Governor-General of Canada , the President of the United States and the legislators of empires . The second , especially for sailors , petitioned God to " conduct us speedily and safely on our voyage and bring us in peace and comfort to our desired haven . " The ceremony was marked by the occasional sounding of the ship 's siren . Struggle Over Readjustments OTTAWA , May 14 ( Canadian Press ) . ?
