Fortnight ago at its General Assembly in Syracuse , N. Y. the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A. formally suspended Rev. Dr. John Gresham Machen and five of his super-orthodox Fundamentalist colleagues because they refused to resign from their Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions ( TIME , June 8 , et ante ) . Last week in Philadelphia , with the confidence of his independent income , determined Dr. Machen set about founding a new and " true " Presbyterian Church . <P> The Machenite Presbyterians soon discovered that church founding has its obstacles . First big one was the ample frame of Moderator George Emerson Barnes of the Philadelphia Presbytery . A onetime University of Montana footballer who subscribes to the 1923 Auburn Affirmation which questions such doctrines as the Virgin Birth , Dr. Barnes is pastor of swank Overbrook Presbyterian Church , a Rotarian and Union Leaguer well versed in church law . When Dr. Machen and his followers began handing resignations to their presbyteries last week , Moderator Barnes promptly called a meeting at which he declared that it was impossible for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , were simply suspended . <P> If this was academic , Dr. Barnes 's next move was not . When the congregation of Central North Broad Church announced it would follow Dr. Machen , Central North Broad was promptly locked up . Moderator Barnes declared its pulpit vacant , announced he would furnish a supply pastor on Sunday , ruled that , according to a U. S. Supreme Court decision , the church belonged not to the congregation but to the General Assembly . To those edicts the Machenites bowed . On Sunday 700 of Central North Broad 's members worshipped with their pastor in Lu Lu Temple . <P> Meanwhile in Philadelphia 's New Century Club met Dr. Machen and 250 Fundamentalists including 33 ministers . The meeting dissolved the organization which had brought them together , the Presbyterian Constitutional Covenant Union which was formed last year to " reform " the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A. It then reorganized as the Presbyterian Church of America , with John Gresham Machen elected by acclamation as first moderator . Sitting as a General Assembly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee the power to ordain ministers . <P> Chief significance of Dr. Machen 's new Church , which will probably not subtract more than a few thousand members from the parent organization , is that it liquidates him as ecclesiastical news . He can no longer with reason utter the peppery denunciations of the conduct of the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A. which used to keep him constantly before the public . A relieved good-by to Dr. Machen &; Co. was said last week by the Presbyterian Banner : " We have no unkind feelings toward these brethren but hope they will treat one another better than they have treated us.
