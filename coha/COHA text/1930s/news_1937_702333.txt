txt A possibility that elimination of Treasury cash borrowing may even be extended to bill issues appeared yesterday . The latest development which might keep the Federal Government out of the money market and leave the field open to private offerings was a spurt in the sale of U. S. savings bonds , otherwise known as " baby bonds . " At the time the annual budget appeared , it became clear that the Treasury would be able to meet its needs out of cash revenues and social security funds without resort to major borrowing in the cash market . It was expected , however . that the Treasury would continue to offer bills for the purpose of gold sterilization . Baby Bond Sales Yesterday . it appeared likely that even these bill offerings may be unnecessary , although unpredictable future gold movements enter into this situation . During the first nine business days of this month the Treasury had received $47,074,839 from sales of " baby bonds . " This figure was higher than the total 211r any other entire month since the bonds were first offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sales during the next six months . Secretary Morgenthau announced yesterday that he would not borrow any money on bills this week for gold sterilization . Only the regular $50,000,000 of 273-day bills , which will replace a similar maturity , was offered . Tenders will be accepted by Federal Reserve Banks and branches until 2 p. m. , E. S. T. , January 18 ; the issue will be dated January 20 . Use General Fund Whether bills will be sold to raise funds for gold purchases is only one element in the gen- eral question of whether the Treasury will have to borrow to meet its Commitments . Secretary . Morgenthau explained . For the time being , subject to change any week , the Treasury is paying for gold out of its general fund balance , he asserted . The development which might take the Treasury out of the money market in any large way coincided with comment on short term money rates which was evoked by Wednesday 's raise in the rate on bankers ' acceptances . Government experts agreed that short-term money rates are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary psychological one on the price of Treasury bonds and on the long-term market generally . The consensus was that , although interesting and worth watching , the advances in short-term rates thus far have been of little significance . Short-term rates " must climb a long way " to have any appreciable effect on the long-term market , according to the view here . However , Mr. Morgenthau explained that he had considered the Wednesday increase in acceptance rates of enough importance to cause him to call immediately for a memorandum from those of his assistants who follow the money markets . Treasury Reastion The Treasury 's conclusion , Secretary Morgenthau said , was that movements in shortterm money rates " have to be watched " but that they have not yet reached important proportions . Their ultimate significance lies , the Secretary explained , in the fact that they " bear on the price of our bonds and the general monetary picture . " " When your rate is and you say it doubled , it sounds like a lot but It does n't amount to much ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it going lower ? It is too early to tell , " he remarked Although the Treasury bond market might be considered vulnerable to a rise in short-term rates , experts agree that the rise would have to be of a magnitude not yet in sight to disturb prices greatly . If there should be a marked improvement in short-term rates , investors probably would prefer to have their funds in short-term securities rather than to gamble on the future price movements of long-term . low-yield Treasury bonds , officials concede . At present , however , short-term rates are so low that investors usually choose to take a. bond , even though its long-term price outlook ' is unclear , rather than take the small return available in the short-term market . When asked how high short-term rates would have to rise to have an appreciable effect on outstanding issues , officials were reluctant to put their finger on a level , but were unanimous III saying that it was a long way above present levels .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
