' ' For a week , the word Ranger has been on the tip of my tongue . If anyone asked me a question , I replied ' Ranger . ' " <P> Victim of this innocent crotchet last week was Mrs. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt. it was caused by her eagerness to perform creditably at the launching of her husband 's newest yacht . Last week , in the salty little city of Bath , Me. , the moment lor which Mrs. Vanderbilt had been nerving herself finally arrived . Taking a firm grip on a ribboned bottle of champagne , she swung it briskly against the bow of what , in the Bath Iron Works , had theretofore been merely Hull No. 272 . Cried she with faultless diction : " I christen thee Ranger . " The hull slipped smoothly down its chute , flopped into the water , stern first , with a loud splash , and ten minutes later workmen swarmed aboard Ranger , warped back to the dock , to step her 163-ft. duralumin mast . <P> Three days later , Ranger started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off Seguin Island , a heavy sea was running . The roll caused a turnbuckle to break on an upper shroud . This tiny mishap put additional strain on the other stays , which snapped one by one all through the night . Soon after dawn , off Gloucester , the towering mast finally crashed over the side , carrying all the rigging with it . Said Harold ( " Mike " ) Vanderbilt : " Bad luck ! " At Bristol , R. I. , workmen prepared to fit Ranger with the mast that used to belong to the old Vanderbilt yacht Rainbow . <P> The curing of Mrs. Vanderbilt 's crotchet and its consequences were easily last week 's biggest sport news . One of the top sport events of 1937 will be the yacht races for the America 's Cup , off Newport , starting July 31 . For the past nine months , the America 's Cup races have been a matter of formal correspondence , long-winded argument about rules , scale-drawings and fabulously costly boatbuilding . For the next three months all this will be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mast last week-which means that she will have to use a makeshift rig until July-it was by no means a certainty that she would be this year 's Cup defender . The Cup races are preceded by trial races in which the two other candidates for the honor of defending yachting 's oldest , ugliest trophy are Gerard B. Lambert 's Yankee , and Rainbow , which now belongs to Chandler Hovey . Like everything else about America 's Cup racing , contender trials are grand scale . The Preliminary Series , which starts May 29 , is for testing rigs and training crews . It is followed by the Observation Series , which starts June 12 , and the Trial Series , which starts July 3 . Job of selecting the boat which will actually defend the Cup belongs to the America 's Cup Committee of the New York Yacht Club . The Committee can announce its choice any time after the beginning of the Trial Series until a week before the America 's Cup Races-a series of four out of seven .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
