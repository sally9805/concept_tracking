IN THE SHADE OF THE TREE A STORY BY WILBUR DANIEL STEELE W HEN you see a very old person you are apt to think what can there be in living for that one ? You wonder to yourself , what has he got ? Well , he 's got this : he 's got his memories . So have we all , you say . But memories , you say , are not meat of adventure or wine of hope for daily sustenance ; they are but thin stuff , ghost and gone . You do n't know the memories of the old . A cow , walking across the morning pastures , tears her mouthfuls here and there , half in haste , eye on some rich tuft ahead . A boy , a man in his prime  --  he does the same . Broken grasses , little tasted . The savor is in the cud . Lying by and by in the shade of the tree of age , redraw .. ing it up the gullet of the years  --  no , it is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time to surrender its inner juices to the unhurried tongue , presently pungent , vividly sweet . What is this ? A tang of wind-tossed stems from the hilltops of excitement . And this ? Lush , deep clover of loves accomplished , triumphs won . And this , to sting the appetite ? Thistle of passing sorrows and small defeats . No , no ; commonly when a man comes to a certain age he steps right clear of the law . He 's eaten his cake , and here 's his cake to eat again . Commonly . But sometimes there 's to be found an old man condemned by this or that to live imprisoned in today , this morning , this evening , to-morrow morning , dustily present , pitilessly awake . It 's like the predicament of acamel in the desert with his hump cut off . Or it 's like that torture devised to drive a man crazy , the trick of denying him sleep for days and nights on end , continually jerking him back out of the beginnings of dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , like the ringing of a bell . In Leander Killen 's case the instrument was , in fact , a bell . The clangor of that hell , hung outside the back door where his garden ran down to the river , had fetched him back to here-and-now so often , so many hours , days , and years , that now he could n't have dreamed off if it had stopped and let him . It was as if his powers of reminiscence , too long denied , had fallen into atrophy  --  worse than the powers even  --  the appetite . It 's one thing to be a young man without a past ; it 's another to be an old one . Leander had come clear of the law the wrong way . Not only had n't he his cake to eat ; it was as though he never had had it ; he had n't even the lingering taste of it left . He had n't anything left now but his hatred of that bell . He had n't even his garden , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of that alarm , and he could n't close them to re-picture what a brave garden it once was ; he had no way of seeing it but as a senile , shallow ground , whiskered with fewer flowers , beans , and lettuces than with weeds , now his hoe had grown so dull . Weeding is not so bad ; it 's work to do without thinking . The trouble was Leander thought about the weeds as he went at them , having nothing else with which to occupy his mind . The two o'clock sun , coming from across the river , lay on his face , a heavy glare . Bang , bang , feebly , went his hoe . How tough the ragweed stems had grown . Stubborn things ! Damned things ! Bang , bang . . . Clang ! ... That bell ! Shame that it was , there used to be a moment of mutiny , in other days . There was none now . Letting the hoe-handle fall from his hand , he turned and hastened slowly up the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't I ? " He entered the kitchen . His eyes wide open , he saw everything there , the mop-marks left by the woman who came in the morning , the towels drying on a string over the stove , the soiled plate of his dinner on the oilcloth-covered table . He had never in his memory seen the room otherwise . As many years as his rusty consciousness ran back , what seemed his whole life , every dingy thing had been just so . He passed through a dark hallway and came into his wife 's room . " Yes , my dear ? " " I feel like I 'm going to die , L'ander . I 'm sorry to be such a . . " Now , now ! Pshaw ! " " But I never felt this way before . It 's a giddiness . " It seemed to Leander that if he had ever been a boy he must have stood in this room with his little cap off , listening to this old , bedridden woman saying , " I never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For he could n't seem to arouse himself to imagine her as ever having been anything but a cadaverous martyr pinioned beneath a stuffy-smelling quilt . " It scares me , L'ander . " " Now , now ! Would you be cornfortabler if I put you on your side ? " " I might try it that way . But I do n't know . " It began to take his strength these days to get her rolled over . " There , I 'm sure you 'll be comfortabler now . You know your giddiness is always better for turning . " " So you do n't believe me . You think I 'm just putting on , for sympathy . " The woman twisted her mouth in a wan , secretive smile . " I 'm glad you can . After all , what good is it your getting upset any sooner than you have to ? " " Oh , no , no , mama , you do n't think for a minute . . . " The invalid bit her lip and turned her face away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the air and sunshine . I  --  I shall be all right . " " If you 're not , all you have to do is pull the bell ; come in quick . " " Will you ? I hate to  --  but  --  you used to come quicker . I suppose . . " " Now , now , do n't you worry , I 'll come on the run . " Leander went out doors , took up the hoe , and banged at a weed . It was Saturday . Young Mr. Cotton next door was out in his garden . He had rank rows of beans and a strong stand of cabbages . He smiled to himself as he studied the antique figure beyond the pickets . " Myra , " he said to his wife , " would n't it kill you ? Look at him standing there , innocent as bliss , square in the middle of the only decent button-chrysanthemum he 's got , whacking for the past five minutes at one old sunflower stalk ! " Mrs. Cotton smiled too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Poor man , we ought n't to laugh at him . If ever there was a saint on earth . . . " There were ten very old frame houses in the row , Gibb 's Terrace , and she spoke for nine of them . " I hate to think what 'll happen to him when she goes . " Her husband looked sober . " When she passes on , you mean ? " " He wo n't last long beyond her , Jack . They do n't , not when they 've been together as long as those two , so devoted , wrapped up in each other , like a pair of lovers . If there were more like him to- day ! " Cotton did n't know whether there was IN THE SHADE OF THE TREE /65 a dig at him in that . He squatted down , creasing his brow . " Here 's a worm got into this cabbage . " " It 's because he does love her . " The woman 's eyes were wetter than ever as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next yard Leander said to himself , " I hate her ! " It made him jump . He had never shaped the thought before . Only a monstrous disaster could have provoked it now . Plodding in circles after weeds , here he had come on the one ewe-lamb among his button-chrysanthemums laid in ruin . He stood with his chin hanging . The work of a vandal ! There lay the footprints bold to see among the broken stems . Whose ? Leander had n't an enemy he could name . Had he ? Had he given anyone cause , without knowing it . . . ? It was too upsetting ; he wrested his mind away . Let it go for just one of those things that are always happening . Concentrate on something else . Now he could concentrate on the larger aspects of his bitterness . It was not that plant alone , it was the whole garden . How could he be expected to make a decent garden when no sooner had he a plan matured or an action started than it was shattered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till to-day he had been at pains to keep his anger centered on that bell . Unconsciously afraid of shame , he had tied a knot in the bell-cord over which his passionate resentment could not slide to run along it and come to the ringing hand . . .. Now it was like a bolt from the blue of truth : " I hate her ! " He tried to undo it by forgetting he had said it . He threw himself against the weeds . His hoe must have wondered at the renewed violence of his hands . Batter and bang  --  what odds what his blade hit ? If he could but have kept it up at that pace ! Perspiration , thin as water , broke from his skin . He found of a sudden that all the while he had been holding his breath . He stood to breathe . He felt strangely terror-smitten . His gaze , turning this way and that , came to the masts of the shipping , sticks as fine as spider-thread a mile away down the river , and remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination that those sticks , which for the normal man , wherever seen , will set fancy straightway towering , golden cloud in a blue wind , ebullient hail of up-anchor , freed heart , swift keel , the narrow room of trouble forgotten , the ineffable , perilous embrace of space  --  it marks it , that in old Leander 's sight they stood but lesser brothers of the clothes-posts running in ranks down the diminishing yards . If they aroused any emotion at all , it was one of querulous protest : " Why do people want to keep moving about ; why not he quiet and rest ? " As a matter of fact , nine-tenths of his mind was fixed on the business of breathing . Once he let up on it , here he was , holding his breath again . Why ? Something was amiss . What ? Something in the world of this afternoon was so weirdly changed that his lungs would n't , or could n't , do their work . Perhaps it 's so a fish feels , taken out of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was it that he had said , " I hate her ! " ? He tried to close it again , but now a pair of figures coming up the river bank prevented him . A sailor and a girl . It was a favorite stroll for sailors wanting to get girls out into the country the shortest way . Leander 's eyes followed them past the bottom of the garden . Though the lass was not the prettiest in the world , nor her lad the most prepossessing , there was something in the hunger of the arm he threw about her swiftly at the lilac cover by the fence-corner that had a beauty quite unrelated to either of them  --  even despite them  --  as if willfully mingling with their amorphous young excitement a tenderness , a larger yearning , a nobler groping of its own . " How lucky he is , " thought Leander . " Head over heels in love with her . " He struck his hoe on the dust with a sudden ferocity . " Why would n't he be ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , like an animal cornered . " No , I wo n't take it back , nor you ca n't shame me into it ! " As he recommenced his hacking at the weeds he muttered to himself , " Why should a man be ashamed for looking at the truth ? " He seemed to he getting an immense amount done this afternoon . Freshly pecked-at soil ran in Tong snake-trails around him . At a price , though . Whether it was this continued holding of his breath , or what , he grew as wobbly with weariness as if he had done the work of three ordinary shifts . Yet now he was so nervous he could n't stop till he was stopped . Unconsciously , all this while that seemed the length of hours , he was waiting for that bell to ring . A ray of the lowering sun struck under his lids . So it was n't that it seemed hours . It was hours . There was a clump of dandelions . It was in the turf border of a bed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took hold of the sticky leaves to try to pull its roots out they broke in his fingers . He straightened , wheeled , and cried aloud at the bell . " What 's the matter with you ? Why do n't you ring ? " He hurried slowly up the yard . He passed through the kitchen and the hall . " Mama , " he said , at the doorway to her room . No answer . It was not like her to sleep so soundly . " Mama ! " He went in and shook her by the shoulder . But she did n't wake . The sun rested on the woods beyond the river ; indoors it was already dusk . So many neighbors had come in to manage things for the old man , the houseseemed crowded to suffocation with their tip-toeing business . They had the wisdom of the humble . They preoccupied themselves with practical matters , tidying the place , especially the room where the body lay , calling up the elected undertaker , preparing supper for the bereaved one , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . So , overtly  --  while privily their one preoccupation was in that figure seated bolt up in a chair in a corner of the death-chamber , hands folded , motionless as wood . " When he does come to ! " they whispered among them . " When he does begin to cry ? Oh , dear ! " But there were some who thought differently . " No , this is the worst  --  this while he 's stunned yet . Crying eases the pain . " Leander sat there , staring at the sheeted bed for upwards of an hour without a sign of emotion of any sort changing the muscles of his face . It was dreadful , this waiting for him to break . " He do n't realize yet . Somebody 's got to do something . " One man , nerving himself to it , went in and laid a hand on Leander 's shoulder . " Come , Mr. Killen . " Rattled , he began to shake the peak of skin and bone . " The ladies 've got some supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to eat something  --  do you good . That 's the man ! " In the hall , the others put fingers to their lips and bent their ears Silence . " Mr. Killen , now , come . We understand what this means to you , one and all . But you 've got to help us if we 're to help you . " There was a break at last Low , harsh , throat-trapped , a sound of brief laughter , a cartilaginous cackle . Leander came out of the room then faster than they had thought his feet would carry him . It gave them no time to wipe the confusion from their faces . Over his own , at the sight , spread a redness of more blood than they IN THE SHADE had supposed was in him . There was a savage misery in his eyes . They thought , " How awful . He 's too old for it , and he 's gone queer . " Aloud they said , " There 's some supper for you in the kitchen . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sit down right here and have a bite . " But Leander had another purpose . Cutting loose in mid-floor he followed the line of his own shuffling momentum and passed out of the back door . Alarm . " What 's he doing ? Catch him . Somebody must go with him . " Young Mrs. Cotton had a ray of sense . " Let him be . He just wants to get out in his garden , alone ; and maybe it 's the very best thing . " Leander went down to the bottom of the garden . It was true , he wanted to be alone and rid of them . He wished passionately they were all dead too . Damned whisperers , damned tear-dabbers , why could n't they have come straight out with it , " Poor , poor fellow , your heart is broken and we know it , so why try to keep the sobs back ? It 's too stunning a blow , too cruel a loss . " He had an impulse to go back and brutally challenge them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , describe it to me . " He could see their faces . They 'd feel silly enough then . But no they would n't . They 'd only signal to one another , " See , it 's unhinged his mind . " For that had n't escaped him , in the hall . The heat of it still burned his cheeks and temples , its redness doubled by the light from the dome of sunset reared above the trans-river woods . What if they were right , and it was his mind ? He grew aware of a kind of numbness , lying not in him but tight around him , like an iron cloak . Was it possible they were the right ones and he the twisted and wrong ? With a scared sincerity he tried to think of some single thing in his life with his wife , the loss of which would have subtracted from his happiness . He 'd be reasonable : he would n't take to-day , or yesterday ; he 'd struggle back into the past . Ten years . Twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then  --  a quarter of a century . An ache in the brain . Calling on emotional memory for so long a leap was like asking power of a machine wrecked by rust . Maybe he could begin to do it by and by . Perhaps with time , now he had been given the gift of time .. . Clang ! Sweat struck out on Leander 's forehead . Ghostly , incorruptible even by death , that bell ! A calm man would have considered that there were outsiders in the room in there , unfamiliar with the purpose of that rope-end hung by the bed , curious hands itching to finger and find out . " Goodness , so that 's what rings ! " But sweat struck out on Leander 's forehead . Vividly , he saw the hand of the dead one on the time-greened cord . " Come in , my poor dear husband . Do n't lag this time , for pity 's sake ! All I ask is so little , L'ander . To see your tears . " Panic grabbed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the path along the river bank . His uplifted soles scratched on the gravel , heavier and heavier , but he would n't , lie dare n't give in . Not till he had gone a great way ( it might he fifty yards ) did he pause to breathe . He sank on a bench made of a single board , below the path , facing the river . He fastened his mind upon the glowing surface . Damned to live in the moment , he would live and lose himself in that maze of reflected sunset . The tide was making , the river ran backwards , with what slowly dissolving , softly flaming whorls , with what crimson ripple-nets cast about glimmers caught from the greener top-sky , like little , cool , green fishes ! Engrossed so , the one old man did not see the second old man who came up along the path from townward . This was a fellow much of Leander 's age , but brighter of eye and ruddier of cheek , where it showed above the white ring of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had eighty years of brave alarums and sweet excursions to regale his gums with and hunger his appetite . He sat down on the other end of the bench . Leander might be dumb , but this was not one to be quiet long . " Yes-sir , by jolly , I been here before ; same identical place , by jumbo ! Comes back to mc , plain as plain now . It was when I was a sailor . " Once Leander was assured that this was none of his tormentors , he got back among the fluent whorls . Now the fire from the sky began to pale ; the little green fishes caught in the ripple-nets grew paler , dying . . . . Here came dismay . What was he to do when they were quite gone ? How then keep his mind from the senseless , numb discomfort that lay wrapped tight around him ? To any but an ancient mariner this abstraction might have been a damper . But after all , the stranger 's speech was less conversation than soliloquy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leander . " Yes-sir-cc , comes back to me . Used to be , right up along there somewheres , a little stage with a boat made fast to it . Eh ? " Leander glowered and shook his head . " Do n't ask me . " " Newcomer , eh ? Heh-heh ! Well , I could tell you things . " Now a shadow ran toward the zenith . To the one old fellow it was the coming of to-night . To the other it was neither day nor night , here nor there ; it was the shade in the pasture of the sunny past , cool to lie down in under the tree of age . Now , at his ease , this time-gelded bullock of a man who had been a sailor had up his cud of memories . Ruminant , reminiscent , he worked his jaws , expressing the juices a hundred times savored , but never so sweet , never so vividly actual . " A sailor , mate , he 's got a funny lay . He 's got no home where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of ' em . It 'd surprise you , now and again . Them and sailors . The way I figger it  --  a sailor  --  when a sailor he 's got on his ship and gone , he 's gone a long ways over the water , and they nor nobody 's going to hear of him ever again . Heh-heh . . . " Chewing and chuckling . " Good women too . But all women are good , God bless ' em . This one was good , pretty and good . Only , she was young , and her husband he was long away . I see her plain as if she stood there now , in her skimpy waist and big long skirt the color of lilacs . Her cheeks they 'd go red one minute and white the next  --  no , sir , she did n't know how to handle herself , the way things were . Know what she 'd say , mate ? You must n't come by here again  --  with my husband away in the west , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as two-bit pieces and her fingers working criss-cross on her breast  --  she was built full in the breast , I remember , like a beauty ought to be  --  upstandingmmmra-mmmni  --  a right armful of a woman for a strong handsome man ! " Leander would have got up and gone away if the weight of his strange numbness had let him . There was no flame left in the water . The other sucked at his ambrosial pabulum . " I forget her name . " " It 's growing cold , " Leander thought . " I 'll catch my death . " The word made him writhe . " I wish I could feel like moaning and crying ; then they 'd be satisfied . " " Where was I ? " the other mused . " I was a seafaring man . I was second mate on the bark Andrew L. Cram . I could thrash any man aboard of her . Good-looking too . Always ready for anything . We were taking on spruce logs here , and they came along slow yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' If you come by again , I 'm sure I sha' n't speak to you . ' " Then I give her a grin  --  I was always a cocky one  --  and I 'd say , ' I do n't see what 's the harm , my helping you with your flowers . ' " She had an almighty lot of flowers  --  all kinds  --  asters and pansies and bachelor buttons all kinds  --  and rambler roses climbing over the kitchen porch ? and everything . How sweet they smelled ! Maybe it was because she was messing with ' em so much  --  but , mate , she smelled like flowers , all kinds mixed up . Ever since , a flower garden 's put me in mind of her . " She had little ways with her , enough to craze a man . The way she could pout . ' You 're lucky you 're a sailor ; sailors have so many lady-loves ; ladyloves everywhere . ' And she 'd run down into the vegetables then and stand with her hands going criss-cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast , I remember  --  and ' I wish , ' she 'd cry , ' I wish my husband would hurry and come home . ' " I told her the ship was laded and I was going away . ' To-morrow ? ' says she . ' Day after , ' says I. " ' My husband he 's coming home day after to-morrow , ' she says , and she run , and I rim after her into the lilacs and caught her and give her a kiss , the first I done . Day following , I went by to say good-by . " ' Here 's a boat tied up , ' I says , ' and here I am a sailor . Come out on the river for a little row . ' " No , no , ' says she , no , no , no . ' " We got in the boat and I rowed across the river . . . See them woods over there yonder , mate ? " The woods were no more than a low black wall now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ancient Lothario , he rolled between tongue and gum his succulent morsel of memory . " Mate , do n't ask me . We walked a ways in the woods . She laughed and cavorted . Then she 'd get white 's a sheet and run hide , so 's I could n't find her , and I had to stand and hail for her . Ahoy , Marjorie . . . ' by jolly , I got it , that was her name . " " Marjorie ! " Syllables uttered at a great distance in Leander 's mind . " Marjorie ! " An echo from beyond a gulf . The numbness that had been as wide as an iron cloak shrank as narrow as an iron hoop around Leander 's brain . Where had he known one by the name of Marjorie ? " We walked in the woods . Ah , mate , but there was a lovely woman . Only she 'd put her hands to her neck and cry out : ' My husband ' s corning to-morrow . " ' " Marjorie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crumbling before the inflood of forgotten memories . " See them woods over there yonder , mate ? Do n't ask me . I was a sailor-man them days . . . . When I left her she was crying . " That inflood , tumultuous , instantaneous , complete , and vivid . stench of train smoke . . . smell of the earth of a street , years ago now paved . ... In a gateway the fragrance of a garden of flowers . Leander opened his mouth . " She was crying when I got there . It was because I 'd been away so long and she 'd been so lonely . She always had a playful way  --  could look like a thunderstorm . You do n't love me any more , otherwise you 'd have hurried more . You can be happy away . I suppose I ought to be happy you 're so lucky . ' " The weight was gone from the other end of the bench . " How pretty she was  --  Marjorie ! No , not pretty  --  beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man standing there , his mouth a black hole in his whiskers , he gasped . He got to his feet with a sense of towering . " You  --  I 'm going to lick you . " He had to say that . He was a man . " I 'm going to kill you . " What a shame it would be to him if he were to forget it before he could do it , too helpless , too happy ! The hole in the whiskers opened and shut . " I  --  mate  --  I thought you says . . " Leander shuffled toward him . Des-perately he fought to make it remain momentous , that dirty little pebble in the great white flood . He got his hands on the scoundrel 's shoulders . But it was too late . He 'd forgotten . The dams in his tear-duets broke , and water poured out of his eyes . " She was lovely . Was n't she lovely ? She was so sweet . She was so true , so good , and so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mariner was gone , a gulp and a shadow . Turning his feet homeward , thirty years of age had vanished too . Full dark had come , but he needed no light up the yard . It was a garden thronged and fair . The good green smell of brittle cabbages , firm squashes and melons and tall young corn , and mingled now the coming perfume of many , many flowers . Flowers that Marjorie gathered in a great sheaf against her bosom gaywith pride of them  --  and one for love for young Leander 's buttonhole . .. . He passed into the kitchen . A clean room , a singing , busy room , never so shining a kitchen . Doctor Hathelly he saw there now , in vivid memory , drying drug-washed hands by the stovethere . . . . " It 's a fine baby , Leander , " the Doc was saying , " fine big boy . " Chug-chug and cinders . He seemed to be on a train . . . . Trip to Niagara . . . . What a sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Marjorie 's face . " The Hewett boy got only eighty-five . " " They found him early this morning ; he must have fallen in yesterday on his way from school . " . . . In this hall here , the news had caught them . Nothing in words to say to each other , nothing to do but hang tight to each other 's hands . . . The seasons pass , light and shadows . . . " Your beans have never looked so well as this year , L'ander . " . . . " Nor your hollyhocks either , my dear . " Bedroom . There was something under a sheet . A thing that was still and white , full-breasted and young and beautiful . Leander went down a-spraddle on his knees . Out in the hall they listened , and sighed after the long strain . " That 's better . He 's crying now . "
