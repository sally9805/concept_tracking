A problem which perplexed a Santo Domingo friar 401 years ago when called upon to baptize a pair of " Siamese ' ' twins perplexed Manhattan 's marriage license bureau last week when called upon to authorize the union of one of a pair of ' " Siamese " girls to an orchestra leader . The friar , uncertain whether his twins contained one or two souls , solved his problem by baptizing one with the regular ritual , the other with a special ritual reserved for those whose previous baptism is in doubt . <P> Daisy- &-Violet; Hilton are a pygopagus , a double-monster joined at the buttocks . They say that the bones of their lower spines and hips are fused and that the same blood courses through both bodies . Invoking shyness , they refuse medical or x-ray examination . Presumably if Violet were to bleed to death , Daisy would also be fatally drained of blood . But , strangely , three weeks ago Violet had a bad cold and fever . Yet Daisy ran no fever . <P> The pair entered vaudeville through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their mother , an unmarried barmaid , sold the infants to the proprietors , a family named Hilton , for exhibition purposes . The Hiltons ' daughter married one Rothbaum who changed his name to Meyer Meyers and took the twins to the U. S. , where their stage and sideshow appearances earned enough for a mansion at San Antonio , Tex . and a portfolio of securities . <P> Adult , 26 , worldlywise , once named as corespondents in a Kansas City divorce action . Daisy- &-Violet; Hilton argued last week that they knew what they were doing about marriage . They cited Chang- &-Eng,; the actual Siamese whom P. T. Barnum made so famed that all conjoined twins thenceforth have been called " Siamese . " Chang- &-Eng; ( 1811-74 ) took the name Bunker and married daughters of David Yates , North Carolina minister . The wives kept separate domiciles in which the brothers took turns living . Chang had ten children , Eng nine . Their descendants are reported still living in the Piedmont . <P> The Hiltons also cited the case of Rosa- &-Josepha; Blazek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vagina , one rectum , but two uteri . Rosa bore a son whom both nursed . Later the pair were reported to have married one man . The 1918 epidemic of influenza killed them , aged 40 , while in Chicago . <P> Violet Hilton was the one who sought the marriage license in Manhattan last week . Prospective groom was Maurice L. Lambert , 29 , of Westmoreland , Md. , her orchestra leader . Daisy pleaded for her sister 's right to marry , for she , too , was engaged . <P> But Manhattan officials refused the marriage license . Exclaimed William C. Chanler , acting corporation counsel : " The very idea of such a marriage is quite immoral and indecent . I feel that a publicity stunt is involved . " <P> The twins and fianc rushed under the Hudson River for a Newark , N. J. marriage license . City Clerk Harry S. Reichenstein expelled them , with : " Nothing doing ! Moral reasons . " <P> Violet Hilton swore last week that she was sincere in her desire to marry the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphed the rejected trio offers of marriage license and minister .
