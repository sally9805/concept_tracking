( See Cover ) <P> On a clear cool afternoon , Tuesday , August 4 , 1914 , a grave , spare , rather homely North Carolinian entered the courtyard before the massive grey British Foreign Office on Downing Street . He turned to the right , passed the guards , walked down a broad ornate corridor , passed through a large oak door into a spacious room . Its windows looked out on the tranquil lake and lawn and trees of St. James 's Park . The clocks of London struck three . <P> Walter Hines Page , U. S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , turned unsmiling to a tall , worn , pale man who leaned against the mantlepiece , Sir Edward Grey , British Foreign Secretary . They sat down , like old friends , and Grey , grim chin propped on folded knuckles , talked : <P> " . . . It is upon . . . solemn compacts . . . that civilization rests . England would be forever contemptible if it should sit by . ... I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning we sent an ultimatum to Germany . . . . There will be war . " <P> That week there were three days when Ambassador Page had no time to take a bath . <P> On August 21 , 1939 , Joseph Patrick Kennedy , U. S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , returned by plane to London , fresh from a month 's vacation with his wife and nine children spent at an estate famous for its roses , Domain de Ranguin , five miles from Cannes , on the French Riviera . In the two weeks that followed , the red-faced , red-haired Boston Irishman went many times in the footsteps if not in the mood of Walter Page to the red-draped oak-and-leather office in Downing Street . There he saw a man like him only in that both are deeply religious , an extremely tall , gaunt , bony-faced man , with a sensitive mouth and a talent for gentleness , the Rt . Hon. Edward Frederick Lindley Wood , 3rd Viscount Halifax . The end came on Sunday morning , September 3 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the British had moved up their ultimatum deadline to Hitler one hour . There would be war at n a.m . <P> The St. James 's Beat . An Ambassador is a glorified reporter , a legman in a tailcoat . His main job is to interview people , get news , report accurately . To do this he must 1 ) have the confidence of the people he represents , 2 ) win the confidence of the people he is assigned to . <P> Walter Hines Page was an Anglophile , literary , philosophic . No Anglophile is grinning , cussing Joe Kennedy , known and loved by millions of English-speaking men . <P> From one point of view , Joe Kennedy is a common denominator of the U. S. businessman - " safe , " " middle-of-the-road , " a horse-trader at heart , with one sharp eye on the market and one fond eye on his children . But he is a super common denominator , uncommonly commonsensible , stiletto-shrewd , practical as only a former president of a small bank can be . As Ambassador Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Where do we get off ?
