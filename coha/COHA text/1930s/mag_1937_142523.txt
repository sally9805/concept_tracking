In 1933 Wayne W. Baker , 27 , of Yuma , Ariz. entered the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a law clerk . Recently he decided to be a G-man , so he took the Bureau 's three-month training course for investigators . Having graduated , he was assigned to the bureau at Kansas City , Mo . Last week he was at work on his first important case . He and two other agents went to the post office at Topeka , hung around for three days waiting for Alfred Power ( alias Gerald Lewis alias Thomas Malley ) , New York bank robber , to claim a package at the general delivery window . <P> Month ago the Northern Westchester Bank of Katonah , N. Y. was stuck up . The robbers got away with $18,000 . In Manhattan , Thomas Malley had registered a black Plymouth coup , license 4Y-7607 . That was the car in which a man had been making calls at the post office in Topeka . If he came back , the general delivery clerk was to give the tip-off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vigil , the clerk gave the signal . <P> Agent Baker stepped up , drew his gun and ordered Alfred Power to put up his hands . Blam ! A bullet struck Agent Baker in the back , he spun around to face the bandit 's unnoticed companion , Robert Suhay , began to fire . Another bullet struck him in the chest , two in the legs . He crumpled . An innocent bystander , hit in the foot , flopped under a writing table beside a scared little Negro woman . Twenty rounds were exchanged before the two bandits fled , vanished . <P> That evening in Plattsmouth , Neb. , Sheriff Homer Sylvester received word to look out for the fugitives who might be heading toward Omaha . Sheriff Sylvester and his brother Cass grabbed their rifles and drove a few miles south of Plattsmouth to a filling station . Waiting there they soon saw a car racing along at 60 m. p. h . They let it pass and followed it . Soon the bandits slowed down , began to drive a weaving course pretending they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvesters refused to be tempted , finally cornered their men at the dead end of a street in Plattsmouth . Sheriff Sylvester and his brother had them covered . Power and Suhay surrendered without a shot , were disarmed and handcuffed . A few hours later , Federal Agents had them in jail in Omaha . Some $12,000 in cash was recovered . Agent Baker 's first case was successfully concluded . He died in a Topeka hospital .
