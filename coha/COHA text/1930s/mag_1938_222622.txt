Down Berlin 's wide Unter den Linden last week paraded 8,522 men and 870 horses , the well-trained German troops goosestepping , the as yet untutored German Austrians passing by in an ordinary march .

Der Fhrer received tons of flowers , hundreds of cakes , a set of phonograph records of Anschluss speeches , a set of foreign translations of Mein Kampf , a lion cub , the 500,000th Daimler-Benz car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradles , baby carriages , and babies ' clothes " from the provinces " -i . e. , from provincial families still unaware that the man who so often appeals to German mothers for more and better children is a bachelor.
