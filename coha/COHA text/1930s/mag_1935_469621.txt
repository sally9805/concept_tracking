THE strain he had undergone dur- ing the production of " Princess Ida , " early in 1884 , the references in the press to the weighty duties of a composer who had been honored by his sovereign , the solemn admonitions of George Grove and George Macfarren , both of whom had been knighted with him , and the fact that he felt ill and played out , forced Sullivan to a decision . He informed D'Oyly Carte that , tired of light opera , he did not intend to write anything more for the Savoy Theatre . Carte was thunderstruck . At first he did not believe that Sullivan was serious , but after dining with the composer he changed his mind : Sullivan was deadly serious . But Carte was a business man and , having failed to coax Sullivan , he threatened him . The trio had recently signed an agreement for five years , whereby Gilbert and Sullivan had bound themselves to provide operas for the Savoy during that period , Carte to give them six months ' notice whenever a new work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear that " Princess Ida " would not repeat the success of its forerunners and Carte despatched a formal notification to the collaborators , at the same time informing Gilbert of Sullivan 's attitude . Gilbert was amazed and promptly wrote to Sullivan for an explanation . Sullivan replied from the British Legation in Brussels , and it is clear from his letter that Carte 's reminder of the agreement , which rendered the collaborators liable for any losses resulting from their failure to supply an opera , had made him shift his ground . He said that his music was becoming repetitive and that his work had been dominated by Gilbert 's words . He wanted greater freedom ; he wanted his music to " speak for itself " ; he wanted " a story of human interest and probability " ; he implied that Gilbert had a habit of spoiling a serious scene by the introduction of humorous dialogue ; above all he wanted a libretto in which the humorous and serious elements were kept entirely separate . This letter gave Gilbert " considerable pain " and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry , since he could not suppose that Sullivan had meant to " gall and wound " him . He accused Sullivan of trying to teach him the ABC of his profession and left it at that . A fortnight later they met at Sullivan 's flat and talked for two hours . Gilbert had what he considered an excellent subject for their next work , but unfortunately he had been similarly inspired about two years before and Sullivan had turned it down as artificial . The main idea was that by swallowing a lozenge a person became the character he or she pretended to be . Gilbert was obsessed by this theme ; it cropped up at nearly every stage of his future dealings with Sullivan ; and eventually he collaborated with Alfred Cellier and used it in " The Mountebanks . " By then he had changed the lozenge to a Liquid , and this is what we read : " Man is a hypocrite and invariably affects to be better and wiser than he really is . This liquid , which should be freely diluted , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pretends to be . The hypocrite becomes a man of piety ; the swindler a man of honor ; the quack a man of ! earning ; and the braggart a man of war , " Not perhaps a particularly brilliant notion , but it captured the imagination of Gilbert , and Sullivan had to pay for it . Their two hours ' talk about the effect of the lozenge came to nothing . Sullivan could not stomach the unreality of the plot ? and in fairness to him one has to admit that probability is not its strong point ? while Gilbert was really suffering from lozenge on the brain . The next move came from Gilbert , who wrote suggesting that , if Carte agreed , Sullivan should do his next opera with someone else . Gilbert went on to say that he was at a loss to know what Sullivan wanted from him and that Sullivan 's objections to his libretto seemed to him " arbitrary and capricious " : yet another proof of the strange lack of sympathy and understanding between the men , a variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan refused to entertain the suggestion and hinted that Gilbert might evolve another plot . But Gilbert remained faithful to his lozenge , and in order to meet Sullivan 's demand for " human interest " promised to separate the serious and comic episodes , keeping each firmly in its place . Sullivan , though still protesting against the lozenge , was partially appeased and promised to give his " most earnest consideration " to theplot when Gilbert had fully sketched it out . Gilbert finished the job in a few days and went to read the result to Sullivan , who liked it much better than before but again displayed hostility to the lozenge . However , he promised to study it carefully and let Gilbert have his final opinion shortly . He wrestled with the theme in solitude for several days , but the lozenge stuck in his throat and at length he had to confess that the plot did not arouse in him that " enthusiasm which has hitherto characterized all my work with you " and without which he would not undergo the pangs of composition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent of supernatural or improbable elements . Gilbert lost his temper . Had not Sullivan expressly declared his satisfaction with the plot only a few days before ? Gilbert had made his reputation and his fortune on the exploitation of the supernatural and the improbable and he was certainly not going to be told at this time of the day that he must forego his fairies or his lozenges . Taking up his pen he wrote : " The time has arrived when I must state . . . that I can not consent to construct another plot for the next Opera . " He wrote reluctantly , he said , and remained " Yours truly . " Sullivan replied that further discussion would obviously be useless , that he regretted it very much , and remained " Yours sincerely . " Carte nearly went off his head when he heard what had happened . Had he known how much money their next opera was destined to make the anxiety caused by the present uncertainty might have killed him . He rushed from Gilbert to Sullivan and from Sullivan to Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after each had stood upon his dignity for a period sufficient to satisfy his pride , the business argument prevailed . Gilbert agreed to jettison the lozenge and all it stood for , and Sullivan was so relieved that he undertook to set the new piece without even asking what the subject was to be . The quarrel had cleared the air , and in an atmosphere of good-will and serenity the partners produced a work that was the perfect expression of their artistic harmony . II Gilbert had a clearer conception of what the public wanted than Sullivan had ; he led and Sullivan followed . " I know my limitations and capabilities better than anyone else , " he once said ; " no man is successful until he learns that lesson " ; which was certainly true when he was writing libretti . But he also knew that success was not solely the result of self-knowledge . " The secret of success , " he said , " is to keep well within the understanding of the least intelligent section of the audience . " This did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the author , he admitted , though it required a good deal of practical skill . He worked with the utmost care , often between eleven at night and three or four in the morning , because " then you have absolute peace ? the postman has done his worst and no one can interrupt you unless it be a burglar . " He usually began by writing out the story of the piece about twelve times , until he had got it right . He then read it to Sullivan , who sometimes made suggestions which were duly incorporated in the final version . After that he commenced the libretto , writing only the baldest dialogue and leaving out both songs and jokes . This merely carried on the action in the fewest possible words . Later he wrote the songs for the first act , which were sent to Sullivan , who set them to music while Gilbert was writing the songs for thesecond act . The songs completed , Gilbert returned to the dialogue , elaborated and polished the crude suggestions in the first draft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason he would not allow the actors to " gag " was because he had so carefully timed the " laughs " that an additional joke , perhaps in the wrong place , might have destroyed the dramatic or humorous value of the scene as he visualized it . Very occasionally he permitted an actor to put in a quip or a piece of business that did not happen to spoil the effect of what followed , but his usual reaction to that kind of thing was neatly expressed when Grossmith , anxious to score a laugh " during one of his scenes , fell over and rolled on the floor . " Kindly omit that , " said Gilbert sternly . " Certainly , if you wish it , " replied Grossmith , " but I get an enormous laugh by it . " " So you would if you sat on a pork pie , " was Gilbert 's comment . On the other hand he was quite willing to receive suggestions from actors as to how their parts should be played . At a revival of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that I ought to play Sir Joseph with his nose in the air , as if he was raising it above an unpleasant smell ? " " Unpleasant smell , " muttered Gilbert lifting an eyebrow ; " well , you 're the best judge of that , Passmore . " Gilbert 's vitality as a producer was phenomenal . He supervised every thing ? scenery , costumes , stage-management , chorus , lighting ? and nothing escaped his notice . His attention to detail was such that Barrington once bet he would not commence a rehearsal of " Pinafore " before noticing that one of the ship 's ropes was wrongly placed , and won the bet . His strictness at rehearsals has become proverbial and he certainly could play the martinet ; but no producer since his time has been able to exercise half his patience . He would stand on the stage by the side of an actor or actress and repeat the words with appropriate action over and over again , without the least sign of despair or irritation , until he had achieved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations of his actors and took care that the work he gave them to do should be well within their compass . He also knew that he could only get the best out of them by being on friendly terms with them . He believed that acting could not only be taught but dictated , and it satisfied his appetite for power to teach his actors like children who did not know their alphabet . With those who took his teaching in good part and tried their hardest to follow it his patience was inexhaustible and his kindliness never-failing . To one well-meaning girl who kept putting the accent on the wrong syllable of the work " indubitably " he remarked that hers was a Parisian pronunciation and though of course it would be understood by the stalls it might not be clear to the gallery . He had a different method of dealing with those who resented his teaching and refused to follow it . To a girl who was evidently not trying to obey his instructions he said : " Never mind , my dear , you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I want it . " Naturally his moods varied . Sometimes he was all smiles and the actors breathed freely . At other times he glowered upon the assembled company and no one dared to approach him . Whenever he was exceptionally irritable the actors would assume that he had been eating almond rock , of which he was very fond ; and as it was supposed to he bad for his gout , an " Almond Rock Day " was usually tempestuous . He was to be seen at his best and at his worst when drilling the chorus . Then the military-looking gentleman became military in manner . He issued his words of command as if he were on parade and when they were not obeyed he stormed and shouted . Sometimes he would even seize the leader of the chorus and shake him into a Gilbertian view of his duties . He seemed to be possessed of demons . When the dancers failed to put sufficient vigor into their performance he would show them how to do it by twirling up and down the stage , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , his feet moving at a most unmilitary speed , and his body gyrating in a manner never seen on the drill ground . Even though he could not sing a note in tune , he would instruct the chorus in rhythm and pronunciation . However rapidly uttered , every word had to be given its full value , every syllable its proper inflection . " Remember , ladies and gentlemen , " he would bawl , " you 've got ? to ? doyour ? damnedest in this passage or it 'll go flat ! " At the close of one of these drastic rehearsals the female chorus were speechless , the male chorus were spineless , and all of them were thirsty . But they had a very high opinion of him , and one of them reverently paid him this tribute : " He 's the only man I ever met who could swear straight on for five minutes without stopping to think and without repeating himself . " He was not always so vigorous . Some playful moods have been recorded . During the rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right hands at a given moment , but every time they did so one of their number raised his left hand by mistake . At last Gilbert said : " My good fellow , if you do n't know your right , ask the gentleman on your left . " Sometimes he had to ease an awkward situation created by a member of the chorus . A girl who had just joined the company complained that one of the gentlemen-choristers had put his arm round her waist and called her " a pretty dear . " Gilbert mollified her at once with : " Never mind , never mind ; he could n't have meant it . " He did not usually treat such matters with levity , and the moral atmosphere behind the scenes at the Savoy Theatre would have been approved by Queen Victoria herself . The strictest discipline was enforced by Gilbert and no theater was ever run with such careful regard to propriety . The dressing rooms of the actors were on one side of the stage , those of the actresses on the other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no gossiping of the sexes in one another 's dressing rooms ; when not actually playing or waiting for their entrances on the scene , the performers had no contact with one another in the theater . Even on the stage they were not safe from the eye of authority and every time they varied from the set " business " of the piece or misquoted the text they were fined half-a-crown . This monastic or conventual austerity was observed also at rehearsals , and though Gilbert was heard to swear he was never heard to use an ambiguous word . His language , like his libretti , was clean , if hearty . According to Jessie Bond , he " watched over us young women like a dragon . " During the run of " Patience " he happened one evening to be standing by the side of Jessie when a note was brought to her . " What 's that , Jessie , a love letter ? " lie asked . " Here it is ; you can look for yourself , " she answered , handing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men in one of the stage boxesasking her to have supper with them after the performance . Gilbert was extremely angry ; he considered that the letter was an insult to a lady and instantly went round to acquaint the young men with his views . The young men were ignorant of the standard of behavior enforced at the Savoy Theatre and the sudden appearance in their box of what they took to be an irate colonel ( probably Indian Army , retired , with a troublesome liver ) completely upset their conceptions of life behind the scenes . Unable at a moment 's notice to give any satisfactory reasons for their past existence , their immediate future was placed on an optional basis by their liverish visitor , who said : " There are three ways of dealing with you and you can take your choice . I will go before the curtain , if you like , explain what has happened , and say that Miss Bond refuses to continue whilst you are here , or you can go of your own accord , or I can send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the second , and probably entertained morbid views of light opera for the rest of their lives . The incident got into the comic papers , the " Savoy Boarding-School " became the joke of the season , and Jessie Bond received printed condolences , e.g. " Poor little dear ! she always has to show her love letters to her daddy ! " Though Gilbert carried his views on respectability to a point that some thought was beyond the limit , his attitude was not entirely unreasonable . In those days actresses were popularly supposed to be saleable property . Their social status was extremely low and the average middle-class Englishman scarcely differentiated the back of the stage from a brothel . A Victorian Dr. Johnson ( if one can imagine such a being ) would have defined an actress in his dictionary as an immoral woman . Jessie Bond 's husband , for example , I ? ? came of a Quaker family , and when after their wedding Jessie gut into the carriage to drive away , her father-inlaw 's parting words were " I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Gilbert was not on the premises even the actresses at the Savoy were made to feel that they were not " ladies . " One evening Jessie and several others were sitting in the greenroom when the door opened and in walked Carte , followed by the Prince of Wales and a few friends . The ladies stood up but no one took the least notice of them and the Prince , having made himself comfortable in a chair , proceeded to light a cigar . Jessie Bond promptly sat down and went on with her sewing , much to the annoyance of Carte , who made angry signs , unperceived by the Prince , that she should remain standing . Later she was scolded for her behavior by Carte , but she replied that he ought to have presented them to the Prince . Later still she met the Prince at Sullivan 's fiat , reminded him of the incident and informed him that " there are ladies in our profession . " " Miss Bond , " said he , " you are perfectly right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he made a request : " May I come to see you , Miss Bond ? " " What for , sir ? " she asked . At this point the conversation lapsed . It is clear from the foregoing that Gilbert had some excuse for protecting his actresses from the attentions of Victorian gentlemen , and we may unreservedly accept Jessie Bond 's statement that " no breath of scandal " ever touched the Savoy Theatre while he was responsible for its morals . Sullivan had very little to do with the morals of the Savoy Theatre ; in fact he scarcely came into touch with the artists at all . The music rehearsals were taken by the musical director , Cellier , and as a rule Sullivan did not put in an appearance until the dress rehearsals , though he always went to the theater in order to play over the songs as each was completed to the actors concerned . The company did not like him so much as Gilbert . He was courteous but not so friendly ; and here again they provide a strong contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Sullivan 's popularity in society . Many acts of generosity to individual artists have been placed to Sullivan 's credit ; yet somehow they remained indifferent to him . He did not trouble to charm them and his interests were not theirs . He copied Gilbert 's form of humor , but as it was the expression of Gilbert 's character it did not come naturally from Sullivan . Though accompanied by a most attractive smile , his remarks seemed comparatively crude . A singer who thought he knew better than Sullivan how a certain song should be rendered was rebuked in these terms : " In future I 'll get you to sing my songs first , then I 'll compose them afterward . " A neater example of his humor is reported by Rutland Barrington , whose treatment of other people 's tunes was individual and peculiar . Having accompanied Barrington right through a song , Sullivan remarked : " Very good tune indeed , Barrington , but now we 'll have mine . " Gilbert capped this after the first performance of an opera , when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his songs in tune . " Oh , I know that first-night nervousness , " said Gilbert , " it soon wears off . " But the humorous side of Sullivan 's nature was best expressed in sheer nonsense , as was the case with so many Victorians , and the most characteristic specimen of it is to be found in a postscript to one of his letters , which starts off with a number of complicated and indecipherable hieroglyphics and ends with the phrase : " This of course is ' between ourselves . " Sullivan maintained that there was no such thing as humor in music , which accounts for the unique success of the Savoy collaboration . Had he perceived the possibilities of humor in music he could not have illustrated the humor of Gilbert 's words , for he would have demanded a far greater freedom than Gilbert 's libretti gave him . Failing in imagination , he triumphed in interpretation . Mozart would have submerged Gilbert ; Sullivan helped to keep him afloat . " We always saw eye-to-eye , " said Gilbert ; " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Sullivan I never had to do that fatal thing ? explain a joke . " Sullivan was aware that his best light music would never have been written but for Gilbert , that in some obscure way Gilbert " called the tune , " and the knowledge troubled him . It made him feel only half a man and he would try his hardest to believe that he had put his real self into his serious work . Though Gilbert realized the enormous value of Sullivan 's contribution , he did not fully appreciate it . He used to say that he only knew two tunes : one was " God Save the Queen " and the other was n't . The truth is that he did not much care for music , and really disliked grand opera , confessing " I would rather hear ' Annie Laurie ' sung with feeling than the greatest singer in the world declaiming a scene from ' Tristan and Isolde ' . " He was the first comic-opera librettist to achieve equality of standing with the composer . The librettist had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offenbach , for example . But with Gilbert and Sullivan the positions were reversed , and though Sullivan might sometimes say " My dear fellow , I ca n't make anything of this , " and Gilbert would rewrite a song to meet the objection , the composer was always the disciple , the librettist the master . III The last six months of the year 1884 were spent by Gilbert in writing , rewriting , polishing , and re-polishing " The Mikado , " and since it could not be ready for production until the following spring the Savoy was kept open , after the withdrawal of " Princess Ida , " with a successful revival of " Trial by Jury " and " The Sorcerer , " for which a few new numbers were written . Sullivan suffered a slight setback in his career of fame at the beginning of ' 84 , when the Committee of the Birmingham Festival passed him over and appointed Richter as conductor . He was extremely annoyed and expressed himself freely on the subject , asserting continually that native talent should be encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was unpatriotic . However , he forgot his griefs in a round of visits to eminent people , and throughout the season he was to be seen at Ascot , Sandown , Newmarket , and other haunts of the English aristocracy . He had many friends among the members of the Jockey Club and not only bet heavily at all the big meetings but owned several race horses during his years of prosperity . In November he dined with Gilbert , went through as much of the new libretto as had been completed , and made a few suggestions . Among other things he wanted to know why Gilbert had not used any of the distinctive class titles of Old Japan . Gilbert replied that when he found the aristocracy of Old Japan were called " Samurais , " the obvious rhyming phrase had decided him to keep clear of historical accuracy . Sullivan started to write the music just before Christmas , working all night when time began to press , and the score was finished a week before the production . The rehearsals were exceptionally trying for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for the comparative failure of " Princess Ida , " and he believed that a play 's success was largely due to good production . He drilled the company until they were exhausted and then drilled them . again . Every step , every gesture , every expression , every inflection was rehearsed and rehearsed until the players achieved automatic exactitude . The effect on Grossmith , a highly sensitive man , was disastrous . He was reduced to a pitiable state of nervous trepidation and almost wrecked the piece on the first night . Though Gilbert can hardly he held responsible for Grossmith 's nerves , it was partly due to the extreme methods of the producer that the actor took to drugs in order to keep himself going ; and at the end of his long engagement at the Savoy Theatre a member of the company was horrified by the sight of Grossmith 's punctured arms . Grossmith was not the only person who suffered from nerves on the opening night of each new production . Gilbert , who had combined the patience of Job with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a frightened child on the evening of the first performance . Wrought up to the highest pitch of excitement and dread , he went from dressing room to dressing room , wishing the actors good-hick , asking them how they felt , reminding them of points he had already stressed a hundred times , wondering whether they were sure of their words , begging them to do their best , and making a general nuisance of himself . Then he had a last look round the stage , fussed over the scenery and properties , andworried the life out of the stage-manager . The moment the curtain went up he left the theater and wandered about the streets in a condition of indescribable anxiety until eleven o'clock struck , when he returned to the theater to hear the result and to take his bow before the curtain . " What I suffered during those hours , " he once admitted , " no man can tell . I have spent them at the club ; I once went to a theater alone to see a play ; I have walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was , agony and apprehension possessed me . " Strangely enough , he never saw his productions after the final dress rehearsal , and with a single exception he never witnessed any of his operas as a member of the audience . Sullivan 's first-night demeanor was quite different from Gilbert 's , but then the tumultuous applause with which his appearance in the orchestra was always received must have given him assurance . The moment the audience caught sight of the dapper little figure , moving to his seat with quick step and cocksure carriage , the cheers broke out and sometimes lasted for more than a minute . His manner as a conductor was not spectacular . He kept his eyes on the music and his beat was restrained and cramped , the - baton moving across the top or up and down the sides of the score . He wore glasses , and people sitting near him observed that the fingers of his wellmanicured right hand were stained with nicotine . In spite of his unimpressive manner , he was in complete command of his orchestra and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be as dramatic as anyone , he altered his style of conducting , using whirlwind beats , stamping his feet , jerking his head , and twisting his body . Though many people considered it a great improvement , he did not repeat the experiment . At the conclusion of the performance the theater resounded with cheers , applause , the thunder of beating feet , and loud cries of " author , " " composer , " " Gilbert " and " Sullivan . " The contrast between the tall martial figure of Gilbert and the short tubby figure of Sullivan as they came before the curtain was heightened by their difference in bearing . Sullivan bowed gracefully , smiled affably , and walked on and off the stage with ease and self-assurance . Gilbert almost had to be dragged on , scowled at the audience , inclined his head ungraciously , and seemed to resent the occasion as a personal indignity . " The Mikado " was produced on March 14 , 1885 , and ran for nearly two years . It was the greatest success of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sullivan operas . It carried the fame of the collaborators all over America , Australia , and South Africa , and even aroused the enthusiasm of Amsterdam and Berlin . IV So pronounced was the success of " The Mikado " that there was no need for the partners to think of their next opera for some time to come . Gilbert settled down quietly to enjoy his new house in Harrington Gardens , which became the scene of marvellous children 's parties when the host would stuff them with sweets , load them with presents , take the lead in their games , and behave like Santa Claus and Mr. Maskelyne rolled into one . Yachting and tennis occupied most of his time in the summer , and he was a regular playgoer when the days shortened , but he was not very fond of dining out , preferring to entertain a few carefully selected friends in his own home , when he would relate amusing stories in a dry quiet voice or flirt with the prettiest woman present , telling his wifewhen she laughingly protested that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed his meals , he declared that it was not so much what was on the table as on the chairs that mattered . People attached too much importance to the business of feeding . " My cook gets eighty pounds a year and gives me a kipper , " he said ; " Sullivan 's cook gets five hundred pounds a year for giving him the same thing in French . " But he was annoyed when someone invited him to a poor meal and threatened to " pay him out by asking him to dinner . I have an avenging sherry at one and nine which I think will astonish his digestion . " Sullivan 's life was not so well ordered as Gilbert 's . In the summer of ' 85 he tore himself away from the tables of the great and crossed the Atlantic . His brother 's widow had recently died and he had made himself responsible for the children , who were now left to look after themselves at Los Angeles , where the family had settled shortly after the death of Sullivan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , a personal one , but he was not allowed to pass through the continent unheralded . In New York he tried but failed to escape the reporters , who discovered his hotel and cornered him in his apartment . In Chicago he made an effort to shake them off by starting to remove his clothes the moment he reached his bedroom , but they would not stand on ceremony and interviewed him in his shirt and trousers . When he returned to England , in October , he found the country Mikado-road . From drawing-rooms , concert halls , cottages , street corners came the well-known airs . Queen Victoria strummed them , barrel-organs murdered them , business men hummed them , errand boys whistled them , and the future Kaiser wrote to tell Sullivan that as soon as he could get rid of " a very serious and rather dangerous attack of ear-ache " he would attend a performance in Berlin . Sullivan felt that he could rest on his laurels , but Gilbert felt otherwise , for he wrote to say that they must now get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ) admirable plot I proposed to you last year " ? in other words , the lozenge plot . Sullivan was seriously disturbed over the reappearance of the fatal lozenge and wrote to Gilbert begging him to forget all about it . Gilbert could not forget all about it , but he laid it aside for a stormy day and concentrated on something else . One January morning in 1886 he walked through a blizzard to Sullivan 's flat ( it must have reminded them both of the first reading of " Trial by Jury " ) and after Sullivan had helped to relieve him of the snow that lay in drifts on his overcoat they went through the plot of " Ruddigore " together . Sullivan was pleased with it and they sketched out the whole story , but he told Gilbert that he would have to write a work for the Leeds Festival before starting on the new opera . Gilbert received the information with fortitude and they parted amicably . A wave of laziness now overtook Sullivan and though he had given Joseph Bennett three hundred pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he could not settle down to composition . Instead he went to race meetings , introduced Liszt to London society , and hobnobbed with the nobility . By April he had done nothing and was recalled to duty by Gilbert , who cursed him for being idle and received the reply ; " Do you take me for a barrel-organ ? " Sullivan rented a cottage at Yorktown and began " The Golden Legend " a few weeks later , but work progressed slowly at first . May went by and he had done scarcely anything . June came and he still found the effort " awfully tedious . " July found him absorbed at last and for six or seven weeks he hardly went out of doors . He was in pain at regular intervals throughout the entire composition and toward the end , when the mental strain was increasing his bodily infirmity , he hardly enjoyed an hour free from suffering . " The Golden Legend " was performed at the Leeds Festival on October 15 , 1886 , and was received with delirious enthusiasm . The audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to bow his acknowledgments to the choir , who also pelted him with flowers . The newspapers agreed with the audience and choir . The World called him " the Mozart of England " and said that , though it was difficult to claim a place in the foremost ranks of composers for the author of " The Pirates of Penzance , " the case of the author of " The Golden Legend " rested on a very different basis . It still does . The plaudits had not ceased to ring in his ears when Gilbert wrote to congratulate him on what " appears from all accounts to be the biggest thing you 've done " and to remind him that the music for " Ruddigore " had still to be composed . Sullivan now balanced his period of laziness earlier in the year with one of extreme activity . In spite of the fact that he was preparing performances of " The Golden Legend " for the Albert Hall , Queen 's Hall , Crystal Palace , and St. James 's Hall , he started on the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each collaborator had a high opinion of his own contribution to " Ruddigore " and was not too pleased with the work of the other . Yet such was their curious relationship that they dared not express their feelings frankly to each other but tried to influence their friends to do it for them . " How do you think the piece is shaping ? " Sullivan asked a man who was on friendly terms with them both . " It is supposed to be an opera but it is really becoming a play with a few songs and some concerted music . Do n't you think it would be as well to hint to Gilbert that the music is disappearing in the background ? " " Though to my uninstructed ear , " Gilbert said to the same friend , " nothing could be better than the music , there is so much of it that I am afraid the audience will lose the thread of the story and forget what it is all about . Perhaps you could suggest to Sullivan that if one or two numbers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was founded on an early sketch of Gilbert 's and of course he made use of one or two ballads , but the whole piece was put together with considerable skill and it is certainly one of his best libretti . " Ruddigore " was produced on January 22 , 1887 , and went very well up to the last twenty minutes of the performance , when the audience became restless . At the fall of the curtain the first " Boo " in the history of Gilbert and Sullivan opera was heard from the gallery . Whether this expressed the general feeling that the sailor 's song about " the darned Mounseer " was a slight on the British Navy or the popular objection to the resurrection of the ghosts it is difficult to say . It may have come directly from a " darned Mounseer , " since Gilbert received several challenges to duels from Frenchmen who felt their country had been insulted . At any rate the opinion of the audience and the critics was that the new work was not half so good as " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title . This annoyed Gilbert , who suggested that it should be changed to " Kensington Gore " : or " Not Half so Good as The Mikado . " The morning after the production the partners met at Sullivan 's flat and made a number of alterations and excisions ; next day they changed the Finale , so that the ghosts remained spectral ; but when a play receives a mixed reception on the first night no amount of titivation can make a success of it , and the run of " Ruddigore " only just beat that of " Princess Ida . " It was what the Savoy partners called a failure : that is to say , Gilbert made seven thousand pounds out of the original run , Sullivan made more because of the sale of his music , and Carte made most because , having only financed instead of creating it , he naturally made most . Of course there were recriminations . Sullivan thought that by bringing the ghosts back to life Gilbert had ruined the piece . Gilbert thought that Sullivan had not treated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional position demanded something grander and more impressive than the words suggested , " said Gilbert , adding that the ghost music was like introducing fifty lines of Paradise Lost into a farcical comedy . ? These opinions , however , were not exchanged by the partners , who were content to whisper them into the ears of their ft iends . V The mixed reception of their new opera had a mixed effect on the two partners . Sullivan was again at the mercy of his solemn mentors , who did not fail to point out that now was the time to break away from the Savoy and compose works more worthy of his genius . Gilbert , who had satisfied his lust for writing works more worthy of his genius at an earlier period , was now solely concerned with the problem of increasing his investments . The result was that Sullivan went abroad to ponder on mightier themes , while Gilbert remained at home and reconsidered the possibilities of the lozenge . Early in September he read the scenario of his proposed operetta to Sullivan , who objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write the music for it . Gilbert again pigeonholed the plot but stated , flatly and finally , that he had no intention of thinking out another , hoping perhaps that his attitude would bring Sullivan to his senses . It did nothing of the kind . For many weeks Sullivan had been fighting his disease ; he had no patience to spare for Gilbert ; and it was during this period of estrangement that an ominous incident occurred at the Savoy . One day D'Oyly Carte chaffed Gilbert about the condition of the carpet outside the door of the room which he shared with Sullivan . It was shabby ; it had a hole in it ; surely , said Carte , a man who was earning such colossal royalties as Gilbert ought to spare a few shillings for his mat . Gilbert , who hated chaff and usually scented some malicious motive behind it , flared up at once and retorted that as Sullivan earned more than double his own royalties , music being considered of much greater value than libretti , it was up to him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan appeared , feeling very much below par , and what started with a joke ended in a violent controversy . Once more the clouds lifted . After several weeks in bed with a recurrence of his malady , Sullivan went to the Savoy to conduct a music-rehearsal of " Pinafore , " which was the first of the revivals that had been decided upon . There , by accident , he met Gilbert , whose business-sense had begun to function again and who had thought of an entirely fresh plot which he was going to call " The Tower of London . " Sullivan was immensely relieved . A little later Gilbert spoke of the play as " The Tower Warden , " later still as " The Beefeater , " finally as " The Yeomen of the Guard . " Sullivan did not mind what it was called so long as it was not about a lozenge . The idea for the new plot had come to Gilbert when waiting for a train at Uxbridge station , where he had seen a poster of a beefeater . Soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an instant appeal to Sullivan , because it was human and free from topsy-turvydom . Sullivan , the dreamer , was always crying for reality . Gilbert , the realist , was always crying for dreams . But on this occasion the desires of both were appeased , for Gilbert contrived to dress his dream in the costume of reality . He spent days in the Tower of London and thoroughly enjoyed writing a work which he always declared to be his best opera . He put a great deal of what he thought was his essential self into the character of " Jack Point , " and regarded this idealized Gilbert as a greater creation than any of Shakepeare 's jesters . He was never happier in his partnership with Sullivan than when be was engrossed in this plain tale of the Tower , for it was the nearest he ever got to the Gilbert of the earlier plays , the poet he imagined himself to be . It was , therefore , a terrible shock to him when Sullivan wrote from Monte Carlo that , after mature reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself henceforth to serious work . Having left the impression that he was delighted with the new work , Sullivan had gone to Algiers and the south of France early in ' 88 . There he meditated upon various matters : the persistent warnings of his friends , Grove and Macfarren , the constant friction with Gilbert , the periodical resurgence of the lozenge , the illness which was growing upon him and making work on anything but the most exalted subjects burdensome to him , above all the extraordinary success of Cellier 's comic-opera " Dorothy , " which had already passed its five hundredth performance at the new Lyric Theatre . This last achievement made him feel thoroughly uncomfortable . It seemed that inferior composers could make fortunes out of comic operas . So why should he , Arthur Sullivan , debase his art merely in order to compete with people whose success could equal his own ? The thought rankled , and in the disquietude of his soul . he determined to dedicate himself to the nobler forms of music in which he felt that he excelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think " The Golden Legend " was a better work than " Ruddigore " ? Did he believe that he could live in comfort on serious music ? What did the success of " Dorothy " matter ? Damn " Dorothy " ! Had not " The Mikado " run for two years ? Had other musicians stopped composing because of its success ? The company at the Savoy was the best in England ; the composer was the best in England ; the librettist was of course the best in England ; Gilbert and Sullivan opera was a national institution , like Westminster Abbey ; and did Sullivan seriously intend to wreck the whole business and sacrifice a gold mine merely because rubbish like " Dorothy " could fill a theater for five hundred nights ? Gilbert committed these reflections to paper and sent them off to Sullivan , advising him at the same time , since it was possible a run of bad luck at the tables had affected his brain , that he ought to try Gilbert 's system : " Back red until it turns up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up twice ? then back red and so on . Itried it a dozen times . . . and always won . " Possibly the tip for the tables was successful , possibly he went down heavily on it and as a consequence the " gold mine " argument in Gilbert 's letter became operative ; at any rate Sullivan was convinced , and when he returned to London he showed his disinclination to religious music by plunging into the social life of the capital . He did however conduct a command performance of " The Golden Legend " at the Albert Hall , when Queen Victoria earned the gratitude of serious-music lovers by telling him that he ought to write a grand opera . " You would do it so well , " she said . Sullivan went to Fleet in Hampshire at the conclusion of the social season and started on " The Yeomen of the Guard , " which was put into rehearsal during August . He wanted Gilbert to make a number of alterations . Gilbert protested but eventually agreed ; and while Sullivan was staying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer residences of his wealthy friends , Gilbert was reconstructing the second act . With the first breezes of autumn Sullivan began to make up for lost time , and during September he worked all through the nights , seldom turning in before 6 a.m . He experienced considerable difficulty over the setting of " I Have a Song to Sing 0 " and tried in vain for a fortnight to get the right tune . Gilbert offered to recast it , but he was so pleased with it as it stood that he would not allow it to be altered . At last he gave it up in despair and said to Gilbert : " You often have some old air in your mind which prompts the meter of your songs ; if anything prompted you in this one , hum it to me ? it may help me . " This was quite true , because Gilbert frequently achieved a particular rhythm with the aid of a tune he had heard , but as a rule Sullivan would say : " Do n't tell me what the tune is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my head . " However , the present situation was desperate , and though , as Gilbert said , " only a rash man ever asks me to hum , " he did his best to reproduce the air of a sea-chanty that the sailors on his yacht used to sing in the dog-watch on Saturday evenings . He had not hummed a dozen bars before Sullivan exclaimed : " That will do ? I 've got it ! " Gilbert wondered whether his humming had proved too much for Sullivan , whose sudden exclamation might have been a cry of pain . But Sullivan assured him that for once he was responsible for the music as well as the words . " The Yeomen of the Guard " was produced on October 3rd , 1888 , and was given such a tumultuous welcome that Sullivan thought its success would be greater than that of " The Mikado . " Right up to the last moment Gilbert was the victim of nervous apprehension . The commencement of the opera was in his opinion too serious ; he had warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of October 3rd he wrote to his collaborator " to place upon record the conviction " that the play 's success would be seriously imperilled unless certain musical numbers were shortened or withdrawn , adding , lest Sullivan 's vanity should be hurt , " I am proposing to cut , not only your music , but my words . " A few minutes before the curtain went up they reached a compromise , and then Gilbert started his regular first-night fuss . Jessie Bond as " Phoebe " ( alone on the stage at the rise of the curtain ) was almost driven crazy by his questioning . " Are you sure you 're all right , Jessie ? " " You have n't forgotten anything ? " " Mindand take the keys from Denny at the right moment . " " Are you feeling nervous ? " " Remember that ? " but Jessie had had enough . " For heaven 's sake , Mr. Gilbert , go away and leave me alone , or I sha n't be able to sing a note ! " He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vanished from the theater , and tried to stem his agitation for the next three hours in the streets . The papers were lavish with praise the next day and by a coincidence Sullivan received a letter that morning from the Duke of Edinburgh , who enclosed a decoration from the Sultan of Turkey " as a mark of his appreciation . " In making a request for selections from the operas , the Duke said that the favorite piece played by the band on board H.M.S. Alexandra was Sullivan 's music to " Henry VIII . " Sullivan had also written music for three other plays by Shakespeare , " The Tempest , " " The Merchant of Venice , " and " The Merry Wives of Windsor , " and now in October ' 88 he was approached by Sir Henry Irving to provide the music for the Lyceum production of " Macbeth . " Irving had a very vague idea of music , but he knew what sorts of sounds he wanted and he gave Sullivan a brief outline of his requirements : trumpets here , drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . and one player at rehearsals " to tootle , tootle " so that they could hear the exact tunes . Apparently the player did not always " tootle tootle " the kind of thing Irving had in his head , and an interesting fact emerges from this brief union . Just as Gilbert , by a most unmusical humming , was able to inspire Sullivan with the tune for a song in " The Yeomen of the Guard , " so did Irving , by an exercise in cacophony , obtain from Sullivan the very themes that he needed . The company watched entranced as their chief stalked the stage , swaying his body , moving his arms in curious convolutions , now making strange croaking sounds in his throat , now tapping his feet on the boards to keep time with the moaning modulations that issued from his lungs . " Much better than mine , Irving , much better , " Sullivan would cry the instant he perceived what the other was trying to express ; " I 'll rough it out at once . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the actor 's startling exhibition , it was always exactly what Irving wanted . Here is another proof that Sullivan was the perfect medium . He could transmit the essence of words ( or even croaks ) into music ; but , being of an essentially feminine nature , his best work was produced only under the spell of a dominating and masculinepersonality ? Gilbert , as it happened , though it might have been Irving . Both Gilbert and Sullivan thought that " The Yeomen of the Guard " was their finest work together . The general public did not agree with them , and the general public was right . It is a serious opera and , owing to the restrained nature of their relationship , seriousness did not become them . Their happiest combination was on the plane of facetiousness . They flirted together in perfect accord ; and since a misunderstanding invariably gives a zest to flirtation , their two best works were produced after their two biggest quarrels . Already we have seen " The Mikado " emerge from the ashes of their anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be followed by the yet serener calm of " The Gondoliers. "
