txt A plan for bringing the large excess funds of the New York banks to the aid of commodity borrowers in. other sections of the country where , as an aftermath of the banking troubles earlier in the year , credit is scarce or impossible to obtain , was announced last night by Mortimer N. Buckner , president of the Clearing House Association . The plan , which was ' first suggested several weeks ago by Eugene Meyer , governor of the Federal Reserve Board , involves the formation of a Commodities Finance Corporation with funds of $50,000,000 subscribed by local banking institutions . Operating through subsidiary corporations , the new company will finance the purchase , carrying and orderly marketing , " for domestic consumption or export , of agricultural and other commodities . " Like that - earlier example of cooperative banking , the National Credit Corporation , the new company will have only nominal capital , but will derive its funds from the sale to the Clearing House and other banks of its notes in the - amount of $50,000 , - 000 , subscriptions being apportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31/2 per cent of their capital funds or 1 per cent of their respective net demand and time deposits as at July , 30 , 1932 , whichever is less . Incorporations at Once . The parent ? corporation will be chartered in Delaware , while the subsidiary corporations will -. be organized under the laws of New York State . It is expected that incorporation will be accomplished today or tomorrow and that meetings of the directors , comprising an official of each of the twenty-one clearing house banks , will be held on Monday or Tuesday at Which officers and an executive committee will be elected . Actual functioning of the corporations will begin as rapidly as the details of organization can be worked out . Two of the subsidiaries will be set up at once , one a corporation to undertake an acceptance business and one to carry on a finance business . The capital stock of the subsidiaries will be $2,000,000 each , entirely subscribed for by the parent corporation out of the proceeds of . its $50,000,000 note issue . Additional funds will be advanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the need arises . The membership of the New York Clearing House Association , which has collaborated on the plan and will subscribe the major part of the corporation 's funds , comprises : Bank of New York and Trust Company . Bank of Manhattan Trust Company . National City Bank . Chemical Bank and Trust Company . Guaranty Trust Company . ? Sdanufacturers Trust Company . Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company . Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company . First National Bank . Irving Trust Company . Continental Bank and Trust Company . Chase National Bank . Fifth Avenue Bank . Bankers Trust Company . Title Guarantee and Trust Company . Marine Midland Trust Company . Lawyers Trust Company . New York Trust Company . Commercial National Bank and Trust Cornpany . ? Harriman National Bank and Trust Company Public National Bank and Trust Company . Not to Buy Commodities . The corporations will not be authorized to purchase commodities for , their own accounts , but will devote their activities strictly to the making of loans . Bankers emphasized yesterday that there is nothing in the plan that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices or to encourage unnecessary purchases of them . The project is In many respects more intimately connected with conditions in the banking field than in the commodity markets . In many sections of the country , it was pointed out , banking facilities have been reduced or dislocated by the severe strain to which the banking system was subjected earlier in the year . As a result good borrowers in some sections are unable to obtain commodity loans from their local banks , or can obtain them only at unfavorable rates . Normally manufacturers , such as it is expected will be helped by the new corporation , would be able to get acceptance credits from their local banks to finance their purchases and , the banks would , in the ordinary course of affairs , dispose of the acceptances arising out of these credits In the open market . But at present many banks find the bill market virtually closed to their paper and are therefore compelled to absorb their own portfolios . Such banks find themselves lending actual funds instead of simply lending their credit . - Move Aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt to the Federal Reserve Banks or to their large city correspondents and which are striving to liquidate and strengthen their positions are apt to be reluctant to extend direct commodity loans even though in normal conditions the loans would be regarded as ' desirable . Borrowers in districts where banklag facilities have been curtailed are - - - frequently reluctant to approach a large New York City bank with a request for a small commodity loan . Many of them are under the impression that such requests would be summarily rejected . The New York City banks , for their part , do not consider it a proper course for them to seek out borrowers of this type . The result has been that , while many legitimate credit-seekers are left unsatisfied and deprived of the means of undertaking new business , the big city banks are glutted with excess reserves for which they would be glad to find safe employment . As of last Wednesday local reporting member banks of the Federal Reserve had excess reserves of S120,000 , - 000 which would have sufficed to support an extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is an effort to bridge this gap that has formed the mainspring to the present plan . A number of bankers are of the opinion that the corporation will do but little business . It is their contention that legitimate borrowers can obtain accommodation from their banks in nearly all cases . Nevertheless it was the opinion of the majority of bankers , after prolonged discussion of the project , that the organization should be formed so as to leave no chance open that deserving borrowers might be denied the credit with which to undertake new business . Statement by Buckner . Mr. Buckner 's statement , outlining the structure and functions of the new corporation , follows : A corporation is to be organized under the laws of the State of Delaware called the Commodities Fi : nance Corporation , with a nominal capital . It is to have the usual corporate officers and a board of directors with the usual powers of directors and provision for an executive committee . The Commodities . Finance Corporation ( hereinafter called the corporation ) has been organized primarily for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly marketing , for domestic consumption , export , of agricultural and oter commodities . The sound and effective financing-of these transactions may require different methods and in consequence operations will be conducted wherever deemed advisable through separate subsidiary corporations . Subsidiary corporations therefore will be organized under the laws of the State of New York , but in no event will the corporation directly or through its subsidiaries , nor will any of the subsidiaries , purchase any commodities except where necessary to protect loans or acceptances or other credits . Two subsidiary corporations will be forthwith organized . One con : ? poration is to undertake an acceptance business exclusively and the other corporation is to undertake a finance business , making loans or extending other credit facilities , all upon such terms as it is anticipated should , enable those with satisfactory business responsibility to obtain proper accommodations upon a sound banking basis . To Issue $50,000,000 Notes . The corporation is to be authorized to issue up to ' $50,000,000 principal amount in notes . Members of the New York Clearing House Association and other New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes at par in an amount equal to 3l per cent of their capital , surplus ' and undivided profits or 1 per cent of their respective net demand and time deposits as at July 30 , 1932 , whichever is less . Subscription will be payable in instalments on call of the board of directors , when and as required . Notes are to be issued from time to time to the principal amount of the instalments . paid . The notes of the corporation will , subject to the payment of the expenses and other liabilities- of the corporation , have behind them all of the assets of the corporation , which will consist principally of the capital stock of the subsidiary corporations- and the obligations evidencing the indebtedness of the subsidiary corporations to the corporation . In the case of the subsidiary acceptance corporation , the capital funds ' will be obtained only by the issue of its shares to the corporation . In the-case of the subsidiary finance corporation it is contemplated that the capital stock will be $2,000,000 , and additional funds will be advanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by banking institutions who subscribe to the notes of the ' corporation . The notes will be issued under an agreement and will be payable one year from their date , with the right to the corporation to one or more extensions of the date of maturity , not exceeding in the aggregate two additional years , but are subject to earlier redemption ' at the option of the corporation at their face amount plus interest , as provided in the agreement . Notes will carry interest , if earned , at a rate up to but not exceeding 6 per cent per annum , ' payable until maturity , only out of the surplus and net income of the corporation when and as ascertained ' and declared by the board of di- ' rectors . Theagreement under which the notes are to be issued and the notes will provide , in connection with redemption and maturity , , for participation in the net earnings of the corporation by the holders of the notes according to the principal amount thereof held by them . respectively , and the agreement will limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 6 per cent upon the par value thereof . The notes will be issued in registered form only and will be authenticated by a bank or trust company as agent . The notes and the agreement under which they are issued will contain such other terms and provisions as , shall be approved by the board of directors of the corporation . STOCK PRICES RESPOND . Rise in Anticipation of New Commodities Credit Move . A last-hour rally on the Stock Exchange yesterday , which not only erased earlier losses but left the general average of prices higher on the day , resulted mainly from the improvement in commodity prices that preceded ' the announcement , late in the day , that banks in New York had taken steps to form a commodity credit corporation . The organization of this corporation had been forecast for some time , and there was a widespread impression early yesterday afternoon that the announcement was about to be made officially . The stock market was pursuing an irregular course when it was strongly rumored that the banking project to strengthen the commodity position was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net gains of from a fraction to 1% cents a .. bushel . .

Proposed plans of a syndicate composed of cotton mill and financial interests to purchase about 3,000,000 bales of cotton either held directly or indirectly by the Farm Board are not connected with the- Commodities Finance Corporation . However , since this cotton is to be purchased by the cotton mills for consumption , a mill desiring financial assistance from the Conimodities Finance Corporation so as:to carry the product probably could obtain the necessary aid : - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board 's cotton-and that which the Farm Board is financing for the various cotton cooperative associations in the South is understood to have been placed before the Farm Board for its consideration . In view of the large number of organizations interested in the transaction , consummation likely will require several days . The syndicate of mill owners with the necessary financial backing has been in process of formation for . about two weeks and it was only at the close of last week that a tentative plan for the purchase of this cotton was agreed to by . the members of the syndicate . The syndicate , which has been formed with a view to ' purchasing this cotton in order that it can be placed in consumption in an orderly way so as to be , as small a factor as possible in. , the cotton market , is described as - " neither a pool nor a holding corporation . " Since - July 9 , . the Farm Board or cotton cooperatives have been large sellers of this cotton on the New York Cotton Exchange and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This selling , it is maintained , has prevented the cotton market from advancing ? as much as crop conditions and other factors warrant . To relieve the market of this unsettling influence is one of the main objects of the organization of this syndicate . The plans of the syndicate call for the purchase of- this cotton for delivery , starting one year hence , at the rate of 50,000 bales , monthly for the first year and 75,000 bales I monthly from then until the holdings are exhausted . With the exception of perhaps 500,000 bales , the price for which will be based on the closing quotations for October contracts on the New York Cotton Exchange at the times of the consummation of the deal , the price to be paid will be approximately the market price ? at the time of delivery . The cotton will be allocated to the various mills of the country on the basis of their annual requirements . However , no mill will be permitted to subscribe to- more than 20 per cent of its requirements for any one year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will receive preference , while the cotton will go Into consumption . in an orderly way . Consequently , every mill will remain in the market for at least 80 per cent of its cotton requirements . every year . The formation of a similar syndicate for the purchase of the remainder of the Farm Board 's holdings of wheat also has been discussed , although this probably would be more of a pool operation . - The ' Farm . Board , according to estimates about two weeks ago , had reduced its wheat holdings to about 50,000 ; 000 bushels in - the spot and futures mar kets . The belief is that these holdings - have been ? further , reduced , in the meantime . At one , . time Farm IBoard'sholdin of wheat . ainounted. to ' around ' 250,000,000'buSh els.
