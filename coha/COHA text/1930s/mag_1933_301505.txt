To Dubliners last week Armistice Day was just another unpleasant reminder that Great Britain and the Irish Free State are still parts of the same Empire . They showed their feelings by dynamiting an obelisk on Bray Head erected to celebrate Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee . On Armistice Eve the Irish Republican Army and the Laborites paraded and tiraded through Dublin streets to College Green . There they poured kerosene on two Union Jacks , brandished the blazing banners until only charred staves remained . Leaders howled at the crowd , " Destroy every poppy in Dublin tomorrow and burn every Union Jack and every emblem of British imperialism . " They excoriated President Eamon de Valera for not having made it a crime to fly the British flag in Dublin on Armistice Day . <P> Taking his own time and way of annoying Britain , de Valera last week let to non-Britons the biggest batch of Free State contracts since the great River Shannon hydro-electric project eight years ago . Part of his long-range program to make Ireland self-sufficient , they called for 600,000 worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . German and Czechoslovak companies got the contracts in exchange for promises to buy more Irish farm products . When the three new plants are operating next autumn , the Free State need import no more sugar . Next problems : grain , clothing , paper , machinery , chemical products . Insoluble : tea .
