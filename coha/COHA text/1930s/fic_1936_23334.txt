THE DOLL A STORY BY BERNICE KENYON EN they were living at home the microscope always stood on the library table . It was placed beside the windows overlooking Central Park , where the light was just right and where , by standing on a hassock kept under the table for that purpose , Susan could see into the eyepiece perfectly . She was a slender child , not very tall for nine years old , and she longed for the time when she would grow a little more so that the hassock would n't be necessary . Often she got so excited at what she saw through the lenses that she slipped off , jarring the table and moving the slide or spoiling the focus by knocking against one of the lacquered brass wheels that her father had set for her so carefully . She loved the instrument and hated to see it nut of its place . To-day the library table looked queer and empty , for the microscope had been taken down and put on the hall table with two stacks of scientific books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a year abroad . " I hope you have not planned to take that instrument along with you in your hand luggage all the way to Italy , " Susan 's governess , Miss Ekstrom , said when she saw Susan 's father bringing out the padded leather case lined with red velvet and placing it with the other bags that had to be packed before they sailed next day . Nicholas Ashford stood back from the pile of bags and laughed . " I most certainly aml " he exclaimed good-naturedly . " Where would you have me put it ? With the hold luggage ? I 'm sending the big microscope over that way ; but we want this one with us , do n't we , Susan ? We might need it on the voyage . " Miss Ekstrom turned away in disgust and went back to her packing , but Susan could n't resist dancing down the length of the apartment and back again . She knew that her father was taking the heavy thing along for her sake . As far back as she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each morning , to show her the most wonderful  --  the most exciting thingsl One slide each morning  --  she never could tell what she would see . She knew that he prepared the slides himself before breakfast and put them in focus just as she came in from her bedroom to join him . They were never commonplace ones , the kind you can buy if you know where to go for them , in shops selling scientific apparatus , showing mounted amoebae or algae or carefully killed and stained disease germs of quite ordinary kinds . They were things her father found everywhere : bacteria from water in a flower vase , celled cross-sections of leaves , a fly 's multiple eye , crystals of minerals , the branched antenna of a moth that had flown into the living-room drop light , teeming dust from Times Square , a hair from SoLange the Siamese cat who lived in the apartment across the hall , hits of flower petals showing colored plastids and tinted cell-sap , pollen in fantastic shapes , like dozens of small stars or cubes ; once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Susan ! " he had called on that memorable occasion , " Look what 's happening here ! " And she had gazed in fascination , watching the corpuscles line up and fit themselves together , as if to staunch a wound that did n't exist . " It 's human blood , " her father explained . " Is n't it beautiful ? That 's what we have inside us . Every bit of it knows just what to do , and does it even when separated from the creature it 's supposed to care for . Each corpuscle is like a person going about his business , not for his own good , but for the good of the whole man , the whole complicated world to which he belongs . " " Yes , " said Susan . " I see . " She had looked a minute longer , expertly through her right eye without closing the left ; then she had turned away from the table and looked at her father . She had been conscious of a curious and vibrant confusion inside her somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stated honestly . " I 'm all mixed up . " " What 's the matter , Sue ? " " You said it was human blood . Whose blood ? " " Mine . " Susan felt a pang go through her . " Oh , Father , " she cried , " you cut yourself for mel " " Do n't let that worry you , my dear , " said her father . He held out his hand to her . " Look at that . A prick with a sterilized needle . It 's gone already . I 'd do a lot more than prick my finger for you , I hope . " He bent his long , bony , dark length over the microscope again . " Do n't you think it was worth watching ? It 's all finished now , dried up . It 's served its purpose . " He put his arm across Susan 's thin shoulders . " Come on in to breakfast , " he said . Miss Ekstrom had been waiting for them at the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee which the child poured out for her and she looked disapprovinglyat both father and daugchoters a sat , in an understanding npirsacythejf silence , at opposite ends of the table . Susan was n't eating very much and she wore a scowl to mar her plain and already far too thoughtful face . Miss Ekstrom seemed impelled to speak . " I think , Mr. Ashford , if you would leave the microscope until after break . fast ? " she had begun tentatively . " Why ? " " All these queer things you show her  --  this blood for instance  --  it quite takes away her appetite , and you know she 's thin enough already . You undermine her health and you make her unhappy . " " But he does n't ! " exclaimed Susan , suddenly aware that she might be deprived of one of the things she loved best . " I 'm not unhappy . I 'm just thoughtful . " " There you are , Miss Ekstrom ! " Her father had smiled . " She 's thoughtful . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you may not know , the marvelous preoccupation of blood corpuscles , and their self-abnegation  --  to put it sentimentally  --  in serving the whole man instead of looking out for themselves individually . There is much to be /earned from their behavior , as I 'm sure you 're aware . You come from an extremely civilized and democratic country where people have skeptical minds and a large amount of philosophical comprehension . That 's one reason why I took you as governess for my child . You should n't shy off now at a drop of blood . Susan does n't . She thinks about it . " Miss Ekstrom had n't said anything , but Susan knew by her paleness that she was angry ; and from that day on Miss Ekstrom took very little part in the breakfast-table conversations they always had about whatever happened to be in the microscope each morning . Susan had been wondering whether or not their trip to Italy would put an end to her father 's morning ritual , but now she knew that he meant to keep on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ( it did n't show on the map THE DOLL 589 though her father said it was above Lake Como ) he would find ever so much new material for slides , some of it in connection with the work he was doing , the study of the cell-structure of certain rare Alpine plants . But it did n't matter , she realized , where they were ; her father never ran out of material . His mind moved everywhere ; he knew everything . Privately she was sure of this , but her father only laughed at her when she stated that he knew everything . " I know nothing , " he said . " Relatively speaking , nothing at all . Like you , I 'm trying to learn . If I knew everything we should n't be going to Italy . " " Will you show me everything you find out about the Alpine plants ? Can I go up to the snowline with you when you collect them ? " Susan asked . " Certainly , if you can climb that far . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was never a time , she thought , never a moment when she was not looking forward to something new and wonderful that might be examined and discovered and understood . They sailed for Genoa next day in the great Italian liner . Susan and Miss Ekstrom shared a stateroom next to that of her father ; but Miss Ekstrom , who was not a good sailor , spent most of the trip in bed . A stewardess named Carmina came and went , attending to her wants and regarding Susan with a warm affectionate look . " Poor child , " she said on the first day out , " your mother is already quite ill . It is hard for you to be without her company . " " I have my father to be with , " Susan explained , " and besides , Miss Ekstrom is n't my mother ; she 's my governess . My mother is dead . " " 0 Santa Maria ! I did not know . I am so sorry . Your mother is in heaven then . Poor child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout blue-clad stewardess wrung her hands sympathetically . " It is n't hard , " explained Susan . " You see I never knew her . She died when I was born . " " For pity ! She is in heaven then , with the angels . " " Why do you say that ? " Susan looked at the woman curiously . The light from the porthole ran along her polished black hair with a blue sheen . " Because she was good , your mother , I am sure . She is with the Blessed Virgin . " " Oh , no , I do n't think so , " said Susan with conviction . " She is n't anywhere . She 's just dead . My father says so . " " Holy Mother of God ! " exclaimed the stewardess , covering her face with her hands . " You will excuse me . I must go to my work . I will pray for you ! " She backed out of the door and was gone , as if something had frightened her . Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; then she turned toward her governess who was moving uneasily in the bed . " Are you all right , Miss Ekstrom ? " " Please , Susan , please ! " Miss Ekstrom 's voice was faint and her lips very white . " Ca n't you go away somewhere ? I 'd feel better if I were alone and people did n't talk so much . " Susan explored the ship with her father . They went up onto the navigating bridge , and down through the kitchens and the engine rooms . It was a wonderful place , and the enormous staff of people running it , each doing just the right thing for the whole ship , made Susan think of the blood corpuscles under the microscope . The ship , a great being , serene in the perfection of its parts , moved resolutely toward the coast of the OW World . Perhaps in the Mediterranean it might be smooth enough , her father said , to examine some of the samples of sea-water which a sailor took lip for them each day ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blustery March weather which made the ship roll all the time . But in the Mediterranean they both forgot the sea-water samples . There was too much to watch , just as there had been during the day they spent passing the Azores , those amazing green and tawny islands which kept appearing and disappearing about them as the light changed . They saw the small boats of a fishing fleet moving off toward the north with the wind bellying out their queer-shaped brown sails ; an airplane flew over , dipping to the liner as she passed ; other ships went by ; and now and then land appeared . People who had stayed below throughout the rough voyage began to show themselves on deck , fixing their gaze upon the horizon where soon , like a mirage out of mist , the city of Genoa took shape , its houses pouring whitely down through the shallow cleft in the mountains , like the foam of a widening stream . They disembarked amid so much clatter and color and confusion that Susan felt bewildered with too many new impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited people rushed about on the docks , waving and screaming to their friends jostling their way ashore over the second- and third-class gangways . Noise and color and brightness were everywhere , and the thy around and above them looked strange beyond anything Susan had ever seen . At the customs her father and governess made her sit down on one bag while they found and assembled the others . Around her the tide of people passed , crowding against her , hurrying and shouting and gesticulating , greeting one another , dropping bags , offering fruit and toys for sale , opening bundles , running after straying children , arguing in their swift language , and waving their hands , all seeming to get nowhere . And it came to Susan suddenly as she sat there that up until now  --  until this very minute perhaps  --  everything had looked as if , underneath its outer confu sion , it was really quite simple and plain . Seen a little at a time , carefully , all the things of the world had appeared to be in a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design as you learned more about it . But now it was n't so any more ? it had n't been , really , for a number of days , though she 'd only this minute cometo realize it . She could see no pattern in anything about her now , and the lack of it made her curiously uneasy . She felt a need to steady herself , to fix her attention on some one thing , as she had learned to do . Perhaps that would help to straighten out the confusion . On a box at the far side of the room stood a vender with a trayful of objects from the sea slung round his neck by a string ; he had taken from it a large conch shell and was holding it up above the crowding people . How beautiful the shell was  --  brilliant and strangel Her father would buy it for her if she asked him to . She wanted it very much ; it was a single solid beautiful thing that she would keep with her always to remember this time . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father would n't . To him it would n't be just a conch shell  --  one more thing to carry about with them . He would understand how much she wanted it  --  needed it . She stood beside her father , where he was strapping up a bag . " There 's something I want very much , " she said . " That conch shell , the one the man 's holding up over there . Could I have it , do you think ? " Her father looked across the clamorous room . " You wait here , " he said . " I see the one you mean . I 'll get it for you . It 's a very good one , I think , with exceptionally fine color . " He stepped through the tangle of people and bags . He had n't even asked why she wanted it . He was taller and thinner than anybody near them , and more agile ; and when he went to get something he went straight there and got what he was after and came straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassured her . He never seemed confused ; never as if he wondered about anything , or doubted , or felt strange . There was nothing he did n't know or could n't find out . Her admiration for him went beyond all words . . . . He came back and placed the shell in her hands . " They do n't wrap things up if they can help it over here , " he said . A ' 004$4110.10 " You 'll have to carry it that way . But it wo n't break easily . As you see , the color 's very fine . " They got their bags together and took a carriage up to the hotel where they were going to spend the night ; to-morrow they would go on to Milan and Como and their little village of Lariano . At home it was still wintry , but over here spring had come , and the hotel lobby was full of flowers . Miss Ekstrom went past them toward the desk , but her father paused and glanced quickly at each thick bundle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he went on to see about their rooms . The lobby was large and walled with a chilly marble . Near the desk stood a tall glass showcase , its shelves filled with rows of Lenci dolls , surprisingly lifelike , their clipped felt frocks made to represent the regional costumes of different parts of Italy . Their faces were pretty and at the same time full of character ; not all young babies or fluffy little girls , but older children , and even men and women . Miss Ekstrom was fascinated by them . She stood before the showcase all the time that Nicholas Ashford was making out the registry slips at the desk . Susan too could not help but admire the display ; yet after all these were only dolls and had a blank quality about them . They were not real , like the shell , hard and smooth , which she held in her hands . Her father joined them . " Now here is something , " Miss Ekstrom said to him , " that Susan would love to have I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . You do n't often see dolls as fine as these ? " But her father interrupted . Susan had never known him to interrupt anybody before . " Miss Ekstrom , " he said , " I should think you would recall what I said to you many months ago . I am sure you must remember my feeling about dolls . " There was a pause . It was as if something awful had happened . They went up to their rooms in silence , led by two porters carrying the bags . Inthe small single room that opened into that of her governess , Susan hung up her wraps and a few things from her suitcase , and then lay down on her bed , the conch shell in her hands . She turned it about in the light . Its colors had a fundamental iridescence ; held very close to the eye , the smooth bright texture of the surface gave out all the shades of the spectrum in minute gleams . Miss Ekstrom thought shells were useless . In the next room , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving about , unpacking many little things and setting them out carefully . What was the matter with Miss Ekstrom , she wondered , that she did n't remember what her father had said about dolls ? Or had she remembered and was she just trying to change her father 's mind ? Susan knew that here was something you could n't change his mind about . He had a horror of dolls , a kind of fear ; and yet she knew he was not really afraid of anything . But he had sounded frightened that day last year when Miss Ekstrom had brought the doll into the library where they had been sitting reading . She had come in carrying on her arm , as if it were a baby , a rather large doll with pink cheeks and yellow curls , and her father at sight of it had stopped her . " What have you got there ? " he demanded . The sound of his voice was curiously high-pitched . " Is n't she pretty ? " Miss Ekstrom had said , holding out the doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a little old for dolls , but the child seems never to have had one . It 's time she took an interest in the normal playthings every girl enjoys . " " No , no ! " her father had exclaimed , putting down his hook and getting to his feet hastily . " Take it out of the room , please . I do n't want Susan to have it . I do n't need to explain to you , I 'm sure , " he went on in his harsh pained voice , as he hurried Miss Ekstrom before him from the room , " I do n't have to explain to you , I know , that many modern educators do n't believe in dolls . It is n't natural for undeveloped children to want to be mothers ; the idea is forced on them far too early . She 'll come to her feeling of maternity soon enough without the help of dolls  --  too soon  --  much too soon . Her mother did , you know . Her mother was very maternal . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ; she could n't make out the rest of what was being said , but she knew that her father must have been explaining how her mother had died after only two years of being married to him . Miss Ekstrom did n't know ; probably the subject had n't come up at all in the month she had been with them . When her father had come back into the library he had n't taken up his book at once , but had sat looking straight ahead of him , his dark face drawn and queer . Susan put down her book and came and sat on the arm of his chair . She took his long lean hand between her own . " I know what you 're thinking , " she said , though it was very hard to say , " and I should think you 'd hate me . " " Why ? " Her father had looked at her darkly , compelling her to answer . " Because if it had n't been for me , Mother would n't have died . You wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I should hate you , " he said slowly , " if you were n't such a good daughter . But you 're a good daughter . I do n't hate you at all . " He had sat there stiffly in the chair , looking at her , not making any motion toward her . She held his hand , harsh and tense , pressed between her own . " They 'll tell you a lot of things from time to time about your mother , " he said after a while . " A lot of vain and comfortable things . They 'll tell you she lives on , somewhere , after death ; that she has immortality . They 'll tell you about religion , about their own ideas of God , who is supposed to look out for people after they die . If you went to church you 'd hear many things like that , complicated stories to give you a feeling of content , if you thought you needed it , and could shut off your active mind andjust sit there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this later on . But I have n't told you much about religion because most of it 's a lot of fairy tales made up by people to explain what we do n't yet know . Beautiful stories perhaps , but I 'm not sure we have time for them . Our lives are very short and we have so much to find out . There is nothing that we can not find out if we 're given the time . " He stopped for a minute , frowning , pushed the books about on the table as he looked for a cigarette , found and lighted one and shook out the match . " Try to think of your mother the way I do , " he went on . " She is n't anywhere any more so far as we know , and yet she has a kind of immortality because she lives in you ; and she lives in my thoughts and in the thoughts of everybody who knew her at all well . She did n't live very long as a person , but it was long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " After that it had been necessary to go to Miss Ekstrom and tell her how sorry she was about the doll and how nice Miss Ekstrom had been to think of giving her one . " You see , " Susan said , " I do n't really mind not having had dolls . I 've had so many other things instead  --  real living things : my window-box garden , and in the summer every sort of pet when we 're in the country , and the things in the microscope . I have n't needed dolls at all . You see when I grow up I 'm going to be a great botanist and biologist like my father . " " That 's a very natural ambition for you to have , " said Miss Ekstrom , though she had sounded rather hurt . " But just the same I ca n't see why you should be denied the normal interests of other young girls . After all you 're growing into a woman , and when you 're a woman you 'll find that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of , however wise he may be . There are ideas and experiences that wo n't yield to any microscope , you know . " Susan thought a moment and then she spoke . " You and my father are always fighting about something , " she said . " I feel as if I were to blame . " " But you 're not , " said Miss Ekstrom . " You really have n't anything to do with it at all . If your mother were alive she 'd know what I mean . " Perhaps she would have known , Susan thought , turning the shell in her hands , as she lay on the bed and listened to the unfamiliar street-sounds of Genoa ; but her mother was n't anywhere any more . It was useless to think what might have happened had she been alive . Miss Ekstrom was still putting things away in the next room . Susan held the conch shell higher up into the light . Inside its nacreous walls , colored like sunset , had lived what sort of creature ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the sea ? A living door once closed the spiral chamber ; but the inhabitant of so much beauty was gone now , door and all . What fate had overtaken him ? Where had he met his end ? People held shells like these to their ears and , hearing in them the echo of their own living blood , said that they heard the sea . But the sea was themselves  --  a mystery , because you could n't tell what the sounds meant ? what your own blood corpuscles were doing . Yet all of them served you , giving up their single lives for you when necessary without a thought or any hesitation . If you lived long enough you might know why ; you might at least begin to find out why . Mysteries , she knew with every thought in her mind , with every glance , every touch , every sound , were to be explained and understood . There was a way , if you could only find it , of understanding even your own part in them . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , motoring up to it through Erba and the high Brianza on the following day , was one of the quietest places in the whole earth . The town was built on a series of descending rocky shelves , miles above the normal level world some-where below , miles above Lake Como which looked like a blue-green thread between the ash-gray and silver of the mountain slopes , sheltered by peaks of incredible whiteness . Spring was only beginning up here ; far down below them the lake had a green rim . Between their own great height and the immensely distant thread of water were villages like their own , in a descending chain ; on the far side of the lake , looking toward the north , a score or more of villages glimmered against the gray rocky background . The slender belfries of their churches , set upon pinnacles of rock in the steepest places , looked prominent and important ; nothing else showed so plainly . Susan saw them , counted them as she stood on the stone terrace of the house that was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eleven churches , with the tops of their belfries made to look like the opening buds of gigantic flowers . " I ca n't believe we 're going to live here , " she told her father , who had come up beside her . " Why not , Sue ? " Nicholas Ashford shielded his eyes and gazed away off toward La Grigna , the peak of glittering whiteness that rose behind Lake Lecco where it joined Como . The bells in one of the churches began to ring , their thin metal notes muted by distance . " It 's not a real place , " she said , feeling for the right words . " It 's too far and too high . " Her father pointed to a nearer peak . " Wait until you have climbed up there , " he said , " and then you 'll know it 's real . Of course you ca n't believe it till you 've been there . I 'll go up first with some men to bring down plants , and on the second trip I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes , " she said , trying to sound enthusiastic ; but she did n't really care whether she ever went up or not . It was enough to stand on this terrace in the hard bright air , among the sparkling yellow-flowered rock-plants , and look off into the distance , And to look off this way made her so sad that it hurt inside , in a way she could n't have described . Inside their house very soon the usual routine of their lives established itself . The many thick-walled rooms were full of color and light . The largest of them became a laboratory for her father , and she had a study all to herself , with the microscope set up before a north window overlooking the lake and the Alps . Her conch shell stood on the mantel shelf , a long way from the sea out of which it had come  --  looking oddly out of place there , Miss Ekstrom said . The governess spent her days happily putting everything in order and giving directions in Italian to Giulia the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she explained to Susan ; " but she does n't look much like a jasmine flower , do you think ? " And Susan felt annoyed that she should speak like that . Why did Miss Ekstrom always have to be so literal ? Susan was fond of the fat pleasant cook and liked to go down with her to market in the village just below them and sit on the warm stone walls and watch the many small children at play , while Gelsomina haggled with the shopkeepers . Sometimes the older children , back from school , would call to her in their unintelligible dialect , and try to make her join them in some sort of running and jumping game ; but she could n't understand them so she just sat and watched . In their more strenuous play they pushed the younger children out of the way and kicked aside their playthings , smashing the twig huts , treading on the colored pictures torn from newspapers , snatching at the grimy balls . One day a small girl , who for some time had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ragged cloth , found her treasure torn from her and hurled over the wall of the open square down into whatever nothingness lay below . The child could not see what had happened to it ; she was too small . Susan watched her walk away from the others , sobbing to herself and wiping her eyes . " Poor little thing , " she thought , " there 's nothing I can do about it . I ca n't even say anything to comfort her because she does n't even speak Italian  --  only dialect . " Susan 's own Italian had n't yet many words . As she learned her way about , the village of Lariano began to seem to Susan a cruel and a bitter place ; but that was natural , she reasoned , because the people were so far away from the world up here living a hard meager life of their own ' trying to keep alive on so little . They had n't time for thought , and they never looked at anything closely as she did through her microscope each morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand it . You felt thwarted ; you could only look at it with wonder and sadness . Probably these people never noticed anything round them at all , but took the height and distance for granted , so that it did n't bother them . They went happily about their work , singing and laughing , no matter how hard a time they were having . One day Gelsomina did n't go straight home from market , but took Susan with her on an unfamiliar steep path that led out of Lariano , along a narrow ledge to the village church . It was built on a smoothed space of rock that hung perilously over the cliffs that fell straight , at that point , to the valley below . Before the fa  --  ade was a flagged square set about with ash trees , and two reddish stone beasts , their heads and flanks worn by the touches of innumerable hands , guarded the carved church door . Gelsomina said she had to go in to say a prayer for her cousin . She looked worried . " Aspete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the step . The cousin was going to have a baby . Susan hesitated at the door , running her hands over the mane of one of the stone beasts ; then she turned and followed Gelsomina into the hushed gloom . She had never been inside a church before . A quiet silvery light fell about her , from windows set high above somewhere , and a spicy fragrance gathered round her , like the atmosphere of an imagined world . Silence and emptiness , that was all , and a kind of peace . She could see nothing at first ; the light from above cut off everything in front and to the sides , as if it had been a wall . Somewhere beyond the light Gelsomina had disappeared ; but soon Susan heard her matter-of-fact steps on the stone pavement , and she went toward the sound , out of the light . As her eyes grew accustomed to the shadow , she saw that there were small framed pictures along the walls at intervals . Gelsomina knelt before one of these to pray , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . Susan walked to the end of the room and saw the altar candles standing like a still white grove about a gilded cross ; between them were placed tarnished ornaments that flashed with dusty jewels , and tinsel and paper flowers strung into fadeless garlands  --  dead flowers that had never lived . And against the wall hung dead silver hearts that had never beaten , fastened upon black cloth and framed under little squares of glass . So many hearts . Susan looked , and then she turned away . There was nothing here then after all but these small objects , faintly glimmering , arranged in their changeless design with so much work and care . She turned about , searching for Gelsomina and saw , standing upon a pedestal in the angle of the wall , a marvelous doll . She caught her breath and came nearer , then stood looking upward , into the unimaginably quiet face that seemed to be gazing down at her from a great height  --  and yet it was near , almost near enough for her to touch . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn her eyes away from it . It seemed to search her , to reach past all her thoughts . She stood there in the half light , bewildered . Groping behind her with one hand , she felt for something to hold on to , but there was nothing there , and she stood unsteadily , swaying a little . The face continued to look down at her with such sadness as she had never seen , and yet with happiness too . A face with a secret look  --  as if she knew , this strange woman , more than anyone could ever hope to know . But it was only a doll . Of course . Susan drew herself together and took her eyes away from the face . Only a doll that somebody had put in the church . A doll in a dark-blue gown with tinsel trappings and a jewelled crown that held the veil about its head . It stood with arms quietly at the sides , the palms of the hands turned outward , as if they had just been carrying something and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared not look again at the face . " Do n't look up  --  do n't look up , " she kept saying to herself , as if there were some mysterious danger above her . If she looked again what would she see ? On the pedestal somebody had put a little spray of edelweiss . She fixed her eyes on that . Edelweiss . It was a very rare flower . She knew how it looked from the botanical books ; but this was the real flower itself . She came closer and saw that the spray was dry . Gathered a long while ago at the top of one of the snowy peaks and withered now . It was dead , but better than the paper and tinsel flowers , better than the silver hearts . It had lived once and bloomed at the top of a mountain . Someone had climbed a long way to get it and brought it down here because it was rare , to be a decoration for the doll before whom they kneeled and prayed  --  as Gelsomina was coming to kneel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll bring them ? She looked up at the face again , with a kind of desperate boldness this time , and the face looked steadily down at her , with quiet mystery , as a mother might look at a child . As her own mother might have looked at her . Susan turned away suddenly . Tears rushed into her eyes . Something was the matter with her . Was it that she was afraid , like her father , of a doll ? She went out into the square in the sun and stood against one of the ash trees , trembling , holding on to it and feeling the strong bark with her fingers , but seeing nothing about her . She saw only the face ; the deep and secret look enveloped her . She must have stood there a long while , for gradually she began to hear Gelsomina 's impatient voice , saying that they must hurry home . They were late already , she said . Gelsomina 's broad features appeared empty and content from her prayers . She was not even worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook dinner and she knew she would get there in plenty of time ; she knew just what she had to do . They went along the path silently and up the sa flea to the house . On the way in Susan passed Miss Ekstrom hurrying off on some errand , looking much as she had always looked , but yet not quite familiar . There was a blank quality about her as if , behind her determined expression , she was really not thinking at all . In Susan 's study everything waited in the usual order , the conch shell on the mantel , books strewn about her table , the microscope under the window , with the slide of the morning still in focus . None of them seemed to mean anything ; the importance had gone out of them . What had been in the microscope this morning ? She could n't remember . She could n't remember at all . And she did n't even want to look . What was the matter with her ? A good daughter with a scientific mind  --  why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mingled in a vast confusion to which she could get no clue . Yet why should she fight against the confusion and struggle so to understand everything ? What did it matter when you had seen that there were things you could never hope to know ? Why should n't you give yourself up to the confusion , let it sweep you along in its tide , while you closed your eyes now and then to remember the serenity of that marvelous face , the face whose wisdom went beyond the world , and whose look seemed to mean that struggle was n't necessary , that time was endless and life very simple if you would only be quiet and wait and not always ask why . . Because life was n't fathomable . . . . It was n't possible to know . . . . But that was the face of a doll ! She must get away from the face ; it was a doll 's face with no life behind it ; it had never lived . In spite of its look of wisdom , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shell . It was not like the edelweiss , snatched down from its perilous hold on the top of a mountain . It was only a dolll She ran out of her study , down the stairs , through the hallway , out over the terrace , to the wall that held you from running off into space . Her father was there , sitting on the terrace wall with his back to the Alps , reading a hook . He put it down . " Why , Sue , " he said , " What 's the matter ? You look as if you 'd seen a ghost ! Come here . Sit beside me . Where have you been ? " She stood still before him . He was waiting for her to explain . " I 've been to the church , " she said finally , catching her breath . He might as well know . She 'd be bound to tell him sometime . " The village church , " she went on . " Out on a cliff . They build them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said gently . " Mak. ing things hard for themselves , as if they were n't hard enough already . What did you see in the church ? " She had known he would ask . She must think of something else to tell him ? quickly . " I saw  --  I saw  --  an edelweiss . A real one . " She focussed her thought upon just this one thing . She must never again remember the face , never speak of the doll . " An edelweiss ? Did you really ? " " Yes . " She paused . " It was a dried one . From last year . " " Quite likely . Trust you to find it though , among all the things in a church . What did you think of it ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " she said slowly , trying desperately to get her thoughts together . " Not much . A little cottony thing . Like something cut out of white felt . " " You 're an observing girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They are like that . But do you know that people have lost their lives for them , climbing to the tops of peaks to get them from where they grow with their roots toward the sky and their dull little flowers facing earthward ? The people have fallen sometimes  --  died that way . " " I know , " she said . The distance around them , the wall of mountain peaks , seemed immense and terrifying . " I know they grow high up  --  where you have to go . " " Ohl So that 's what 's been worrying you ? " " No ? " she began , and stopped , feeling that there was no way out but deception . " No , " she began again . " It 's only that  --  they ought not to have to die  --  just to know about  --  about edelweiss . It does n't seem worth while . There must be things you are n't meant to know , even if you want to . And things you ca n't find out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you 're alive . Like  --  like what you ought to do ? " She broke off , finding no words that were any good to her . Her father grasped both her shoulders with his long tense hands . " Sue , " he said , " Sue , you must n't think that . You really must n't . You 're going to be a great scientist some day , and every door , every mystery , will open ahead of you as you come to it . You 'll know just what you have to do . And for now you must n't have any doubts . . " " Do n't you ever have any doubts ? " she interrupted , glancing up at hint for reassurance , and seeing for the first time that his look was hard and bitter , a tragic look that she did n't know at all . But he answered her quickly , hurrying out the words . " No , " he said . " Of course I do n't . Of course not . No . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Susan saw that the tips of his fingers went white . And she knew that he was lying .
