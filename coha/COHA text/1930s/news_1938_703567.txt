txt Carnegie-Illinois Steel , leading producing subsidiary of United States Steel Corp. , yesterday reduced its prices on rails and railroad track materials , effective immediately . At the same time , the corporation reaffirmed for fourth quarter delivery quotations on all products effected by the price cuts made last June . This action , expected to be followed shortly by all other major steel makers , leaves tin plate as the only product on which official reductions have not been made . However , there have been numerous reports of " concessions " in this product . Yesterday 's announcement by CarnegieIllinois brought quotations on steel rails and track materials in line with the reductions made earlier on other products . It was indicated that , once again , the old differentials from the Pittsburgh base have been eliminated . $2.50 Reduction on Rails The new price for rails was set at $40 a ton , a reduction of $2.50 ; track materials were cut by amounts ranging from $2 to $5 a ton . Steel trade circles believe that neither the cut in railroad materials nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on consumer orders . Both actions had been anticipated . Despite talk of the need of a general price increase , informed trade quarters have stressed the impossibility of such a move at the present time . The price structure has lacked stability , and even the quotations now reaffirmed have not been holding firmly . There have been numerous instances of shading , as well as open concessions . Because the contract year on tin plate expires September 30 , it had been expected that a reduction , covering requirements of consumers for the contract year beginning October 1 , , also would be announced .

However , this view is not shared by consumers , who insist that there have been concessions on this product for some time . These users say that current market and price conditions must be recognized . The quotations reaffirmed for fourth quarter deliveries were established by subsidiaries of the U. S. Steel Corp . on June 25 , last , when drastic reductions were made and differentials from the Pittsburgh base eliminated . At that time it was announced that the leading interest had made the move to attract business , but it also was believed that the reductions were in recognition of the lower prices which had ruled on actual transactions for weeks .
