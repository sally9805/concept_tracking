txt The eleven Tammany legal advisers , looking upon their own creation , pronounce it very good . Having given Leader CURRY their opinion that he ought not to waive immunity , they praise him to the skies for acting upon their counsel . Mr. CURRY himself must be a little surprised , and perhaps secretly amused , at finding himself suddenly advanced as " an example which will help to " recall to the public a realization of " the value and necessity of preserv " ing those rights and powers of the " Individual upon which so much of " our progress and growth have " rested . " No such tribute is paid by the Eleven to the Tammany district leaders who are also officeholders . Their great constitutional rights and privileges which they had attempted to assert , just as Mr. CURRY did , disappear in a statement that they ought to be " ready at any time to " obey a legal process of the court " and respond to all faire questions " affecting their official acts and " conduct . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immortal muniments of personal liberty were thrown out of the window just because the Governor had advised this course and the Mayor had commanded it . There is no occasion to challenge the sincerity or the soundness of the advice given by the Tammany lawyers to Mr. CURRY . But the impatient and suspicious public will think that all this is only sticking in the bark of the real question . The city has before it four indictments for a felonious act in securing an appointment as a magistrate . There is a strong desire to find out whether this is only an isolated case . If it was a common or frequent practice , people are entitled to have the fact established . No one could give more direct and first-hand information about it than the Tammany leaders . nstead of shying at the inquiry , they ought to spring forward to volunteer their aid . Professing as they do to stand for clean government , . and filled with horror as they are at the thought of official and especially judicial corruption , they might be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let them tell what they know . Let them submit to cross-examination on what they say they do not know . It is not really a case , when it is a matter of such vital public concern , for seeking the advice of lawyers . It ought to be enough for the Tammany men to consult their own consciences and to be guided by their Own common sense , The latter must tell them that the course which they have elected to pursue is the most damaging to them politically that could be conceived . All over the city candidates for minor offices are complaining that they are frightfully handicapped in their efforts to win votes by the terribly bad impression made throughout the city by Tammany evasion . If the Eleven could have brought themselves not to pore over their law books or-dig up precedents , but to study human nature  --  especially political human nature  --  a little more closely , they might have seen reason to give Mr. CURRY a very different kind of advice .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
