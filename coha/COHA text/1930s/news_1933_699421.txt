txt Secretary of the Treasury Mills expressed the opinion that there would be no general revenue bill in the present short session of Congress . ne ealie ? attention to the time that is required to put through such a proposal as the Democratic leaders are discussing for raising additional revenue from income taxes and said that he did not think that the remaining weeks of the session allowed sufficient time . Democrats , however , could balance the budget in a special session if they chose , he said . To do this they would have to effect about $500.000,000 in economies and raise about $500,000,000 in revenue Hope that the present session of Congress will take action to balance the federal budget has about disappeared . Whether the job can be taken care of during the probable special session of the new Congress now seems to depend on the willingness of President-elect Roosevelt to adopt bold measures . Both parties went through the late Presidential campaign promising fiscal reform , and both came into the short session of Congress a month ago fully aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in sight . President Hoover proposed a program of reduced appropriations and the enactment of a sales tax . However , even his program left a large deficit for the current fiscal year , and it failed to bring probable expenditures to the level of probable receipts during th : next fiscal year . Cone-res. , has been unwilling to go as far as President Hoover proposed , either in the matter of economy or in taxation . The President proposed a rut of 5127 000.000 in veterans ' al- lowances and of $55,000,000 in government salaries . It is now clear that Congress will not adopt these . The President proposed also a number of consolidations of bureaus , which would result in administrative savings of undetermined amounts . These Congress proposes to block . It would be quite wrong , however , to say that Congreai has done nothing in the way of economy . In consideration of the various appropriation bills , it has made reductions even beyond those proposed by Mr. Hoover . A special committee in the Senate has worked out an economy program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriation totals about $100,000,000 below the Hoover proposals . But the congressional action is still inadequate , for the job calls for more than a paring of expenses . It calls for eliminations . weeding out of unnecessary functions and a searching investigation Vito the two channels of largest expenditure , the veterans and national defense . Unless that is done there can be no hope of cutting expenditures to the level of revenues . There is absolutely no indication that Congress will take such action . On the side of new taxation , congressional leaders have turned their hand to just one measure , a bill to legalize beer and tax it . The enactment of that measure is doubtful . Even though it were enacted it would raise from $125,000,000 to $150,000,000 a year , which is not a large fraction of the probable deficit . After some hesitation , Democratic leaders in Congress seemed to be corning about to the idea of a sales tax . Their efforts were stopped before they were started by the objection of the President-elect . Higher Income Tax Plan Squelched The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party leaders in House and Senate contained a new project to increase normal income tax rates and lower exemptions . That project has been smothered as it was born by a storm of opposition in Congress . The real truth of this situation is that Congress can not act . In considering economic : : it is tied up by the pressure of lobbies . In considering taxation , its members obviously fear to put any further burden upon the public . The next Congress is very likely to act pretty much as this one does . Its membership will be different . One party will have indisputable control . But it will still be subject to the pressure of organized minorities . It will still fear the wrath of the public . In fact , its fears might be expected to be even greater than the present Congress . for the new members have political prospects and many of the present ones know their political careers to be ended . Three Ways to Balance Budget There are three ways that the budget can be balanced : by reducing expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best fiscal authorities in Washington believe that the third is the practical way . For the reasons mentioned no one looks to this or the next Congress for the economies necessary . They must be effected by the incoming President , acting under a blanket authority granted by the Congress . The more quickly the new President acts in this matter of economies , the more likely will be his chances for success . The longer he delays . the more chance he gives for vested interests to get in their wort : on Congress to halt or overturn he= action after it is taken . For that matter the longer he delays , the more chance there is for pressure on the executive himself . Of course , the President can not act alone in the matter of taxes , because the raising of revenue is so unquestionably the function of the legislature . What the executive must do is to furnish the leadership that will cause Congress to act , for without that there is little chance that Congress will do more than it has done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is every reason why he should go slow about attempting to exercise his leadership at this Congress . They point out that it is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats and that even some of the Democrats might not feel that they are committed to the Roosevelt leadership . It is said that with the next Congress the incoming President will not hesitate to use his influence to the fullest extent . If he does so , he can bring the budget into balance . From THE NVAT.I. . riled Jot IZNAL " Wash travton bureau WASHINGTON  --  Democratic leaders in Congress have every ntention of attempting to carry out the tax plan conceived at the conference in New York with President-elect Roosevelt , although some are aware of the un certainty of the outcome of their efforts . The tax program of the Democrats has already been turned over to experts on tax matters in the joint committee on internal revenue taxation . Senator Harrison . ranking Democrat on the finance committee , said that the minor ? ity members will meet this week to advance the program toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate members in charge of taxation matters will ' be held . It is estimated that on the basis of Treasury figures approximately $150,000,000 in revenue must be raised through increased normal tax rates . This is assumaig that a beer tax - will provide $125,000,000. economies , $100,000,000 and gasoline tax $137,000,000 . Senator Harrison pointed out that nothing final will be done on taxation pending the outcome of efforts to cut governmental expenditures by $100,000,000 . When told of the surprise which met the announcement that low incomes would be further taxed , the Mississippi Senator said he thought that under existing conditions the American people would be glad to help the government to this extent . There was created as a result of Speaker Garner 's statement on Saturday that less painful taxes could be adopted , considerable confusion as to whether the entire Democratic membership was favorable to the plan adopted at . New York on Thursday . Mr. Harrison , on the one hand . speaking for Democrats in the Senate , declared that the tax program would be carried out , while Speaker Garner . representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Garner said in effect that if too much opposition arose over the plan , he would suggest a leas painful form of taxation . What his alternative plan is could not be ascertained . Discussing the New York conference , Mr. Garner said , " It . was suggested up there that to broaden the base of income taxes and to raise rates was the best way of meeting the deficit . Some one said we could get $203,000,000 that way and there was no objection . " I would be mighty glad to see It ( the tax bill ) reported and passed by the House . " Garner Sees " 49 Other Ways While favoring the plan , Mr. Garner observed that if it does not meet the approval of the committee on ways and means and the House generally , there are 49 other ways of raising revenue . " This is a practical proposition . The question is getting so much revenue . I do n't care how you get it The thing is to get it . " Asked about the possibility of an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of efforts to balance the budget which would be shown at the end of the current Congress . " I would like to se a tax plan passed , and I think that the income tax plan is one acceptable to me , among others . There are many ways in which to raise taxes . The quicker you levy taxes and balance the budget , the better it will be for the country . It is the foundation of recovery . It is the first stone to be laid . The first thing to do is to put your house in order . " The cost of government oughtt o hr. meterially reduced , from the city council to the federal government . The country has gone crazy in the last 15 years in issuing bonds to make progress . Some of the improvements have been good . Some not so beneficial . " If the President vetoes the beer bill , we will have to get $125,000,000 some place else , or if the President vetoes a revenue measure , we may as well realize we ca n't balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
