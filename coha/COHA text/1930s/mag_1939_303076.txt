The residents of the little village of Alder , Wash , heard the sedate rumble of her four 1,100 h.p. engines change to a snarling roar as her pilot put her nose downhill through the overcast one day last week . From the clouds 10,000 feet above them she burst into view , fleet , round-bodied . A black speck burst from her left side , grew with incredible rapidity as it hurtled to the ground-an engine . Her sleek left wing swung back , twisted in the air and fell away as her engines alternately roared and growled . <P> Boeing 's 33-passenger Stratoliner , pressurized to travel above the airways at 20,000 feet , was in her death throes , had broken up in an engineering test dive . Down the crippled ship came , spinning , straightening out , sailing like a piece of ragged paper , carrying the ten men in her to sure death . <P> She crashed in a wooded ravine . From the flattened fuselage , stretched out like a beached and broken whale not far from where her wing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots , the chief test pilot of Transcontinental &; Western Air , four Boeing office and shop employes and two Hollanders who had been thinking of buying Stratoliners for Dutch airlines . <P> At the Boeing plant , some 50 miles to the north in Seattle , work was stopped on ten other Stratoliners , three of which have been ordered by Pan American airways . Perplexed , President C. L. Egtvedt of Boeing declared : " It was . . . one of the best we have built . I ca n't believe the fault lay in the ship itself . " Quick to deny that this implied sabotage was Boeing . But the facts remained that the first Stratoliner , carefully built and tested on the ground , had flown about 23 hours in closely supervised engineering tests without sign of structural weakness , that into her building had gone all the genius that had produced the Army 's successful flying fortresses , Pan Am 's 74-passenger flying boats .                    @
