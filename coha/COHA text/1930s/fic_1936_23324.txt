PRICE OF EMPIRE A STORY BY OWEN JOHNSON C URIOUSLY unemotional people , the English . Hard to decipher . The French never understand them , their calm , their phlegm . " Le phlegm , le beau phlegm brittanique . " Hard for us too to get under the skin . It 's the bit of sentiment that 's hidden away , down deep , carefully repressed for fear of appearing sentimental like the Germans . The one unforgivable social error . But it 's there just the same , something that 's bound up with their youth , with adventure , with some far-flung spot in the great British Empire over which the sun never sets . They venture out with the old Viking lust , drift about the world in strange forgotten places , among queer savage tribes , pick up curious knowledge , do extraordinary things , and retire on a small income to nurse rheumatism or malaria in cheap , tidy places with excellent food which they have discovered . On the Continent go where the English go . The instinct is infallible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an immaculate room of the Pension Suisse at Cannes . Immaculate is exactly the word . Even the formal shut-in garden with its twisting gravel walks and sunny bursts of mimosa is meticulously scrubbed and combed each morning . The Swiss must have been created to satisfy the English need of the perfect pension . This is like ten thousand others ; the same sitting room with copies of Punch , the Graphic , the Times and Daily Mail , the same Swiss clocks and heavy rugs for table covers . The outer room for coffee and liqueurs is glassed in on a blue-and-yellow diagonal pattern . There is a marble pavement , palms , little iron tables and little iron chairs , and the traditional upright piano that is never played  --  is never meant to be played . Subdued , restful , the off-season . Only a scattering of guests . A German family carefully speaking broken French and the English . Nothing exciting . No one under fifty . Nothing to disturb the routine of a month 's concentration on a lagging bit of work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy , purposeful middle-class , backbone of the Empire . Small existences , a few weeks ' vacation planned to eke out the last penny 's worth . No one will speak to me unless I speak to him , and that would be regarded as an intrusion . The Englishman 's home is still his castle and he carries something of that atmosphere with him to repel invaders . So while I sit expectantly in the shining dining room , waited on by a buxom red-checked girl from Savoy I study my cousins with a tolerant humor , amusing myself with their ungainly hygienic clothes , their cathedral silences , their inscrutable exteriors . At the table next to me a couple somewhere in the late sixties . The wife plump , wrinkled , smiling , enveloped in multicolored veils , is a sort of militant head nurse scanning the menu with suspicion , dictating the diet with a ferocious enmity for anything that suggests a French sauce , substituting endless omelets and shirred eggs . The husband , object of these persistent prohibitions , is short , fleshless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly overweight . He has a suppressed energy that explodes at the slightest infraction of the table etiquette and occasionally flares up in a futile revolt against his domestic tyrant . He takes drops before each meal and pills afterward , with shaky , spidery fingers that write scrawls in the air . The day before yesterday they came in late half-way through the table cl'hOte . The chops arrived tepid . There was a rapping on the table with a knife , scurrying up of the waitress , and a sudden volcanic eruption . " Louise , take away these chops . They are cold . Cold and devilish tough tool " Madame arrived volubly ; apologies and explanations ; substitution of a special dish . There was an approving stir and a nodding of British heads . English sense of justice vindicated . Englishmen 's rights . It was not that the food had not been uniformly excellent but that no deviation must be permitted where Englishmen are involved . A little thing , but the attitude that rules undisciplined races . Fussy old curmudgeon ' If I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , he sits in a corner and fixes me with a bovine stare " Who the deuce are you , an American , to deprive an Englishman of the first glimpse of his daily Bible ? " Sometimes I prolong the agony . On the other side two English women sliding down the fifties . Spinsters ? Probably . At any rate something of the spinster 's self-sufficiency and authority . Teachers ? With us , yes ; or business women . I 'm not so sure . They reel off endless miles in their square low-heeled boots and homespuns ; energetic swinging miles which would leave me short of breath and humiliated ; returning punctually with reddened cheeks to slip into a frock for dinner . Always the same Liberty smocks that have survived a dozenfashions . They look splendidly scrubbed and tidy . To-day I discovered their names at the mail window  --  Diana Drayton and Rose Bart . I can think of no other expression quite so fitting as the English phrase " sweetly pretty . " Once they must have looked just that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosycheeked , clear eyes , straight in body and lithe in limb . You know at a glance what their lives have been : Church of England , charities , gardens , handiwork , sport ; with a little stereotyped flirting and a touch of tragedy  --  lover killed in the service of the Empire . Through it all splendidly unemotional . Victorian once but quite modern now  --  modern spinsters . I come upon them occasionally at the Casino , venturing a few francs at the least expensive tables , dancing in a rigid revolving old-fashioned way , or at the theater risking a French farce . OId enough to do such things now . To know how the other half lives . What makes such existences tolerable is that hundreds of thousands are doing the same . The caste feeling . Exactly . England is full of castes , rigidly doing the things that arc done in a predestined station of life . Yet once upon a time they must have had more than an average of good looks . Particularly the taller one , Miss Diana Drayton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good regular features , nice wavy hair . Put a touch of color in her cheeks , a sparkle in her still clear blue eyes , the challenge of a gay laugh in her voice , men would have noticed her passing . Many men . Miss Bart too might have been pretty , sweetly pretty in a plump , dimpled way but shyer . The waiting , quickly fading English primrose . Nevertheless , spinsters both . The answer ? The Empire . Two wars in their generation , the Boer and that great struggle that decimated the already inadequate males in the great imperial hive . There is between them , as in all such companionships , a marked distinction , assumed and conceded . A subtle distinc-tion , not at once apparent . It is Miss Drayton who makes the decision : what to select from the menu , when to rise ; Miss Drayton who dictates the play at the gaming tables , who plans the daily excursion . Hard to formulate but I feel a deference on the part of Miss Bart . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the recognition of some clear superiority . Perhaps it is only a social distinction . Miss Bart is the commoner . There may be a drop of the aristocrat in her friend . At any rate the feeling that one has had something in life which the other has missed , possibly could never achieve . I am letting my imagination run . The difference may be merely one of authority , a positive nature dominating a pliant one . Beside my neighbors , a solitary Englishman , long , lumbering , of the foreign service type , who keeps strictly to himself ; and a family of five  --  mother and father , beefy and red , with three rosy mannish daughters between the ages of eleven and fifteen , who chirp incessantly and watch me furtively to see how an American eats . We have been here a week together , crowding into the same lift , mingling in the lecture room , passing and repassing , without the recognition that one insect gives to the other . The curmudgeon and his keeper take to their rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not at the Casino sit side by side reading romantic novels . The clock in the hall tick-tocks the routine hours . Once in a while the youngest of the bounding sisters looks at me as though she would like to ask me a question about the Indians and buffaloes of New York , but does n't quite dare to venture through the gates of propriety . Lazy monastic existence . The world a thousand miles away . Like a long , languid English novel of commonplace life . Sometimes in a rebellious mood I am tempted to spring to the piano stool and bang out a ribald tune . . . . The curmudgeon 's name is Ratchett ; Colonel Martin Seton-Ratchett , retired . This is a surprise . A most unmilitary Colonel . I had placed him definitely in trade . After ten days Miss Drayton has spoken to me . It reminded me of Jules Fabre 's experiment with the inchworms . To prove that insects do not reason he directed a file of inchworms onto a circular basin and cut the life line by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days starving and bewildered they continued to circulate , each worm following blindly the worm in front of it . Three days , if I remember correctly , before the chain was broken . The experiment seemed to me to prove nothing but that insects reason as most humans do . At any rate , after ten days Miss Drayton spoke to me . " Are n't you sitting on the copy of Punch ? " ? I was . I popped up as though I had been trampling on the British flag . She immediately retired to her corner . An American girl would have developed an acquaintance . Not so with Miss Drayton . She simply wanted the copy of Pun'ch . On the strength of this introduction I how now when we meet in the lift . A most casual , fleeting recognition . The flutter of an eyebrow with an instant concentration upon the far distance . A bow that is meant to say , " Oh yes , you did speak to me once , but I have no intention of permitting the acquaintance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics are successful . I shall be considered well-bred because I show no interest . Plainly this excites her curiosity in an American . On the twelfth day the file was broken again . Colonel Ratchett barked out in the sun parlor after dinner : " Anybody mind if I close this infernal door ? " I did mind , everyone else minded . But the Colonel ( he had a muffler about his neck ) closed the door . The tall Englishman , Mr. Macklin ( he was n't military after all ) , immediately rose and said in nasal indignation : " Garcon , mon caf ? dehors ! " The next day I nodded tentatively to Colonel Ratchett who immediately looked me through . To-day , the fourteenth , I have definitely broken through the ice . It happened in a curiously impulsive way . I was taking an aperitif in the ballroom of the Casino while waiting for the gambling to open . I was studying the ever-interesting spectacle of a cosmopolitan crowd when I noticed my two English women of the pension sitting opposite . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed and she nodded with an unexpected smile . There was a touch of wistfulness in the recognition , something that gave me the impression that she wanted very much to dance and that Miss Rose Bart was distinctly inadequate to her mood . An excellent orchestra was playing the " Blue Danube , " a waltz that stirs memories and entices middle-aged sentimentalists to out-of-fashion spins . I went over and bowed . " Would it be impertinent to ask you for this waltz ? " She got up quickly and placed her hand lightly on my arm . I had an agreeable shock . The first time you dance with a woman your instinct tells you a great deal . It was a real surprise . Miss Drayton danced exceedingly well . Nothing rigid , nothing standoffish : a natural , extremely pleasant melting into one 's arms . " You 're an American ? " " You 've found me out . " " Why did you ask me to dance ? " " Because I felt you wanted to dance with me . " " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very observing . " " You love it ? " " Oh , yes , I still do . " The music ended . A burst of hand-clapping and we began the encore . I looked down . Her eyes were closed and her lips a little parted . " Memories ? " " Yes , naturally . " At the end I took her back to her seat and Miss Rose Bart . This was our entire conversation . But I retained a distinct , even sensuous , impression . I am now established on the basis of a conceded acquaintance . Largely , I think , because beyond a formal greeting each day , I have carefully refrained from further approach . This arouses her curiosity . So unlike an American . Result : following conversation in the lift , " I saw you at the shimmy table . Did you have a good evening ? " " Excellent for me . I lasted two hours . " " Do you mean you never win ? " " Never . " " Oh ! " " 4ncl you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my quota . If I lose fifty francs or make a hundred I stop . " " Excellent system . Almost a moral pastime . Ahead I hope ? " " Almost a thousand . " " What ? And that does n't tempt you to plunge ? " She shook her head decisively . " Oh dear , no ! " Last night I saw them at the theater at a typical Palais Royale farce . Rather more so in fact . In a particularly outrageous second act Miss Drayton rose , shook her skirts as though cleansing them of pollution , and stalked out of the theater , followed by Miss Bart with her head down . I could not refrain from a little teasing . " I see you have an excellent knowledge of French idioms , " I said during a chance meeting in the gambling rooms later . " Now just what do you mean by that ? " " A lot passes over your head in a French farce if you 're not up on the slang . " " I thought it most unnecessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammers in a nail . " Are you easily shocked ? " She looked at me rather resentful at so unnecessary a question . " Oh , but I most certainly am ! " We sat down for sandwiches and a nightcap . Miss Bart was still playing at a modest table . " Then you do know a good deal of French . " " I was in charge of a field hospital during the War . " I was tempted to more questions but refrained with an effort . My patience has been rewarded . Miss Drayton becomes each day more articulate . She is quite an important person , head superintendent at one of the newer London hospitals . She has what we used to call a strong character . Black is black and white is white . Only the gambling is inconsistent ; but then all the English gamble . However , to pursue it with such rigid discipline , never deviating from her fixed principles , is to make of the demoralizing passion an exercise in ethical contra She is a perfectly regulated moral nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemal Pasha . Dislikes intensely Lloyd George , thinks the League of Nations sentimental twaddle . Disdains romantic novels , though she reads them copiously . Favorite authors , Thackeray , George Moore , and Somerset Maugham ( despite or perhaps because of his cynical estimate of women ) . Never reads an American author  --  are these any ? If there has ever been a flicker of sentiment in her nature , except an idolatry for the Empire , it is undetectable . Enjoys laying down the law to me . Sense of humor feeble , sense of enjoyment extraordinary . This is what makes her companionable . An eager response to little pleasures . This I set down as a quick observation . But now that I have set it down , I do n't believe I am at all right . How could a more than pretty woman , in whose veins youth must have flowed imperiously , have gone through two wars in intimate contact with primal forces and have remained unawakened ? My instincts deny it . Yet I am puzzled and my curiosity is quickened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered . But with an English woman the discovery is more difficult . Miss Drayton has a realistic philosophy that is like a Prussian discipline , but did she never in some swift revolt of youth , step outside the ranks ? To-day  --  an extraordinary day  --  my questions are answered . It all happened because Miss Bart was laid up with a touch of the treacherous Riviera cold . On an impulse I offered to replace her for an excursion over the mountains . To my surprise Miss Drayton accepted  --  yes even with alacrity . We started early in the cool of the morning , leaving the tram at Grasse , to climb the white road that coils upward over the vast plain of the Riviera . " Do much of this sort of thing ? " she said giving me a compassionate glance . " Well , do n't gallop up . " " It is a bit stiffish . " Stiff it was , but the soaring view was an inspiration . The day was brilliant and with the bite of mountain air . Still I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an aperitif at a caf ? that hung in midair . " Nice here . " " " Very . We sat down , consulted the patron , and ordered the local vermouth . Below us hamlets were clinging like wasp nests to giddy crags , ancient refuges from the days when the Moors ravaged the seacoast . Cannes and Antibes on the dotted Littoral ran along the flat expanse of the ancient sea . Other villages huddled on the knobby hills about the moldy churches . Terraced slopes of cloudy olive trees , flashes of mimosa , thin threads of meandering roads through checkered fields extended on the green plain . To the north , against the brittle blue , the stark white Pyrenees retreated in stony waves . We were incredibly high , above even the droning flight of an airplane that hung like a giant darning needle far below us . Above even a wisp of cloud that straggled up a nearby mountainside . The silence had a hollow vastness . Thin sounds floated tip . The pipe of a shepherd . The honk of a motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Corsica  --  immensely clear , is n't it ? " The island came out of the fiat blue mirror of the ancient sea across which the galleons of Spain and of Venice , the triremes of Rome and Greece had sailed a thousand years and faded away . All so long ago . " Cozy here ? " I aroused myself  --  at least she had n't said " sweetly pretty . " Cozy even was n't adequate . " There 's where we end up , " I said leaning out over the wall . Thousands of feet below in a vertiginous drop we picked out our little restaurant and the cataract that roared through the Gorge des Loups . " It does n't seem real . " " Nothing is real here , " I said , and repeating my thought , " It 's all happened so long ago . " She nodded . " Quite . " I sipped the vermouth . " Better this than listening to old Ratchett beefing about the food . " " Fussy , disagreeable old man . He should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very military about him . " " Ratchett ? Oh , but he was a first-rate man , you know . Colonial service . Oh , yes , indeed . He 's sort of legend really  --  like Lawrence of Arabia . " My face showed my incredulity . " Oh , but everyone knows about Seton-Ratchett . Surely now you 've heard about the time he stopped the Zulu outbreak . " " We 've plenty of time , " I said , pouring out another glass . " Tell me . " " Fancy your not knowing of that ! Even in America ! There 's not much to tell but ? " " Where and when ? " " It was just before the Boer War  --  oh yes , I went through that too . If he had n't done what he did we should have had the natives on our backs you know . And justthen that would have been rather awk-ward . " She told the story as though she had been reading a financial report in a dim Committee Room . " Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Upper Africa . Right after the second Zulu uprising . Was it the first or the second ? The second , yes , the second . Ratchett had to take over a post that no one fancied . Ten days ' or possibly two weeks ' trekking from anywhere . A most dismal spot I should say . Mail and provisions once a month . Not always that . Two whites , forty Colonials in a bit of stockade . Thousands of Zulus about them . The local king  --  I ca n't remember his name  --  Nambi-Boko , Nambi-Bobowell any rate they called him Namby Pamby  --  had to be closely watched . Very irritating sort of person . Liked to gobble up the Colonials . I suppose he actually thought he was a real king . Natural though , was n't it ? Quite an annoying person for the Colonial Office . You see they did n't want to have another tiff with the Zulus on their hands . " When Ratchett took over , three of the Colonials had been potted in the last month . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked them up afterward . Shocking state of affairs . Ratchett learned the local dialect in three months  --  he 's awfully good at that sort of thing . Then he sent for Namby Pamby and told him if any more of his men popped out he 'd hold him personally responsible . " Well , of course it did happen . They gobbled up two more . Ratchett marched right into the camp and up to Namby Pamby . And what do you think ? He was actually dining off one of the Colonials . Double offense , that ! Ratchett put a pistol to his back and marched him out , threw him into irons , tried him , and sentenced him to be shot at sunrise . " Well , there was a row you may be sure . They started up the tomtoms . Ever heard them ? Most irritating sound that , you know . Rather unpleasant night I imagine in the stockade . Two Englishmen with a scrubby lot of frightened natives listening to the tomtoms . When the dawn came in the impis were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witch doctors shrieking among them . However , a little thing like that did n't bother Ratchett . He shot Namby Pamby right at sunrise . Then be gave him a most splendid funeral . Military honors and all that sort of thing . Clever of him , was n't it ? Just the right touch . So consoling . After that things went very smoothly you may be sure . Nice bit of work , was n't it ? Very efficient chap , Ratchett . " My Yankee emotionalism ( which I try to suppress in the British presence ) got the better of me . " Good Lord ! Efficient ? What 's efficiency got to do with it ? It took cold-blooded nerve ! " Miss Drayton looked at me blankly . " But what else could he have done ? He could n't let his men be gobbled up , could he ? lie just had to see it through . " The picture of the two Englishmen standing there in the gray of the dawn amid a handful of shaky native troops to face ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ever show enthusiasm ? " But the chances were a hundred to one against it ! Why the man deserved the Victoria Cross . " " Do you think so ? " " Do n't you ? " " No-o . You see that 's given only for exceptional and extraordinary valor . " I looked at her suspiciously . The English do enjoy " spoofing " us . " Of course , " I said , with a touch of malice , " if he 'd been murdered now or splendidly tortured  --  the Cross would have gone to his widow . " She took this seriously . " Well , yes , perhaps . But I daresay he much prefers to be kicking about and she too . " She reflected a moment . " It was in the line of duty you know . " " That 's an English point of view . " " Oh yes , quite . Of course we 've been doing things like that for such a long time you know . " I thought this rather unnecessary . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting my glass , " I humbly beg his pardon . " " As for me , I sha n't do anything of the sort , " she said pushing aside her glass . " He 's a most dreadful , impossible old man . " I gave up . There was n't a shred of romance in the woman . " Twelve o'clock . We 've a couple of hours ahead of us . " She rose . " Are you annoyed with me ? I should n't like that . " " Oh no . " " You Americans are so delightfully dra-matic . " I refused to answer this and we set out . When we reached the restaurant it was well after two o'clock , and the last stragglers were leaving . We took a table under the lindens by the wall and summoned the proprietor . I knew the specialites de la maison : brook trout and spring lamb from the mountains  --  the tenderest in the world . Out of season of course , but with an exchange of winks between reciprocal sinners , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an omelette aux confitures . " Hungry ? " " Wolfish . " " It will take time but it is worth the waiting . Well have a bit of Jambon de Parme and the local yin ros ? . Ingratiating and cheering . I 've had it . " Our table overlooked the hard white road . A swarm of dusty children appeared from nowhere clamoring for pennies . The river , beyond , went tumbling through the ravine . The mountain we had descended rose thunderingly in dark-blue relief , shutting off a third of the horizon . By craning our necks we could just make out , far above us where the crags split the sky , the little cafe where we had hung . The waiter arrived . Fresh butter , the best bread in the world , the bread of France , and thin appetizing slices of my favorite hors d'oeuvre . I poured out the yin rose , tasted it , and nodded approval . Deceptive , insinuating wine that loosens tongues and puts a ripple in the laughter . " Clever of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wine ? Not bad ? " " It 's rather heady , is n't it ? " I filled her glass . " Glad you came ? " " Enormously . " She wore an ample shade hat with a filmy blue scarf , and as she sat in the grateful shadows , flushed with the zest of one to whom pleasure is rare , it was not difficult to evoke the loneliness of other days . " Cigarette ? " She lighted one and , resting her elbow on the table , looked at me approvingly . " Selfish , but I do say , I 'm frightfully glad Rosie had that co/c11 " She laughed with the high spirits of a child . " Quite a lark this for me you know . " She took up her glass and sipped it delicately . " Extraordinarily nice of you to take me on  --  yes really . " " Thought you 'd like it . " " I say , I rather fancied you were miffed about something up there . Were n't you now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ever see eye to eye . You think us emotional and we think you ice-bound . " " Oh , that story about Ratchett ? " " You English are always doing such amazing things and never want to acknowledge what you 've done . " " I think we 're shyer than you , you know . " I shook my head . " No , deeper . Frightful inhibitions . You 're afraid of your own nerves . " " I suppose we are dreadfully unsatisfactory , " she conceded . " You are . Now take your own case . You 've lived two wars . Actually lived them . You 've seen the Empire topple , you 've seen dying men by the thousands , you 've looked at them in the raw , known the worst and the best . You must have been torn to pieces by your feelings . You 've had things happen to you that come to women who live among men about to die , women like you who attract men . And yet , if you should start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my hands in empty irritation . " Of course , there 's a story about you ? " She nodded . " Oh yes , naturally . " She flicked the ashes into her cup and frowned . " Do I show it ? " " There you go ! Repression at once ! " From the restaurant a phonograph began to grind out a tinny one-step . " Are you going to ask me to dance ? That would be sweet of you . " " Will you ? " She sprang up with that animal lightness that was diaracteristic of all her motions . " I 'm dreadfully out of date . I only waltz . " " Nonsense . I can show you in a mo-ment . " She murmured something in feeble protest but her eyes said yes . I put out my arms and she came softly and quickly into them . " Smooth  --  do n't bob up or down . Glide . That 's it . Splendid . " " You 're awfully clever . " " Not at all . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records and found an old-fashioned waltz . She closed her eyes and drew closer to me . The abundant wife of the proprietor from the cornptoir watched us with a sympathetic smile ; the waiter , napkin over his arm , bobbed his head in rhythm , both trying to puzzle out the exact sentimental relation and probably both immensely puzzled . Miss Drayton did not look like the traditional Riviera femme galante or I like the needy gigolo . We whirled around the room twice , three times , while the waiter readjusted the record . Around and around , without reversing , laughing and gay , as though we were unravelling the bobbin of time , recovering the precious thread of the years . Her hair brushed against my face , her cheek came to mine as the young dance to-day . Around and around , faster and faster ! We ended with a final vertiginous spin and collapsed against the doorway , until the swaying room steadied and we could stagger back to our seats . " Oh , but you did n't reverse . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely . She understood and nodded , gulped down a full glass of the yin ros ? , her eyes sparkling and her cheeks flushed . " I know I 'm quite absurd , but I 'm irnmensely happy ! " The trout arrived , tender , young , melting in the mouth . " What made you say there was a story about me ? " I smiled wickedly . The eternal feminine . Fear of being read . " Do n't worry , you are quite safe . Even I should n't have guessed it if I had n't danced with you . " " Oh ! Is there a difference ? " " I 'm sure , " I said maliciously , " Rosie would have been quite different . " A little smile touched her lips , the instinctive triumphant smile of the woman over the virgin . The lamb arrived . " I have never seen such a wee one , " she said gazing at the gigot in amazement . " Contraband , of course . " I waved the waiter away . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in boldly , " please , please do n't perform as you did about Ratchett . " She circled her plate slowly with the tip of her fork and then looked up at me from under her eyelids . " You 're a most extraordinary person . What makes you think I shall ? " " Because we shall never meet again . " She rested her arm on the balustrade and frowned . A donkey cart went tinkling below us , the driver asleep on the piled-up bags . A touring car with insistent siren screamed past , raising a cloud of dust . " It was so long ago , " she said unconsciously repeating my phrase . " Give meanother cigarette . " She lighted it and said in a matter of fact tone , " I suppose that 's why you 've been so nice to me . Natural in a writer though . What do you think my story is ? " " Tragedy .

" Yes , I think I 'll tell you , " she said in a low voice . " It 's forgotten now , but I daresay a good many guessed it . It was Lord Karger . " She named one of the Empire 's great names and in the naming there was a conscious note of pride . " Old Tom , they call him  --  only it was n't Old Tom then  --  the Boer War you know . " " Please , please , the beginning . " " What ? Oh . Well , there was n't anything much before . Just the usual thing . You want to know how I happened to be in South Africa ? " I nodded . " Question of marrying someone I did n't want to . Usually is that , is n't it ? Quite the sensible thing to have done , looking at it now . He was thoroughly acceptable . Money of course . Sensible thing . But I was all for romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything had to be done for the brothers of course . Usual thing in England . The war got them , yes both of them . Ypres and Neuve Chapelle . We 're an old county family . Father was a younger son , barrister , stiff time making both ends meet . I daresay I was headstrong  --  Iooking at things now . Family row . I bolted . Went off on my own . That 's how I took up nursing . " " And Miss Bart ? A cousin ? " " Oh no , mates at the hospital . " The waiter came with the souffl ? and departed . I fitted the glasses . " Well , that 's how it was . We volunteered together for Cape Town . If I drink any more of this pink wine I shall be quite blotto . Do light your cigar . What time is it ? Should n't we be going ? " " I had a car sent out  --  the weaker sex you know . " " You are a scheming man . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glass and savored it . " Now that I have told you this much , I do n't suppose it makes much difference if I do go on . Well , Cape Town was a frightful mess . Transports coming in , Tommies disembarking and marching out . Enormous rush to reinforce the advance posts before the Boers started cutting them off . Exciting though . The brass hats arriving . All sorts of rumors flying about and everyone wanting to be the first out . " She finished her cigarette , ground it on her plate , and took up another but without lighting it . " Lots of liberty at first . No end of a gay time . Teas and dinners and all that sort of rubbish . Dances too . It really began at a dance . " She reflected a moment .

War had n't been declared , but of course everyone knew it was coming . Knew too we were in for a nasty go until the army could get over . He asked me to go up with him and organize the nurses . I knew what that meant  --  oh yes , really all that it meant . 1 was madly in love with him from the first . He was the sort of man who gets the women he wants , and he wanted me . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . I paid her hastily andsent her away . Miss Drayton after one glance did not notice the interruption . I waited , not daring to put a question for fear the mood of revelation might pass and she would be back behind her English inhibitions . Something of this must have passed through her mind because she looked at me with a touch of resentment and said : " I do n't know what started me telling you . It 's not like me at all you know . I suppose it 's all this pink wine we 've been having . Heady stuff . Well , I 'm going on . You 're right , we sha n't be coming in each other 's way again . Sometimes it 's easier to talk to a stranger , do n't you think ? Well , then I went up to Trefontein about a month before the war . I must say it did n't look very promising . Not more than seven hundred Tommies and as many volunteers . Everyone expected us to be flattened out in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Hold out he did though , six months  --  six months of touch and go . " " Trefontein ? Why I remember everything about it . It was one of the great defenses of the war . " " Yes , I daresay it was . But we did n't realize that then . We were just in a little spot thinking of nothing but carrying on . Lost a lot of splendid chaps . Kept me frightfully busy . Six months is a long time when you expect to be rushed at any moment . The hard thing was keeping up the spirits when the food ran low . Tom was amazingly clever at that . Invented all sorts of amusing games you know . Plays and tournaments . Luckily the Boers would n't shell us on Sunday . Their religion you know . Helped because we could play football and cricket . They did n't like that though , sacrilege . They threatened to bombard us if we did n't stop . But they did n't . It was all queer and mixed up ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next hell went loose . " " Yes , but you ? " I could not restrain my impatience . How differently a Latin would have 4.40111111111w4 told it . It was n't the siege of Trefontein that 1 was interested in . " Oh , I was no end busy running about . I told you I was in charge of the nurses . Volunteers most of them . There were some pretty stiff times . Tiring . " She reflected over my question . " I see what you mean . We were tremendously in love . He too . Oh , yes , quite . Thrilling way to live , was n't it ? Thrilling too to be at his side to know just what was going on . Yes , I did stiffen him up a bit . He would get down in the mouth at times . Fagged out , poor boy . He 'd held out so Iong , you know , he just could n't bear the thought of failing . There were lots of times when he thought the game was up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did show it to me . I did buck him up if I say so . Well , that 's the way it was . England got through to us in the end . " She tapped the cigarette nervously on the table . " Too soon . If you understand what I mean . Now give me a light , will you ? " I struck a match and leaned over . " And then ? " " That was all . " I took my head in my hands and rocked it slowly . " Oh , you English ! " " I say , what 's wrong now ? " " You tell me a romance that any woman would have given her inner soul to have lived and then you pull up and say , ' that 's all . ' " She looked at me and smiled . The smile of the disciplined race fur the emotionalism of the younger . " Odd people , you Americans . Incurably romantic ! " I was annoyed and showed it . " And everything ended like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the war ? " She frowned . " That would n't have helped , would it ? " I blurted out : " Why did n't you marry him ? What was there to prevent ? " " Oh , that is American , " she said decisively , " but I suppose that 's being awriter too . I say , you must n't make that mistake you know . I went into it with my eyes quite open . The trouble with you writers is you always want to sentimentalize a perfectly ordinary situation . You like to end up with a melodramatic scene . " " Not at all , " I said acidly . " I 'm quite sure it ended with Lord Karger saying , Steady , old thing , ' and your answering Righto . ' " She laughed at this , shook her head and laughed again . " However , " I insisted , " I do n't think it ended that way at all . " " Ah nol No , it did n't end like that , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We knew that , both of us , from the first . He belonged to England . " " You never saw him again  --  not even in London ? " " No , oddly enough , no . Well , yes  --  just once , if you could call it that . At the Victory celebration . Torn was always thinking up nice things to do and he did a particularly nice thing then for me . He took a window for us  --  a very splendid window it was too . We were among no end of swells . I daresay they were hard put to it to figure us out . You see we had the window quite to ourselves , Rosie and I. It was immensely thrilling looking down on the troops . . . " " And on Lord Karger ? " " Yes , of course . He was riding at the head of our men . It was all very grand and exciting . They made no end of fuss about him  --  as of course they should have . " She paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looked up and saluted . Dear of him , was n't it ? But he always was a dear . Rosie was quite upset . Emotional , you know . Wept . " " But not you ? " " Ah no . Not me . " We sat awhile in silence . " That was a long time ago , " she repeated as if in justification . I did not answer . I was looking out of that window , seeing the pomp and parade of victorious Britain swinging past under the flaunted flags , with all the swank that only Britain knows how to give to a Roman triumph . Great names , great regiments ; the Guards and the Lancers , the Highlanders with bagpipes playing and the rhythmic flutter of white feet and swinging arms ; the eloquent guns and the ancient battle flags over the tide of red ; and at the last a figure on horseback with lifted sword , looking up . " You 're an impossibly romantic person , " she said , looking up at me all at once , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how it was . Thanks , nothing more . " She drew her scarf tighter about her throat . The blue shadow of the mountain had crept over the golden wall and now lay at our feet . " Time to be buzzing along , do n't you think ? " We rose , made our adieu to the patron , and took seat in the waiting car . The sun was dropping fast and as we raced home , the cold shadow ran ahead of us , engulfing the countryside . I closed the windows and sank back in my corner . The obscurity deepened . Lights began to pop out along the road . Out of the darkness I heard her say : daresay you know I did n't tell all . " " We never do . " " Well , no I did n't . You writers are so clever , daresay you 've guessed . " " There was a child , " I said quickly . " A boy . Tom adopted him . That 's done a lot with us , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karger . Very sporting she was about it . Splendid woman . " I dreaded to ask the question for I fore . saw the answer . " He is alive ? " " I should hardly have told you if he were , should I ? " " The war ? " " Gallipoli . " " Oh . " " Pity too . Hard on Tom . There were no other children you see . Brilliant fellow too . Cut out for big things in the Foreign Office . But he would pick out the Flying Corps . You do n't last in that service you know . " " Not in four years . " " Exactly . " Her voice became impersonal . She was back in the ranks again , marching in that anonymity which is middle-age and security . " Now you must n't take all this too theatrically  --  no , really . Do n't try to make me out anything I 'm not . Never was maternal  --  not the least bit . Would n't have known what to do if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been . Impossible explanations . Oh , yes , I 'm immensely glad I had all that I had ; and that 's about all there is to it , do n't you see ? " Neuve Chapelle  --  Ypres  --  Gallipoli ! " You pay high for your Empire , " I blurted out . " We always have . But what can we do ? We 've got it on our hands . So we 've just got to stick it , have n't we ? "
