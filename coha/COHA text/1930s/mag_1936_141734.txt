" I propose to give you a Constitution of the type the Irish people themselves would choose if Great Britain were a million miles away . " As truculent , smoldering Eamon de Valera bit off these words before a packed assembly of his party , Fianna Fail , at the Mansion House . Dublin last week , millions of rebel Irish hearts all over the world were stirred . <P> President de Valera 's new Constitution . which would set up in the Free State a state wholly free , with the office of Governor-General abolished and all specific reference to the British Crown removed , will come before the Dail in the form of a Bill before Christmas . The Constitution contains provisions for the election directly by the people of a Chief Magistrate similar to the President of the U. S. ; for a bicameral legislature in which the new Senate would be constituted not on party lines but on a functional " corporative state ' ' basis . " We do not , however , want a Fascist Senate , " declared Mr. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " At the moment it is not our intention to change existing relations with the British Commonwealth except in so far as use is made of the same machinery utilized by Canada , New Zealand and Australia . . . . I regret our relations are no better than they were with Britain . The British Government still exacts payments through penal tariffs of a sum of money we say is not due . We do not propose to pay it . The Irish people have not surrendered , and are not going to surrender . . . . However , I am certain that this Constitution will not injure the British people but will make it possible for both peoples amicably to come together . "
