In Inside Europe , first published three years ago and since continuously revised to keep up-to-date , Correspondent John Gunther wrote a swift , popular handbook of present-day Europe . His system was to take a country , give the lives , habits and personalities of its leaders , put in a few choice anecdotes , make a few sound generalizations about the people , sketch in historical background , retell the nation 's most recent and dramatic episodes and then move on to the next country , where the same process was repeated . <P> <P> In Inside Asia , * published this week , Author Gunther tries out this technique on Asia and produces much the same kind of book : a lively , gossipy , not too profound but interesting encyclopedia of present-day Asia . Jumping-off place for Inside Europe was Germany ; Inside Asia begins with Japan . From Japan , the book takes the reader to Manchukuo , makes a brief stopover in Siberia , moves on to China and then , going south and east by way of the Philippines and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Siam , India , Afghanistan , Tibet , Nepal , Burma , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Trans-Jordan and finally Palestine . <P> The sacred Japanese Emperor leads the parade of personalities in the newest Almanac de Gunther , as the author discusses his divinity , ancestry , poetry , wealth , family and advisers . After that , among many others , come the venerable , 89-year-old Prince Saionji , last of the Genro ; jingoistic Baron Kuchiro Hiranuma , who as Premier has an **34;3216;TOOLONG house ; aristocratic former Premier Prince Fumimaro Konoye , who has made a " cult of languor " ; Lieut. - General Seishiro Itagaki , most prominent member of the Army 's radical Kwantung Clique , who conquered and now rules Manchukuo ; the fabulously rich men who own the Houses of Mitsui , Mitsubishi , Sumitomo , Yasuda and Okura , firms that control 62% of the total wealth of Japan ( Mr. Gunther calls them " Men of Yen " ) ; Emperor Kang Teh ( formerly Henry Pu-yi ) of Manchukuo , " least consequential monarch on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunther remembers a Tokyo night-club sign in English : WINE WOMEN SONG AND WHATNOT .

Panay when it was bombed and sunk by the Japanese , kept repeating all evening : " Panay ! Panay ! So sorry ! So sorry ! " Typical Japanese Army reasoning : Capitalism is responsible for communism , hence to defeat communism capitalism must be overthrown . Author Gunther also picked up a warning that the Japanese are capable of committing hara-kiri on a national as well as individual scale : the more inextricably Japan becomes involved in China the more likely it is that Japan will deliberately attack a stronger enemy and go down blazingly to defeat in a first-class war .
