These Three ( Samuel Goldwyn ) . When Producer Samuel Goldwyn paid $40,000 for the screen rights to Lillian Hellman 's famed play , The Children 's Hour , the Hays organization had a mild attack of frenzy . The Children 's Hour relates the case of two young schoolteachers whose lives are wrecked when one of their pupils accuses them of Lesbianism . This seemed to the guardians of the cinema industry 's morals so appalling that they not only banned both the title of the play and its plot but refused to allow Producer Goldwyn even to announce that he had bought such a thing . <P> Last week Miss Hellman 's adaptation of her own play made the perturbation of the Hays organization look as silly as it made Producer Goldwyn look shrewd . In the screen version the rumor charges one of the teachers with normal rather than abnormal misbehavior . This trivial change strengthens rather than weakens the story , makes it entirely fit for the consumption of all cinemaddicts with the most rudimentary knowledge of the facts of life . Brilliantly directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Three remains on the screen what The Children 's Hour is on the stage-a calmly bloodcurdling investigation of what several honorable adults can suffer at the untender mercies of one dishonorable child . <P> Martha Dobie ( Miriam Hopkins ) and Karen Wright ( Merle Oberon ) open a school for girls in an old house Karen has inherited from her grandmother . Young Dr. Joseph Cardin ( Joel McCrea ) helps them and falls in love with Karen . One of her grandmother 's acquaintances , Mrs. Tilford , befriends them by sending her little granddaughter , Mary ( Bonita Granville ) , to their school and recommending it to her friends . Mary Tilford , shrewd , neurotic and remorseless , hates schools in general and this one in particular . One night she hears a strange noise in Martha 's room , and from then on all the cards are in her hands . She whispers to her grandmother that Martha is up to tricks with Karen 's fianc . Old Mrs. Tilford feels bound to tell the parents of other girls . The school goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in the sudden horror of the situation , Karen begins to wonder if the story might be true . Even when Martha finally proves the lie , it is too late to do much good . <P> These Three may presage a year in which child actresses will provide their own antidote to Shirley Temple and , barring the unforeseeable , should win Author Hellman next year 's Academy prize for adaptation . In the part that 25-year-old Florence McGee plays on the stage , solemn nervous Bonita Granville , 13 , makes herself as odious as any little girl who has yet appeared in cinema . Among the other children concerned , major acting honors in These Three go to plump little Marcia Mae Jones , as Rosalie , Mary Tilford 's unwilling accomplice . Good shot : Mary blackmailing Rosalie into corroborating her baseless story by threatening to accuse her of stealing . <P>
