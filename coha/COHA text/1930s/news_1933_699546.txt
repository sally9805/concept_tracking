txt With only the slightest popular recognition , a legal reform believed to have far-reaching consequences has just passed Congress in a bill giving the Supreme Court authority to " prescribe the rules of practice and pro , - cedure with respect to proceedings in criminal cases in the federal courts after verdicts of guilty . " Behind this legal phra , se is the expectation that the Supreme Court will soon sweep into discard one of the oldest and most flagrant abuses in the Airierican system of justice , the long delay of convicted persons to serve their sentences , wile they are out on bail , or pending an appeal . Records of criminal cases in federal courts show that often as much as from one to five years may elapse after the verdict of guilty before the judgment is finally affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals , and the convicted person finally goes to jail . Meanwhile , he has often been allowed to go on bail , thus losing all incentive to expedite his own appeal . The long delays in the interim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trial courts , in making motions for new trials , in preparing narrative statements of the evidence , bills of exception and %he- like , which  --  too often in American justice  --  have left guilty persons go at large in the populace . Congress some time ago gave the federal courts the right to regulate their own procedure in equity cases , altifough state courts are still generally rigidly bound by the prescribed iules imposed by local legislatures . Many critics of the United States courts do not understand that delays ate often due to compliance with rules imposed by legislatures quite beyond the court 's Rower to remedy ; unlike the English method where the courts have power to run their own houses . The Supreme Court has long since adopted rules for its own procedure , which put an end to delays in criminal cases , and there is every reason now to expect that it will end the long standing abuse in the lower federal courts . The bill just passed was drafted by the Attorney-General , Mr , William D. Mitchell .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
