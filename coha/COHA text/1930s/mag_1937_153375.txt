The first week of New York 's Metropolitan Opera traditionally gives debutant singers an occasion to be heard , boxholders an occasion to be photographed , critics an occasion to be lenient . Critics did not have to be lenient when , on Dec. 21 , Manager Edward Johnson opened the season with a rattling good performance of Die Walkure . They were unable to be anything but enthusiastic when , two days later , Kirsten Flagstad sang Isolde with the miraculous freshness they had learned to expect from her . They were grateful to Manager Johnson for brushing up the ragged Met orchestra . When he began last fortnight to put on some of his second-string operas , critics sharpened their pencils and found cause for complaint . <P> Much of the complaint fell upon the pretty Belgian head of Vina Bovy , the coloratura soprano who stepped into the part of Gilda in Rigoletto 24 hours before the performance when Stella Andreva caught a cold . Critics had liked her better four days earlier when she made her Metropolitan debut singing Violetta in Verdi 's La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pitch . In Rigoletto her colorless , inexact rendition of the great Caro Nome and her literal , lifeless acting convinced few that she was the outraged , unhappy daughter of a court fool . Lawrence Tibbett was more imaginative as her hunchback father , used his strong baritone with an accuracy that seemed almost reproving . <P> The record was not improved by a performance of Delibes ' Lakm . New Conductor Maurice de Abravanel tortured this suave , tuneful music into Wagnerian thunder . Vina Bovy , cast as the Hindoo maid , remained Vina Bovy and gave little support to Basso Leon Rothier who made Nilakantha piteous with his fits of love and fury . Not till the middle of the week brought a competent Ada and a warm , vivid Faust in French did critics feel confidence in Director Johnson 's French &; Italian wings . <P> When Rigoletto was repeated last week . Soprano Bovy proved that she could sing truly if not more evenly , but she still seemed pathetically unequal to Tibbett . A German opera saved the week from mediocrity , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in five years . Save for Hans Clemens , who sang the Steersman in the last production , all the principals were new to the Metropolitan in their parts . Flagstad took the role of Senta for the first time in her career and made it unforgettable . Warmest praise went to Baritone Friedrich <P> Schorr who sang the woe of the ghostly captain with such feeling one could well believe he was doomed to sweep across the seas forever until a girl 's love would win him rest .
