Two LIVING AND ONE DEAD-Sigurd Christiansen-Liveright ( $2.50 ) . <P> Just so much grit in so many gear-boxes are most themes in most novels . A brilliant exception to this rule is Author Christiansen 's Inter-Scandinavian prize novel Two Living and One Dead . So dextrously is its theme amalgamated with its characters that readers will find it impossible to formulate the one without telling the whole story of the others . <P> When two armed bandits walk one evening into the city post office , Kvisthus , one of the clerks left on duty , is killed . Clerk Lydersen. in a panic , throws himself on one of the bandits , is knocked out . Clerk Berger , who has had time to think , when faced with two revolvers thinks some more , hands over his cash box finally . The bandits escape , and Clerk Berger 's troubles begin . The police commissioner , the newspaper , everybody accuse him of cowardice . Berger knows that he was no coward , that he had done the only sensible thing , but even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shown fight only because of panicky surprise , becomes a hero , scorns Berger with the rest . Only one man , Rognaas , a fellow lodger of Lydersen 's , makes mock of his heroism , tells him that Berger was the only sensible one of the three . <P> When Lydersen is given a post office promotion over Berger 's head , in deep chagrin Berger gets himself transferred to Oslo . After years of desperate loneliness he chums up with a man who turns out to be Rognaas , the only man ever to take his side . At the height of their intense friendship Rognaas confesses that he was one of the bandits ; his story absolves Berger of any taint of cowardice . But Berger can not tell on his friend , even to justify himself to the whole world . Instead , he hits on a plan to justify himself to Lydersen , his chief antagonist , who has by now become a postmaster . On the evening when post office receipts are reckoned up , Berger calls at Lydersen 's office . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority over Berger , Berger suddenly draws a gun . Staring at death , Lydersen hands over the post office money . Then , smiling , Berger puts down the money and the unloaded gun . Vindicated at least in Lydersen 's eyes , Berger returns happily to his wife , who , in naive admiration , wonders where he got the courage to play so desperate a trick . <P> The Author . Since 1915 a clerk in the post office of his native city , Drammen , Author Christiansen has had long to wait for anything more satisfying than critical acclaim . His first novel The Victor won the critics , sold only a few hundred copies . Subsequent plays and novels got high praise , but sales stayed low . Now all Scandinavia is reading Two Living and One Dead . Flawless in outline , crystal-clear as a Norwegian icicle , it deals with psychological subtleties at high tension with almost miraculous precision , without any witchcraft other than an immaculate literary conscience and a knifelike style .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
