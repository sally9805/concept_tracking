Man has been breathing with lungs for a million years . Men have been studying the lungs 's physiology for nearly 5.000 years . But not until Radiologist Alfred Ernest Barclay* took to blowing bismuth and powdered glass down the windpipes of cats was one of the lungs 's important protective devices thoroughly studied . Last week his findings were published in the American Journal of Roentgenology . <P> At Oxford 's Nuffield Institute for Medical Research , Dr. Barclay has recently explored the uttermost crannies of the living lungs . Notable result was a complete description of " the normal escalator action " by which the lungs constantly expel dry dust that is inhaled . Dr. Barclay made his observations on the lungs of anesthetized cats , which breathe at 30 respirations a minute ( almost as slowly as man ) . <P> The walls of most of the throat , of the windpipe and its branches ( bronchi and bronchioles ) are covered with fine , threadlike filaments called cilia , which continually move , waving their tips with an upward motion . When bismuth powders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anesthetized cats , Dr. Barclay and his associates found that the dust in dry form remained in the windpipe and its branches , never penetrating into the little sacs ( alveoli ) which absorb oxygen from the air and eliminate carbon dioxide from the blood . They could see by X-ray the foreign particles moving from the base of the lungs up &; out . The movement they discovered was spiral and ( viewed from above ) clockwise . Particles traveled 1 inches per minute within a cat 's windpipe . When administered in oil or other fluids , the particles quickly reached the alveoli , were not completely excreted except over a period of weeks . The researchers found that the cilia , to remove dust effectively , must be covered with a " blanket " of mucus . The cilia kept this mucus moving up &; out of the lungs all the time . <P> Significant for human beings who live in dusty cities , especially for those who work in dusty factories , mills or mines , were the conclusions of Dr. Barclay &; associates . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute amounts that are inhaled in the most dusty atmospheres , provided the subject is given an adequate rest period away from these atmospheres . " But people who live in damp and dirty cities have no such assurance , because ' ' it seems possible that a moist atmosphere might tend to agglomerate particles of suitable dusts , and turn them into a semifluid , which could interfere with ciliary action .
