Room Service ( by John Murray &; Allen Boretz ; George Abbott , producer ) does for shoestring theatrical producing what Producer Abbott 's Boy Meets Girl did for Hollywood and his Three Men On A Horse did for horse racing . It pumps its subject full of fun in veterinary doses . Than this pinchbeck legend of Longacre Square , there is no funnier show in town . <P> Veteran theatre people and veteran theatre goers will particularly relish the venality , innocence , hope and cynicism of such a character as Gordon Miller ( Sam Levene ) , who once produced a great show on a sidewalk between two No Parking signs and is now trying like a man possessed to produce another from a double room in the White Way Hotel . His initial handicap lies in the fact that he has already run up a bill for $1,200 and is about to be evicted . Lacking costumes and scenery , his cast starving , his author ( Eddie Albert ) about to be lured by another producer , his backer a jittery character from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check , Gordon Miller falters but never quite loses his show or his senses of duplicity and humor . <P> As interpreted by Actor Levene , the leading role of Room Service is a brutal assault on most spectators ' funny bones . There is the time , for instance , when he and his director ( Philip Loeb ) have gone 18 hours without food , the White Way having discontinued room service . Actor Loeb , a master of comic finality , declares that he is seeing spots . " No , " he corrects himself , ' ' it 's hamburgers . " <P> " If you see one with onions , " asks Actor Levene , " save it for me . " <P> When food is at last sneaked them by a waiter ( Alexander Asro ) who has been promised a part in their show , Mr. Loeb , after the most voracious eating scene since Mclntyre &; Heath in The Ham Tree , amiably suggests that a small part be written in for the chef . In addition to the mortal drolleries of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the continual reappearance of a man from the We Never Sleep Collection Agency who is trying to repossess a typewriter , an elk 's head which the director loyally refuses to pawn and two stuffed owls . There are also a frantic and shirtless stage manager , a great penultimate fake deathbed scene which keeps Miller and almost everyone else from being taken to jail for fraud and forgery . Critical consensus is that Room Service will be notable for long life as well as long laughs .
