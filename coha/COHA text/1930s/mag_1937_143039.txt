Goober Cox <P> Sirs : Strange that TIME Aug. 23 , in its passion for nicknames would have missed one so colorful as that applied by Washington newshawks to Congressman Edward Eugene Cox of Georgia . For his friendship for peanuts , which TIME did mention , Congressman Cox is dubbed " Goober . " There 's very little pretense about " Goober . " He 's sincere and frequently speaks his mind . That 's why he 's popular with Washington correspondents . His suite in the House Building retains much of the flavor of the small town lawyer 's office . Pants which are obviously in the midst of being carried personally to the presser drape the backs of chairs . Country weeklies from Georgia are piled here and there , and " Goober " is none too concerned with House(office)keeping . But let no one , because of these oddities in Congressman Cox 's make up , presume that he is not abreast of the times and that he is not an able legislator . WILLIAM E. GROSE Jackson Heights , N.

Calif . P. S. Do you see the " ghost " On the Pacific Coast ? <P> Spit- &-Image; <P> Sirs : Your ' ' spitting image " ( TIME , Aug. 30. p. 11 ) , which is meaningless , should have been " spit an ' image . " You doubtless have interpreted what you have heard " spittin ' image , " and , being punctilious , have supplied the g . You may supply the d for an ' , too , if you wish . Saliva , like blood , breath , etc. , has been regarded , by many peoples of the world , as having supernatural potency , and , of course , intimately associated with one 's being . In the folk-mythology of both hemispheres , saliva is often associated with conception . It is reported that among the Gypsies a woman who wishes to have a child will drink water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' image " is , in all probability , to be traced back to a mystical notion of this sort .
