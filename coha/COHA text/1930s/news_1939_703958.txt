txt William F. , fornler assistant to District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan of Brooklyn , pleaded guilty yesterday to four separate charges involving " fixing " of criminal cases and immediately afterward Special Prosecutor John Harlan Amen revealed that , under a promise of " proper considera- , tion , " had agreed to give information concerning official corruption in Kings County . 's unexpected move was regarded as giving tremendous impetus to the investigation of the administration of criminal justice in Brooklyn in view of the fact that in his seven years as a key assistant district attorney he had knowledge of the confidential office affairs of Mr. Geoghan and the office 's relations with the Police Department and the criminal courts in that borough . His information on these matters is now available to Mr. Amen . 's plea makes him the first member of the Kings County District Attorney 's office ever to stand guilty of official corruption charges , though rumors of general misconduct in that department have formed the basis of public criticism for years .

Amen Expects Much Aid Asked if he expected to turn State 's evidence , Mr. Amen replied : " I certainly assume so and I hope and believe that he is telling everything he knows . " The special prosecutor admitted that had made several statements in the last two weeks , but declined as a matter of policy to say whether had appeared before the extraordinary grand jury , adding , however : " You can say that Mr. expressed a willingness to go before the grand jury . " Mr. Amen said he was " very much satisfied " with the statements already made by and added : " I believe that he has told the truth so far .

In view of yesterday 's development , however , it was considered likely that the special prosecutor already had undovered instances of possible official corruption in that department that required either corroboration or amplification from an " official " source . Asked if he would provide a guard for , Mr. Amen replied : " He will have no protection unless he wants it and he can have all the protection he wants . " Yesterday 's guilty plea by came on the heels of a public demand made on Monday by Louis . Waldman , Brooklyn attorney and leader in the American Labor party , that Mr. Geoghan either re- sign or be removed from office on the ground that he must assume responsibility for the conduct of his staff assistants and that the recent indictment of two of his assistants represented a " complete breakdown " of his administration .

Mr. Geoghan was asked to comment on rumors in downtown Brooklyn that he was about to resign . The District Attorney 's face flushed slowly and then he threw ' back his head and laughed loudly . " What book did you get that out of ? " he demanded . " That sounds as though it were right out of Joe Miller 's joke book . It 's ridiculous . " Mr. Geoghan was then reminded that " certain groups might argue that you are responsible for the conduct of your assistants " and was asked again if he cared to comment on the day 's general developments . " Well , one of Attorney General Bennett 's assistants was indicted by Mr. Amen for accepting $13,000 in bribes , " Mr. Geoghan . replied . " Why do n't they ask him the same question ?
