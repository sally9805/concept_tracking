WATER NEVER HURT A MAN A STORY BY WALTER D. EDMONDS H E TRUDGED with his hands tight fists in his pockets , his head bowed to the wind and rain . Ahead of him in the darkness , so that he could hear the squdge of their hoofs , the towing team bowed their necks against the collars . He could not see them in the darkness . When he lifted his face the rain cut at his eyes ; and when lightning split the darkness he shut his eyes tight and pulled his head closer into his coat collar , waiting blindly for the thunder . Once in a lull he looked back . He could barely make out the bow lantern and the arrows of gray rain slanting against it . Between him and the light he caught glimpses of the tow rope , dipped slightly between the team 's heaves , and the roughened water in the canal . Somewhere back of the light his father stood by the rudder-sweep , his beard curled and wet , his eyes slits , sighting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie-by for the night , wanted to be in the bunk with his head buried in the friendly , musty smell of the blanket , where the storm could not reach him . He had gone back once , but his father had reached for his belt , saying , " Go on back . Watter never hurt a man . It keeps his hide from cracking . " John had gone back to the team . They did not need his guidance . But it was his place to keep the rope from fouling if a packet boat coming theirway signalled to pass . He was afraid of his father at night , afraid of the big belt and strong hands with hair on the fingers over the knuckles . He caught up with the plodding horses and let the rain have its way . At each stroke of lightning his small back stiffened . It was his first year on the canal and he was afraid of storms at night . He had been proud that spring when his father said , " John 's old enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Baccortula . " He had showed his dollar to his brothers and sisters , first pay in advance , and his father had bought him a pair of cowhide boots from the cobbler when he came to the village . Later , when the frost was out of the mud , John would go barefoot . He was proud of his father . In Westernville , with other small boys , he had heard the dock loafers talking about his father , George Brace , bully of the Black River Canal . In some strange way they had news of every fight his father fought a day after it happened . " George licked the Amsterdam Bully Wednesday mornin ' . Lock fifty-nine . It tuk nineteen min-its only . " " George is a great hand . Them big ditch bezabors is learning about George . " A stranger had said , " Wait till Buffalo Joe meets up with him . " There was silence then . Buffalo Joe Buller , he was bully of the western end of the Erie . A pea-souper , a Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he licked them he marked them with his boot in the Canadian style . It had a cross of nails to mark the beaten man 's face . " You wail , " said the stranger . Little John , listening then , felt shivers down his back . But now , with the wind and rain , and the lightning tumbling the clouds apart , he forgot . They were on the long haul westward , to Buffalo , with plows aboard , full drafted in Rome . They had had to leave three hundred weight on the dock . He felt his muddy boots slip in the towpath . He heard the squelching of the horses . Squelch-squelch , a steady rhythm as they kept step . Once the lightning caught his eyes ; and he had a clear view of trees beyond the canal-side meadow , their budded twigs bent down , Like old women with their backs to the storm , and the flat , sharp wall of a canal house , sixty yards behind him . He had not even seen it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck . It crept farther , bit by bit , with a cold touch . He could feel his fists white in his pockets from clenching them . His legs ached with the slippery going . They had bad supper at six , tied up by the bank , and John had eaten his plate of beans . He had felt sleepy afterward , barely noticing his father 's big body bent over the dishpan . It was warm in the cabin , with the little stove roaring red hot , and his small hat hanging beside his father 's cap on the door . He had been almost asleep when his father 's hand shook him roughly , then tumbled him from his chair . " Get out , John . Them plows we 've got has to get west for spring plowing . We 'll pick up Bob in Syracuse , then we 'll have a better chance to rest . Get out now , " and he had reached for his belt . What did John care for the old plows anyway ? But it had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witha tired sense of importance . One had to keep freight moving on the old Erie . The old Bacconota always made fast hauls . He had been proud and shouted in a high voice to the tired horses and kicked one with his new boots . But now he did not care about the plows . He wished the crazy old Bacconola would spring a leak in her flat bottom , so they would have to stop till the hurry-up boat came along and patched her up . He thought of her now , bitterly , with her scabs of orange paint . " Crummy old blister , " he called her to himself and made names to himself , which he said aloud to the horses in a shrill voice . He was only twelve , with all the bitterness of twelve , and the world was a hateful thing . " God damned old crummy bitch of a tub . . . " But the lightning caught him , and his throat tightened and he wanted to cry out under the thunder . A water rat went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced up to see a team on the opposite towpath heading east . " Hey , there ! " yelled the driver in a hoarse vaiee ; but John was too tired to answer . He liked to yell back in the daytime and crack his whip . But lie had dropped his whip a while back . He would get a licking for that in the morning . But he did n't care . To hell with the whip and the driver and Pa . " Hey , there ! " shouted the other driver , a voice in the rain . " All right , all right , you dirty pup . Eat rain , if you want to and go drownd . " The rain took the voice , and the boat came by , silently , noiseless as oil , with its bow light a yellow touch against the rain . The steersman gave a toot upon the horn , but the sound bubbled through the water in it , and the steersman swore . They were still on the long level , alone once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the lock would show . In Syracuse Bob would come . He took turns driving and steering and cooking  --  a little man with a bent shoulder who had dizzy spells once in a while . At the lock John could sit down and rest and listen to the tender snarling at his sluices while the boat went down , and heaving at his gate beam , while John 's father heaved against the other . He was crazy , the lock-keeper was ; all lock-keepers were crazy . John 's father always said so . John had seen a lot of them in their week of hauling , but he did not see why they were crazy . They looked no different even if they were . He hoped the lock-keeper would be asleep , so it would take a while to wake him . Squelch , squelch-squelch , squelch . The horses kept plodding . Sudden/3 ! John caught a break in the rhythm . One foot sounded light . He pushed his way up beside them against the wind and laid a wet hand against a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and wet , and he got a smell of sweat . Yes , he could feel the of horse limping . Hope filled him . He waited till the boat came up where he was , a small figure , shrunk with cold . The boat 's bow , round and sullen , slipped along , the bow light hanging over and showing an old mullein stalk in silhouette against the water . " Pa ! " His voice was thin against the wind . He saw his father 's figure , rain dripping from the visor of his cap , straight and big , almighty almost , breast to the wind . " Pa ! " The head turned . " Hey , there ! What you ( loin ' ? Get on back ! Or soap you proper . " " Pa ! Prince has got a limp in his front foot . Pa ! " The voice turned hoarse with passion , " Get on back , you little pup . Fifty-nine 's just round the next bend . Take your whip and tar him . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a bare moment he thought of staying still and letting the boat pass on . He would run away and join the railroad . He would get run over by an engine there , just when things went well , and they would be sorry . He started to draw himself a picture of his body coming home in a black box , and his mother crying , and his father looking t , hained and sorry , and then the lightning made a blue flare and he saw the straight figure of his father ahead , on the Baceonola , which seemed struck still , a pill-box in the flat country , and he was afraid and went running desperately , hoping he could get back to the team before he was missed . He caught the horses on the bend and , lifting his face to the storm , saw the lock lanterns dimly ahead . And even then his ears caught , coming up behind him , the harsh blast of a tin horn . He looked back and saw a light , two rope lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , he saw that it was creeping up . " John ! " His father 's voice beat down the sound of rain . " Lay into them brutes and beat into the lock ! " He could imagine his father glaring back . If only he had not dropped his whip . He would have liked to ask his father for the big bull whip that cracked like forty guns , but he knew what would happen if he did . He shrieked at the horses and fumbled for a stone to throw . But they had heard and recognized the note in his father 's voice , and they were bending earnestly against the collars . A sudden excitement filled John as his father 's born rang out for the lock . The wind took the sound and carried it back , and the other boat 's horn sounded a double toot for passing . John yelled shrilly . The horses seemed to stand still , and there was an odd effect in the rain of the canal sliding under them inch by inch laboriously , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes crept at them out of the rain , and the lights of the lock did not seem to stir . Then John heard the squelching of the team behind his back . Little by little they were coming up , past the Bacconola , until he could hear them panting through the rain , and saw them close behind , behind dim puffs of steamy breath . He watched them frantically . Then the lightning came once more , a triple bolt , and the thunder shook him , and when he opened his eyes once more , he saw the lock lanterns a hundred yards ahead . At that instant the driver of the boat behind yelled , " Haw ! " and the following team swung across his towrope , and they were snarled . The horses stopped of themselves , shuddering . They were old hands , and knew enough not to move , for fear of being thrown from the towpath . The boats came drifting on , placidly as water-logged sticks . The light of the following boat showed a dark bow coming up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow light of the other boat , a tall , clean-shaven man as big as his father crouched to jump ashore . Then both boats came in by the towpath , and both men jumped . They made no sound except for the thump of their shoes , but John saw them dim against the lantern light , their fists coming at each other in slow , heavy swings . The strange team was panting close beside him , and he did not hear the blows landing . There was a pushing upward in his chest , which hurt , and his fists made small balls in the pockets of his trousers . The other boater and his father were standing breast tobreast , their faces still , cut , stonelike things in the yellow light , and the rain walling them in . He saw his father lift his hand , and the other man slip , and he would have yelled , for all his cold , if the lightning had not come again , so blue that his eyes smarted . He doubled up , hiding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the shoulder . " A little puny girly boy , " said a voice . " I would n't lick you proper ! Not a little girly baby like you . But I 'll spank you just to learn you to let us come by ! " John opened his eyes to see a boy , about his own height but broader built , squinting at him through the rain . " Take off your pants , dcaric , " said the boy in a mock voice , digging in his fingers till John winced . " Joe Buller can handle your Captain smart enough . Me , I 'll just paddle you to learn you . " John , looking up , was afraid . He did not know what to do , but without warning his hands acted for him , and he struck at the square face with all his might . A pain shot up his arm , making his elbow tingle , and the boy fell back . John could feel the surprise in that body stock still in the rain , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and be tried to run . But the other boy jumped on his back . They went down flat in the mud , the older boy on John 's shoulders , pummeling him till his head sang , and forcing his face into the track , and crying , " Eat it , you lousy little skunk . Eat it , cat it , eat it , eat it , " John could taste the mud in his mouth , with a salty taste , and he began to squirm , twisting his head to escape the brown suffocation . He heaved himself behind , throwing the boy unexpectedly forward , twisted round , and kicked with all his might . The boy yelled and jumped back on him . And again they went down , this time the boy bent seriously to business . And this time John realized how it was to be hurt . At the third blow something burst loose in his inside and he screamed . He was crying madly . The other boy was heavier , but John squirmed over on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face he caught it in both his own and bit with all the strength of his jaws . The hand had a slippery , muddy taste , but in a second it was warm in his mouth , and there was a sick , salt warmth on his tongue . The boy struck him once in the eyes and once on the nose , but John held on and bit . Then the boy howled and tore loose and ran back . There was another stroke of lightning , and John saw him doubled up , holding his hand to his mouth ; and he got stiffly up , turned his back to the thunder and saw his father bent over the other boater , taking off his shoe . John walked up to them . His father 's face was bleeding a trickle of blood from the right eye into his beard , but he was grinning . " I 'll take his boot for a souvenir , " he said . " How 'd you come out , Johnny ? " " Oh , pretty good . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said John , examining the fallen man . He lay half stunned , by the water 's edge , a smooth , big man , with frightened , pale eyes . And one crumpled arm was in the water . John 's father looked at the man and then at the boot he had in his hand . " I 'd ought to mark him by the rights of it ; but he ai n't worth the work , the way he laid down . Who 'd ever know his name was Buller ? " Buller . . John gazed up admiringly at his big father and studied how the blood ran from the outer corner of the eye and lost its way in the black beard , which the rain had curled . his father had licked the western bully proper . " Hey , there ! " The hail came in a thin , cracking voice . Turning , they saw the lock-keeper , white-bearded , peering at them from under the battered umbrella he held with both hands against the wind . The tails of his nightshirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there , you . There 'll be some down boats by pretty quick , so you want to hurry along now , while the level 's right . " John was aware of his father standing looking down at him . " Shall we tic-by where we be ? " asked his father . John felt pains coming into the back of his neck where he had been pummeled , and his knuckles ached . " We can stay here a spell , " said his father . " The storm 's cumin ' on again . There 'll be bad lightnin ' I make no doubt . " As he spoke there came a flash , and John whirled to see if the other driver buy was still visible . He was proud to see him sitting by the towpath , nursing his hurt hand . John did not notice the thunder . He was elaborating a sentence in his mind . He made a hole in the mud with the toe of his boot , spat into it , and covered it , the way he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , " he said , in his high voice , eying the old Bacconola , " I guess them poor bezabor farmers will be wantin ' them plows for the spring plowing , I guess . " " Me , I 'm kind of tuckered , " said his father , raising his shoulders to loose the wet shirt off his back . " And the rain 's commencing too . " John said importantly , " Watter never hurt a man , it keeps his hide from cracking . " His father jumped aboard . He took his horn and tooted it for the lock . John ran ahead and put back the other boat 's team and cried to their own horses to go on . They took up the slack wearily , and presently little ripples showed on the Bacconola 's bow , and the lantern showed the shore slipping back . On the stern , George Brace blew a blast for the lock . The old lock-keeper was standing by the sluices , drops of water from his beard falling between his feet . The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahead , the team and the boy left the lantern light and entered once more the darkness . The rope followed . And once more the Bacconola was alone with its own lantern . Presently , though , in a stroke of light , George saw his son beside the boat . " What 's the matter ? Hey , there ! " he asked . " Say , Pa ! Will you chuck me your bull whip here ashore ? Them horses is getting kind of dozey . They need soaping proper . " " Where 's your whip ? " " I guess I left it a while back . I guess it was in that kind of scrummage we had . I guess it needs a heavier whip anyhow . I guess a man could n't spare the time going back for it . " " Sure , " said George . He reached down and took it from its peg , recoiled it , and tossed it ashore . The boat went ahead , slowly , with a sound of water , and of rain falling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17HEY told me not to go back to your desolate chamber . - I-  " Now that she is gone and is laid away and is dead , The terrible silence will pour into your spirit . There is nothing more to be done . Do not go , " they said . But I returned to that sealed room under the moon and stars . There was no silence there for me , but a voice that I one time knew . I found no aching emptiness . " They were mistaken , " I said . For the room breathed and whispered and sang . It was full of You .
