Spriest of all financial oldsters is a testy , box-jawed Bostonian named Frederick Henry Prince , who is , among other things , the money behind Chicago 's smelly Stock Yard and the Board Chairman of Armour &; Co . Last week two big newspapers , the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune , carried a story about Financier Prince : that in view of his approaching ( Nov. 24 ) 80th birthday , he would not stand for reelection to the chairmanship of Armour . The explanation given , that a younger man would be able to devote more time to the company 's management , was plausible enough , since Prince has scarcely set foot in the U. S. in a twelvemonth . <P> But at week 's end came a trumpeting cable from Biarritz , France , to Prince 's New York office . Deny that rumor ! He was in excellent health . He would be home in a month to see about this . Armour stockholders were set to wondering whether this January there would be another meeting as rowdy as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up effective ( 5% ) control of the stock , first landed the chairmanship . <P> Politically cynical ( " Share the wealth ? A very amusing proposal " ) , he got that way either by being the son of a Boston politician ( Democratic Mayor ) or by amassing a fortune before he was 30 , after dropping out of Harvard in his second year . <P> Many another claim to fame has Financier Prince . Among them : he boasts that at various times he has owned 46 different railroads , that he has built four , that at the height of his operations he was good for $20,000,000 personal credit ; he is reported to have refused $50,000,000 for his Chicago holdings , and to have been one of the few to liquidate before the 1929 crash ; his son , Norman Prince ( strictly forbidden to fly by F. H. ) was a leader in organizing the famed Lafayette Escadrille , was killed in action ; in 1934 , he bought the big sloop Weetamoe for the America 's Cup defense , was soundly beaten by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pau , France , he owns a Paris town house , the $2,000,000 " Marble Palace " in Newport , R. I. , the 1,000-acre , many-roomed " Princemere " in Pride 's Crossing , Mass. ; in 1933 he offered to Franklin Roosevelt a plan for reorganizing U. S. railroads into seven regional systems , for a claimed saving of $743,000,000 annually , saw it thrown out because it would involve firing thousands of railroad employes ; in 1934 he paid some $15,000 damages for clopping behind the ear with a polo mallet an aged riding master who had ridden him off the ball in a pick-up polo match .
