From the Quai d'Orsay to the Place des Invalides the street lamps were on , shining wanly through black shrouds of crepe . As if to make up for official negligence that may have cost the old gentleman his life , the entire distance was lined with steel-helmeted soldiers , elbow to elbow . Six feet behind this first line was a second line of Republican Guards , with a row of plainclothes detectives stationed between the two . Thus last week did France bury her great Foreign Minister , Louis Barthou . All the diplomats who stood bareheaded under the grey sky , all the regiments that marched past the flag-draped gun carriage , all the black crowd that stretched away for blocks had but one idea : Louis Barthou and Alexander of Jugoslavia would not have been shot down last fortnight in Marseilles if police had taken proper precautions ; * Louis Barthou would not have died if a flustered bystander had placed the temporary tourniquet above instead of below the wound in his arm . Premier Doumergue pronounced the funeral oration : " Lift up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us bar the route to the powers of evil that are loosened everywhere and doing the work of death . Remember always that this man who has laid down his life fell at a moment when he was seeking to assure the peace of the world . . . . But if good international work is to be done there must first be good national work , and that can only be secured by union . Disunited peoples are weak , and weak peoples are a prey and a danger . " With his voice breaking , little Gaston reached his climax : " To desire peace is not to obtain it . Let us oppose to passion our will for peace , but let us support it with an unbreakable resolution to hold force in check whenever it is not in the service of right . " Reporters who have seen many state funerals in Paris in the past five years , noted one novelty : three figures in long white sheepskin coats carrying a wooden box . They were Rumanian peasants , come to scatter Rumanian earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumania since last summer ( TIME , July 9 ) . Hardly had the crowds streaked off to their homes than the Doumergue Cabinet took up the ugly aftermath of the assassinations . Obvious problem was to find a new Foreign Minister , but even more pressing was a clean-up of the French police . In command of this force and hence morally responsible for what happened at Marseilles was the Minister of the Interior , grey , fleshy-faced Albert Sarraut . Even before Barthou was laid away in the Pre Lachaise Cemetery , Minister Albert Sarraut stepped quickly out of the Doumergue Cabinet . That made two vacant posts to be filled . <P> Up again came the pale shadow of Alexander Stavisky , almost forgotten for a few days . France 's Minister of War is Marshal Henri Ptain . Honest and ingenuous , he is serving his first trick in a Council of Ministers and hence has little understanding of the terrific pressure , the secret wire-pulling , under which equally honest Minister of Justice Henry Cheron has attempted to conduct the Stavisky investigation . <P> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his portfolio and kindly asked if there were any further questions .
