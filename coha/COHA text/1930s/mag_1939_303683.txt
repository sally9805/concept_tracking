After a 600-mile ride by truck from Warsaw to the southeasternmost corner of what was Poland and after surviving a German bombing raid there ; after traveling by specially chartered Rumanian train to the Black Sea port of Constantsa , and after evading a German order for internment there ; after aimlessly riding the eastern Mediterranean in a Turkish boat for a week ; after a brief stop in Syria ; after traveling to France on a French naval vessel-after these weary wanderings a symbol arrived in Paris last week . It was solid and rare-gold in bars to the value of $80,000,000 . But its real value was as a symbol of the solvency of the Polish Government , whose reconstituted Cabinet received the treasure in Paris . The Cabinet announced to the world that not an ounce of the gold would go for the Government 's current expenses , but all of it would lie in reserve for restoration of a Polish currency after the restoration of a Polish country . <P> Not all Poland 's prominent refugees were as fortunate as the gold : &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72-year-old former President Ignacy Moscicki . He has applied for permission to go to Fribourg , Switzerland , where he was once a chemistry professor . The Rumanian Government would gladly have released the old President , but the German Government objected , and Rumania just now fears crossing Germany in any way . <P> &gt;Seriously ill from long recurrent lung trouble last week at Brasov , Rumanian health resort , where he is interned with other former Polish Cabinet Ministers , was former Foreign Minister Colonel Josef Beck . Suffering from a heart attack in the same house was former Minister of Commerce Antoni Roman . <P> &gt; Few high Polish officers escaped from Poland with much military honor left . Not only were men like Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz ( now also in Rumania ) criticized for their professional handling of the Polish Army , but they were roundly condemned for leaving their country while their Army was still fighting . Exception was General Casimir Sosnokowski , who led a last-ditch offensive action against the eastbound Germans near Lww even while Soviet troops approached from the other direction . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide , a Colonel Dehnel , told newsmen the story of the General 's escape : <P> A patrol having confirmed the news that the Soviet forces were marching into Poland by sighting a Soviet tank through field glasses , General Sosnokowski ordered the remnants of his Army ( 3,000 men ) to disperse hastily into small groups . Then the General , his aide and two sergeants threw away their uniforms , put on the oldest clothes they could find and started out to meet the advancing Soviet Army . The Soviet patrols merely looked upon them as humble peasants . Once they hopped a ride in a Soviet Army truck , but mostly they walked . After 13 days of sleeping by day in the woods and walking by night , they reached the Carpathian Mountains , slipped through Soviet border patrols and into Rumania . <P> Last week , General Sosnokowski had both honor and reward . The President-in-exile , Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz , successor to President Moscicki , became seriously ill , named General Sosnokowski as his successor " in case the post should become vacant before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
