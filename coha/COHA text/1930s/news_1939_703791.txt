txt Secretary Hull on Embargo His Opinion on the Joint Resolution Is Cited by Mr. Conboy To THE EDITOR OF THE Nsw YORK TIMES : . In their letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES , published in your issue of today , Charles C. Burlingham and Philip C. Jessup seek to dispose of an enactment of Congress by the pronouncement that " the conclusion is inevitable that the President believed that the law of May 1 superseded the law of Jan. 8 , as Mr. Stimson claims that it did . " If the conclusion is inevitable one would expect the Secretary of State so to regard it . If the belief of the President had been as stated , how could the Secretary of State have expressed the contrary belief ? And yet Secretary Hull is publicly on record with an unqualified declaration that if the proclamation of the President of May 1 , 1937 , were to be revoked , the act of Congress of Jan. 8 , 1937 , would still remain in effect . Change Called Unwarranted Secretary Hull wrote this in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW YORK TIMES of March 23 , 1938 . The following quotations from the Secretary 's communication will suffice to dispose of the unwarranted assumption indulged in by Messrs . Burlingham and Jessup as tothe President 's belief . Secretary Hull writes : " After careful consideration of all the facts , I am of the opinion that there has been no change in the situation in Spain such as to warrant the President in revoking his proclamation of May 1 , 1937 , prohibiting the exportation of arms , ammunition or implements of war to that country . " Furthermore , I desire to call your attention in this connection to the provisions of another joint resolution of Congress , approved Jan. 8 , 1937 , which is likewise still in force . " And , later in the same : atter . " Even if the proclamation of the President of May 1 , 1937 , were to . be revoked , the prohibition upon the export of arms , ammunition and implements of war to Spain laid down in the joint resolution of Congress approved Jan. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holds Resolution Would Stand Therefore , we have Messrs . Burlingham and Jessup urging the President to revoke the proclamation of May 1 , 1937 , on the assumption that there then will be no Spanish embargo , despite the unequivocal declaration of Secretary of State Hull that in case of such revocation the joint resolution of Jan. 8 , 1937 , " would still remain in effect . " In matters of foreign affairs the Secretary of State is at least the adviser of the Executive . The Department of State exists for the guidance of the President . The State Department prepares what proclamations the President signs . To the President 's signature is added the official signature of the Secretary of State under the words " By the President , " and the seal of the United States is affixed by the Secretary . The Secretary of State has to be aware of the obligations and the restraints to which he , as well as the President , is subject under law . As between the responsible authority of Secretary Hull , resting as it must on scrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal and unofficial opinion of these gentlemen as to what was in the mind of the President , there is no difficulty of choice .

Italy 's Treatment of Jews Recent Suicides Enumerated as Proof of " Material and Moral Suffering " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : THE NEW YORK TIMES of Jan. 30 published a Rome dispatch from Anne O'Hare McCormick on the Fascist antiSemitic campaign in which it was stated that " * " evidences of the unpopularity of the anti-Semitic policy and the half-heartedness with which it is executed can not compensate Italian Jews for the material and moral suffering inflicted on them . " In order to substantiate Mrs. McCormick 's statement may I point out some of the tragic consequences which this " material and moral suffering " has had upon some of the best Italian citizens of Jewish origin : Dr. Angelo F. Formiggini , foremost Roman publisher , who edited the Italian " Who 's Who , " the bibliographical magazine L'Italia the Scrive and the " Encyclopedia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghirlandina tower , in his native city of Modena , on Dec. 1 . In his pockets were found 30,000 lire , which he bequeathed to the poor . Colonel Segre of the First Regiment of Artillery in Vercelli ' , having been requested to resign from the Italian Army , assembled his troops , delivered a patriotic speech , kissed the Italian flag , then withdrew into his office , where he shot himself . Professor Maurizio Pincherle of the University of Bologna and president of the International School of Pediatrics was among the 200 and more Italian university professors who were dismissed in accordance with the recent racial laws . He committed suicide last December . Grand Officer Jarach , Milanese banker well known in financial circles , is the last prominent Italian Jew known to have committed suicide in the last few weeks . The number of suicides in Italy is growing alarmingly . The figure and the names of many remain a mystery , due to the fact that Fascist newspapers are not allowed to publish obituaries of Jews . Colonel Segre 's was published because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his division . The plight of Italian Jews at the moment is very serious because they have few or no connections abroad ; moreover , Italians can not help them or even express sympathy without risking imprisonment on charges of z new offense termed " pietismo . " A few weeks ago a prominent Italian , a Christian , had to cross the Italian frontier for one day in order to send safely an appeal to his American friends on the behalf of hundreds of Jewish intellectuals who are in bitter moral and financial distress , and to inquire whether there exists in this country any humanitarian group or organization willing to alleviate in any possible manner the suffering of Italian Jews .

Scrutiny of Relief Is Urged General Ignorance of Problem Viewed as Cause of Unbalanced Budgets To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : With some concern I read in your paper Governor Lehman 's estimate of the State 's financial prospects . The Governor has a fine record for stating the facts with directness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate tax interests me very much because of a document I have before me . It is entitled " Municipal Problems , " by Cecil F. Bates , City Commissioner of Mobile and chairman of the Governor 's Committee on Municipal Government of the State of Alabama . This says in part : " The committee has found that still another very serious obstacle confronting municipal officials and others interested in witnessing an equitable assessment of property in all Alabama is the disintegration of the State 's property tax administrative machinery . ? * * The committee is in hearty agreement with W. Barrett Brown , fiscal consultant employed last year by the Governor of Alabama and the Alabama Bankers Association , ? * in recommending that the State maintain in an efficient condition its real property tax machinery even if currently it does not need it very much . " Naturally , New York is not Alabama , and if the latter may be more dependent on property taxes than some persons think it is , it does not inevitably follow that New York should revive that tax . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alabama and subsequent studies lead me to these comments on State government , which I think some of the Governor 's statements bear out : 1 . An increasing proportion of a State government 's activities today is represented by activities as fiscal agent for ( 1 ) the Federal Government and ( 2 ) the counties and cities . 2 . Continuing qppropriations , particularly on " turn-backs " ? State money redistributed to counties and cities  --  make it very difficult to control State budgets . 3 . Until the American people make a conscientious study of the relief problem it will be difficult really to balance budgets anywhere . Regarding that , I always come back to the comment of a group of research men who studied the cost of welfare in eight large cities and whose words I quoted in my article " Unfinished Business " last October : " * * * the people in the communities included in the study can not afford to pay for the relief expenditures now being made there " and " * * * this raises the question whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country is merely a great group of such communities and can only obtain its money from the people in these communities .

Education for ' Three Squares ' To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Last Sunday I listened to a broadcast of a debate between two students of the University of Chicago and two of Stanford University , the subject being " Learning for Living . " The whole debate seemed to be which one could use the biggest words and advance the most unintelligible theories . Why does n't some one tell the real object of education , which should be to earn three square meals a day ? If this is drilled into students early , other education can be acquired later . If this is neglected , it is likely to be submerged in the theoretical stuff boys get in college . If a boy learns to earn his own living and saves a little money , he is a free man . If he spends his time saturating himelf with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the end of it can not earn his own living , he is a slave PAUL STARRETT . New York , Jan. 30 , 1939 . Protecting Children 's Health To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : ' While there is every reason to support General Hugh S. Johnson in his campaign for the eradication of infantile paralysis , we must not lose sight of the fact that rheumatic fever , one of the worst scourges of childhood , takes even a greater toll each year . The Health Department is not unaware of this , as is evidenced by the honest but totally inadequate research performed in the schools today by the Board of Health physicians assigned there . Ca n't we give them the little they need ; or must we stand by and let 5 per cent of our children slowly succumb to a scourge worse and more treacherous than infantile paralysis or tuberculosis ? J. A. SCAL , M. D. New York , Jan. 28 , 1939 . More Library Funds Wanted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few thoughtful people will deny that public libraries are second only to the schools as a means of education . Sincere citizens urge that the Mayor , the Board of Estimate and the budget director supply the public libraries with funds to make possible more and better librarians , more books , more facilities and a greater variety of expanded services to the people .
