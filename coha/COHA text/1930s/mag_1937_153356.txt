Smart , sharp-nosed Lewis Deschler , official Parliamentarian of the House-who ever since he came of age ten years ago has been advising the Speakers of the House on the abstruse technicalities of House procedure-had the eyes of the House upon him one afternoon last week as he marched up to Reading Clerk Alney Chaffee . Taking a large leatherbound volume from beneath his arm , the Parliamentarian laid it on the edge of the Clerk 's desk and turned away . As he did so the volume began to slip . Alney Chaffee made a lunge for it but it escaped him , with a resounding clank fell into a large brass cuspidor . The House guffawed . The first fall had been taken out of the U. S. Budget for fiscal 1938 . <P> Clerk Chaffee , doubling his official dignity , retrieved the book and began to read Franklin Roosevelt 's budget message . Before the minds of Representatives became completely swamped in a sea of figures they had apprehended some points that the President was making : <P> If Relief expenditures for fiscal 1938 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions , that year would see the Government 's revenues and expenses brought into balance for the first time since fiscal 1930 . <P> . " If improvement in economic conditions continues at the present rate , " the President expects in fiscal 1939 to bring the budget completely into balance by beginning to pay off some of the national debt as required by law . <P> The President will ask Congress for a 1938 Relief appropriation later in the session and hopes to keep it within one and one half billions provided industry will really try to hire away the Government 's Relief workers . He would also ask ( and did this week ) for $790,000,000 extra to carry Relief through next June bringing the total of Relief and Recovery expenditures for fiscal 1937 up to $2,956,000,000 - the Relief bill to a new high . <P> When Clerk Chaffee finished reading no Congressman who remained in the House needed to be told that this was the dullest budget message which Franklin Roosevelt had yet written , and no Congressman without studying the attached pages of exhibits-a volume the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dullest message accompanied Franklin Roosevelt 's most significant budget to date . <P> Portentous was his budget in 1933 cutting Government expenses by $360,000,000 , his budget in 1934 proposing to spend $10,000,000,000 for priming the pump , his budget in 1935 asking a lump sum of $4,000,000,000 for him to spend as he wished on Relief , his budget in 1936 when he proclaimed , " Our policy is succeeding . <P> ... It is the deficit of today which is making possible the surplus of tomorrow . " His budget last week was the thing of which all the others had been portents , a picture of U. S. finances not in process of change but as changed , of the new fiscal situation brought about by four years of the New Deal .
