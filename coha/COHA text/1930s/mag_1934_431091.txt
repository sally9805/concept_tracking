 | A YEAR of education missed is a year of education lost . A A child kept out of school , or deprived of the proper facilities in school , is a child handicapped for life . Consider those facts in relation to these other facts : that all over this country the schools are being forced to close , or to run on part time , or to operate with budgets cut to the bone . And more children than ever before are wanting to go to school . Surely it is zero hour for the American ideal of education . Shall we let the forces of the depression close in upon the schools , or shall we , right now , take advanced ground ? Here is a leader who says to go ahead ? to remember that tomorrow is more important than today . We go ; our children go on . The schools are theirs , not ours IN WASHINGTON they call the coming and going of the representatives of industry before General Johnson the Big Parade . By hundreds and thousands they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pledge to pay higher wages ; to reduce hours of labor ; to bring about fairer competition and better teamwork . The tramp of their feet echoes to the farthest corner of the country . It is a parade marching toward a new deal and , we hope , a new day . While this parade , which affects everything we wear and everything we use , marches forward , there is another which is not moving forward . It is n't even standing still , but is moving backward . It is the parade of public education , which , instead @#  | of marching to the tune of a national recovery plan , has been left to shift for itself , and in some places has been disbanded . Yet the parade of industrial recovery can move only as the parade of education keeps pace with it and ahead of it . Every successful move in industry , every step forward toward a new day , depends upon a people educated and trained , a people prepared to think and to adjust themselves to new conditions . Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it is pinched , it speaks in a loud voice . Education , if it is real , is quiet and inconspicuous ; it touches our children . It is too busy with its task of shaping their lives to be articulate . Education is what President Roosevelt means when he speaks of " the longer pull . " In explaining the NRA , last summer , he said ? " This task is in two stages ; first , to get many hundreds of thousands of unemployed back on the payroll by snowfall ; and second , to plan for a better future , a longer pull . " We have heard the tramp of the feet of the returning hundreds of thousands to shops and factories , but how many of the 200,000 teachers who lost their jobs , or how many of the 2,000,000 children who are without schools are in the parade ? Industry has a national backer . Education has no comparable backer , unless the people out of whose hearts education has sprung as a hope for the betterment of their children , rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American dream , the very core of its central idea . Whatever we are , of strength or weakness , we have been shaped by that dream . Our hopes have always been centered in the little red schoolhouses that used to dot the country , and from them were transferred to the consolidated schools that are taking their places and to the great imposing buildings in our towns and cities . Invisibly engraved over the doors of each of these schools is the declaration of our ideal , " An equal opportunity for an education for every American child . " That ideal is under attack in our schools today , with our dream of public education threatened with bankruptcy . We can get a much clearer idea of what is happening in this country today by looking at our schools than by turning to the situation in the business world or on the farms , for when education falls under the knife of economy to the extent that it has , it means that we are under the dominance of fear rather than hope . The line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast to the East and from the Gulf States to Canada . With a million more pupils in our schools today than there were in 1930 , the schools are being forced to operate with funds decreased by about $368,000,000 ? a per day decrease of $2,100,000 . Here are a few results of that decrease : The Joint-Commission on the Emergency in Education reports that at least one out of every four public-school teachers is receiving annual wages less than the minimum provided for factory workers under the blanket NRA code . More than 40,000 rural teachers will receive less than $450 this year . ( The wage for an unskilled factory worker at the minimum code rate is $728 . ) Moreover , in a number of states , teachers are being paid in warrants which can be cashed only at a discount ranging from 5 percent up . Total unpaid teachers ' salaries exceed $40,000,000 . Nearly 2000 rural schools in 24 states failed to open last fall . Another 715 were expected to run less than three months . In some places schools have kept running by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can not pay are deprived of the chance for an education . With as many facts about the present crisis in education as I could find I went to Dr. John Dewey , who , more than any other person , is @#  | responsible for shaping education to the ways of modern life . I asked him to interpret these facts for the benefit of Goon HOUSEKEEPING readers so that they might be guided in their local problems and might perhaps be stirred to join the army of those who will set education once more on the forward march . What follows is Dr. Dewey 's discussion : This is a dark hour for education in this country , but it need not be a zero hour . It may even be an educational opportunity for a big step forward if the forces are mobilized to deal with the situation hopefully and constructively . The most significant thing that has happened in our national life in the past twenty years has been the expansion of education to include all ages and all members of our social group . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school . Education was trying to make a place for every one who needed or wanted it , and there was a tremendous , growing faith in the power of education . It is at that faith , which is our greatest hope for a continuing civilization , that the present situation is striking . It is hard to believe that we can not find adequate means to support our schools . The whole cost of public education is only a little more than a third of what we spend a year for tobacco , jewelry , cosmetics , sporting goods , and toys . We pay five times as much for our automobiles every year as we do for our schools . It would seem that with judicious readjustment of our scale of social values we can meet the situation . IF WE had been fair to our schools , not a dollar of the $368,000,000 would have been cut from their budgets , and not a teacher removed . You might question that statement in the face of the fact that all prices of equipment and school supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . But these have not gone down in proportion to the increased demands on the schools . The number of pupils in our public schools has rapidly increased since the depression . In the period between 1930 and 1932 our school population increased by the size of the population of the entire State of Montana . This increase represents more than the number of all the pupils enrolled in our public high schools in 1900 . All of us have rejoiced in the great victory of the NRA in abolishing child labor , which has liberated from shop and factory and office an estimated 100,000 youths and delivered them back to the schools of the country . Under existing conditions , what can the schools do with these liberated youths ? Already they are spilling over . There are not desks and chairs enough to take care of the students who have come back begging for more schooling . And this increased enrollment is in the high schools , where education is most costly . In 1930 the average amount necessary to educate a highschool child was $136 , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in the face of this increased need for schooling that operating expenses have been so indiscriminately slashed . A policy that would be considered madness in a clothing factory , a grocery store , or a steel mill is considered good enough for our schools , whose output is the citizen of tomorrow . In the fall of 143 , there was an infantile paralysis epidemic which left in its wake several thousand crippled children . Our schools took these children in . Special classes were provided for them as well as for other handicapped children . It is a comparatively expensive form of education , requiring trained teachers and a different kind of teaching equipment . This special education is being cut out of many of our schools in the program of economy . It is classed as one of the " frills " of modern education . Yet educating these children to be useful members of society is much less costly than taking care of them later on as adults in benevolent institutions , even if we did not consider the happiness of the individuals . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving . " Health care is being cut down . Vocational training is being eliminated in many places , kindergartens done away with , school terms shortened , the number of teachers reduced , and the size of classes increased . The situation in regard to textbooks is so acute that Dr. George Zook , Commissioner of Education , recently called a conference in Washington at which it was revealed that in some schools textbooks published eleven years ago , and later discarded , have been brought back into use . Books , unsightly , unsanitary , with pages missing , are being used by as many as six classes a day in some schools , and in many schools throughout the country classes are trying to carry on their work with wholly inadequate materials . Many a leading business man , member of a local school board , who has willingly signed the NRA code for his business , has cheerfully voted for a 20 percent cut in teachers ' salaries and a reduction in the number of teachers . He has approved a budget cut that means a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taking teachers off the school payroll to add to the unemployed as he does in adding new employees to the payroll of his store . He does not realize that a lowering of school standards will eventually affect his business , yet whenever he calls in his secretary for dictation , she brings him the benefit of more than a thousand dollar investment in elementary and high-school education ; his manager gives him the results of twelve years of public school and four years of college . His employees bring him a total of training that is one of the chief assets of his business . If that training were lessened , his business would soon suffer . GOOD education costs more than poor education . It is like good plumbing , good clothing , good furniture . If we want shoddy material , we can get it at a cheaper price . But if we want quality , we can not expect to get it at the bargain , marked-down rate to which education has been reduced in many parts of the country . Taking a long-range view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child at an average of $91 a year , and the cost of keeping a man in prison at $300 a year . In cutting down our costs for education we are almost certain to run up our bill for crime . Where economy logically should strike is at the fundamentals , such as more economical school districting , centralization in the purchase of supplies , school buildings designed for maximum usefulness rather than to flatter community pride , sound and efficient management instead of political control . - The methods , e ? economy of many school boards might : - be compared to skimming the icing off a cake . They have simply taken off what was added last and what they denounce as frills and fluff . These subjects are not frills and fluff but are the ones most in key with life today , which have been added in an attempt to adapt our schools to our changing world . About 40 years ago , a new idea dawned in education . Educators began to see that education should parallel life , that the school should reproduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education the child instead of the curriculum became the center of interest , and since the child is active , changing , creative , education ceased to be static , became dynamic and creative in response to the needs of the child . Many things were added to schools which before had been considered out of their province . These changes have come very slowly and unevenly and are still far from being generally accepted .  | In a survey of secondary education in this country made by the Federal Office of Education recently , it was found that the number of courses offered by schools has practically doubled in recent years . And in some schools non-academic subjects have come to claim from one-third to two-fifths of the time of all pupils . What does this mean ? Simply that the modern school offers to the pupils what the school of earlier days gave them , plus much that the home used to teach . As the nature of the home has changed and as all our life has become more complex , due to the contributions of science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tasks for his training . When girls used to learn the fine arts of cooking and sewing under the tutelage of their mothers and their grandmothers , it was not considered a " frill " or useless knowledge . Now the teaching of sewing and cooking , together with the chemistry of foods and a good deal more , is transferred to the school under the name of home economics . Boys , instead of going into shops or businesses of their fathers as apprentices , have their training in the high school . It is wiser economy , and it fits in better with our whole scheme of living . The change from healthy country living to cramped city life has been met by physical education and health work . Music , art , and dancing , which children used to get in their home and community life , are woven into the school 's activities . Civics , athletics , out-of-classroom interests give training in cooperative group living made necessary in our present complex civilization . Science , manual training , and the crafts should play a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades if children are to adjust themselves satisfactorily to a technological age . We do not need fewer of these subjects ; we need more . A reorganization of our courses of study is needed which will make them as fundamental a part of education as the well-known three R 's . Reading and writing need not be isolated subjects . Even very young children can read and write about something ; for instance , about their work in arithmetic , nature study , or what happens on the playground . The fundamentals of arithmetic can be more economically and just as thoroughly taught if they are linked up with shop work , domestic science , and geography . The three subjects , geography , history , and civics , are , in some schools , being replaced by one subject ? social studies ? which gives pupils the information on which they can build up an understanding of social , economic , and political institutions today . Giving up the old-fashioned recitation where one pupil stands and tells the teacher what he has learned while the rest of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting more time to teach other things . A rearranging of subjects and methods in the light of a new philosophy which sees education as a total experience , exactly as life is a total experience , would provide economy in time , materials , and cost , that would be a far more sensible proceeding than setting our schools backward by lopping off the activities and courses that have been pointing the way toward a new deal in education . WHEN the panic of 1837 struck the country , public education was just gaining a foothold , especially in Massachusetts and New York . Before that , education was considered a privilege , paid for in tuition by those who could afford it . Horace Mann , a rising young lawyer in Massachusetts , gave up his practice and for a beggarly sum became secretary of the State Board of Education . In that capacity he preached the doctrine of education . for all children and proposed that schools be supported by taxation . It was from that crusade , following on the heels of a depression such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first real impetus in this country . The infant that grew under the encouragement of Mann in Massachusetts and of Henry Barnard in Connecticut , has grown tremendously , but it is still being supported by methods of a century ago . The property tax was the logical means of support when Horace Mann preached his crusade of tax-supported schools . In those days nearly every one owned his home and place of business , and life was individual and simple . Education reflected that simplicity , and , logically , education took on the tinge of the local life and habits . There was no such concentration of wealth in certain areas of the country , due to the concentration of business and industry , as now exists . We can not determine clearly what can be done to save our schools without first facing the question of the foundation of support on which they rest . It is the cause of most if not all of the inequalities which exist in our educational system . If we wait for reform , state by state , and in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the price of the sacrifice of educational opportunity for hundreds of thousands of American children to whom that sacrifice can never be made up . WHY should a child benefit by being born in New York State , Delaware , or California , where the schools , because of great wealth and an intelligent use of that wealth for education , have weathered the depression , or suffer for being born in Arkansas or Alabama , where there is no such wealth nor a satisfactory subsidy for education ? In New York , the poorest schools are spending $78 a year per pupil ; in Arkansas , the poorest schools have only $12 a year per pupil . And even if all the wealth of the State of Arkansas were taxed through property , income , and other possible taxes , it could yield only $24 a year for each pupil instead of $12 . ' In Alabama for the past two years about 27,000 school children have had their school term shortened . In some places the teachers have taught without pay in order to stretch out the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cooked their meals on the heating stove , the children bringing them food from the farms . In Lamar County , Alabama , the schools closed the middle of December , both this year and last . This year the children will again have three and a quarter months of school , instead of the eight full months they should have . Across an invisible line , in Lownde : County , Mississippi , the children went to school a full term last year and will again this year . The difference between what happens on one side of that invisible line and the other is the difference between the tax system of the two states . The schools of Alabama are still limping along on an old and unsatisfactory method of taxation . In Mississippi , which is the most rural of the forty-eight states and as hard hit by the depression as any in the Union , the support of the schools is taken care of by an emergency sales tax which was passed in 1932 when the schools were about to close . Equal opportunity for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortuitous circumstance of the kind of taxation that state or community may have . The country boy does not have the same opportunity as the boy in the city . There is a wide range of inequalities between states , between counties in the same state , even between neighboring townships . On the average the city child goes to school more than five weeks longer each term than the boy or girl who lives in the country ; the total time ? or education ? a country boy thus loses during the grammar grades is equivalent to a whole school year . Only one-fourth of the rural children between fifteen and eighteen years of age go to high school , compared with three-fourths of city children . In one state the richest school district is 275 times better able to support its schools than the poorest district . @#  | These inequalities existed even in normal times . The depression merely shows up the contrast in sharper outlines . They are not facts that come under codes , nor has any NRA been organized to deal with the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has suffered least during the depression some means of support for the schools other than sole dependence upon the property tax has been found . There has been a healthy progression from local to state support . A common school fund , or an equalization fund as it is sometimes called , has been established , with gratifying results , in a number of the states . The next logical step should be equalization in all of the forty-eight states through some form of Federal aid . Thiswould insure a square deal to education not by states or by sections , but for the nation as a whole . In other words , education has outgrown its purely local character which it had in the days of Horace Mann , and is tending toward nationalization . We are no longer an isolated , pioneer people ; we have become homogeneous . Without losing our local flavor we should secure the benefits to education of national unity . If the citizens of any state stayed within the state , the rest of the country might look with unconcern upon the denial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are , and traveling and moving as freely as we do , the whole country has a vital interest in the whole educational set-up . The uneducated boy of any state may become the pauper citizen of any other ; the educational problems of one state are the concern of all the others . Since education is the keystone of democracy , education should be truly democratic . The facts which have been cited show that as education exists in America today it is not democratic , and probably can not be unless we establish some centralization of education in the government . THE time seems ripe to-urge again a Federal Department of Education with a Secretary of Education in the President 's cabinet . England , France , Germany , Italy ? in fact , nearly all of the large countries of the world except the United States ? have departments of education in their governments . Our Federal Office of Education , as it now exists , is mainly an advisory and fact-finding bureau with no power to help education out of its present dilemma . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of the Interior , with an appropriation of $270,000 , makes an interesting contrast with the Department of Agriculture with its appropriation of more than $370,000,000 , and its vast activities and powers operating at the moment to pull farmers out of the red . Education , which deals with the future of American citizens , has reached its present grave crisis with no national program of recovery . As some one has tersely put it , children are not getting a new deal , they are getting a raw deal . Under the recovery program , a small beginning recently has been made for the aid of schools , which gives help in repair and reconstruction of schools and in reopening schools that are closed . Some teachers are being reemployed , and over the country at large two million dollars a month are being allocated for emergency educational programs , chiefly for adult education and nursery-school projects . Though a move in the right direction , this hand held out to the biggest of our public services , the schools is pathetically small in comparison to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bridges . A Federal Department of Education would not mean , as many seem to fear , a standardized system of education any more than the De- I State partment of Agriculture means standardized @#  | farming , unsuited to local conditions . It would mean a fair deal for American children just as the Department of Agriculture is trying to give the farmer a fair deal . This fair dealing would be further safeguarded if the new Federal Department were not confined to education alone , but were given authority over every phase of child welfare and protection . Then the activities now carried on with such splendid results by the Children 's Bureau could be coordinated with education , and the whole administered as an effective unit . It is significant that in those countries of Europe which have governmental supervision of education , the schools have not buckled under the depression as ours have , even though the economic situation has been more acute than with us . It is said that in forty other countries the educational front has held better than ours has under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed over into the hands of the government , we would have Uncle Sam collecting taxes for the benefit of the schools and returning it to the states to supplement local taxes . In this case such contrasts as that between Alabama and her neighbor state could not exist . By setting up a Federal Department of Education we would not be weakening the local educational structure , but rather strengthening it by having for the first time a machinery which could wipe out undemocratic inequalities . ONE can not believe that the American people will stand by and see their system of public education go bankrupt ; that the same energy and initiative which are being roused for the revision of industry can not be stirred in defense of the schools . The schools of America are the real laboratories in which any new deal can be permanently and successfully inaugurated . Some such national planning as our financial institutions are undergoing is needed for education . The very desperateness of the school situation may serve as the fuel to start a conflagration in their behalf . The starting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lie in the Parent-Teacher Association , in the League of Women Voters , or the Civic Club , in the Rotary or the Kiwanis . The communities should begin with the thing closest at hand , study the changes being made in their schools , the tax system on which they are dependent . Then , if necessary , help should be asked of the state educational authorities , and Federal aid urged through the representatives in Washington . A sufficiently aroused public opinion can command what it will . The hunger for education in this country is as great as , if not far greater than , the hunger for food . There are bread lines at the doors of our schools which it is as dangerous to turn away as the bread lines at the doors of our welfare agencies . We need not less , but more , education for our children , and not alone for our children , but for our adults , released to new leisure . If there should sweep over us a concern for education which sees it as essential to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may bring about a reconstruction of our entire system of education which will be the culmination of that impulse begun forty years ago to bring education into line with the life of today and tomorrow . The result of that reconstruction would be to justify , as we must admit it has not been justified in the past , the hope over the doorways of our schools , " An equal opportunity for an education for every American child .
