" Ah , what the hell , Kit . . . let 's talk about something else . " Do n't say no more , " Agnes cried . Kit had said nothing . Agnes had ( lone all the talking . It had been bitterly cold for several days and then had got somewhat warmer and the snow had come . States like North Carolina , Kentucky , Tennessee , Missouri  --  called Southern , Oh , Thou Sunny South  --  can be colder than North Dakota , Idaho , Alaska . The cold gets you more . The world was white as Kit and Agnes walked down from the mill village . There had been a drizzling rain earlier that day . It turned to snow . A kind of glory and mystery in the night , too .

There was no sidewalk from the mill village down to the town but the way was lighted . It was an okay road forose who owned cars .

The hunger was not in Agnes . If it had ever been in her , had been put down . It was in Kit . The establishments in the cities sent experts off to the bigstyle centers . . . smart men , smart women designers , think-g out new , striking , enticing ways to bring out the charmwomen in dress . The experts went to New York . Theyt to Paris . They kept on the alert , bought or stole thepIO2 lines of new gowns , bought originals at high prices .

If a woman likes beautiful clothes it is n't always and altogether as a way to the man hunt . The chances are that women dress more for other women than for men.  |p103And  there is something else too . . . a thing not too often thought of . . . it is too easily taken for granted that havingmoney , living in a fine house , driving a fine car , makes for sensitiveness , the possibility of tenderness . We group people too easily . . . new words rapidly coming into our American vocabulary . . . the proletariat ... the bourgeoisie ... the capitalists . . . separations too simple , too easily made . Kit Brandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Agnes , had n't , as yet , any definite ideas about clothes , getting a man or not getting one . She was beginning to get , faintly , ideas of what might be done . There was her straight slender young body , white flesh , straight legs , slender ankles . She did not spend much time dreaming of strong male arms : Tout her , the brave male protecting the shrinking female . She was getting along a little in a matter of growing importance to herself , beginning to want something , that some man might  --  by a conceivable chance  --  she having aforesaid nice legs , arms , little hard breasts just budding , etc.  --  help her to get . What nice eyes ! They could be soft and apparently gentleand yielding at times . They could be hard shrewd eyes . Kit was having her being , her young womanhood , in the period immediately after the World War in America ... . ' They sure gypped us in that war . " The thought not very definite in the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not touched Kit or any one shenew very directly . There was something in the air . " Thesebig boys are n't so big , are they ? " Doubts regarding not onlygreat soldiers , so-called , but also great statesmen , captains ofindustry and others . There was no definite immediate ornizationof thought , for example , toward impulse to re/volt , make revolution , a new start . Age of the so-called hard-boiled ones . . . they often enough a new kind of sentimentalists too . . . the wise crackers . . . hard boys . All of this merely suggested here , as part , unconscious part , of Kit Brandon , what she would have been becoming . In her day the American intellectual world was being flooded with books . . . she had n't read them . ... she came later to a time of hook reading , trying to " improve " herself in that way as people do . " It may be that is the way , the hard sharpness , " she was thinking . All of this , hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young are often more open and ready to receive than people want to believe . It is so much easier for any one of us to think of another , of any one , as all one thing , easy to understand . It makes everything so simple and nice , does n't it ? It , the thing here suggested , however , standing up in Kit . She was more intensely personal than Agnes . It may be that the thing Agnes had was more healthy , that it was somethingbigger  --  growing belief in revolution for example  --  growing readiness to give self , throw self away , fight , even perhaps to die for others but , again , this not all of Agnes either . There was a side of her that wanted to be more like Kit . Once that evening as they were walking along , she stopped in the road and stood for a minute , looking at Kit . The struggle along the road , in the snow at the side of the road , had brought a flush of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale . They were under a street light . " Gee , Kid . . . God , you 're a swell-looker , Kid . " And then there was the world the two were moving in that night . It was oddly , strangely , a world more mysteriouspI05than they knew , at least consciously . Men and women in a new American world trying to adjust . . . new mystery inside houses they passed , outside houses , inside factories , outside factories . The two young women , walking down thus through the snowy night , walked under electric lights . The states of the upper South had been made what they were , what they suddenly , in a single decade , became , by the coming of water power . Duke . . . the Duke fortune ... a man named Duke , certainly a go-getter . . . in tobacco , organizer of the American Tobacco Company . . . the governmentbusting that up . . . effort of another generation to stop the development of the next generation . . .

Boy , go get the water power of our State . It 's a state of high mountains , cheap land , many mountain streams rushing down .. . " . . . They do n't see it . Go get it ! " " More money in that than in anything yet . " Power . Power . Power . The Dukes the new kings . Power hidden in streams , hidden away , far up in the mountains to be sent singing along wires , great steel spiders striding down out of the hills , across the lowlands , to towns , factories ... big towns springing up suddenly . The two mill girls also walking that night under the great steel spiders . The snow clung to them . " Look , " Agnesp106said to Kit . The steel structures that carry high pressure wires went like an army of gigantic spiders off into the darkness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a night , by speeding automobiles . The lights of passing automobiles played over their figures struggling along in the snow . There was a car filled with young men . They called to the women : " Come on . What about it ? Want a ride ? " " All , you go to hell . " Laughter . A shout . Speed . Speed . Speed . " Here we go . " Speed in machines inside factories , infinite speed in power , being carried , high up , over their heads , to factories , outside factories , in the nights , in the days . Let 's say that , in winter , the days in upper South States become cold and disagreeable . All right . You have money and a fast car . You jump into the car , whirl away . Florida in a day and a half , maybe less . . . orange trees . . . Gulf Stream swinging in to wash on a wide sandy beach . " Did you bring your bathing suit ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday we were in Greensboro , North Carolina . " God , was n't it cold ? " Cars flying over roads at forty , fifty , sixty , seventy . Who knows yet what it 's all about ? Who 's going to tell us what it 's all about ? And in the factories the goods pouring out , shoes pouringout , nice slick foxy little gowns for women . . . just like the top-notchers in New York , on Park Avenue in New York , on Michigan Avenue in Chicago , on the Rue de la Paix in Paris , just like the top-notch dames in such places wear.  |p107You  have to know your stuff to see the difference , when they 're new .

Mystery in a snowy world walked in by two young women , coldly different , maybe , down inside them , oddly alike . They got down into the town and their feet were cold and wet . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap shoes they wore . " Come on Kit , " Agnes said , and led the way out of the main street . They went down to where a railroad crossed the main street and got into a street of shabby little stores , little hot stuffy restaurants run by Greeks where hot dogs were sold . You could get spaghetti in Italian joints . On such a street , on most Saturday evenings , plenty of young fellows out trying to pick up something , the girls would have been hailed a half dozen times . " Hey , kid "  --  this to Kit  --  " shake that female Jack Dempsey you 're with and come to me . Hot time , kid . " Agnes would turn to swear . The young bloods were n't out that night . The girls went along the street to a small frame house , set back from the street , piles of rubbish in the yard , and around the house to the back door . Agnes knocked and a woman came to the door . She knew Agnes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and presently they were in a warm inner room and Agnes had called for drinks . Kit did n't want her drink . She took it . There were some men in the room , sitting at a near-by table and they were also drinking . What they all got was white mule . It was a raw , terrible drink and burned Kit 's throat . Funny to think it might have been made by her own father , back up in the hills . Tears came into her eyes when the raw stuff touched the tender flesh of her throat and Agnes laughed . " It 's awful stuff but it 's good for you sometimes , " she said . They were in the room and Agnes was talking again . She had been to the place one night with a certain man . He was , she explained , a radical from New York . She was trying , was always trying to work something out in her own mind . They sat at a little table in the little room , rather dimly lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out . There were five or six men at a near-by table and Kit sat so that she faced them as Agnes talked . She did n't hear much of what Agnes said . There was a young man over there , at the other table , facing her . He was pale . He did not look well . He was oddly like the young man Frank , the consumptive who had been her first boy friend . She might have called Frank lover . She did n't . The one at the table that night was like and unlike . He was dressed well , in well-made clothes . She even looked down at his shoes , could see them under the table . They also were well made . They were unlike the shoes on the feet of the other men at the table . He might be a young swell of the town . Drinking habits and drinking places in America during prohibition were not so swell either . Agnes talked . She was so absorbed in her own words that she did not notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young man at the other table was so unlike his companions . They were all young men . They talked loudly . Once or twice the woman who ran the place had to comep109in and ask them to be more quiet . The woman was middleaged , she looked frumpy . The other men at the table were unlike the pale one who looked like Frank . Frank had died only a few weeks earlier . The young man at the table kept looking at Kit . She was having thoughts about Frank , now dead , as Agnes talked . Agnes was talking of revolution . She was always at that . She was talking of a new world workers were some day to make . The pale young man at the table in the little shabby speak-easy might have been a young Duke , or son , say of some great cotton-mill baron , or a cigarette baron . There are huge life-insurance companies in North Carolina . He might have been the son of a millionaire president of a life-insurance company . He might have been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got it , I bet , like Frank had , " Kit thought . She meant tuberculosis . Odd to think about people  --  supposing the young man at the table to be something of the sort suggested above , getting the same disease a lad like Frank got . He 'd have come to the little dump maybe just to be with people . " This rot-gut whiskey wo n't do me any good but what 's the difference ? I 'm gone anyway . " Kit Brandon off on her own , a million miles from Agnes , talking away opposite her . She was thinking of her last eveningwith the dying boy Frank . She had walked out with Frank on another Saturday evening. it was winter time too , then , but it was warm . It was the last time he had been outdoors before he died . He had got an obsession . He had sent her word : " I wantpIIOto see you . You come Saturday night . " A woman who worked in the mill and had a room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and she had gone to him . They had walked out , going slowly , and had got finally into a little lane , leading into a field . It was a place , just outside of town , where there was a farmhouse on one side of a road and a barn , in a field , on the other . The barn was set quite far back from the road and the lane led down to it . The farmhouse was quite dark . " Come in here with me , " Frank had said to her . He explained that he could n't walk far . They went into the lane and Frank told her what he wanted . " That other night , " he said  --  they were in the lane , just off the road  --  " when I touched you the way I did , with my hands ... I did n't have the nerve to ask you then but now . . . if I do n't ask you I wo n't get another chance .. . " Because I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , with me , because I never did and I do want to before I die . " Kit had let it happen . " Why not ? " she had thought that night . She had let him and they had got caught , just after it was over  --  a man , perhaps a farmhand coming along the lane . Fortunately , they did n't quite get caught . They had a chance to get to their feet . " What the hell you doing in here ? " They had n't said anything but had hurried away out of the lane and back to Frank 's place , as fast as they could go , he being as he was . They sat on the porch together at the house for a time and he cried and told her something . " I did n't want it to be disturbed like that , " he said . He hadpIIItried to explain something of what he had wanted , a kind of sealing together , of himself with her , a living in profound nothingness with another  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of idea . " I might live on in you , " he said . As to whether or not Kit had understood what Frank had meant that night she did n't know . She was in the little speak-easy thinking of it as Agnes talked . Her thoughts had been aroused in her by the face , the eyes , of another young man at the near-by table , like and unlike Frank , now dead . She and Agnes had their drinks and Agnes talked and then paid the check . Agnes was a little irritated , perhaps , feeling that her talk had been falling on deaf ears . She got excited . She had been telling the story of another strike she had been in and of how , after the failure of the strike , the workerswere left stranded , as at Marion , North Carolina . All the labor leaders , even the young radicals from the North , had got on trains and gone away . " Why the hell do n't they stay with us when we 're licked , take what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud voice , and the men at the near-by table all turned and stared . She and Kit both became self-conscious . " Let 's get out of this dump , " Agnes said , and they had got up to go out when one of the young men at the other table jumped up and tried to detainKit . The one who did it was a little drunk . He grabbed Kit by the arm . " Look here , " he said . " Say , you 're a sweet kid , " he said . He held her by the arm and when Agnes advanced to the rescue he threw out his free arm trying to brush her aside . " I do n't want you , " he said , " I want this one . " The other young men at the table were laughing and the pale young man , who was so like and unlike Frank , was trying to protest . " Ah , Jim , Jim , let her alone , " he waspII2 saying when Agnes , with a quick wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face with her fist and knocked him to the floor . There was an outbreak , an outcry , a racket , and the woman of the place ran into the room . She protested . Two or three of the other young men , at the table with the drunken one , had helped him to his feet and were holding him . He was swearing and the woman of the place kept protesting . " Be quiet ! Oh , please , please be quiet , " she was saying as Kit and Agnes slipped past her out of the room and got out again into the street . They walked up and down the main street of the town . It still snowed and Agnes had becomequiet . She had perhaps been hurt by two things , that Kit had not listened to her talk in the speak-easy and that the drunken man had made the sharp distinction between herself and Kit . As the two young women walked up and down the main street of the town , the snow still falling , snow clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the falling snow , Kit felt the night beautiful . Agnes did n't . She soon wanted to go home . " We might as well , " she said . She spoke of clothes ruined , shoes ruined . The night had turned suddenly ugly for her.  | THERE were all kinds of fellows in with Tom Halsey , more or less under his orders , some bold ones , some sly crafty ones , some brutes . They talked , whispered among themselves . " What the hell ? " It was because of Tom Halsey 's son , young Gordon Halsey . He had got stuck on the skirt  --  Kit Brandon . There was that other woman , Kate , a good deal older than Kit . She was all right . She knew how to keep her mouth shut . But just the same . It was an old , old idea  --  cherchez la femme . " They gab . You get in a jam and you are mixed up with some dame and , sure as hell , she runs out on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the mountain men who worked with Tom Halsey . . . Tom was a pioneer , a bringer of a new and modern world into the mountain life , . . . they were of an older order . You saw a mountain man coming into some little mountaintown afoot . He strode along the road ahead of his woman , did not walk beside her . Many of the mountain men had big families . The children walked in the road behind , the girl children at the end of the little procession . When  --  son of the family had reached maturity , began to think , of himself as a man , he stepped ahead of his mother and walked just . at , the heels of his father . The women submitted . A mountain man did not do any work about the house . He did not milk the cow , feed the pigs , carry firewood into the house . He crept away to the woods to make himself a run of liquor ; he worked in his few hillside fields . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paved roads were being pushed through . They twisted and wound along little river bottoms , under majestic hills , occasionally climbed over a hill and went on down into another valley . Industrial towns had come , some of them growing swiftly , towns of North Carolina , Eastern Tennessee , Eastern Kentucky , Southwest Virginia . Tourists in Fords , Chevrolets , Buicks , Packards went whirling along roads and through the hills . The industrial towns had come because of power in the rivers of the hills and because of cheap labor . There were still hundreds of square miles of country in the mountainsapparently uninhabited , but not uninhabited . The touristgoing along in his car looked about . " What a desolate country ! " He was mistaken . There were many thousands , even hundreds of thousands of people , hidden away , in little hollows , on mountain sides , in mountain cabins no car could climb up to . The mountain people had lived thus for many generations . Books had been written about them , tales of mountain feuds . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breathitt County , Kentucky . . . sentimentalyarns . . . . " Trail of the Lonesome Pine . " There were garages strung along the new big highways and these were often gathering places for Tom 's men . How quickly they had taken to the automobile . They gathered be/fore such places , sat about , some in overalls . A surprising number of them could not read or write . They were outwardlylistless enough looking men . They talked slowly and quietly . As always happens , the mind of the man out of another world too much influenced by the reading of newspapers , popular magazines and novels , could not differentiate . The mountain men were thought of , by tourists passing swiftly through the hills , as all of a type . They were dangerous , secretive , sly . They spent their time hunting " federals " or shooting at each other . It was of course all nonsense . They were of every type , incipient poets , honest hard-workingmen , killers , horse traders , liars , men faithful to friends unto death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that in lonely isolated places things did happen . What Kit 's father had , she thought , intended doing to Kit was not a too unusual thing . They lived in a country long out of the path of so-called American progress , a country long forgotten . The westward drift of population in America in earlier ( lays had been along rivers and across the plains , over the Alleghanies from the East and down the Ohio , or along the upper lake region . Then out into the fat rich plains , the prairie country , the great American agricultural empire . A man of Tom 's crowd took a load of liquor into Ohio . He came back and talked . During the Civil War Mosby 's raiders cut across river from Kentucky into the North . They would have been Southern boys , for the most part Poor Whites , fighting they did not know what for . They raided through Indiana and Ohio and some of them came back . They came back shaking their heads . Talks at night by Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that peo/pie . Why , look how our fields are desolated . Up there the barns are groaning , towns are growing , even while this war is going on . They are too big , fat , and well-fed for us . " Mountain man , of Tom Halsey 's crowd , in a garage , talking to other mountain men . " Good God , Jim , Fred , Joe , Harry , here we are . We scratch the ground on one of these hills to raise a little corn . It gets up shoulder high and we think we 've got a crop . Little scrawny corn stalks as big as my finger . Up there the corn is like trees and you should see their towns , the way their women dress , the houses they live in . " It was no wonder that the money crop of the hills , moonliquor , had , under prohibition , got so important . Tom Halsey , in organizing , drawing together under one head , a scattered industry of thousands of small units , had but followed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oil industry , tobacco , the woollen industry . Control the illicit liquor business , control and organize crime . Although Tom Halsey did not have an office in an office building , board of directors ' room with mahogany table , etc. , he was ambitious . He felt himself in the Americanbusiness tradition . He had thought about it , had his own pride . He felt that American business men , captains of industry , were really big men and that he was on the road to bigness . The mountain empire in the very heart of America was long forgotten . In Old Virginia the big families , the F. F. V. 's , are nearly all in the Tidewater country . The Washingtons , Jeffersons , Madisons all lived in Tidewater . They forgot the mountain country , the mountain men . Daniel Boone lived out there , Abe Lincoln 's people came from the hills . The mountain men were the adventurers , openers upp117of Kentucky , of Tennessee , of what is now West Virginia  --  land of coal . Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tidewater Virginia . They organized the state of Franklin , a purely mountain state , elected a governor and United States senators . They did n't get away with it . The men of Tom Halsey 's crowd , bringers of the new era into the hills , whiskey-making organized , put on a business basis , on their hours off loafing before a roadside garage , looked out over a lovely country . The garage , let us say , is high up , near a mountain top , where one of the new paved roads sweeps up out of one river valley to pass over and into another . The men 's eyes are accustomed to the sight before them . However , and although the mountain folk do not often speak of it , not being given to flowery talk , there is in them a deep love of their hill country . Some of the men of Tom Halsey 's liquormaking , liquor-handling , liquor-running crowd , men who under Tom began suddenly to make money , to drive automobiles , to take trips down out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern Ohio and Pennsylvania . . . some of them had been as far away from their home hills as Detroit . . . belonged to families that had been in the hills since before the Revolutionary War .

They did n't become clerks in stores and banks . " I ampoor but be careful . Do not tread too hard on my toes . " When a stranger came into the hills he was watched , but the mountain men were not necessarily suspicious lest he be  --  federal . The poorest mountain man , living in the mostp118isolated hollow of the hills , in the greatest poverty , often in a one-room cabin with a dirt floor , when such a stranger came to his door invited him into his house , invited him to eat , to spend the night , to stay , if he wished , in the poor hovel for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American SouthernHighlands are Scotch-Irish , so-called .

The English king tried to tax them and great hordes of them came to America . They were always whiskey makers . Their ancestors had made pot liquor in Scotch hills . They came through Pennsylvaniaand down through the valley of Virginia , the " Shenandoah " and to the hills because they were hill people . They were in the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania in early days . " What was all this business about taxes ? What has government done for us that we should pay taxes ?

It is true that modern industry had done something to , if not for , the hill country . The great lumber kings had invadedthe country . There had been thievery of great boundariesand ruthless cutting and slashing . An old story , thep119whole country may some day realize what a tragic story . In the early days the mountain men , families , drifted into the hills one by one and settled there . They knew little of courts of law . Titles for land when acquired were often not recorded in the courts . After all Daniel Boone , at the end of all his exploring , his daring penetration into unknownplaces , when he was old and had settled on a piece of land , to enjoy in peace his old age , was gypped out of the land by some big land company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American graft . Even the immortal Washington got in on that racket . The early mountain man , coming in , picked himself a place with a bit of creek or river bottom . Hundreds and even thousands of cold mountain streams flowed down out of the hills . They were alive with trout . The forests were full of game . There was enough grass . . . the nutritious blue grass in the limestone hill . . . to feed a cow , a team of oxen or a horse . Pigs could be marked and turned loose to roam in the forest and in good years they grew fat on the fallen acorns . A life that would have seemed barren to many Americans , in a land where riches came so rapidly , so much flat land , easily farmed , land to be had for the taking in an earlier day .

" Treat me with the respect due to my manhood or ... " Or , or , or . " Life was hard but good , too . A mountain man , grown lean and hard in a hard land on hard fare , thought nothing of walking twenty-five miles over mountain trails , through the thick laurel , under the great trees , to some tiny settlement , to bring home tobacco , salt and sugar . He went with his " passel of ginseng , " called " sang , " or with a few hens in a " poke , " slung over his shoulder . There was something mysterious about the wild sang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , by some far-off people . The people who wanted it might have been living in Mars .

Hens came indoors and laid eggs on the beds or under the beds . The mountain man 's children had fixed a place for hens to set in a corner of his one-room house . His pig wandered in and out at the open door . You can housebreaka pig , too . Suspicion of government deeply rooted . Again : " What right has government to say my children shall go to school ? What do we need of book-larnin ' ? What has government done for me ? I myself have no book-larnin ' , can not read or write , but am I not a man in my place ? " Tom Halsey , the man who became a mountain gang leader . . . he was a rather small compactly built quiet man . . . blue-black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people , more cunning , perhaps cruel , determined , ambitious . How he got his power over other men and , when he wished it , over women , no one knew . He could remember when , as a boy , he went , for the first time , with his father and other men to a town. pI2IThey went , the little caravan of mountaineers , some sixty miles , over stony winding mountain roads , half trails . The men carried axes to cut underbrush away . Up and down mountains they went , a team of oxen pulling a covered wagon , a few dozen jugs or kegs of whiskey in the wagon . They made good whiskey in that day , let it mature , did n't hurry it , did n't load the beer with sugar to hurry it , did n't make the later stomach-destroying stuff Tom got rich handling . The whiskey would be buried in straw in the wagon and a man with a gun walked on a mile or two ahead . If a federal appeared . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to fire the gun . The whiskey was quickly hidden in the near-by brush . At night , when the little caravan camped by some clear mountain stream , it was again carried into the brush , hidden for the night under the thick laurel and rhododendron . When the men got down , near the town , it would be again hidden while they went on into town . The caravan took all of three long days making its way down to the town where there was a store . There was a branch railroad that came up to the town . It was another three days getting home . Could a man , several men , come over such roads , for such a great distance , merely to sell a few hens , a little sang ? It was too difficult to haul the corn down . Whiskey was the distillation of the corn . Men wanted it . A man and his familywanted sugar , salt , tobacco , snuff . The women and childrenhad to have clothes . The little pilgrimage going down camped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered the mysterious darkness of the great forests , the cry of owls at night , the talk of the men . The men who would be so silent in town , among town men , now talkedp122freely . When they got near the town the whiskey would be hidden and the smartest , shrewdest one among them . . . it would be Tom 's father . . . pride in the boy in that fact ... would be appointed the one to make the trade for the liquor . " We are mountain men , can not read or write , but when we speak we tell the truth . It is good liquor . If you think we are dull and stupid , come , try swapping horses with one of us . " The whiskey is hidden in such and such a place . Come , I will show you . " Tom 's father spoke of good times when he was a boy . His people lived in the hills of Tennessee . There was a war . . . it was the Spanish-American War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to camp at a place called " Chickamaugua Park . " And did they want whiskey ? Did they buy it ? It was good times for the liquor makers in the hills . It may be that later , when Tom became a big business men , he remembered his father 's talk of that time . In the town something to be seen . There was , for example , the railroad locomotive . It was really a cheaply constructedbit of railroad that ran up to that mountain place , a mere branch road . There was to be a big lumber cutting started there . But , to the boy , the railroad engine had seemed wonderful and terrible enough . To Tom 's mind it may have suggested something . Organizers of big business must have imagination too . They must be born with imagination . The business , the acquisitive instinct , that enables a man to grow rich and powerful , may be , after all , but a perversion , a twist of some finer instinct . Oh , the great world , off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little mountain railroad , great rich plains opening out downp123there , broad rivers flowing ! Oh , the great cities being built ! Oh , the great forests that still covered so much of a hill country ! The mountain country lay between the North and the South . It had long been the middle-land , the border-land between two civilizations . How many battles of the Civil War fought in the hills , mountain men on both sides in the struggle . Birds , from the North , going South , stopped their flight for a time in the hills . Some from the South stayed there , in the high cool places ; from the North , in the warm valleys . Southern and Northern flowers and trees grew along mountain trails . There was snow falling on the mountain tops , far South , warm days in winter far North . The forest that once covered the whole land to be remembered by all those who had known it . Tom 's father became a lumberjack when the lumber kings came . He talked , sometimes , when Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forest . It was something mysterious . You felt strange sometimes . Tom 's father could not find words for what he wanted to say . He did not know that man had got his notion for the cathedrals , for the Gothic , from the forests . The great aisles , leading away mysteriously under the trees . It was dark overhead , the branches of the great trees intertwined . " You did n't want to speak loud . " There was no underbrush in some places , on upper plateauswhere the biggest trees were , and the ground underneathwas soft . You walked always on a deep thick carpet f moss . It was a great sponge . You sank in it to the boot tops . An idea Tom Halsey never got , that his father never got . This great middle-ground between the North and the South , pI24 the Southern Appalachian Highlands , meant something terriblyimportant to the whole country . It was the great stream source . What great rivers having their source in the hills . Once Pinchot , in Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forest preservation clear to a group of senators . He took a board and held it on a table , at an angle of forty-five degrees . He poured a glass of water down the face of the board and then took the same board and covered it with blotting paper . Again he poured the water down the face of the board but it did not run off . The water trickled , a few drops at a time , slowly out at the base of the board . To see the country as a whole , understand it as a whole , a faculty that , as statesman , Lincoln had , as warrior , Grant had . The lumber kings going into the Southern Highlands and stripping the timber away , often destroyed timber they could not get out . Whole mountain slopes were often destroyedto make a runway for tall timber on some upper plateau . . . the washing away of the good soil beginning , going on year after year , floods in the Tennessee , the Cumberland , the Ohio . Floods down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . countries have been destroyed thus .. . towns destroyed , farms destroyed . A lumber baron has made a million , two million , five million . It is a sweet picture . Kill the TVA ! Kill the CCC ! These things embarrass private enterprises . Suppose it were possible that , some day , a new impulse be carried to the point where all men , in youth , were compelled to spend perhaps three years , working in the forests , or in any work that would benefit the whole country , getting thereby a sense of the country as a whole . The dream of a new conception of life and the land.  | ToM HALSEY , a mountain man and the son and grandson of mountain men , was born with a talent . It was not altogether an accident that he became a success later . He was by his very nature a man of business , an organizer of men and affairs .

Do not be too quick to condemn them . Wait . I lave you had the opportunity for wealth and the power that at wealth brings ? For a long time the industrial organizerswere America 's heroes , looked up to by American youth ... their glory is fading now . They were more influential in making young Americans than the Jeffersons and Lincolns . Is it worth while naming some of them . . t h e Rockefellers , Goulds , Harrimans , etc. , etc. , etc. ? A list of names could be made covering a long page . Did I say their glory has passed ? Do you live in any small or fairly large American town ?

" A stitch in time saves nine . " . . . " Take care of the pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves . " Later product of that last , " Safety first . " There came a time when the young Tom Halsey left his father 's house . He had already got his start . He had a calf his father gave him , and that grew into a cow . In a year when the moss in the old forest was thick on the ground two young pigs he had acquired grew into fat hogs at no cost to young Tom. 13c careful , be cautious , be shrewd . Do not mind too much using others . Be as fair with them as you can . Tom was never much of a talker . Do n't waste words either . He went once to make some liquor with his father , when he was still little more than a boy . They were walking up a long mountaintrail . They were going to a certain spot , beside a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in . Tom 's father had an idea . He spoke of it as the two made their way up the path . They had been up there some time before to set the mash , to make the beer for the run . It was to be a big one , the biggest they had ever made . The father walked in front , not looking back . " Now you look here , . Tom " . . . the father spoke of his plan . There was a good and growing sale for liquor in the lumber camp where he had been at work . He had got off work for two or three weeks and had tramped home , over the mountains from the big lumber cutting forty miles away . " You will bring the stuff over there at night . " He named a certain date . He was to go back to the camp in a few days . The idea was that the boy was to haul the liquor to the vicinity of the camp atp127night . It would take two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the day . The father would meet him on the second night and together they would store the liquor in a place near the camp where the father could get it out , a gallon at a time . It would bring a good price . There was : m advantage , the father being there , one of the workmen . The man at the head of the camp was sharp on bootleggers . The sharpness had driven up the prices . The father was telling the son . He was taking him into his plan . Well , not quite . They walked along in silence for a time and then the boy spoke and the father turned in the path to look at him . There was that quality in the young Tom . It was always in him . He did not get excited , speak sharply . He meant what he said . There was a certain finality that made others stop , take a look , wonder . It was the sort of remark a mountain boy did not make to his own father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of suspense , there on the mountainside becenthe two . . . this after the father had stopped and was looking at young Tom .

As though birds in the woods might be singing the words , c wind that blew among the trees carrying the words . " And me ? And me ? And me ? " " Now there has come the time for the bargain between W. " The above words not said ... just the , " And me ... and Inc . . . and me. "  |p128But  a mountain man , if he is a man , does not bargain with his son . He orders and the son obeys . " And me ? And me ? And me ? " Young Tom , even then , would not have been defiant . He was handling his father as later he handled officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His " and me " was rather an explanation . " You see , you do not understand . I am not merely a mountain boy , son of a mountain man . I am myself . " I have certain plans , not very definite yet . You have to begin small , but you must take advantage of every opportunity . The time will come when I will command men , will command affairs . " The " and me . " What an influence it has had in the affairs of the world , eh ? The father turned , after a long silent look at the son and went on along the trail up the mountain and the son followed in silence . He had n't said , " If you do n't split I wo n't do it , I wo n't play ball , " but the words were implicit in his voice , the sound of his voice , a certain quiet thing in his eyes . Already he had the cow . It was his and he had sold the fat pigs . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife , set up for himself , on less . The father went along before his son in silence . He was . thinking . If he took some other mountain man in with him , to make the stuff at home , haul it to the camp , take most of the risk , he would have to share . The boy had not defied him . He had asked a question . There were no other sons at home . The boy was already trained as a liquor maker . There was a quality Tom had from the beginning . If he got what he wanted he did not try to win moral or spiritual victories . It was as though hepI29said to himself . . . " Be careful now . A man wants to keep Isis self-respect . Be careful . Give the other fellow a way out . If lie wants to feel big , you let him . You get what you 're after .

We will make some money . " By God , you shall have your share , " he said . Get a little and a little more . Do n't waste anything at first .

What hope , what longing . It is generally understood that blondes do it best . As it happened , however , Tom Halsey was one of thep131lucky ones . A woman came to him when he was very young . She was not a woman . She was a young girl but , in the mountains , young girls suddenly and mysteriously become women . Torn was working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring , and the field went down to a mountain road . You went along the mountain road , perhaps a quarter of a mile , to the Halsey house , a large and rather comfortable log farmhouse . At the foot of the field , near the road , there was a spring and locust trees grew there , spreadingtheir branches out over the spring . The locust puts out its leaves late in the spring . How delicate and feathery they arc . The honey locust blooms riotously and the trees are covered with bees . They make a soft , sometimes loud , murmuringsound . Tom was hoeing corn , working it for the first time , and an odd caravan came along the road . But the caravan was n't so odd . It was a sight Tom had seen before . Some little mountain farmer had failed . He had been living on a mountainside farm somewhere back up in the hills , a man of fifty , with pale watery eyes and a little scrawny red beard , now turning gray . It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and several children , some of them quite young . Why , what a producer . It was , in the mountains , a commonenough sight . Look . There are twelve , thirteen , perapsfourteen kids . The man has two half-broken-down old horses and there is a wagon , the wheels tied in place by ropes , and on the wagon , pretty much covered with younger children clinging on , there are a few sticks of furniture , some dirty torn blankets and equally torn and dirty bed ticks . On one of the blankets , held in the arms of a girl child of eight , a sickly looking pale child , there is a babep132and it cries lustily . The babe is not sickly . It will still be at the breast of the woman , the mother , who sits on the wagon beside the man . She is a huge fat woman who looks like an old Indian squaw . She may be that . She sits so placidly as the wagon crawls creaking along , Tom , in the field , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an Indian . There are still small fragments of Indian tribes in the hills . Torn is standing and looking . He looks with impersonal eyes . The hill farmer on the wagon has had ill luck . He had a crop of corn planted and there came a great rain . The corn was planted on new ground in a sloping field and the man and the children had worked all winter clearing the land . It was a piece of cheap land , the timber having been taken off some years before . And then the great rain came , the water washed down the hill and across the face of the field . There was nothing to be done . The man stood helpless . He was a man who had always had ill luck . His wife was slovenly , a bad housekeeper and a bad cook and as her children dropped from her .. . they came regularly , one after another , easily , falling from between her great thighs , they were all girl children . What is a man to do about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil in the new ground washed away , the young corn gone , all washed ' away . There were three young calves and three cows and two sows , soon to farrow , in the field by the creek . It was a long narrow field and the grass was good . In the mountains when the great rains come , in country where the timber has been cut off , small mountain streams become suddenly torrents . It may happen without warning . The great rain may be above you , far up some mountain . It may be the rainp133tomes at night , when a man is asleep . The calves , sows and tows were all drowned . Last year the bean beetles took his beans . He had four fine hogs , fat , almost ready to kill . He had driven them down , out of an upper oak forest where they had grown fat on the fallen acorns . It was almost killing time but they till took the cholera and died . What was the use ? What was a man to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far away , a hundred miles , there was work to be had for women and girls . Some of his girls were quite big now . There was a cotton mill in the town . It took such girls . It was no place for a man . They did not take a man of fifty , did not want such men , but a man must do something . Hungry children must be ( cal . The man sat sadly on the broken seat of his broken wagon beside his fat silent placid wife , driving his bony team . In the town to which he was going , a growing industrialtown , the girls would find work . They would earn money . There were some five or six girls , now old enough to go to work . He himself would have to sit at home , with the fat wife , in a house in a mill village . Or in the afternoon , he would wander about . There would be other men like himself , " mill daddies . " His old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the end , he would begin working about the house , doing women'swork , making beds , sweeping , helping with the cooking . The wagon went its painful way along the road . There had been a dry time and there was dust . The wheels made crazy tracks in the road . Three or four older girls walked behind the wagon . The caravan passed , young Tom standingand staring , no word , no sign passed between him and the man , between him and the girls . It went down the sloping road , the crooked wheels catching on protruding rocks . Often the wagon came to a dead stop . " Why does n't he make that fat old mother get out and walk ? " There was a little creek to be forded and beyond a little rise just before you came to the Halsey house . The team struggled , the man slashing at them with a whip , Tom staring . " They 'll never make it . " And how did the team manage to get up hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of such mountainroad to be covered before the caravan reached the cotton-milltown . Tom turned to go back to his work and then stopped . There was still another girl , belonging to the family , a slenderpale woman child of fourteen or fifteen . She was comingalong the road alone , stumbling along . She did not see Tom standing there . She was bare-legged , bare-footed . She was ill . She stopped by the fence near the spring and struggled to get over , still not seeing Tom . Her cheeks were flushed , as with a fever , and she appeared as though drunken . Had the others forgotten her ? She had become ill and had stopped beside the road to rest and was now trying to overtake the wagon , but she had noticed the spring just inside the field and was trying to get to it . In such a family , one child would not be missed . She looked very ill . She might die . Something in Tom was touched . Why , how pretty she was ! Her illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got to the top of the rail fence , had one leg over  --  what a clear-cut lovely little face , now drawn with pain , lines of suffering showing on such ap135young face . She had yellow hair , a mass of it , fallen down over young shoulders . " She will fall , " Tom thought . He sprang toward her . I t may have been his sudden appearance that startled her , threw her off balance . There was a little cry from her and she fell . She lay still on the grass under the fence . And now something else happened . Tom had run to the girl under the fence , had picked her up , was holding her in is arms , and had faced about . . . she was unconscious , had erltaps struck her head in falling . . . he was facing the road lid the Halsey house , and the wagon had struggled up the little slope and was before the house . I t broke down . There was a crash . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its contents , the few sticks f furniture , bedding , assortment of girl children of all ages , Itc fat old mother , the defeated mountain farmer , all were lumped in the road . There were screams . There were cries . Tom , as he stood folding the unconscious girl child , saw his mother run out of the house to the road . At that time Tom was alone at tome with his mother , a strong , rather mannish-looking woman . He laid the unconscious girl as tenderly as he bold on the fence top , her arms and head hanging down Nt one side and her feet and bare slender legs on the other , nil bolted over . With her in his arms he went , half running , long the road to the house . It was Tom Halsey himself who afterwards told Kit Brannnof what happened to his young wife , the mother of his n Gordon who became Kit 's husband . He got to her house that day , and afterwards for several weeks she was ill there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a distant town to bring a doctor , sometimes at night . As for her family , the wagon again patched , they went on their way , having spent the night and a part of the next day at the Halsey place . To the fat mother and perhaps to the father she was just another girl child . Such a woman could drop another . It was easy for her , and Tom 's mother , although she looked mannish , had a woman 's heart . She was glad enough to get the girl . " If she lives , she may be a comfort , " she thought . She did live and she became Tom 's wife , but she was never strong . Tom told Kit the story of his short life with her and of her death . He had got his own place and already he had got into the liquor business in a small way . He had got his neighbors , who were liquor makers . . . there were enough of them , all small makers , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . he had got them all to bring the stuff to him . He told Kit how it was with him at that time . His son had been born and his wife was again ill . She had begun nursing her child but one of her breasts had caked and he had to take her off to a distant town to have it lanced . He had wanted to take her to a big town , perhaps to the very cotton-milltown that had swallowed up her family . . . she had never heard from them again after they disappeared down the road . . . there was a hospital at that place . . . he had n't the money . He had got a mountain doctor who had done his job crudely . His wife 's breast became infected and there was high fever . Tom was in a fix . He was worried . He was frightened . The doctor who had lanced the breast told him that it would be dangerous to try to move her . He had come withp137his young wife into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house and had bought a little farm there . He did not know his neighbors very well yet and already he was in debt to some of them . He had taken their liquor to handle , had begun to build up a trade in distant towns . 1k had taken several trips with his loaded wagon at night but some of the money that should have gone to the liquor makers had been spent . He told Kit of calling his neighbors together . " This is how it is with me . My wife is dying and the doctor says she can not be moved , but I intend to move her . I must havemoney . " Beside the cotton-mill town there was another industrial town , some thirty miles away , but there was no hospital in that place . Tom had been there several times . Thereas a man of the town . A note of bitterness , of contempt , crept into Tom 's voice hen he spoke of that man . It was n't a pleasant picture . He was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans ' an we other Americans care to realize . He had made . oney rapidly after a long early struggle . . . a big man , with a big head , big shoulders and body . Once he had been laborer in a lumber camp . Often such men , when they creed . . . they have done hard , heavy manual work dur-g youth and early manhood . . . they are inclined to eat hugely , drink hugely . Later they sit all day and every day at a desk . They go with the heavy living and while they still appear strong err is a gradual breaking down of something inside . Tom id that this one had got hold of some invention . It was a tool widely used and useful to farmers , not of the hills but of the Northern plains , and was built largely of wood . He had understood how to get money from banks , how to advertise . Perhaps he had come South , into a Southern industrialtown , because wood was cheap there and labor cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife had died . He prided himself on being a sport , on living flashily . His mind had taken that turn . He drove a big sport motor car and wore heavy homespun clothes imported from England . He had got him a big house , at the edge of the town where he had set up his factory and had guests down from Northern cities . " You must come down to my place . It is in the mountains , in the Blue Ridge . " If you want to bring a woman along . . . " Laughter . He poked the man in the ribs or slapped him on the back . " You know . . . make it a vacation , " he said . This was beforeprohibition but there was local option in the county and he had built a bar in the basement of his house . The Southern industrial town was a county seat and before and after the coming of prohibition , the jail there was constantly filled with violators of illicit liquor laws . They were all poor men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories in the town , sons of laborers , mountain farmers , caught at the still , sons of these men bringing moon whiskey . in to serve the town . The rich and the well-to-do and the sons of these did not get into jail . The whole town knew of the bar in the rich man 's house . He gave money to charity . He helped support the churches of the town . Tom told Kit , speaking bitterly , stories of how the man lived . He loved getting the sons and daughters of the town people , sons and daughters of merchants , lawyers , successfuldoctors into his house and getting them drunk . He hadp139become somewhat jaded about women but still loved touchingthem , the young ones . He wanted to put his hands on than , stand close , run his hands over young female bodies . There are such men . Once perhaps they had something to give a woman . It got lost , was petered away . " I 'd do anything for you , little girl . Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . Hands creeping down over hips , over breasts . Men of the town , the respectable women . f the town , older women , leaders in the churches , knew ofthese things . The town was filled with whispers . Nothingas done . The young people continued to go to the parties t his house . It was a little hard to refuse . " Be careful . Do  --  of offend this man . He has power . " I le wanted to be known as a sport , a dashing figure of a an , but he was also frugal . Men who grow rich are frugal nd careful in small things . For his bar he brought in licquors from Northern cities . . . . " You see , " he said .. . c put on a white apron , became a bartender for his csts . . . . " You see , it is good stuff .

Torn Halsey drove at night . . . it was a Saturday night . . in at the man 's driveway and on past the brightly ' bred house to where there was a big brick garage . There as room in the garage for several cars . Tom drove his m  --  the wagon well loaded , and it made racket enough . was no wonder that , later , when he became a successful illicit liquor man , making plenty of money , he insisted on big powerful , silent cars . The house of the successful manufacturerwas surrounded by several acres of land and was outside the town limits . It was a summer night and the house and yard were filled with young couples . Some of the young men , seen by Tom , as he drove in . . . they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in evening clothes . Young women were in light summer dresses . It is so nice , with your hands , to feel the body of a young woman , under a light summer dress . Tom was in a hurry . There was a negro man , dressed in uniform , who came to him when he had stopped the team near the garage and Tom spoke to him . He did n't waste words . " Look here , nigger , I 'm in a hurry . You tell your boss . Goddam your black soul , you get him out here , and quick . " He said no more . The man went and presently there was the big man , the rich man , the flashy one . He was angry . He was upset . " Why , yes . I have bought stuff from you but for God 's sake , man . . . have n't you any sense ? " . . . he made a sign towards Tom 's team .. . bringing that in here . There are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a man who is such a damned fool . " The two men were walking in a path near the garage . ' There was a light over the garage door and they went along the side of the building and stopped . Tom tried to explain . " But my wife is very ill . She may die . I must have money . I could unload it back here . " He even pleaded , but as the man did not at once respond his voice grew harsh . However he did not shout . He was sizingup his man . " He is pretty big . " Tom was himself a small141p141man . " He has led a certain kind of life for a long time now . He 's probably soft . " " That nigger of yours , in that uniform ... there are 150 gallons . . . I want you to take it all .. . it is a hurry up matter with me . . . I tell you my wife is ill . . . I 've got to have money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oo . . . I know damned well you always have cash , plenty of it . . . you are the kind . " His voice was growing more and more harsh . " You are the kind that likes to pull a big roll , flash it before people . Goddam you . " Ile was astonishing the man , throwing him off guard . " ' There are some bushes here . " He pointed . They stood near the wall of the garage . " I 'll unload it quickly enough . Your nigger can put it away . While I am unloading you will go into the house and get the money . " If you have n't it on you . Have you ? " The man laughed . After all he had once been a lumberjack . If he had only taken care of his big body through the years . The man before him was after all small . " Why , you impertinent little runt ! " He got no further . Tom leaped and had him by the throat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a horse . After all , the man would not shout . He would not dare . " Oh , these big bugs , " Tom said , long afterwards , telling of the moment . It did n't last long , a short struggle , the man 's arms flailing about , hitting nothing , his breath going . Tom was close in where the big fists could n't hurt him . His rather small hands were very powerful . " Will you or wo n't you ? If you shout end they come I 'll kill you and them . " He let go the man 's throat . He knew he had him . " If you go in there and do n't come out with it , at once , I 'll come in after you . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " my wife 's dying . " The man went. 142p142Tom drove home . He told Kit that he forgot about the liquor , did not remember to unload it . The way home was over very rough roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking , he said . There was a drip , drip , drip of mountain liquor in a mountain road . He lashed his team , nearly killing the horses . When he got to his house there were several men , mountain men , neighbors , loitering in the dark road before his house . Their women were inside . They were the men who had trusted him with the liquor but they were not there to collect . Their wives were trying to save Tom 's wife , but it was too late . She died that night , just as he stopped his team before the house . . . steam arisingin clouds from the half-dead animals . . . they breathed in gasps , nostrils vibrating . . . it was a pretty good team , young horses . His wife died but his son lived .   KIT thought that Tom Halsey must have seen the woman Kate before his wife died . She and her husband , a mountain preacher , lived in the same settlement in the mountains where Tom had his farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same night , a tragedy also happened to Kate . She was laid abed of her first child and it died . Tom may have heard of her loss . Almost every day he had been driving to a distant town . There was trouble in getting a food his babe would take . He had consulteddoctors , had , at their advice , bought certain patent baby foods that were tried unsuccessfully . When he went hurriedly off to town thus , his way lay past a certain mountaincabin . It sat back from the road on the side of a hill , a flimsy little one-room structure built of unpainted boards . For some reason , unexplained , Kit telling Kate 's story , knew that there were great masses of tiger lilies in the yard before the door and she thought that Tom might have noticed the woman , having heard her story , and after she had got out of her bed of illness . . . the husband would be away from home . . . he always was . . . he was a God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been off somewhere working in God 's vineyard , herding theP144strayed sheep , lifting the fallen . The woman would have been seated in the doorway of her little house , behind the masses of tiger lilies , head in hands , gazing off toward the distant blue hills , sunk in the terrible sorrow that comes to the woman who loses the first fruit of the womb . Her husband was an uneducated man . He could just read and write . In the mountains there are many such men . They are not called to God 's ministry by the church . God calls them directly . He had been , before God called him , a rather quiet , somewhat sensitive and frightened boy , and was one of a large family . His name was Joseph Lawler and his father , Ike Lawler , was a man well known and a good deal feared in all that section of the mountains . He was a big man , tall and with small shifty eyes and was notoriously lazy but , although he himself did no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into his possession and he did the same with his wife and children . The mountains were full of stories about Ike Lawler . His wife , a heavy fat woman , like Tom 's mother-in-law , was always having children . As with the Indian woman , the mother of Tom 's wife , they dropped almost casually from her . It was said that she once dropped one in a field where , under the eye of her husband , she had been kept at work until the last possible moment . There were fourteen of the children , twelve of them boys , and when a new one was born Ike Lawler did not waste time on sentimentality but made his wife get out of bed and get back to work at once . He was , in a small way , successful . Although he owned little land , he was always arranging with others for the working of land on shares and often the fields , so worked , would be a long way from his house and Kit said . . . she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's later rumrunners , from that neighborhood . . . that he would be seen by neighbors herding his family along a road to their work . He himself would be astride a horse , a long horsewhip in his hand , a whip he was passionately fond of using on his wife or one of his children , the processiongoing along a road or across fields . He was also , in a small way , a thief and was in the habit of . going at night with two or three of the sons to rob his neighbors ' hen roosts . He did not work , when so occupied , in his awn immediateneighborhood , but started in the late afternoon and went many miles , often into some mountain town . He himself did not approach the hen roosts . He stayed hidden in some near-by wood and sent the sons . If they were caught and arrested it would be they who would have to serve the jail sentences . In the mountains there was a story that , once , when he had no horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it could not work , he hitched his wife and two of his sons to a plow , himself for once taking the plow handles , and that he thus plowed a field . So there was this man and his family and it was a summer day and the family were at work in a field . The field was far from the Lawler home and was at the very top of a high hill . It was flat up there and the field was new land . There had been a stand of timber but it had been killed by the process known as " ringing . " In the upper field , where the Lawler family were at work , there was a whole forest of such trees . Dead trees standing up thus put out no leaves . They turn gray . After a time they tremble in every wind . There are no masses of leaves to keep the warm sun from the good earth . The trees are but the ghosts of trees . To break up such new ground , under the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . The plowP146point catches upon tree roots , there is a tangle of the roots of smaller trees and bushes . The work in the field had been done and the field planted to corn . The young corn was ready to be hoed but Ike Lawler did not stay in the field . He had his wife up there , one of the girl children and the young Joseph . Joseph was then a boy of twelve and was thin and sickly . He spent his days being frightened and his nights having strange dreams . It was because of religion . Going to meeting was almost the only diversion for the mountain people and there had been a series of meetings in a little church in the neighborhood . Ike Lawler did not stay that day in the upper field . He had others of his children at work in other fields . " I want this field all worked out by tonight , " he said . The fat old mother was again pregnant . She grunted as she worked . At noon there was , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . It was a hot day and as the afternon began to grow long there was , on the part of all three of the workers , a growingfear that the field would not be finished . They did not speak of it . They worked more and more hurriedly and feverishly . The thin-legged sickly boy Joseph may have gone a little off his head . He began talking aloud to himself , " Am I one of God 's children or am I not ? " he asked . " Will God some day speak to me ? If I die suddenly will I go to Heaven or will I go to hell ? Will God speak to me as he did to Paul on the road to Damascus ? " It may be that he had begun to have ambitious dreams . In the mountain churches men spoke of the call , direct from God , to God 's ministry . There was a storm , coming quickly as storms do in high mountain places . There were black clouds creeping upP147over distant mountain ridges , plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds became spread out . They covered the sky . It remained very still , very hot in the field . There was 1.1pid movement in the masses of black clouds overhead while down below all was still . It would have been well for the mother and children if they had run into a near-by wood , where the trees were still strong and alive or down the mountain toward their home . They did n't dare . The old mother , heavy with child , went along the rows , working desperately , groaning , under the tall ghosts of trees , the childrenfollowing , Joseph muttering . The girl child had begun o cry . There was another quick change . It had been still and hotthe field but suddenly a cold wind began to blow and cry moment it increased in violence . It made a low whining noise rushing through the branches of the bare dead es and at once smaller branches began to break and fall . hey were carried along by the racing wind . The whole scene was like a stage set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they suddenly stopped and stood . Branches from the dead trees be- ! an flying past them and with every minute the violence of wind increased . Now the black mass of clouds overbeadwas torn into ribbons . As the three stood , carried suddenly thus out of one fear .. the fear of not getting the work done ... into this newar , fear of the husband and father on the one side and Godar on the other . . . the father Ike Lawler appeared . He had been at the house of a neighbor , one of his own stripe , and had been drinking there . He had traded horses and was astride a great awkward work horse he had got , P148a horse very huge and very bony . He was beating the horse with his whip as he rode down toward his family . Being rather drunk , he was without fear of the storm . So he had told the wife , son , and daughter to finish the field and now night was coming and it was not finished . He had mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " Why , what are you doing here ? Why are you standing and loafing ? To work , I tell you , to work , " he yelled , riding down upon them . If he was not frightened the horse was . It was a huge , awkward , bony old work-horse but had become mad and unmanageable with fright . It reared , stood on its hind legs , grotesquely . The masses of black and gray clouds fell down over the scene . They became a dirty flying gray mist that hid the horse and rider from the three workers and then the rain came with an even louder roar of wind . It was a bedlam and Joseph Lawler always remembered the scene afterwards . When he became a mountain preacher and told of it the scene grew more and more wonderful . He said that there was the man , representing evil , roaring in the storm and that there was a moment when the wind blew a little clear place in the blackness and that , standing and trembling , he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that God spoke clearly to him but what it was that God said to him he would not tell . He grew mysterious . " It is not to be told . The words of God are not to be told to mortal ears , " he said . The horse , with its rider , the horse maddened by fright and by the lash of Ike Lawler 's whip , rode down upon the others and the girl child , Joseph Lawler'ssister , was knocked down and hurt . Later she died of the hurt . The great wind was blowing down the dead trees . TheyP149began falling . The trees were like rows of dominoes set up on the floor by a child at play . One domino , at the end , is touched by the child 's finger and down they all come . The falling limb of a great tree struck Ike Lawler and knocked him from his horse . He was badly hurt and later , after the mother , who by some miracle escaped , had got down out of the field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house . And where was the boy Joseph ? How significant ! Several men of the neighborhood brought up there by the mother found him , and even Ike Lawler was impressed by their story . Two great trees had fallen making a gigantic cross and there was the boy apparently stunned . . . it may have been no more than fright . . . he was uninjured . . . he may have climbed to the position in which he was found . He lay very still and white . As he lay thus he was exactly the figure of the Christ on the cross . He was unconscious but when a man picked him from the cross he spoke . " I saw God , " he said , quietly enough . " God took care of me . He spoke to me in the storm . " It was enough . To the mountain people , even to his father , Joseph Lawler became something special . More and more , as he grew into young manhood , he lived a life apart from others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking and exhorting in the streets of mountaintowns and in cabins . He came along a mountain road and stopped before a cabin . " Come out . Come out , " he called , " God is calling to you , " and when the people had come out of the house he knelt in the road and prayed loudly for the people of the house . He began to get a small following , among others the mountain girl Kate , who became his wife . She was theP15o woman Tom Halsey had perhaps seen , after she had lost her child , sitting by the door of her house and looking out over the hills . She had followed her preacher husband in his wanderings over the hills . . . at first he called himself a Baptist but later he adopted the Holiness faith . . . and there were several others , among them two old men . and a half insane old woman . The little cavalcade took pilgrimages , sometimes lasting for several days or weeks , through the hills . At night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become more and more sure of himself , more and more imperious . He demanded food for himself and his followers and a place for them to sleep . " It is God 's wish , " he said . He had grown constantly more and more adept as an interpreter of God 's wishes . Kate was his wife  --  or mistress . The young preacher had not been legally married to his woman . " God has married us , " he said to her and to the others among his followers . That was also a story . Tom once told Kit Brandon about it . " I had a feeling , " he said . He meant to imply that what he did was not very definitely thought out . He was at home on the little farm he had got . . . this some days after his wife 's death . He did not remember how much time had passed . His mother had come to his new home to take care of the babe . He was in trouble . As has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doc- . for and got from a drug store in a distant town , had proved ineffectual and his child was starving . He was at work one day in his field but suddenly stopped work . He stood gazing at the sky . " There is no use crying out to God . " He told Kit later that he did not remember much of what happened to him that day . It was late after-P151noon and he had been hoeing corn . " God takes care of the man who takes care of himself . " " God is on the side of the big battalions . " Anyway Tom Halsey was not literary . " If I stand here like this my babe , my son , will also die . " He threw his hoe into a fence corner and started toward his house . He got down to his barn and saddled a horse . " There is needed a woman who can nurse my son . " He may have heard that the woman Kate had lost her babe . He mounted the horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the babe . " 1 Lis mother protested . " What are you going to do , Tom ? The baby is too sick to be moved . " She had come to the door of the house with the sickly , starved child in her arms . He did not answer but , getting off the horse , went to her and took the child from her arms . The mother stood in the little yard before Tom 's mountain cabin protesting violently , but without another word to her and with the child in his arms he mounted his horse and toile away . The young preacher , of the Holiness faith , whose followinghad grown , had got himself a tent in which he heldmeetings , moving from place to place through the mounins . He was holding meetings in a field , near his ownhome , at the time when Tom Halsey set out with his babehis arms . Tom was not very clear as to what had haptiedto him during the late afternoon and early eveningOf that day . He may just have ridden rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got , there was ameeting being held . The preacher 's wife , the woman Kate , was there . She was a little ill . Her breasts were hurting . Thetent , a ragged dirty one , without walls , was a mere shelter .   It had been pitched close beside a road and was filled with mountain people . They sat , with heavy serious faces . The preacher had for a light a sputtering kerosene torch , hung from the ceiling of the tent , and the light from it played over the faces . It played over the face of the young preacher . He was exhorting . He half wept . He shouted . Little flecks of spittle formed in the corners of his mouth . There were groans from the audience . A wailing woman 's voice arose . " Oh , God , God , look down on me . . . speak to me as you once spoke to him , " she cried . The preacher had again told the story of the storm and of his own direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , the story always growing and growing . The meeting that night had not really got well going . Presently it would be better . God 's spirit would manifest itself . There would be screams , women rolling on the ground , cries from the throats of men . The meeting was however spoiled . Tom Halsey , the sick child in his arms , rode along the road beside which the tent was pitched . He stopped his horse and getting down came into the tent with the child in his arms . He also may have been temporarily a little off his head . He had been passionatelydevoted to his wife . He stood in the tent , under the sputtering light , looking about , and then went to where the preacher 's wife sat , rather apart from all the others . She ' was on the very front one of the rude benches . The benches were but rough boards laid on logs . Tom went to the woman and sat beside her and immediatelythe thing happened . He began to look steadily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spoke . It may be she did not look at Tom but at the babe . " My own babe has been torn from my arms by death . Come to my arms , comeP153to my breast , thou hungry one . " She became fascinated , staring , and the preacher , looking down at her and at Tom Halsey , was profoundly disturbed . Well , and what of him ? It may be that thoughts rushed through the woman 's mind . He had said that God had taken their child and had seemed almost cheerful about it . It was another thing to speak about in his sermons . " God wants me to go on doing I I is glorious work . He has taken my child , a little saint now in Heaven , to have there , as a shining thing , a shining lightto me . " And so . . . bitter thoughts perhaps in the mind of the Woman , the mother , sitting and hearing his words , a bitter hurting in her breast . As she stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , tears came to her eyes . And then Tom Halsey did something . He arose . He stood before the woman .. The preacher , on his little raised platrm , stopped speaking and a hush fell over the audience . he woman was clad in a simple cotton gown . that buttoned own the front and Tom reached down and began to unbuttonit . She did not move but when he put the child to her breast , an ecstatic look came into her eyes . There was a commotion . The preacher 's words died onhis lips and he sprang down from his raised place and stoodbefore Tom and the woman . " Well , " he said . He had gonehite . His mouth opened and closed . As for Tom and theWoman . . . it was as though they had both suddenly become aware that what had happened . . . such a personal , such aprivate matter . . . had happened in a public place . Thewoman arose , the child still at the breast and stood besideTom . She was staring now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . With the man , her husband , thatP154God man , she had once followed blindly , with blind faith , like the others in the tent . . . all now staring at her with fixed stares of astonishment . . . she had nothing to do . With Tom Halsey she could live again . He was connected with the child in her arms , at her breasts . The young preacher continued to stand , his mouth opening and closing . " Kate , " he said , but she did not answer , did not look at him . She was looking at Tom , as though expectant . " What now ? " She did not speak . She stood waiting . She did not have to wait long . " Come on , " Tom said , and led the way out of the tent , the preacher following . Men and women of the audience arose from their seats and followed . Tom led the way to where the horse was tethered and helping her on again put the babe into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Put your arm about me , " he said , " you wo n't fall . " The preacher had fallen to his knees in the dust of the road and was crying out to his God . " Do n't let her go away with him . God , do n't let her go , " he cried . The astonished people stood in silence as Tom and the woman Kate rode away into the darkness .   THERE was another adventure coming Kit Brandon'sway before the big adventure of marriage . She had begun her flight . . . young , pretty , goodlookingAmerican woman on the move . She had n't yet gone very far , in a certain direction . There had been n alive pert little one , named Sarah , she had known in the of ton mill . ' " Life 's a game . " " Play to win . " " Learn to use what you 've got . " " If you do n't put it over on them they 'll put it over on you . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , factory hand . . . . " Say Bill , I 'm ping to pull my freight out of here . I 'm going to Baltimore . . . to Frisco . . . to Cleveland . . . to Kansas CityI hear it 's swell out there . " Labor turnover in more than one American factory as high as fifty , sixty , seventy-five per cent in a year . The word is t hat they have the same problem over in Russia . As for the matter of a " certain direction , " that 's putting k delicately enough , eh ? . . . Kit did n't count a certain threatened happening with her own father . . . by a certainmountain stream . . . after bathing . . . being bathed by the hands of another . . . in soft evening light when she was a child . It might have happened then , but it did n't . She got out of the cotton-mill town suddenly one hot summer clay , took a train to another industrial town of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . They always manage to make a place for the young pretty fairly welldressedones , if they look strong enough to stand up to it . Kit had got the faculty , the trick  --  it is born in some women  --  of wearing clothes . There are some of them , as the saying goes , who can take almost any kind of rag , put it on , make it look like Park Avenue . She had it . It was partly study and observation . She had even changed her way of walking , of carrying her body , holding her head , getting a certain dignity and grace . As they say of colts at the race tracks , she was about ready to go to the races . As for the shoe-factory town . . . she always thought of it afterwards only in this way as . . . " that place where the shoe factory is . " It was a big town , set on the side of a hill . There were big hills , really mountains , climbing up back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down hills . You stood in one of the streets and looked down on the roofs of the houses in the next street below . Far down below there was a river , very charming sometimes to see from above . . . the factory was down near the river and near railroadtracks . . . the river gleaming gold sometimes when the sun was setting , red sometimes , sometimes a dirty yellow , sometimes when the sky was overcast , steel gray . Kit did n't notice it much . She had a room with an Italian woman in a street also down near the river . The woman had left her husband and had a son , a clerk in a grocery store , who livedP157with his mother and he at once began trying to " make " Kit . I k did n't get far although the mother was always singing his praises . " I tell you he 's a good boy . " He was a man of twenty-seven and unmarried . " When he was in school he was always the smartest one in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store had got into trouble with a married woman and , in danger of being shot , had fled and she had got a divorce . The woman wanted her son to marry and have children . " I like children about . " I tell you he 's a good boy . At the store they 're simply crazy about him . So many people come in the store .. . they wo n't have no one but my boy wait on them . " At night , when she was in bed , Kit heard the mother and son talking together in Italian . What an odd thing , the people , so near , talking in words she could n't understand . It was new knowledgeto her , that there were people , in strange places , strange countries over the world , talking in words you could n't understand . So much new knowledge to get . The son had sleek shiny black hair and black eyes . His skin was very dark . Soon he would be fat , a fat Italian man . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confuse him . You had to learn the trick . Hold yourself back , learn to keep a kind of reserve . It was for Kit a time of slow awakening . . . " soon I 'll be a woman . " .. . " A good many women are married even at the age I have now come to . " Kit 's point of view on men . . . it is certainlyan important matter to any young woman of seventeenor eighteen . . . was , in an odd way , outside self , importantand not important . Talk of it always , persistently , among the young women at the factory . . . in that place she made no close friends with any of the other girls , her mood for the time to be alone . . . she went now and then to the movies and there always the man and woman thing ... long lingering kisses . " Your arms about me , darling . Oh , darling , how I have longed for you . " In that place she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought up in such families as her own , she knew how to read and write . " I had better find out more about that . " She heard from a girl in her room at the factory , a thin big-nosed girl who wore glasses , about a thing called the public library and went there one Saturday afternoon . But how were you to know what books you wanted ? There were so many . There were open shelves and she watched others , went as they did , in among books . A woman spoke to her , an older woman with white hair and a curiously gentle face . Kit thought at first she had something to do with the place but was mistaken . She was just an older woman sensing Kit 's confusion . " May I help you ? " " Yes . " Confusion in Kit too , then a sudden impulse to be downright with that one . It was the woman to woman thing again , the instinct in other women to like Kit , in an odd way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a factory girl . I 've never been in a place like this before . I know nothing of books . " The woman smiled , but nicely , Kit thought . " Odd , my fight . in life is going to be with men , not with other women . " That thought not definite in Kit and yet the understandingof it in her almost from the beginning . " Do you want a love story ? " " No . " The woman smiled . " Oh , so not that ? " she said . " Well , let 's look about . Will it be something about people , or perhaps history ? " She was going along the rows of books and suddenlyP159stopped . Kit followed . Could it be that any one was familiar with so many books ? History ? Kit had but a vague idea of what the word meant . How many words also to know about . Words also opened out new vistas in life . There was a sudden longing that morning to be more like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quality , firm but gentle . " She 's never worked in any factory , " Kit thought . The woman revolutionist , Agnes , who had been Kit 's friend and who was always talking about the rich and the poor . . . . " The rich are pretty much all skunks . . . . They have to be wiped out , done away with . " Such notions had never made a deep impression on Kit . There might even be a certain advantage to the unbalance . There could be such a thing as intelligent luxury , soft fine fabrics out of which to make clothes , life on a certain high plane of mind and body . All of this to be sure , dim , oh , very dim , in Kit . The woman took a book from the shelf . " It 's a book by TheodoreDreiser . He may be our great novelist . " The title of the book was Sister Carrie . The woman helped Kit about the making out of her application for taking the book out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town and she signed it . Her name was Holbrook . She did not work in the library . There was a pile of books on a counter and the woman went to an outer door and called a Negro who came and got them . She was some swell . " Are you going anywhere I could take you ? " she asked Kit . " No . I am just going home . " " Well , come on . Let me take you . I 'll enjoy doing it . " P160It was an old story , the rich woman , some woman the wife of the man who owned such a factory as the one Kit worked in . Kit 's chance acquaintance was not like that but her associates were mostly like that . Such women ca n't avoid seeing young working women , many of them comely , even beautiful women . Such a woman may be childless . Mrs. Holbrook had a woman acquaintance who had no children and who kept fourteen Angora cats . She fed them on pate de f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . . . chatter , chatter , chatter , at garden parties , at teas . . . the servant class , the working class . . . the rich constantly doing more than the workers to build up the idea of the much-talkedofthing , class consciousness .

But alas and alas , for even the most wealthy , in secret moments , a kind of niceness , reality of outlook , persisting in spite of ugliness , alas even envy . Things to give you a jolt .

" And sometimes these working girls . . . poor things .. . often so lovely . Why I never did any work with my hands in all my life . It is so confusing . " They went out and got into a big luxurious car and drove to where Kit lived in a little street of frame houses down by the shoe factory , the river and the railroad tracks . The woman kept talking , evidently trying to put Kit at her ease . She need n't have bothered . Kit felt quite all right . The momentary confusion that had come when the woman first spoke to her was quite gone . " My name is Mrs. Holbrook . " " Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And , sitting thus , in the luxurious car , with the rich woman , Kit 's mind drifted away from car and woman and to another woman , one she had known just before she left the cotton-mill town . That one was a gold-digger . She , Sarah , had got her hooks into a lawyer . Some man had alreadytaught Sarah to drive a car and she had got the use of the lawyer 's car and had taught Kit how to drive . It was , as Sarah said , " a pretty swell little runabout . " Sarah spoke of her man by his first name . " I 'm going to get Joe to buy me one . " Sarah had even suggested with a laugh that it would be something pretty hot if she got Joe to get the money from his rich horsey wife to buy a car for herself and told Kit that she and Joe were planning a campaign to get the money . He was to say that he had lost it playing the races . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about horses . " P162Joe had given Sarah a key and would leave his car on some side street . Occasionally , when he had to leave town she had the car over the week end . She had taught Kit to drive and Kit had caught on quickly , instinctively . " Say , kid , you are going to make one swell driver . You take to it like a fish takes to water . " Kit in the big car with the woman she had met in the library , the woman talking , trying to put Kit at her ease . She spoke of books , several of them piled on the car floor at their feet . They had , she said , something to do with a paper she was preparing for a woman 's club . . . the woman was half laughing at herself . . . it was all so silly , a person like herself pretending to be a scholar . She was to prepare a paper on the Civilization of the Ancient Greeks . Kit was not listening . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Italian woman and her son , people who could say words , speak in a way you could n't understand . She was really thinking about the car . If she had been born a man , she would have tried getting a job driving for some such rich woman . " Lord , how I 'd like getting my hand on that wheel . " Later , not much later , when Gordon Halsey , not being able to get her in any other way , proposed marriage , the thing that really induced her to make up her mind to do it , give it a trial , was that he had such a swell fast car . Odd that now the rich woman , and not Kit , was self-conscious . Kit was even a little aware of that fact . It might well have been her mountain ancestry . The mountain people can do it . There is a quality in them , it was in her father , even in that slovenly woman her mother . " Here I am . I am what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel superior to me . " It is a quality sometimes very confusingto outsiders , people not of the hills , particularly to those coming from the outside , wanting to help the poor . A mountain man or woman can look at you with an odd impersonal stare . They can look out of their eyes as gypsies look . The woman who insisted upon taking Kit quite to her rooming place kept talking . " I ca n't help thinking , often , what an injustice . " This place down here . How stupid that we have let the railroads and the factories take our river front . " She laughed , self-consciously . " Not that I should say anything . It was my father who first grabbed the river front here . " She pointed . " I dare say you work in the shoe factory . It was my father who established the shoe factory here . " And I must say I 'd hate to give up anything I 've got because of his cleverness and greediness . " She let Kit out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wooden porch before the house was terribly impressed . She had a mop and a scrub bucket and , after quickly putting them inside the door , stood , lost in wonder , staring . " I see you are not among the Greeks . You are among the Romans , " the woman said as Kit alighted , holding her book . The rich woman had got back her self-possession . " It is so hard to talk with working girls . I do n't mean they are not nice , as good as we are , perhaps better , but one does not know what to say to them . " " Yes , that 's so , " Kit said , answering the woman 's sally . What did the woman mean by Romans ? She was still thinking of the car . " God , but I would like to get my hands on it . " She had already picked up from Sarah some of the patter of car drivers , giving cars the feminine gender . " I 'll bet she could step . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . " In her absorption she even forgot to thank the rich woman for her kindness . She read the Dreiser book later in her bed at night . In that place she had a daytime job . Reading was at first slow and rather painful work . Even in so simple a story , simply told , there were so many words she did n't know . And then too it was about a woman , of a sort she already had learned to know . It might have been Sarah 's story . Sarah might also come to something like the woman of the book . She wished the story had concerned itself more with the lives of the rich . She was sitting in the railroad station . in the town of the shoe factory and by chance had the Dreiser book in her hand . There was a bag sitting at her feet . It was a Sunday afternoon and she had grown tired of sitting in her room . Downstairs , in the house of the Italians , the son was at home . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that embarrassment , the young man ogling her in that way he had . He would n't dare say anything but he would keep looking with his queer greedy greasy eyes while the mother talked . It was a bright warm day and Kit had come to a sudden decision . She had been lying in bed reading her book and suddenly got up and dressed . She packed a bag she had recently bought . " I 'm going to get out of this . " And why not get out of this town ? " She had no friends in that place . It would be something , an adventure , a new beginning . She suddenly remembered having heard one of the girls at the factory speak of another North Carolina town a hundred miles away . " It 's a fine place . There 's plenty of work there . " P165When she had said good-bye to the Italian woman , who ( protested and even threatened to weep . . . the son wanted t o carry her bag . . . dark sad Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have missed my chance " . . . she turned him away with an abrupt no . . . he did n't know how to get past it . She went into the railroad station , into the waiting room , to sit , the station was beyond the factory , on the bank of the river . On Sunday there were no afternoon trains and the big waiting room was deserted . Any way , she might as well it there . It was for Kit a beginning , a start . She had got , in the railroadstation , the young man who took her in his car to the town she had made up her mind to tackle next . Anyway it was saving railroad fare . And she was curious . He seemed all right , was perhaps three or four years older than herself . He drove a good car although it probably did n't belong to him . She had beenI sitting in the quite empty waiting room of the station when he came in , a young man , such as you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , dressed in light summer clothes . I lc had come in and tapped on the window of the ticket riflice . There was a clouded glass . There was no one there and he had turned to go out when he saw her . She had the I ) rciser book in her hand . She was n't reading , although at once , when he approached her , asking her a question , she saw that he glanced to see what she was reading . Afterward , when they were in the car , he spoke of it . " You are n't a highbrow , are you ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " That book , " he said . He said that when he was in collegeP166he had heard some of the fellows speak of it . " I do n't hold it against a fellow or a girl that he reads such books , these serious books , but I do n't go in for them myself . " He had even tried to use the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had a sister who was rather a highbrow . . . he had heard it was about a woman who was rather free with men , not being married to them . " Is that so ? " " It may be so . " His young eyes looking at her . " How do you feel about such things ? " She did n't try to answer that one . She let it go with a smile . She had really been sitting in the station , not reading , looking out a window . . . there was a printed time-table on the wall and she had figured out that there would be a train in the late afternoon , at five . There was the figure of little blond Sarah of the cotton mill in her mind . " On such a day as this she would be steppinghigh . " Sarah would have gone to live with that man , the lawyer . It was bound to happen , inevitable . Outside the station window there were just the tracks between the station and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there , low wooded hills and a clear blue sky . There were a few white houses among the trees , houses just seen , half hidden by trees . . . perhaps also in Kit thoughts of that Mrs. Holbrook . Some women get so much . Mrs. Holbrook no doubt born to it . Sarah after it . " Life 's a game . " " If you do n't put it over on them , they 'll put it over on you . " There were a few boats on the river , young men with theirP167girls out for a ride . It may be that at the moment the thing predominant in Kit 's mind was just the vague thought of distance . Always the thought of something nice out there , beyond the horizon . Mrs. Holbrook beyond the horizon . Was Sarah also ? To he a Sarah was also not so easy . Perhaps you needed to have something . Sarah , no doubt , had the feel for it , the not too much minding some one , some other person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could ? I 'm sure I want some of the things Sarah is going to get by it even more than she ' does . " There was , however , something in Sarah 's voice , in her manner , when she spoke of it , " pleasure , " that must have been it , " in being in the arms of that man . " Sarah had spoken with such enthusiasm of the hotel room , the luxury of the bed , the curtains at the window . " Gee , Kit , if we ould have dresses made of stuff like that . " " I would have liked that but to have to pay for it that ay . " Are you by any chance Miss Overton ? " That was the young man in the railroad station , who had got a sudden unch . " Gee , I 've got Dad 's car . Now if I had a swell little , ' piece , that would maybe come across . " I do n't like to be always buying it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He really meant the satisfaction of winning it . " I got it from her with my personality " .. a personal triumph . That about Miss Overton was of - arse a stall , a bluff , a way to cut in . He told her that afterardswhen they were in the car . " You know , as soon assaw you sitting in there , I thought . . . gosh , ' I thought , ' Ed like to take her with me some place in my car . ' " Kit had made it not too difficult although she had thought at once , having decided she would take him on , that itP168would be no Sarah and her Joe affair . " It may be only because he is too young , too much of a kid . " He has asked , with a rather nice boyish frankness , " Where are you going ? You are waiting for a train , are n't you ? " " Yes . " Then his proposal . She had told him where she had planned to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " Then come on , let me take you . " He had n't been able to place her , get her number , that was evident . Could she be just a little girl , ready and willingenough to be picked up by a man , any man who happenedalong . The town was full of young factory girls and at least some of them were like that . There was n't any regular house of prostitution , and young fellows of the town , sons of important citizens . . . they had to do what they could . It was an absorbingly interesting experiment for Kit , her first of the kind , trying to figure him out , be nice enough to him to get the ride to that town in his car . . . she might even work him to let her drive . " Life 's a game . " " Work them to get what you want . " He was thinking . . . " I do n't know about her . " She might be like his sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a car outside here . " He had really seen her through the window of the room , had looked in from the outside and seen her sitting there . " Gosh , there 's something nice all right . " He even told her all of this when he had got her into the car . " I was just driving past the station and thought I would run in to set my watch by the station clock . All of that , my coming in and tapping on the window , thatP169about a Miss Overton . . . it was all a bluff . " " Well , you smarty , " Kit said trying to be girlish , even a bit kittenish . He was a queer combination of caution and frankness . For example , lying to her about his name . She did n't quite know how she knew that but she did and she also lied . He might be thinking that he would get her and that later it might lead to some kind of trouble . They had got outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an open car , very nice , very light and swift . Almost at once she had got him to let her drive . They were on the great North Carolina highway that runs down southwesterlyfrom Charlotte to Greenville in South Carolina and beyond . Oh , North Carolina , the proud state , the bold state ! No longer the old North Carolina . " Old North State " of the Southern Confederacy , later poor state . " Valley of Humiliation between the two Mountains of Conceit " .. . South Carolina and Virginia . . . better forget all that . That 's all in the past . The big highway Kit was on with her catch , her hands presently at the wheel of the car , was something to excite. ou could ride all day on that highway , coming to town after town , many of the towns but a few miles apart , big towns and little towns , factory chimneys , mill chimneys never out of sight . Much of the big highway was cement hard and smooth , on such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the world but in America could  --  u see such a sight , cars by the hundreds , by the thousands , many of the cars very beautiful , the swift ride , the soft hurling through space , when you have got it into you , have the feel of it , in your own body , in your hands . The purring thing down in front , under the hood of the car . . . oh , American workmen , American inventors , you have done something here , oh mechanical age , this is your finest accomplishment . This power , this swiftness sometimes in the hands of young girls , like Kit , in the hands of fat women of forty . Look a little out for them if they have not begun to drive when they are young . . . old men , come down out of horse-and-buggy days , old gray-haired women . The long gleaming , moving , sometimes swift moving procession , Kit in it , a part of it . " Say , you are pretty handy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said once . She had just shaved a car that had come into the highway out of a side road , that had come without warning . She had whizzed past , throwing the juice to her at just the right moment , her catch sitting tense , his eyes closed . There was a heavy-handed farmer driving . " Gosh , I thought he had you . That guy ought to stay at the plow . " Her catch was still puzzled . " Say , tell me , you ai n't a highbrow , are you ? " She did n't answer but smiled . He was thinking of the book she was holding when he found her . She would have to mail it back to that libraryplace . His sister had been caught reading it by his father . His sister was a highbrow all right . He had heard there was some hot stuff in it . When he was in college . . . he had been out a year . . . there were some of the fellows . . . they went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff myself , " he said . When he read a book he wanted action , something doing all the time . He had got it into his head that she was a school teacher . " Are you ? " " I might be , " she said . Well , it was possible , a school teacher also might be had . He decided to wait until night . " You would n't mind having dinner with me , would you , we 'd go to the hotel ? " SheP171wondered if that was the way Sarah 's lawyer began with Sarah . She said she would go . " Then we can take a ride in the evening , " he said , thinking that in the darkness with her he could perhaps get his nerve up , perhaps kiss her , get his arms about her . " You 've got to work them up , get them going a little . " How transparent he was . They went to the hotel and Kit had her bag checked . He suggested that . " Do any of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was noncommittal . " It might be , " she said . She let him buy her dinner in the dining-room of a big hotel , many well-dressed people also dining . Kit being as cagy as she could , watching others not to give herself away , letting him talk . . . men and especially young men and young old men love to talk of themselves .. . What he was going to do in life . His father had a factory , he was going in and try to work to be a sales manager . He had forgotten that he had already told her his father was a doctor . " Then I 'm going to get me a swell little wife . " c described the woman he thought would make him appy as his wife , making her as much like Kit as possible . Anyway I 'm not going to marry for money . " It might be at he had noticed that her bag was a cheap one , her lathes certainly not expensive . When she had dined she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ad to go to the toilet , and going out of the dining-room , got cr hag and hurried out of the hotel . She would have to tryfind a cheap boarding house . She had a queer uncomfortable feeling . If she had been playing a game it was too easy . She felt like a hunter of big game who had been out shooting at rabbits . A. A A. AL A. AL A ALA . AL A A.

LA LA AL TOM HALSEY , the man old enough to be Kit Brandon 's father , was destined to be the big figure in her life . She did not know that . She was brought to Tom by his son , Gordon Halsey , who was the man child Tom had once brought to the mountain woman Kate , wife of the inspired mountain preacher , the man child Tom had laid to Kate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's children , hushing the cries and groans of mountain men and women touched by the finger of God , creating thus a sohumansituation that did in a way knock rather galleywest the power over people of the preacher . " By God , before I 'd let any man get away with a thing like that with my woman . " " Say , if he 's so big with God as he claims , why 'd God let that happen to him ? " Tom getting more than that , an almost slavish follower in the woman Kate . . . male triumph over the female . Kit 's first meeting with Tom was at Kate 's house . Kate had grown middle-aged and the babe she had nursed was now a man , at least in years . He was a young sport , a woman-getter he hoped , a rich man 's son . He wanted to think he was truly all of these . P173He had not been sent to Harvard , or Yale , or Princeton , had never been a football hero , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that Tom had n't got his real start early enough . Young Gordon was physicallybig . He might have been splendid football material and , as for Kit when she met Gordon , she was certainly not the rather naive mountain girl who had taken the first mill job . Mill girls also educate each other . They do it also in shoe factories , overall factories , five-and-ten-cent stores , in Macys and Wanamakers , why not ? A mountain girl , ex-mill girl , getting keen . Get always a little keener . Why should the daughters of mill owners , storekeepers , daughters of professional men , novel writers , etc. , etc. , have anything on you , cotton-mill girls , overallfactorygirls , shoe-factory girls , big department-store girls ... when it comes to handling men ? You 've got to learn it , have n't you , girls ? They sure try to get away with it with you too , do n't they ? Sharpen your wits . Life 's a game . Women know . Workingwomen , particularly the ones that have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have opportunities . They should learn . to know a lot . At least girls , to be on to a guy like young Gordon Halsey ... not so smart after all . . . son of a rich man , wanting to be both a very very respectable one and at the same time more or less the tough one . . . in with the best people but also thought to be , well , cheek-by-jowl with the so-mysteriousunderworld . . . men of crime , men of mystery , hardys . . . like Cal . Coolidge going out West and putting on to cowboy uniform . . . young man half balanced so between two or more than two worlds . . . belonging really to no world . . . say like a lot of us modern novelists and storyP174tellers too . . . wanting to be both poet and rich man . But let it pass . Gordon Halsey , living as he did in one of the states of the Upper South , would perhaps already have begun to think , and when occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best blood of the Old South . He would have got that far out beyond his father . Poor lad . Look ! He does n't get away with it . Society , American society in his time , havingtaken to arms oil thieves , timber robbers , water-power highwaymen , had gagged at taking Al Capones , Legs Diamonds , Waxey Gordons . Not that Tom Halsey cared too much . He did care . As Tom had grown richer he had also changed but more of that later . The fact surely did hurt the son . He , the son , would have tried to put it over on Kit Brandon . He had found her working in a five-and-ten-cent store . For some reason , certainly not understandable to him , she got him hard . " What , am I really going to fall for her , just a little shop girl ? " Look out , boy , it has happened before . It was n't because she was so warm , a hot baby . There is another sort of challenge . " Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knock off . If I could get her I 'd prove myself , even to myself , a real ladies ' man , eh ? " The cooler , more self-possessed ones also tempt .
