 | THE HEYDAY OF THE FORTUNE TELLERS BY TRAVIS HOKE FORTUNE tellers are flourishing as never before in generations . The drawing of horoscopes , numbering of names , staring at glass balls , table-tipping , and muttering over teacups find an increasingly large number of believers . One million three hundred thousand radio listeners in a year respond by mail to Evangeline Adams 's tri-weekly broadcasts ; a million and a half a year ask the astrologer Dolores for advice ; a magazine article about an . unnamed soothsayer brings 11,700 inquiries ; newspapers print daily horoscopes , the astral predictions of Belle Bart , and the algorithmic forecasts of Elaine Hale Williams . In New York City twentyfive million dollars a year cross the palms of clairvoyants . Even phrenology and physiognomistry revive ; Rosicrucian temples spring up in California and New York ; gypsies open " mitt joints " in vacant shops . There is a rising urge for the esoteric , a tidal wave of faith in applied mysticism . Unquestionably , millions of adult Americans believe that the future can be foretold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If this return to astrology and its sister arts came with the economic depression it would be notable merely in the psychology of despair . If it appeared only among the humble and unlettered it would show nothing more than the tenacity of superstition . But when the revival is at least ten years old and still gains fervor , and when , in a literate day , the converts include such supposedly intelligent people as bankers , Cabinet officers , and Governors of States , the phenomenon grows extraordinary enough to warrant examination . All the oracular arts are prospering , but the stoutest are astrology and numerology . Astrology , first practiced when priests foretold Babylonian floods , ascribing to stars an influence since become a matter of meteorology , is the brand of sorcery now most respectable , most favored by the well-to-do . Stock market operators buy or sell according to its indications ; business men subscribe to periodical horoscopes ; a Governor of a western State signed legislation at hours astrologically dictated ; women competent enough to earn a hundred dollars a week steer their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the letters of names , runs second to astrology in popularity , and may even have more devotees if not such eminent ones . Both are " sciences , " of course . When palmistry , crystal gazing , and trance mediumship first thrived there was no need of convincing people through proof . Faith and fear were sufficient . Once it was enough to say that the stars guided man 's destiny . But now that science has become a shibboleth , the mechanism of influence must be exposed ; and so we are told that the stars are full of vibrations and wave-lengths busy ruling the affairs of earth . Thus " Cosmic rays vary with the season of the year , " according  | to Dr. Francis Rolt-Wheeler , Director of the Institut Astrologique de Carthage , and " the planetary vibrations , partly reflected , act more readily on the physical body . Natives those born under the influence of Saturn are tall , bony , pale , and melancholy . Jupiterians are round-faced , ruddy , frank and laughing . Vibrations direct from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations , too : one 's name vibrates according to the sum of the vibrations of the letters which spell it . This is science . Anything about vibrations is science . The hoary aspect of astrology seems to heighten its authority as a science , and its claims to antiquity , at least , are valid . It was born some eight thousand years ago , after dwellers on the Tigris and Euphrates found that flooding rivers signalled the time for planting . There was no calendar then , no year , nor any conception of the regularity of seasons , but as crops must be planted before the floods , it became necessary to predict their coming . The job of forecasting , like so many other offices then and since , was taken over by priests , who for several centuries thought well of human entrails , the movement of insects , and symptoms of royal ailments as meteorological instruments , but who eventually were forced to the discovery that the astral bodies moved in regular procession , and that when certain planets reached certain positions the floods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars rule human affairs as well as those of rivers . If the movement of heavenly bodies could predict spring floods , why not births , deaths , and the arrival of ambassadors from abroad ? II The ancient map of the heavens is still used : a girdle , the Zodiac , around the sun 's path , divided into sections called houses or signs of the twelve constellations , originally named for details of Chaldean anatomy but now Latinized ? Leo the lion , Pisces the fish , Taurus the bull , etc . The signs serve also for months , from the twenty-first to the twenty-first ; thus Aries the ram is March 21 to April 20 , Taurus the bull , from April to May . Each house , of course , has its special influence on human character and destiny . But about the Zodiac move the planets , each with its own peculiar influence , which may well be at crosspurposes with the stellar influence ; all of which so complicates matters that , says Evangeline Adams ? perhaps the most comfortably established American astrologer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light shining on plants under a dome ? " a dome divided into twelve parts always moving , each part a color , all crossing and recrossing . The plants would grow better under yellow sunlight than they would under purple or mauve . Others wither under too bright a ray . " So auspicious , for example , is the light shed by Aquarius , between January 21 and February 21 , that eighty per cent of the occupants of the Hall of Fame were born then , as were Lincoln , Dickens , and Tallulah Bankhead , Miss Adams finds . Cardinal Gibbons ( whose horoscope was strikingly like that of Houdini ) , George Bernard Shaw , Miss Anne Morgan , Shelley , and Ethel Barrymore are Leo natives , whereas Cancer sponsors Calvin Coolidge , John D. Rockefeller , and Rider Haggard . Of such prime importance , in fact , is the state of the heavens at birth that some astrologers specialize in Natology . By drawing the horoscopes of husband and wife it can be stated with precision when is the best hour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intending to place children  | for adoption do well to get horoscopes of them and of the prospective foster parents before making a decision . Several years ago Natologists noticed that many people born about the 13th of March , June , September , and December died during a short interval of time . Others had nervous upsets , still others fainted . Even Mayor Walker of New York fainted ; he was born on the nineteenth of June . The moral is plain . The practice of astrological science , then , is the locating of a date on the Zodiac and , by somewhat mysterious mathematical processes , determining the quality and strength of the influences then prevailing . That , however , is a mere beginning . " Any book on the science can tell you what aspects are favorable and unfavorable , " says Miss Adams , " but you must have ' wisdom to weigh and interpret and apply the aspects to the individual . " By this means many intricate puzzles are solved . The late Reginald Vanderbilt was born when Venus was in Scorpio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interpreting and applying these aspects to the individual , Miss Adams came to the conclusion that this blend of influences is what makes a man " insatiable in his pursuit of beautiful women , " thus answering an enigma of the ages . It is , however , an ill star that vibrates no one good . When Miss Adams first came to New York she drew the horoscope of the proprietor of her hotel , the Windsor . She foresaw grave disaster for him ? and rather favorable conditions for herself . He stepped out of her room into the midst of the Windsor Hotel fire , and next day the newspapers printed his account of her prediction next to the story of the catastrophe , establishing her instantly as a seeress of the first magnitude . Although it is impossible to escape the fates that the stars ordain , one who is forewarned may take precautions that frequently mitigate evil influences . Finding herself some years ago under astrological conditions that promised no good , Miss Adams decided not to go riding on her tall horse Jupiter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their will of the mare , which bucked and threw Miss Adams , but she was not injured as severely as if she had fallen from the superior height of Jupiter . Since the Windsor ' fire more than a hundred thousand people have called on her for consultation , and she has never had time enough to see as many as wished interviews . Interviews , during which the consulter sits in a chair designated as the Seat of the Mighty , cost $50 each , but for $10 a personal horoscope may be had by mail , or a " delineation " and the indications of the succeeding six months for $20 , or a monthly forecast of world conditions for $1 . There is none of the awesomeness of the traditional " wise woman " about Miss Adams , nor any eerie atmosphere in her quarters in Carnegie Hall , New York . Instead , she is placid and even jolly looking , and her studio home is rather businesslike with assistants typing horoscopic charts and mailing mimeographed prophecies to subscribers . The Seat of the Mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest bankers learned astrology there , and during the last years of his life received a regular service of indications of future happenings in politics , business , and the market . A former president of the New York Stock Exchange was another of her clients , as was Caruso , who consulted the stars as to the most propitious dates for starting voyages . A senator asked for astral advices on his chances for nomination to the Presidency ; the answer was that he would fail of nomination  | but would profit , nevertheless , and eventually he became a member of the Cabinet . She cast a horoscope for the S. S. Mauretania , launched under Pisces the fish , and predicted that its career would be more successful socially than financially . She has been consulted in nearly every important divorce case in New York in the last thirty years , she says . In one case the five persons concerned consulted her severally at least two years before the public knew there was trouble . She foretold the infidelity of a wife three years in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not approve ? as when she predicted the early death of a rich suitor for a client who also had a poor suitor . The girl married the rich man , he died within the year , and she then married the poor man . Apparently the stars dealt out the greatest good for the greatest number , but Miss Adams felt ill used . She herself married a man whose horoscope attracted her . In all astrological clienteles women used to predominate , but now there is an equal number of men . Women used to ask , How can I hold my husband or get rid of him ? Shall I meet the right man ? Shall I become engaged this year ? Now they are anxious about careers in the movies and trips to Europe . Since October , 1929 , however , the greatest number of inquiries from both men and women have to do with the earning of daily bread . Buyers ask when their judgment is apt to be good ; theatrical managers when to produce plays , and playwrights when to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical department of the Zodiac can not be too efficient . ) Husbands ask about building homes and taking out insurance . An Episcopal clergyman tries to find out when to start dieting for his gout . A girl in the Kentucky hills wants to know whether to call back her lover . A mother in Pasadena asks what to do with a child who beats his dog . A lifer in the Mississippi penitentiary inquires about his chances for a pardon . The president of a manufacturing company orders horoscopes of several hundred employees , to determine their fitness for their jobs . A magnificent vindication of astrology , this last . Stars indeed rule man 's destiny if a clerk fails of promotion because she was born under Aries . The vibratory prowess of Saturn should be quite ' apparent to discharged bookkeepers and their families . Glorious is the venerable " science " that predicts these events , and they happen ; marvelous are its sage interpreters and its clean-cut American business giant with a mind keen as any Chaldean 's . Certain other astrologers have tremendous followings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentalist " act on the stage , broadcast readings two halfhours a day for a year , offering horoscopes by mail at two and five dollars . One million and a half people responded ; there are not many more members in all the Protestant Episcopal churches in America . Six hundred thousand sent money in their first letter ; the Presbyterian Church in the United States spent less on education and pensions in the same year . Dolores broadcast from what is known as the " Public Service Station . " Wallace Everett Brown prepares a daily horoscope for the largest newspaper syndicate in the country , together with indications , usually cheerful , for birthdays , and answers questions : " Vera ? look for silver linings , beginning about the middle of February . " " C.R.N. ? If the marriage is delayed after June next year it will be doubtful , " etc . Belle Bart draws the horoscopes of infants considered important by Sunday newspapers . Not so well  | known as these , perhaps , but possessed of considerable power , was L. Howell Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He constantly advised two State governors , and one of them is reported to have followed his instructions so implicitly that he would sign bills only at the moment Lewis considered auspicious astrologically ; a three-million dollar school aid bill had to be signed between 11:30 and 12:26 o'clock of a certain Thursday ? and was . Remote in Tunis , Francis RoltWheeler , Ph.D. , is infrequently consulted by Americans in person , but he is noted for his profound researches and his editorship of The Seer , official organ of the Institut Astrologique de Carthage . Dr. Rolt-Wheeler has been an ordained priest and a stock raiser , is a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the American Anthropological Society , has published several dozen books for boys , edited the Science-History of the Universe , and composed such musical works as " Mon Cceur , " " Madness of Love , " and " Le Grand Lit . " He brings his versatility into his astrological work , for he offers courses by mail not only in three kinds of astrology ( seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will promptly forward a Kabbalistic talisman on receipt of name , birth date , and price . This dauntless prophet 's recent forecast asserted flatly that there may be attempts at assassination along the longitude of the Balkans , with probable serious injury to a person of royal blood ; that there are to be religious troubles in Spain , and even world-wide financial troubles this winter . If rectification ? the discovery by astrology of the hour and minute of a person 's birth and the prediction of the future from this information ? sounds like the last word in science , consider location , which is the finding of the spot on the earth 's surface where astral influences will permit the client to live most happily and successfully . Perhaps the most eminent specialist in location is L. Edward Johndro , who has on his hands at this writing a problem that greatly interests him because of its complexity . His client is a song-writer who lacks inspiration in Minnesota , does well in San Diego but is unhappy there . It will take at least three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horoscope must be properly rectified , " says Mr. Johndro candidly , " for most of the rectifications submitted are in error because they are worked out on the Ptolemy arc " ( it seems there really are persons naive enough to work on the Ptolemy arc ! ) " and it must be projected for planetary electromagnetic phasing exactly as any sinusoidal wave problem in alternating-current engineering . . . and the fixed stars checked over to get a favorable latitude for the client 's particular purpose . " Here is astrology at its choicest -- the sonorous terminology , the implication of scientific backing , the ruthless avoidance of sense ? all the appealing gravity of a child at make-believe . The learned Johndro phases the planets and checks fixed stars for three weeks , and the gleeful client thereupon dashes off mammy songs as he basks in sinusoidal waves . III The most striking aspect of the present wide belief in astrology is the ease with which so many people accept the premise on which the system stands . Persons who are otherwise intelligent , who habitually draw reasonably correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the notion that stars give off something that makes human beings what they are and what they are to be . Not only those who  | despair , but persons who have done well with life , who get ahead , stake their fortunes on a supposition they do not even try to test . Persons who understand the functioning of a motor well enough to choose an automobile on performance accept without question the statement that a heavenly body makes them tall or short , rich or poor , well or ill . Persons who make sure that a radio works before they buy it , nevertheless pay money to anyone who promises to tell them when to buy , sell , or marry , and decide the most important issues of their lives on the word of a voice advertising toothpaste . It is a gaudy paradox that a race whose name is a by-word for shrewdness , caution , and practical guile should give over in droves to a footless will-to-believe . Occasionally the remnant of a critical faculty asks for proof , whereupon it is pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , is indisputable . The argument that the ancients possessed certain knowledge denied to moderns is usually reliable , too , but the ancients in their wisdom decided not to mention the planets Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto , discovered within the last century and a half , nor did they find it expedient , in handing down their mystic lore , to advise those on whom their mantles have fallen that the houses would shuffle their positions since they were first neatly spaced around the Zodiac . The discovery of the planet Pluto in 1930 was an event of tremendous importance astrologically , of course , and its reception was significant . It was not taken as a blow to the validity of the science , as might have been expected , but was gladly hailed as a missing link which accounted for the failure of various predictions in the past . A contributor to the Journal of the National Astrological Association asserts that it will take a long time to identify its special influence , but already several volumes have been written about it by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally , cast the horoscope of the stock market and blames its uneasy situation on its position in Gemini . He states also that the Hawley-Smoot tariff act was signed at a time when all influences were favorable . He does not , however , reveal the future indications for Messrs . Hawley and Smoot and for the Republican Party . ) Laurel Miller , a New York practitioner of note , did not use the advent of Pluto as an excuse for past errors . Through plotting planetary influences , she predicted the discovery not only of Pluto but another trans-Neptunian planet , she says . She named them Eslar and Tasmu . Eslar turned up exactly where she expected it , and quite understandably she is indignant that her name for it was not used . Tasmu still hides . The customary rebuttal to all charges against astrology is , that it works . And so it does , with commendable originality . Six astrologers consulted by one person all propounded widely varying horoscopes and none discovered from the stars that the inquirer was married . With even chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child would be a girl . Most successes in prophecy are remembered , failures forgotten . The stock answer is , that the stars are never wrong , but that astrologers may be , which is admittedly an argument to end all argument . IV By contrast with astrology , numerology , or algorithmics , is simplicity itself , and its authentic age is tender ; for though it modestly claims only an Egyptian origin , it was " rediscovered " in England about thirty-five years ago . It is a great favorite with people of the stage . Essentially it is about what a  | Middle Ages half-wit would remember of an hour with the Kabbala , but it can work the same miracles as astrology , it can be learned easily and self-applied ; it is , so to speak , the clairvoyance of the kitchenette . The services of an expert make readings complete and accurate , however , and there are many who follow numerology as a profession . One of the best known , Elaine Hale Williams , former actress , dancer , and private detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of numbers . It was taught by Pythagoras , about 600 B.C. He learned it from the ancient Egyptians . In India and the Far East it continued to be much used , being mixed with astrology and horology . You are your name . The name shows the inner desire , the impression that is made upon others , the natural ability . Whenever the full name which was given at birth is not signed regularly there is a definite influence or cloak that is thrown around the individual with each signature . It is often a great drawback to an otherwise successful vibration . It is well to have the signature adjusted by a capable numerologist . " Numerological rays , we gather , go from the individual and astrological rays come to him ; it would be interesting to know what happens when the rays collide . No doubt some seer is ready to broadcast the details for a mouthwash company . Numerology is the only variety of clairvoyance that concedes to the believer a fighting chance to control his fate ? by changing his name he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found success only after she had changed her name from Moran , for example ; and the marriage of Natacha Rambova , born Hudnut , to Rudolph Valentino was considered a triumph for numerology . Astute persons often use one name for business dealings and another for love affairs ? a practice not confined to believers in numerology , however ; and Miss Williams has a client , a doctor , who will buy no watch , automobile , or surgical instrument that is not auspiciously numbered . Another client has been importuned to donate fifty thousand dollars to a group of people who wish to build a church . Through Miss Williams 's determination of lucky and unlucky dates he has been advised when to give battle and when to absent himself from the community , and has been enabled to withstand the pious pressure for some time . There are indications that he will emerge triumphant in the end . There are schisms in numerological ranks as there are in the astrological , heresies as vain as the Ptolemy arc . The same Laurel Miller who predicted Pluto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proclaiming the Kabbalistic doctrine as the one true faith . It is based on twenty-two mystic characters from the Emerald Table of Hermes , who took them from the Chaldean calendar ; and she points out that Moses formed the original Hebrew , and Palamedes the original Greek alphabet , from the twenty-two hieroglyphs . With such prominent alphabetists on her side , Miss Miller might be thought to have all the best of it , but comparatively few American names can be spelled with even twenty-two hieroglyphs , so that Miss Williams and Pythagoras do very well on the whole . Then there is Arlyne Chalmers , a Pacific Coast numerologist , who has a considerable following for her Numberscopes , which she describes as " A Blueprint of Your Entire Life $15 , " even though her " Advice for a Year How to Meet Your Experiences Each Month " costs but $1.25 . Still other numerologists of a dissenting order predict the future of anyone who will write out seven numbers at  | random and send them along with the money . Such experiments with the occult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and antiquity , thousands who would be ashamed to sit ' in a tea room while waitresses pore over the leaves . More thousands need only the conviction of lowered lights and hushed voices ? for them the crystal ball , the knave of spades , the spirit trumpet serve equally well . Yet not all the believers in the lesser magic are lowly placed . During several years a millionaire Chicagoan maintained a private chapel in New York , with a medium and his wife constantly on call to summon spirits for counsel . Whenever he was unable to go to New York the spirits obligingly advised the millionaire by telephone . Evidently they imposed secrecy on him , for when a newspaper ran him down with the facts he gallantly intimated that the chapel was , after all , only what is technically known as a love nest . Wall Street brokers were prominent among those who endowed a " university " and a " hospital " for Edgar Cayce , of Virginia Beach , who gives " psychic and physical readings " in a state resembling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " churches , " but the more successful prefer to restrict their clienteles to a small number of the wealthy . Commerce thrives in " test books " ? compilations of data on persons of known gullibility sold by brokers dealing in spiritualistic paraphernalia ? and there have been quietly conducted prosecutions of insurance-company actuaries who sold to mediums information about wealthy policy holders . It is not clear why the recital of one 's medical history by a fat woman in a wrapper should prove that there is life after death ; but it does , and also that spirits can foretell the future , and that handsomely engraved oil-wells should be bought . Knowledge of the past is the psychic equivalent of astral vibrations . Neither the phrenology of Gall , Spurzheim , and the Fowlers , with their bumps of amativeness and conjugality , nor the face-reading systems of Simms and Lombroso , with their graspativeness or love of gain , physioelpicidity , degenerate ears , etc. , was intended to be used as clairvoyance ; but in their evolution to character analysis and vocational advice their practitioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . Nor is straight out-and-out phrenology dead by any means ; there are practicing phrenologists in most cities , and the Tope School of Phrenology in Bowerston , Ohio , not only publishes The Phrenological Era , gives courses by mail or in person ( including books , calipers , and diploma ) but boasts : " Not without a student in thirty-five years . " All sorts of obscure beliefs prevail . Hex doctors practice in Pennsylvania . The Institut Astrologique sells for five dollars " Kabbalistic Talismans , either Zodiacal or Planetary , prepared on virgin parchment ( the actual skin ) on the day and hour most propitious to the consultant . " R. C. Jones mails his custom-made talismans from West Virginia for seven dollars to twenty-five dollars , payment in advance . " Namasta " is a cult of which the priestess , Mizanna Wolff , Tonganoxie , Kansas , will say only that " It satisfies . " Osman , in Washington , D. C. , compounds Psychic Perfumes , assuring the user a lucky vibration every day . For some reason not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherents of the less orthodox schools of healing . Thus , a favorite contributor to the Journal of the National Astrological Association is none other than Dr. Louis Arthur Yurman , Drugless Physician , Psychoanalyst , Vocational Counsellor , Chiropractor , Naturopath , and  | Psycho-Physiotherapist . The Doctor is also chief of clinic at the Puderbach School of Massage . V ? Astrologers resent their classification with fortune tellers , particularly at this moment , when the Society of American Magicians , having caught some of its fellows telling fortunes back stage , is bringing pressure on the police of the country to enforce the laws against clairvoyancy . Mr. Hal Olver , husband of Dolores , appearing for the defense , attacks fake astrologers as well as numerologists and palmists , and proposes State examinations and licenses for astrologers , to put them on a plane with physicians and barbers . Unfortunately for his scheme of reform , the laws of most States forbid the practice of fortune telling , but the laws notoriously are not enforced , nor , in many cases , are they up to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrobatic performers , circus riders , men who desert their wives , and persons who pretend to tell fortunes . Some fifteen years ago astrologers were exalted above wife-deserters when a New York police magistrate decided that an astrologer " had raised astrology to the dignity of an exact science ; she went through an absolutely mechanical mathematical process to get at her conclusions , " but since then higher courts have held otherwise . Justice Nott decided that astrologers were fortune tellers ; Justice Houghton termed the pretense to occult powers a fraud ; Justice Kelly ruled that the methods by which prophecies were made was not material . New York fortune tellers get by on the technical ground that they do not utter predictions but " indications , " and that they do not exact fees but merely accept gifts . Now and then one is arrested , for , strangely enough , the real character of plain clothes police is not made known by the lines of the palm , nor do the planets have anything to say about raids . The Federal Radio Commission , though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now frowns so efficiently upon the broadcasting of horoscopes that several profitable contracts have been cancelled by large stations . In Los Angeles , as might be supposed , various brands of soothsaying proclaim themselves religions and are , therefore , permitted to broadcast , but in New York , as was noted in Judge Kelly 's decision , not even religions can work against public welfare . Nevertheless , if the religion take the trouble to incorporate itself , the law seemingly can not touch its employees who give " psychic readings . " The Cayce referred to was recently arrested in New York and tried for telling fortunes . A policewoman testified that she had asked for advice on matters of finance and health only licensed physicians may treat illness in New York , that Cayce had answered her questions as he lay on a bed with his eyes closed , and that she had not joined the Association for Research and Enlightenment , Inc . ( Motto : That They May Have Life and That They May Have It More Abundantly . ) Magistrate Erwin discharged Cayce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , " would be to interfere with the beliefs of an incorporated ecclesiastical body . " What enlightenment the policewoman gained on her hypothetical pains and investments was not revealed , though it formed part of the papers in the case ; and a cameraman who photographed Cayce was dispossessed of the plate , a procedure rare indeed in New York police courts . " Witches appear to have been in bad repute in all jurisdictions since 245 2000 B.c. , but witches , bad as they were , always occupied a different plane from fortune tellers , " Judge Kelly remarks . " The latter have always been classed with rogues and mountebanks and generally disreputable members of society to be summarily dealt with for the good of the community . " Yet , with the law and tradition against it , fortune telling of all kinds flourishes . The takings in New York City , for example , are estimated at a sum several million dollars greater than the city usually expends on its water supply , its judiciary system , or its fire department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faith in the supernatural has never quite died out anywhere , of course , but in America its footing was at least precarious after Salem days ; and with the turn of the last century only a few mediums and palmists and astrologers survived , and only the ignorant followed them , excepting occasional personages such as those who reposed in the Seat of the Mighty . Then the revival began , led by the mediums and inflamed , a few years later , by the fervid sponsorship of Lodge and Conan Doyle . The monumental credulousness of this pair overwhelmed lesser souls . Sir Oliver accepted psychic phenomena on evidence that he would have rejected for an experiment in physics , and standing , to the public , as one of the great scientific minds of his time , forced even educated persons to the conviction that if his searching intellect could accept spiritism , theirs must . Sir Arthur , because he solved fictional mysteries backward , ranked as the great detective , the keen scenter of trickery , rogue-proof ? it seemed inconceivable that any medium could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he ascribed psychic powers to Houdini , arch-enemy of spiritism . His sincerity never being questioned , though it endured many exposures of the most impudent fakery , he preached the gospel with tongue and book and thus unwittingly delivered thousands into the clammy hands of scientific camp followers . The influence that Lodge and Doyle had upon the people of this country by their advocacy of spiritism can never be reckoned in terms of money and stupefaction . It may be contended that their testimony , however mistaken , brought consolation to the sad at heart ; but no one can deny that a shady and disreputable trade was given dignity and respectability by these sincere but misguided men . Riding in on the wave of enthusiasm came the astrologers and the numerologists and the rest , gaining repute and authority and credence until , in the last ten years , people of the utmost conservatism and respectability and even intellectual pride unashamedly avow beliefs almost as logical as faith in Santa Claus . Mankind , it would appear , must have hope or consolation , whether from astrologer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however safe , however easy ? there is still to-morrow to face . Man can not yet face it unarmored of faith that his destiny is ordered ; without the conviction that his destiny is ultimately benevolent he could not withstand the blows that daily assail him . Nor is the intervention of occultists in matters that touch the general welfare necessarily more foolish or more evil than that of higher styled rogues or mountebanks or experts . Many a medium might govern a State as well as some present governors , and perhaps as entertainingly ; might run a cabinet department or a bank as well as Albert B. Fall or Saul Singer . Elaine Williams can foretell the course of the depression as well as Doctor Julius Klein ;  | Dolores may be a better prophet than Simeon Fess . All may be equally well intentioned , all are equally guessers . But you can not hold fortune tellers responsible for their guesses , you can not adjudge their intent . It is occasionally possible to run to earth a dishonest politician and imprison him but you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine a palmist for guessing wrong , even though it break hearts and wreck fortunes . They take no chances when they guess ; the odds are with them , and you can not stop them from guessing so long as people want them to guess . The greatest harm is not that which fortune tellers inflict on believers , but that which believers inflict on others . When fortune tellers corrupt the reason of their patrons they make them unsafe to deal with . Whose loyalty and skill are safe with an employer who discards his judgment of men and work for wholesale poppycock about vibrations ? What man can invest his savings on advice born of the mutterings of a cataleptic ? Yet people want fortune tellers to guess , despite the frowns of the law and education , despite repeated demonstrations of their incompetency as guessers . There must be some instinct at work that is stronger than law and learning . It will be remembered that before the occult revival , religions in America had begun to " modernize " themselves , were tendering seeming reconciliations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a place in modern daily lives -- and were departing more and more from a reliance on faith . Genesis was being attuned to Darwin , the credo blended into social service , pulpit thunder was hushed into suave comment on current events . At the same time science was becoming a national idol . Each day some new marvel appeared ? wagons ran without horses , voices issued from boxes , men flew , phantoms moved on screens ; after to-day 's miracles who could scoff at to-morrow 's ? Science worked these wonders , science made things and sold things and bestowed comfort and wealth ; blessed be the name of science . It became the best-advertised product in the land , it was beatified to the point where anything stamped with its seal must be accepted on faith . Credulity became a national trait , zeal in science worship a laudable one . But science has gone the way of religion , it has been popularized , its magic exposed and explained and handled . In the last ten years both religion and science have grown commonplace , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that the occult wave has mounted highest . Neither the consolation of religion , evidently , nor the enlightenment of science reaches deep enough into the needs of man . Science takes the veil , and religion lets in logic ; man gains logic and loses heart . It must be that neither religion rationalized nor science sanctified gives man what he craves . It begins to look as though man still needed faith beyond logic , hope in things unseen , charity from a source too distant to be scrutinized . The times are ripe for a new faith , for a big gesture , for a new messiah , a prophet . Logically , he should come from the psychoanalysts , for they deal with souls on earth . Logically ? but when was faith logical ? Like as not he will be a hysteric , preaching a belief in madness . Meanwhile , fortune tellers flourish , and they will always flourish , for they offer what religion can not promise nor science provide . Religion deals with futures too remote . Science , near to becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man wants is a glimpse of his individual future , not in heaven but on earth .
