Because music is so important to Lieder-loving Germans , music is also important to the German Government . For generations opera houses and music schools have been supported by the state . When , in 1933 , the Nazis came into power , one of their first concerns was the organization , with characteristic German thoroughness , of Germany 's musical life along strictly Nazi lines . Dominant in the official Nazi attitude toward music were : 1 ) the Nazi theories of race , 2 ) Nazi objections to all satirical , " unwholesome " or experimental types of art . Public performance of works by Jewish composers like Mendelssohn and Gustav Mahler was banned . Likewise banned ( though somewhat less systematically ) were the discordant works of atonalists and other modernist composers . <P> Last week in the industrial town of Dsseldorf , Nazi musical authorities opened a Reich Music Congress , attended by musical big &; little-wigs from all over Germany . Outstanding event on the program was an exhibition of " degenerate music " patterned after the exhibition of " degenerate art " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug. 2 ) . Scheduled for the pillory were compositions by Atonalists Schnberg , Berg and Hindemith , jazz , theoretical and critical writings by Jews and modernist sympathizers . <P> Sponsoring this meeting was the world 's most formidable cultural organization , Germany 's Kulturkammer ( Chamber of Culture ) . Under the directorship of club-footed Minister of Propaganda Paul Joseph Goebbels , the Kulturkammer controls all artistic activity that takes place within German borders . Important among its seven sub-chambers ( literature , music , press , theatre , art , cinema , radio ) is the Musikkammer , presided over by 65-year-old Peter Raabe , one of Germany 's numerous lesser symphonic conductors . Every musician in Germany , from symphonic composer to drummer in a town band , must be a member of the Musikkammer . The Kammer fixes and assures collection of composers ' royalties , decrees what type of music shall be played and who shall or shall not be permitted to play it . Securely under its thumb are the activities of Germany 's world-renowned opera houses , music conservatories , symphony orchestras . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestows upon deserving Nazi musicians the title of Professor ( now an honorary designation without academic significance ) . Membership in the Musikkammer ( and hence participation in Germany 's professional music life ) is limited to qualified and politically tractable " Aryans. "
