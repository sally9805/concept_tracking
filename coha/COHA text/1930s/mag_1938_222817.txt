Britons who thronged the banks of the Thames last week for England 's No. 1 rowing carnival , the annual Henley Regatta , saw an amazing performance . For four days they gaped at a red-haired American sculler , Joseph William Burk , who decisively outrowed his opponents over the mile and 5/16 course day after day in the elimination heats of , the Diamond Sculls , most famed race in the world for individual scullers . <P> " He does everything wrong , " muttered experts and dubs alike . Rowing an extremely high stroke ( 36 to 45 a minute , compared to an average sculler 's 28 to 32 ) , Joe Burk , who weighs 195 lb. and has arms like piano legs , propels his shell with an unorthodox short jerk of his arms and a quick kick of his legs , sits up almost straight at the end of each stroke .

Last year , after running away with the U. S. and Canadian sculling championships with machine-like ease , oarsmen dubbed him the " rowing robot , " marveled at the power of his arms . But his brawny arms are nothing compared to his perseverance . In preparing for the Henley Regatta , throughout last winter and summer , the Jersey farm boy rowed 3,000 miles on the narrow , winding Rancocas , with a stopwatch strapped between his toes . <P> Last week 23-year-old Joe Burk was well rewarded . In the final of the Diamond Sculls , dipping his oars 45 times a minute , he streaked through the water as if he had an outboard motor attached to his 26-lb. shell , not only won the coveted race but did it in 8 min. 2 sec. - eight seconds faster than the Henley record set in 1905 .
