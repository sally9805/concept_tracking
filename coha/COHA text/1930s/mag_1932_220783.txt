One way to bet on last week 's Kentucky Derby was described by Lester Doctor , betting expert for the Whitneys . The morning of the race he had made a long distance call , been cut off by an operator who said something about " overtime . " Lester Doctor said he was playing Mrs. John Hay ( " Jock " ) Whitney 's entry , Overtime . <P> Another good way was to pick out the jockey you liked and play his mount . The field , weakened by three important withdrawals in the last week , was not up to Derby standard and the horses were hard to rate on form , but everyone knew about most of the riders . Everyone could have a good look at them . Perched like bright birds in the sun on the veranda of the jockey house , they sat chatting to each other . In the moving crowd below the veranda stood a detective watching them . <P> Earl Sande , most famed jockey in the U. S. , his cheerful little face pinched by the strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another to break the record . He was wearing Mrs. " Jock " Whitney 's fuchsia silks , as was Lavelle ( " Buddy " ) Ensor , whom she had chosen to ride Stepenfetchit . Ten years ago , when he was regarded as the best rider in the country , Ensor 's conviviality grew so pronounced that no trainer dared trust him with a mount . This year , reformed at 34 , his comeback has been even more dramatic than Sande 's . <P> Another jockey waiting for the start was Laverne Fator , whose admirers consider him more brilliant than Sande . Col. Edward Riley Bradley , who had two horses entered last week , told Fator to choose the one he wanted to ride . Fator , who had won $3,000,000 for various owners and won every important U. S. race except the Derby and the Belmont Stakes , chose Brother Joe . Burgoo King , a horse that most of Louisville liked better , he turned over to 19-year-old Eugene James , a jockey who was bred in Louisville and made a sensation last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky Derby , over a mile-and-a-quarter of chocolate-colored loam at Churchill Downs , takes a few seconds more than two minutes . As the horses paraded to the post last week , Crystal Prince shied at the loud band playing " Swanee River . " Cee Tee and Tick On made trouble at the barrier . Cee Tee was placed outside and when the barrier finally sprang after 15 min. , Tick On was pocketed behind the field . It took Fator on Brother Joe about a half-mile to find that he had picked the wrong horse . Brother Joe pulled up lame and Fator could see Burgoo King , running well with the leaders , in third place , behind Economic and Brandon Mint as they started down the back stretch . <P> Coming around the second turn , Burgoo King moved up with a burst of speed . From three lengths behind tired Economic at the head of the turn , he was four lengths ahead after the horses came into the stretch . Jockey James , who usually lies back to wait for clear running at the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch when his horse is leading in the stretch . Jockey Horn on Economic and Jockey Ensor , coming up fast with Stepenfetchit , found him impossible to catch last week . Burgoo King was first by five lengths at the finish , with Economic second , Stepenfetchit third , Tick On sixth .
