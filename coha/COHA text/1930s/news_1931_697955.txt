txt Will Rogers Pays a Tribute To an Ex-Congresswoman To thc Edttor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , July 2. - You remember I told you there was some awful good dead Republicans . Well , the finest woman one of ' em all went yesterday , exCongresswoman Alice Robertson of Oklahoma . Nick Longworth told Me this story ; When they was voting on the soldiers ' bonus she did n't believe in it in her own heart and she told why and told that her action would mean her finish in Congress . She told how she loved the veterans and had fed ' em and spent every cent she ever had on ' em ( and she had ) , but that she would n't vote against her conscience just to stay in Congress . Nick said every man in the room ' went ' to her and complimented her on her bravery then went over and voted the way the most votes were back home . She was a fine old soul , too fine for politics .
