One of Italian Finance Minister Guido Jung 's favorite stories is about his encounter with President Roosevelt in the White House last spring ( TIME , May 15 ) . To Italy 's Banking Association soon afterward Eccellenza Jung declared : " I had the honor of stating the attitude of the Duce to the President when he enquired of me as to Italy 's attitude on two of the questions which the United States deems of preeminent importance for the London Economic Conference : monetary stabilization and the return of all currencies to a common standard which the United States can not conceive of as other than gold . I replied that Italy had no need to stabilize , as she had already stabilized on Dec. 21 , 1927 , and had maintained and intended to maintain that stabilization unaltered ; and that Italy had no need to return to a gold parity because she had placed her currency on a gold basis .

When the Corporative State law was proposed , the whole Chamber leaped up to adopt it by acclaim . Il Duce stilled the pandemonium , insisted on a vote , cast the first ballot himself . The count , presumably unanimous , was not mentioned in dispatches . <P> " After the bill passed , " declared a Fascist press release , " the Duce pronounced 33 words from behind a table covered with a huge mass of roses :      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
