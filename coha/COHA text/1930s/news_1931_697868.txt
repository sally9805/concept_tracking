txt THE URGE OF BARGAINS . Middle Class Folk Have Money to Spend If Prices Are Attractive . To the Editor of The New York Times : What this country needs is lower retail prices . Recently THE NEW YORK TIMES printed an advertisement of a receiver 's liquidation sale for a well-known hat and clothing store . One of our young men went there and reported the store full , with police guarding the doors and admitting more customers only as others left . This was not penny merchandise , but clothing which , even at the reduced prices , ranged from $32 to $42 for men 's suits and $10 to $35 for women 's gowns . There are hundreds of well-located stores with men 's and women 's clothing on display for less than these prices , but no police are needed to control the customers . The explanation is that the public is ready to buy in considerable amounts if it can get attractive values , and , incidentally , if the information is brought to their attention by the right kind and amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have got in , I would have spent a hundred dollars for my wife and me , " and he did n't even have a chance to inspect the merchandise . That amount represents more than his week 's salary . He said the crowd was composed of people like himself , rather than the swanky element for whom the merchandise was probably designed . It looks as if the middle class , to which he and I belong , is able to buy in sufficient amounts to improve business a lot , but will do so only when , as and if the price becomes genuinely attractive . A. M. New York , May 29 , 1931 , Masts and Funnels . To the Editor or ThS New X MC Times : I note your recent short editorial on the question of the height of the new Hudson River bridge . One phase of this problem does not seem to have been taken into consideration . Would it not be well worth while to consider the total abandonment of masts on vessels ? As I understand it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more obsolete signaling apparatus , and to serve as flagpoles . Could not a small percentage of the cost of a single bridge be devoted to a study of mast elimination ? Smokestacks are fast disappearing with the application of the Diesel engine to marine propulsion and the general use of oil fuel . The big battleship seems , too , to be passing ; let us hope naval disarmament will finish them . The big passenger steamer may be displaced by airplanes . The masts are an anachronism . Radio developments will probably soon make them unnecessary on land and sea . Why not study how to get rid of them rather than accept them as final ? W. P. CUTTER . Harvard University , May 22 , 1931 . Check-Reins on Horses . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I repeat my annual plea on behalf of the poor horses in New York ? For the last thirty years I have asked both the Police Department and the A. S. P. C. A. to intercede and have the useless checkreins done away with during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent hot spell  --  horses suffering from sore withers , spavins , curbs , cracked heels and palpable lameness were truly heartrending , especially so when one noticed a poor horse badly distressed by an absurdly short checkrein and then learn from the driver that he must not change it , as " the boss at the boarding-stable ' said it was all right . " Here seems to be the main trouble , " the boss at the boarding-stable . " Would it not be a good plan for the A. S. P. C. A. to instruct its inspectors to call at the various stables and insist that all check-reins be loosened during the hot spell ? CHARLES G. HOPTON New York , May 30 , 1931.
