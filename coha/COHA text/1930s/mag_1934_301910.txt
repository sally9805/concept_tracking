Luis Quintanilla , 39 , muralist , etcher , humanist and Spanish Republican , held his first one-man show in the U. S. last week . Pierre Matisse was his sponsor , Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos his patrons and apologists . On the sober walls of the Matisse Gallery 39 of Quintanilla 's etchings were lined up , all handsomely mounted and glassed . Critics , collectors , and ladies in long mink coats all hurried up to see them . But Luis Quintanilla was not excited . In Madrid behind the bars of the Central Prison he was fighting for his life . <P> Three years ago Luis Quintanilla was a great man in Madrid . A burning revolutionist all his life , he plotted ardently for the overthrow of Alfonso XIII and with his own hands ran up the first Republican flag over the Royal Palace . Socialist Indalecio Prieto was Minister of Finance then and commissioned Luis Quintanilla to paint huge frescoes on the walls of the Casa del Pueblo and the great new University City out at Moncloa Park . Free-spending Prieto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fearing a Fascist dictatorship , perhaps even a restoration of the Bourbon Monarchy , Luis Quintanilla became a conspirator again . <P> In the bloody unsuccessful October revolution he played no active part but allowed his Madrid penthouse apartment to be used as a hideout by four Socialists while he prudently absented himself for four days . When he returned to his apartment street fighting was still going on . Police raided the house and found Luis Quintanilla and four revolvers . In Spain if a man has three revolvers , shotguns or rifles in his home he may conceivably be a sportsman or a collector . If he has four he is plotting against the government . <P> Luis Quintanilla had the advantage of having extremely vocal friends who were not willing to let the world forget that a very talented young man was in danger of lying in a Spanish jail until he is 58 . <P> Hulking Ernest Hemingway was in Key West dividing his attention between literature and marlin when a two-word cable arrived from Madrid . Inscrutable to a Spanish censor , it read LUIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis Quintanilla on some of his Madrid frescoes , brought a heavy package of etched zinc plates to the U. S. Author Hemingway paid for pulling a small edition of proofs , and Pierre Matisse was glad to give them a Manhattan showing . John Dos Passos wrote a short , able introduction to the catalog . Ernest Hemingway , still hot under his size 16 collar , pounded out a 1,500-word essay that described his friend 's plight , his art , and formed a collector 's item . Excerpt :
