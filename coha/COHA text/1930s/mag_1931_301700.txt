Many a magazine lives a generation , few live two . Last week , having completed 28 years of usefulness , Popular Magazine appeared for the last time . Street &; Smith , largest producers of pulp-paper thrillers , merged ( and buried ) Popular Magazine with another of their 15 periodicals-Complete Stories . The end of Popular , like the end of Everybody 's , rang the knell of another semi-pretentious sheet which could not compete with the innumerable sporadic , cheap magazines which frankly pander yarns about gunmen , speakeasies , dope . Popular-Complete Stories , beginning with the December issue , will be smaller than Popular , will sell for 15 instead of 25 . <P> The history of Popular Magazine is the story of Editor Charles Agnew MacLean 's life . Editor MacLean was born in Ireland in 1880 . Aged five , he was taken to the U.S. His father was a newspaperman who scraped enough money together for Son Charles to go to college . Charles demurred , made his parents move into a better house in Bay Ridge , Brooklyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , in 1903 Charles Agnew MacLean went to work for Street &; Smith . Year after he was put in charge of Smith 's , Ainslie 's and the newly-founded Popular Magazine . One of his first assistants was Theodore Dreiser . He did not like Dreiser . Nobody did . But for $500 he bought the plates of Sister Carrie which had been shelved by Doubleday , Page &; Co . He later sold them to another publisher , gave the proceeds to Author Dreiser . <P> The number of famed and near-famed writers whom Editor MacLean raised from oblivion is astonishing . He lifted the late H.C . Witwer from a $30-a-week copy-reader 's job on the Sun . He helped Albert Payson Terhune with his first work . He ' ' discovered " Zane Grey , Louis Joseph Vance , Charles E. Van Loan . Of his output he said : " Much of it is not literature . Little of it is great literature . It comes so straight and fresh from the loom of life that it may well be imperfect in spots and lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Editor MacLean knew a good glass of wine , a good cigar , but spent most of his money for Scotch whiskey . It killed him in 1928 . Popular was never the same afterward.
