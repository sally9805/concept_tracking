A thousand feet under the Mecsek hills near Pecs , 1,200 miners picked wearily last week at the poor coal that is Hungary 's best . On the railroad sidings above were 15,000 unsold carloads of their low-grade handiwork . The mine owner , Danube Steam Navigation Co. , largely British-owned , had done its best to spread work , a few hours a day per man . But that came to only $2 a week . These Magyar miners and their families were starving . It had come to the point last week where their mouths watered at sight of the fat little pit ponies , sweating in the lamplight . Up from the mine they suddenly sent an ultimatum : either the owners raise their pay to $3.50 a week or they would have one good dinner on the ponies and then smash the ventilators . Death by suffocation they preferred to death by slow starvation . The owners replied : " Come out first ; argue afterward . " The men replied by returning all food and water sent them . Fire broke out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosed it out . The miners insisted the firemen stay down below . After three days , Hungary 's bull-necked Premier Julius Gmbs sent five trade unionists down into the pit to say : " Come up within 30 minutes . " Thereupon the miners added the trade unionists to their collection of hostages . Finally , after five days of the strike , the owners agreed to raise the miners ' wages . Back to daylight were hauled the workers - famished , half-mad , near death .
