In the East it is Temple . <P> In the Midwest it is Michigan . <P> In the South it is Southern Methodist . <P> In the West it is Stanford . <P> Thus last week experts reckoned the best teams in the country as college basketball reached midseason . Because there is no national championship , the question of who plays the best basket-ball is one that perennially and profoundly agitates thousands of pool rooms and fraternity houses throughout the U. S. Each section of the country claims superiority , and the more pretentious teams usually spend Christmas vacation on a junket trying to prove it . This year basketball fans had an additional cause for controversy : the new centre-jump rule . <P> In contrast to baseball , the offspring of cricket and rounders , and football , the offspring of soccer and rugby , basketball can boast a pure American ancestry . Characteristically American , it has been prolific with its regulations . In 1891 the game started out with one rule : no more than one step could be taken with ball in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had 113 . <P> Meeting in Chicago last spring the rulemakers , still dissatisfied , gave basketball the most drastic alteration in its 46-year history . It removed the after-goal centre jump , distinctive maneuver of the game . This year , under the new rule , the ball , instead of being brought to the centre and tossed up after each goal , is automatically given to the team just scored on-for a throw-in from out of bounds just under the basket . This speeds up the game , adds about seven minutes of playing time , reduces the advantages of tall fellows over short ones , results in more spectacular tries for baskets and larger scores . <P> John Bunn . If the centre jump is the news-of-the-year in basketball . John Bunn is the man-of-the-year . John Bunn is basketball coach at Stanford . He served his apprenticeship at the University of Kansas where he played and later taught under famed Coach Forrest C. ( " Phog " ' ) Allen-within reverent earshot of Physical Education Professor James Naismith , basketball 's inventor . In 1930 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long been regarded as " sissy . " He began to experiment with a jumpless game . Four years ago he tried it out , got Southern California 's Coach Sam Barry to join him in a crusade for his new style of play . Last year while the Big Ten gave the new game a test and others followed suit , John Bunn took his boys on a transcontinental tour during Christmas vacation , watched them beat every team they met-both with and without his own rules . In Manhattan , playing under the national rules , his team broke the two-year ( 43-game ) winning streak of Long Island University , with much help from an ambidextrous young forward named Hank Luisetti.
