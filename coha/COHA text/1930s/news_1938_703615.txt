txt Charles H. Bland besides being Chairman of the Canadian Civil Service Commission and President of the Civil Service Assembly of the United States and Canada , now In convention here , is a diplomat . Thus , when an inquiring reporter tried to pin Mr. Bland down to his opinion of spoils and officeholdels in the Unite States , he ran into a polite silence . mi .. Bland had n't come down to Washington , home of Federal patronage and pork , to draw invidious comparisons with the situation back in Ottawa . But on the other hand , when Mr , Bland let the facts speak for themselves and offered them without comment , it soon developed that the big democracy to the south ' might very well sit in wistful admiration at the feet of its smaller northern neighbor. $5 to 1 in Canada Canadians , it appears , believe in Civil Service . Furthermore , they evidently feel that an adequately financed Civil Service Commission is cheap at the price in the long run . With total Federal personnel of 80,000 employees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of $5 to 1 . In the United States , far richer than Canada , with 850,000 Federal employees , the commission gets only $2,400,000  --  a ratio of $2,82 to 1 ? about half of the Canadian figure . Mr. Bland does n't like to make comparisons or drive home the moral . But the facts speak for themselves , For example . Canada In the World War once and for all swept politics out of the Federal personnel . The Coalition Government of Sir Robert Borden , elected in 1917 , offered the nation A " win-the-war " plank first on its platform , and a Civil Service reform plank , second . To many , the two were linked . At any rate , with a sweeping bill the whole Canadian service was put under Civil Service once and for all in 1918 . Mr. Bland carefully avoids comparisons to obvious conditions across the border . But in the United States the sweeping blanket legislation is yet to be written , and only a bit at a time is the inevitable reform coming . At one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congress has exempted an estimated 150,000 to 200,1 ) 00 jobs from Civil Service , and these can now be brought back to the merit system only when Congress reverses itself and passes a law to that effect . That is the contrast . Mr. Bland was asked by the interviewer if the Canadian Parliament . had exempted any comparable army of spoils jobs Leaning backward in his effort to avoid invidious compel isons , Mr Bland , a slight , alert , merry man , who was formerly Chief Examiner of the Canadian service , thought . long and hard Ultimately he said a " few " exceptions to Civil Service had been made . It tuingd out , however , that this comment . was guided by diplomacy rather than absolute fact , for the chief " exception " was the Canadian Tariff Commission , affecting only half a dozen employees and the others were in temporary agencies where exceptions might have , been expected in any case . Internal Revenue Jobs The interviewer thought he could trap the diplomatic Mr. Bland into some expression on the 7,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most notorious Federal spoils jobs " What would you think in Canada of a system where the most mtimole private records of business are opened to spoils appointees ? " he was asked , " where there is always the suspicion that political blackmail might be imposed ? " " Ah , " said Mr. Bland , smiling ; " we do n't appoint them that way in Canada . They are picked ' either as a result of promotion , in the regular career service , or else they are chosen by advisory examining boards of CiviliService officials serving with two or three recognized experts from the business world . The businessmen servo without pay . We have found them patriotically willing to help the Government it furthering Civil Service . Then , again , we have a very definite period of probation before new pppointees become glued " in . Once a man gets attached to the Civil Service it 's hard to drop him . " ? " But you have n't answered my question , " objected the interviewer . " I know it , " smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree mildly that it was " the general feeling ? in Canada that posts so important as tax examiners should be filled by qualified and impartial men , " Competitive System Applicants , for posts comparable to U. S. Deputy Collectors are chosen on the basis of past extxrience , written examinations , and finally oral examinations . There is a strong veterans ' preference , but only if it can be shown conclusively that the veteran is a qualified man . " Generally speaking , " added Mr. Bland , " the great bulk of the Canadian Civil Service Is under the competitive , classified system . " Contrasted with the British system , in which until fah ly recently the honors graduates of Oxford and Cambridge had the pick of the best administrative jobs , the Canadian system has a wider base of selection . The Canadian system has long been the envy of United States MD-dal , who some clay hope the clutch of Congress on 220,000 spoils jobs will be released . On the other hand , - some of the Canadian Provincial Governments , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Service procedure . " But I have found , " added Mr. Bland , still smiling , " that it is wiser for a Civil Service Commissioner , and particularly a guest of another nation , not to make comparisons , either on federal or local matters . You do n't mind ? " ' rho interviewer said he did n't mind  --  much . Richard L. Strout
