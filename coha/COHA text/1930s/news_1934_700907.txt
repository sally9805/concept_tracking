txt Plans of the administration to balance the routine Federal budget for the forthcoming fiscal year while holding the extraordinary relief expenditures to a " reasonably conservative " figure were described late today by Senator Robinson , majority leader , after a four hours ' conference with President Roosevelt , in which Senator Harrison , chairman of the Finance Committee , also participated . Both Senators agreed in expressing the hope that no new taxes will be levied by the next Congress , but they indicated the belief that it will be necessary to continue the " nuisance " taxes which for the most part expire on Jan. 1 . Both Senators definitely opposed payment of the veterans ' bonus . Senator Robinson declined to make an estimate of possible relief needs in the forthcoming fiscal year , but when he was reminded that reports placed the total anywhere from $1,000,000,000 to $12,000,000,000 , he shook his head in positive negation at the latter sum . Senator Robinson remained tonight for a further conference with the President tomorrow morning , but Senator Harrison departed for Washington , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . Rudolf ilecht a Visitor . Following his talks with the Senators Mr. Roosevelt conversed with Rudolf Hecht , president of the American Bankers Association , who reported that he thought cooperation between the administration and business was greater than at any previous time and that team play had brought about a marked improvement in-nearly all lines of industry . The visits of Senators Robinson and Harrison partook of both a social and an official nature . Senator Robinson drove here with Mrs. Robinson from Little Rock , Ark. , to which he plans to return for Thanksgiving . Senator Harrison came by train . President Roosevelt drove from his cottage in his small car to meet his guests and guided them about the foundation . He welcomed them to " the sunny South , " with a laughing allusion to today 's weather , which was sharp enough to require the wearing of heavy wraps . Following the afternoon conference , Senator Robinson , who acted as spokesman , said to the cone-spondents : " I can only say that we are discussing the general conditions that prevail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no detailed statement to make at this time respecting legislation . " It is believed that expenditures for what is termed normal govern- ment operations will be kept well within the income , but it is not possible yet to decide what further arrangements may be necessary regarding continued employment and relief . " In response to questions Senator Robinson said the budget had not been discussed in detail . He added , however , that there is no indication of plans for financing payment of the veterans ' bonus , thus reverifying the administration 's stand against such an extraordinary expenditure . Earlier in the day Senator Harrison had conceded that the bonus presented a perplexing question with the view of the new Congress as a whole as yet unknown . He did not think , however , that such a measure could be passed over the Presidential veto it would certainly encounter if passed . Relief Problem Complex . The relief program for the future and legislation setting up an unemployment insurance system were listed by Senator Robinson as among the more complex matters facing both the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " You ca n't stop relief work and people can not be permitted to starve . " Regarding unemployment insurance , for which a formula is yet to be devised , both Senators agreed that it should not involve Federal expenditure and should benefit only those who contributed to it . " Do you expect any effort to increase existing taxes or to impose new ones ? " Senator Robinson was asked . " There may be small changes , " he replied , " but nothing is expected that will be of great importance . Of course , taxes will depend to a large extent on demands made on the government , but we hope to keep them as they are . Taxes are now being levied which expire in January , but they probably will have to be continued for another year . " These include the Federal gasoline tax , the bank check tax and other excise imposts , including those on electricity and gas bills . " Do you think the government can look to a tapering off of the deficit ? " Senator Robinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , but with a smile he added , " Perhaps the wish is father to the thought . " Hecht Sees Team Work . Mr. Hecht , in talking to newspaper men , recalled his statement to President Roosevelt , made in Washington recently immediately after his election as president of the Bankers Association , that bankers and business were an " allAmerican team . " Keeping that analogy , he continued : " I think there is good team-work going on in the country . I told the President I did n't think it would be long before he had a touchdown and kicked the goal to recovery . " I believe there is a better spirit of cooperation between government and business than we have had in a long , long time , and I think that even the pessimists have to admit that business is looking up . Comparisons in nearly all lines with previous times definitely show that improvement . My statement is based on facts . " Mr. Hecht also discussed with the President possible banking legislation by the next Congress , but declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely between the President and Congress . " The Banking Association , however , might speak as an organization at the proper time . Prior to his talk with the President , Mr. Hecht , in response to questions from the correspondents , said " It is possible that interest rates on saving accounts , now at a level of 2% per cent in New York State , may go lower . " He did not think this would cause a general withdrawal of deposits since the rate named is about the c  --  rent net return on government bu NV le declining to be quilted rectly , he gave the impression that a large majority of bankers favor the operation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , although they are not in sympathy with some of the provisions of the act establishing it . Efforts are looked for to limit the amount of liability of banks under the act when it becomes permanent next July , so that no organization will be in a position to write an " unlimited check " on any bank 's resources . Mr. Hecht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually favored strict examination as this now operated to their protection , but he hoped the examining procedure could be simplified instead of being scattered through four or five Federal organizations .
