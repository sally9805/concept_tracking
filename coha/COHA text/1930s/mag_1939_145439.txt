The swank side of Manhattan 's Central Park is Fifth Avenue on the east , where expensive apartments house Al Smith , many another who can pay for the privilege of looking out on some of the city 's few trees . But the west side of the park , which has a similar view , is no slum . It , too , has fine buildings in which the annual rent of an apartment is as much as the cost of building a modest home . Such a building is the San Remo , whose services employes struck three months ago . <P> Two of the San Remo 's tenants are Mr. and Mrs. Harry Bijur , who pay $5,000 a year for nine rooms . Mrs. Bijur , thirtyish and blonde , is a great-granddaughter of the William Mooney ( no relation to California 's Tom Mooney ) who founded Manhattan 's Tammany Hall . Lawyer Bijur 's late father was Nathan Bijur , a justice of New York 's Supreme Court , and his first cousin is Adman George Bijur . The Harry Bijurs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic charities , no leanings toward parlor pinkery . They might well tire of having strikers picket their expensive doorstep . <P> Instead , every day from the Bijur kitchen ten to 15 Ibs. of meat , seven to ten Ibs. of butter , 18 to 20 loaves of bread have gone to nourish the strikers . The servants do most of the labor , Mrs. Bijur sometimes helps ( see cut ) . To protest the banking department 's failure to rehire the strikers , the Bijurs last month refused to pay rent until served with a dispossess notice . Mrs. Bijur trudged up &; down four flights of stairs rather than use the elevator and condone the presence of strike breakers , some of whom have joined an A. F. of L. union . She said " the scabs " had called her bad names , she had even been told she might have her " puss mashed in with a sledge hammer . " Recently she paid hospital bills for three pregnant wives of strikers . In a little over two months the Bijurs have spent over $3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I just know these people , and even though they are poor they are right . I am helping to avert a revolution in this country by feeding them . What we need to end labor strife is more religion , more charity and a greater obedience to the will of God . ... Six more of the strikers ' wives are pregnant , and it looks as if I will have quite a hospital bill by summer . "
