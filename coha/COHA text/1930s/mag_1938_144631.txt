Last January , President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina , for seven years hard-hitting dictator of the Dominican Republic , announced he was retiring to " private life , " that he would not be a candidate for reelection . That Dictator Trujillo was not going to be any less a dictator in " private life , " however , was evident when he nominated loyal Henchman Dr. Jacinto B. Peynado as his successor . Just where Boss Trujillo stands in his henchman 's estimation is evident from the neon sign which glitters on the front of Peynado 's home . It reads : GOD AND TRUJILLO . Says President-elect Peynado : " It will remain there as long as I live . " <P> Last week , 345,174 male members of the Dominican Party-only legal one in the Dominican Republic-went to the polls . Women were permitted to cast a " symbolic " ballot of confidence . The men voted 92% for Peynado.
