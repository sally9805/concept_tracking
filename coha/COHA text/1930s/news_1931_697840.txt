Maloney , an attorney of 280 Broadway , took recourse in the same reasons for silence used by Mr. Levy . After he had finished testifying , Mr. Wallstein. said : " I believe that the claims of privilege to refuse to testify advanced by these lawyers are unfounded . Since they challenge the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Accounts because of . a Court of Appeals decision now Rending , I would advise the Commissioner of Accounts to delay any procedure to force them to answer until the decision is made . Should the decision sustain the commissioner , I would request that he seek a court order compelling answers under pain of contempt . If the decision is against the Commissioner of Accounts , he must request the legislative investigating committee to apply its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city affairs . " Refuses to Name Land Buyer .
