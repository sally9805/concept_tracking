The U. S. Post Office Department , during the regime of Franklin Roosevelt often at odds with U. S. airlines , last week sent them an amiable invitation : to submit bids for mail contracts on two experimental hauls , a 465-mile route between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh , and a 413-mile loop from Pittsburgh through Clarksburg and Huntington , W. Va . and back to Clarksburg . Catch : without landing , the mailplanes must pick up and deliver air mail at towns scattered from ten to 30 miles apart on each route . <P> Always interesting to aeronauts , scoop-up- &-drop; mail service attracted the fancy of the 75th Congress , which directed the Post Office to call for last week 's bids . Most popular scooping arrangement is a grapple hook dangling from the plane by a rope to catch another rope ( with the mail sack attached ) suspended between two posts . To deliver sacks without bursting them , experimenters have used nets , parachutes , hinged rods on the bottom of the sack which absorb the shock . The Post Office left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil Aeronautics Authority . Deadline for bids : September 15.
