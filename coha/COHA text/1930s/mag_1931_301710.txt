Last week some figures appeared about General Motors stock ownership , were promptly denied by the company . It was true , said the company , that they have 285,615 shareholders ; one in three is a woman ; 44% own ten shares or less ; they live in more than 70 different countries . But the published holdings of officers and directors were inaccurate . Nevertheless the report came from an authoritative source , made impressive reading . <P> Executives and directors were listed for 1,823,682 shares of the company 's stock , or 4.1% in their own names . Some of the holdings : * <P> Preferred Common <P> Chairman of the Board <P> Lammot du Pont 34,250 <P> President <P> Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr . . . 160,000 <P> Vice Presidents <P> Charles T. Fisher 139,250 <P> Fred J. Fisher 4,000 <P> William A. Fisher <P> Lawrence P. Fisher 83,750 <P> R. H. Grant 77 580 <P> Charles F. Kettering 22 2,958 <P> James D. Mooney 100 1,089 <P> Charles S. Mott 649,518 <P> Directors not included above <P> George Fisher <P> Baker Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. du Pont 200 <P> Pierre S. du Pont 10,025 73,513 <P> Louis G. Kaufman 64.935 <P> Seward Prosser 15,585 <P> John Jacob Raskob 22,567 <P> Owen D. Young 98 <P> In addition to these shares , many officers have holdings in General Motors Securities Co. , owner of about 13,000,000 GM shares . Securities stock is exchangeable share for share for GM stock . <P> Charles Stewart Mott leads all others by a margin so great as to stir the imagination . At the current market his 649,518 shares would be worth over $23,000,000 , a vast sum for one man to have in one enterprise . Next in line come George Fisher Baker Jr . with over $6,000,000 worth of stock and Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr . with $5,700,000 . In most companies any man who owned over half a million shares of voting stock could be pointed out as a controlling factor , but not so in General Motors . The company has 43,500,000 common shares outstanding ; Mr. Mott 's staggering block represents only about 1% of the total . <P> <P> * In some cases holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment company in which to carry his GM shares . In other cases the holdings might be smaller , for sometimes an officer of a company wants to sell his stock , thinks it unwise to get his name off the list , therefore quietly takes a short position against his holdings .
