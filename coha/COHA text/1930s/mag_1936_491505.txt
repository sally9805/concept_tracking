S OME 2,000,000 aliens gainfully employed in the United States last year earned approximately $2,100,000,000 . The computation is based upon a Government wage survey with allowances for part-time work . The average annual wage per worker was estimated at 51050 . This outlay for foreign labor was at a time when 20,000,000 persons  --  six-sevenths American citizens and one-seventh other aliens  --  were welfare dependents . There is a widespread belief that mass immigration into the United States was stopped in 1924 , when the bars were put up . This is a mistake . Nearly 2,000,000 immigrants have since wriggled through the quota and nonquota spaces left in the bars and been admitted , many to find work and all to discover that nobody starved in America . Only an emergency makeshift of the Department of State in interpreting strictly the law excluding " persons likely to become a public charge " is now thinning the tide of immigrants that could easily be more than 150,000 a year from Europe , with unlimited thousands from Mexico , Canada and the West Indies . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Hemisphere countries as well as those of Europe , Asia , Africa and the Pacific . We have but a limited restriction . Despite the almost universal enlightened public opinion against restoration of free immigration , the pressure for it is in Congress , and it is likely to continue . At the first sign of a solid economic revival , when more real jobs begin to be available again , it is regarded as almost certain that the temporary clamp on visas will he released and fresh hordes of aliens permitted to flood in to compete for work with our citizens and those aliens already here . " The suicide of a nation , " comments the world . That unemployment difficulties besetting our country could have been lessened is the conviction of those who see them as the consequence of our tenderness toward aliens and the refusal to exercise even a mild application of what is curiously termed " unjust discrimination . " Here aliens are treated like citizens because we do not wish to discriminate against them . In foreign countries our citizens are treated definitely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shove over and make room for their citizens and give them equality with our citizens . But they do not take our citizens at all when they displace their citizens . More than 511,000,000 is flowing abroad yearly from the United States Treasury in compensation to disabled veterans or in pensions to the dependents of deceased veterans who became repatriates of their native lands after service in the United States Army saving Europe from itself . The checks go into eight . European countries . Attorneys for the National Social Security Board say that aliens are eligible for the benefits of the new Social Security Act , including old-age pensions , unemployment compensation and sick-benefit handouts . On Page 407 of the United States Government Manual one reads that " aliens are eligible for home loans " from the Home Owners ' Loan Corporation " in states in which the property is located where they can acquire , hold , and transfer real estate .

They are not exempted from the benefits of the Resettlement Administration , which makes loans and otherwise ( Coartaaed ea Page 821 finances low-income families from both rural and urban areas , either as individual heads of families or as COMmunal groups , as in Soviet Russia . The National Youth Administration 's cash educational aid to deserving students , and all the other implantations of New Deal paternalism have been placed at the disposal of our aliens . Is it any wonder that aliens come to us believing they have vested rights in America , convinced that they own in fee simple large domains here and have great social and economic equities here awaiting their claim ? We have given them everything  --  our work , our wealth and our opportunity . Almost the shirt off our back . " Discriminate " is a word of sundry shadings . One meaning of the word is " to separate by discerning differences , " or , not to plunge rashly into danger without careful thought . This has been the stern European application of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at arm 's length , and nationals given first consideration when it comes to discrimination . Thus they preserve themselves as unified nations . One-Way Hospitality Another meaning of " discriminate " is " to make a difference in treatment or favor , " like an unjust exercise of discretion , or an unjust choice of method , which we have worked out into the grand phrase " unjust discrimination " as the excuse for making repeated concessions to aliens at the expense of our own nationals . " There shall he no unjust discrimination against our aliens " is the outcry of the foreign bloc in Congress , the Department of Labor and the devotees of alienism in the New Deal . Where the American citizen stands with his own Government on foreign employment is made cuttingly clear on Page 11 of a small booklet issued by the Department of State to every American passport holder going abroad : DESTITUTE AMERICANS AnitoAn : Employment conditions in foreign countries are very unfavorable , and Americans proceeding abroad in search of work must understand that no money is at the disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States or to render them financial assistance if they become stranded abroad . Such persons should , therefore , not undertake a trip abroad unless in possession of ample funds for their maintenance abroad and return to this country . Where the American citizen stands with respect to foreign governments upon employment in their countries is equally interesting . In Great Britain the two government agencies , the Home Office and the Ministry of Labor , have the duty of administering the law with regard to employed aliens . All aliens remaining in Great Britain for more than three months must register with the local police , showing their passports and giving their addresses . Changes of address must he reported to the police . Application for a work permit is made in writing , not by the alien but by the prospective employer , to the Minister of Labor . On this application the employer must set forth the exact nature of the proposed duties of the alien , his qualifications therefor , the compensation to be paid , the probable duration of employment and a detailed statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country can not fill the position equally well . The Minister of Labor then gives detailed consideration , making an independent investigation of the case , consulting employment exchanges , employers ' association , trade unions , chambers of commerce , and so on , and , if satisfied that the employment of the alien is in truth necessary to the successful operation of the applicant 's enterprise , the permit is issued for the time considered suitable to the circumstances , this period varying from one week to one year . This work permit is given to the prospective employer , who sends it to the alien . The alien in fL foreign country exhibits it , but does not surrender it , when applying to a British consul for a visa on his passport . On arrival at the British port of entry , the alien again exhibits his work permit , and surrenders it to an immigration officer . The immigration officer makes an appropriate indorsement on the alien 's passport , and attaches the Ministry of Labor work permit to the record of admission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the period specified , the employer desires to retain the services of the alien employee , or if any change in status or of employment is desired  --  for instance , if another employer wishes his services  --  a new application must be made to the Home Office . Seven hundred and forty Americans were admitted last year to the privilege of working in Great Britain , while in the same period 3432 immigrants of the English race came to us . In addition , 34,436 nonimmigrants of the English race entered the United States last year . There are approximately 1,400,000 persons born in Great Britain and Northern Ireland resident in the United States , and this does not include 1,300,000 other British here who are Canadian-born . As one-third of our foreign-horn are aliens , it follows that about 500,000 British aliens are enjoying American hospitality , working , being helped or living on their own savings .

If it is proposed to augment a British dance band by the introduction of American musicians , such introduction may be permitted up to 25 per cent , on condition that no British musician is discharged to make room for an alien . Complete bands to play symphonic or national music are admitted upon the assurance that no British band or British musician is being displaced and that the alien band or its members will not play for dancing . These are but a few of the alien regulations of the tight little island . The British-born picture folk of casual Hollywood experience have been listed . They classify as follows : England , twenty-five actresses , eighty-two actors , twelve directors and five scenario writers ; Canada , sixteen actresses , twenty actors , twelve directors and five scenario writers ; Australia , six actresses , nine actors and one director ; Ireland , five actresses , sixteen actors , four directors and one scenario writer ; New Zealand , one actress , two actors and one director ; Scotland , eleven actors , two directors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , one actor and one director ; Trinidad , one actress , and Wales , Jamaica and British Guiana , one actor each . American foreign-born , who can be regarded as fairly recent aliens , take an important place in the professions and occupations of the United States . With acknowledgments to the Bureau of the Census , it may be stated that they number : 6000 actors , 12,000 lawyers , 30,000 members of the clergy , 20,000 physicians and surgeons , 45,000 schoolteachers , 26,000 musicians and teachers of music , 3000 theater owners , managers and officials , 8000 dentists , 5000 editors and reporters , 4600 stenographers and typists , 90,000 waiters , 78,000 cooks , 5000 members of college faculties , 14,000 policemen and 7000 photographers . Americans in Germany I was recently in the Capitol Hill sanctum of a member of Congress who was born in Germany , when his telephone rang and a high cleric of a great city begged him to use his good offices and political influence to have a certain relief bureau for transients reopened . The bishop making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany for more than six months must obtain permits to remain , called aufenthults erlaithnis , and those taking employment must secure them prior to going to work . After an alien has established legal domicile in Germany , he becomes subject to taxation on his property wherever located , and must declare , for fiscal purposes , his property holdings abroad as well as in Germany . To employ an American to work in Germany , any prospective employer must obtain permission from the local labor bureau , and the American is required to secure a work permit called arbef1er erlaubnis from the local police office , ( Continued on Page 84 ) ( Continued from Page 82 ) which is valid , at most for twelve months , and must be renewed . Unless the labor bureau is convinced of the need of the American 's services for the expansion and improvement of German industry , authority is ordinarily denied . Through a system of national subsidies and international cartel relationships the German steel firm of tiloeckner &; Co. some weeks ago demonstrated how easy it was to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of German labor inside America . Polish furniture , French cement , Canadian wheat , cattle and timber , Japanese textiles , toys and electric bulbs , Czecho-Slovakian glassware and various manufactures from other countries are making similar entrances . These are examples of alien labor coming here in the form of foreign material to displace.both American and alien labor in the United States . The extent to which foreign industries have been pooled in order to compete with and undersell American products is set forth in part by Sir Robert Cahill , C. AI . G. , Commercial Counsellor at the British Embassy in Paris , as follows : " International agreements respecting specific steel products have existed foi . nearly thirty years ( e. g. , that for rails ) , but none matched in scope and importance the International Crude Steel Agreement , first concluded in October 1926 , between France , Germany , the Saar , Belgium and Luxemburg , and to which Austria , Hungary and ( with limitations ) Czechoslovakia subscribed as from the beginning of 1927 . Under this agreement , steel production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonnage excesses were penalized by fine ; but prices were not fixed , nor were exportable quotas to foreign markets apportioned . On its expiry in March 1930 , it was formally renewed for short periods , but it may be regarded as having been in operation throughout 1931 and 1932 . Negotiations were conducted with a view to its renewal upon a different basis : namely , instead of determining in advance the national output of the national participants , and fildng penalties for excess production , to take the exports in a given period and to assign to each participant exportable quotas , and to create international selling organizations that would rest upon national controlling bodies organized . in the participating countries . Great difficulties were encountered in the long-drawn-out negotiations which were finally successful in February , 1933 ; and , in May , the French , German , Saar , Belgian and Luxemburg groups signed a convention , to take effect as from June first , for the setting up of international compleirs to regulate for five years the sale of all main current products ( semis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , large flats and hoops ) . " Europe 's Methods of Control In Italy , any American desiring to work must also first obtain a permit . This work permit may be obtained from an Italian diplomatic or consular officer in America before starting for Italy , or from the chief police officer of the place where work is to be had . The catch is that the heads of all offices and business or industrial establishments in Italy must submit to the local police a full report concerning each alien within five clays after putting him on the pay roll . Foreigners working in Italy , however , are bound by the Italian labor laws and enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining and the protection of insurance against illness , accidents and unemployment . The condition of the Italian labor market determines whether foreigners can enter . Foreign business houses are allowed to employ a limited number of foreign clerks , but the percentage is not fixed and is left to the local police , who consult the competent Fascist Employers ' Association and Fascist Workers ' Syndicate before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt of an alien to obtain employment from a French national are so numerous and exacting that , to all intents and purposes , it is an impossibility . All aliens in France must register and obtain cards of identity from the police , which must be shown whenever requested by the authorities charged with control of aliens . Americans who wish to toil under the tricolor are required to have a health certificate and specific authority for working , even for other Americans or for themselves . Every country in Europe repels aliens . A count established that in a single automobile factory in Detroit more aliens were employed than there are Americans working in all the foreign countries . . filten Penetration The present-day alien penetration into American work has been surveyed . This is concerned only with the alien , and not the naturalized foreign-born . In agriculture it is 3 per cent .. In all mining it is a minimum of 7 per cent , but in coal mining it reaches 9 per cent , in the iron mines 15 per cent , and in the copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries run 8 per cent alien , although in certain industries there are higher foreign peaks  --  for instance , automobile manufacture , 9 per cent , blast furnaces and steel rolling mills , 10 per cent , and other iron and steel and machinery factories nearly 11 per cent . The alien workers in transportation and communication average about 5 per cent , but in water transportation the number is double that . In the number of alien sailors , cooks and stewards employed on American vessels , there are 37,751 in the overseas trade , 8038 in the near-by foreign trade and 8712 in the coastwise trade , or about 22 per cent of all unlicensed men on American ships . These aliens , in their largest racial groups , represent Germany , Norway , Sweden and Soviet Russia . All officers on American ships must be citizens , which likely accounts for 13,151 out of 37,729 officers being naturalized  --  about 3,5 per cent that otherwise would probably be alien . The classification of trade is 9 per cent alien , but banking and brokerage is only slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopkeepers and merchants who can not claim America as their land of birth , but the great majority are either naturalized or being naturalized . They constitute one-fifth of the entire wholesale and retail trade workers . The recreation and amusement departments of American home affairs are 5 per cent alien . Hotels , restaurants and boardinghouses are 9 per cent alien , and domestic and personal service is 6 per cent simon-pure foreign . The American Federation of Labor , which touches all types of work in its 109 national and international unions and 31,291 local unions , is 14 per cent alien in its membership . William Green , president of the Federation , said : " We admit aliens to membership without question . But we are teaching citizenship in the unions and have an Americanization committee at the national headquarters . All aliens who have been admitted into the country should and must become American citizens  --  those legally here . Those illegally here should be deported , and deported quickly . " Nationalities have shown preferences for certain callings . The Portuguese are in the textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Finns are in iron and copper mining . French Canadians are found in cotton mills and shoe factories . Russian Jews and some Italians are in the clothing trade . The Slovaks and Russians are in coal mining and in the iron and steel plants . Lithuanians are in coal mining , sugar and oil refining and clothing manufacturing . Hungarians are in mining , plow-making plants and silk dyeing . The Poles and South Italians are in almost every line of mining and manufacturing . Italians are justly proud that , East and West , they have kinsmen in high places  --  the Italian-American Angelo J. Rossi , flower seller of the Golden Gate , now mayor of San Francisco , and the Italian-American Morello H. La Guardia , once interpreter at Ellis Island , now mayor of New York . Immigrants can be hurried into a legal citizenship , but they can not be rushed into Americanization , and the fault is not always theirs . They are kept alien , segregated in the great cities into more or less separate groups , each with a life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches . New York now has six Little Italy colonies in any one of which English is a foreign language . Modern Manhattan nurtures Old World nuclei like a bewildered hen that hatches strange chicks . An example of the tenacity with which our foreign people hold together is shown at the new limited dividend housing project of Hillside in the Bronx , which obtained a 4 per cent Federal loan approximating 35,000,000 . Tho buildings are of red brick , grouped about landscape gardens . There are some 1500 apartments equipped with tiled bathrooms , parquet floors , Venetian blinds , electricity and cross-ventilation . A. R. Clas , director of Federal housing , says : " Fifty-two per cent of the first 1184 families to sign leases are Jewish . Families of Italian descent are second with 17 per cent of the tenancy . The remainder runs the gamut of racial complexions . " Americans in Name Only I have visited neighborhood centers of the metropolis where cluster members of seventeen nationalities  --  unbroken units of foreign people picked up in bulk over there and set down over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has been progress in a moving box . They cling to old customs , to native foods , drinks and dress , and strive together in attempts to re-create pale wraiths of the homelands . They are tied fast to one another and the Old World in thousands of racial clubs , societies and lodges , some of the organizations religious , others fraternal and a fow frankly military . Many of these aliens stay foreign into the second and third generations . Americanism is a mask put on for Election Day , job hunting and relief getting . Their bodies are here , their minds overseas . Encouraging the aliens in their steadfastness to Old World traditions is the foreign-language press-1073 publications in thirty-seven languages , of which 139 are daily newspapers . The dailies bear a close likeness to the American newspaper in physical make-up , tone and diversity of contents , but there the resemblance ends . It would be impossible for them to exist and not preach or insinuate a dual loyalty to their readers . A common language is the first and fundamental essential of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but act as a hold-back to language unity in the new tongue . They keep the birthland spirit alive , rekindling old fires . A survey of the foreign-language press by Read Lewis , director of the Foreign Language Information Service , developed that of the 139 daily newspapers , eighteen are in the German language , fourteen each in the Polish and Japanese languages , eleven in Spanish , nine each in Yiddish and Chinese , seven each in Czechoslovakian , French and Russian , six in Italian , five each in Finnish and Slovene , four each in Hungarian and Lithuanian , three each in Slovak . Greek and Armenian , two each in Serbian , Ukrainian , Portuguese and Syrian , and one each in Croatian and Rumanian . Towers of Babel Foreign-language publications , classified , were : 690 general , 123 fraternal , 130 religious , 10 agriculture , 24 trade , 32 educational , 52 literary and 12 for women . Examples of the circulations of some of the important dailies : Jewish Forward , 168,552 ; II ProgressoItalo Americana , 83,601 ; Svornost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Kuryer Polski , Polish , 32,250 , and Staats-Herold , German , 65,296 . I have talked with many of the editors of these foreign-language publications . They were cultured , intelligent and sincere , but the subject concerned their living . They explained that they made aliens more familiar with American ways , institutions and opportunities . Some produced editorials that they had written in which was advocated that their people learn English as rapidly as possible , and that they spare no time in becoming naturalized citizens of the United States . Yet how could they continue to publish without some appeal to racial pride or stressing their own far-away national issues ? I had been living in Washington , D. C. , before starting upon this countrywide look-see into the question of aliens upon relief , at work and in subversive activities . The national capital is the focal center of all foreign sentimentalism . The embassies and the legations are there . It is in Washington that one hears such sweet-sounding half truths as " The Americans wo n't do common labor : : : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All racial stocks will soon become a common strain in the American distillation process " and " Ideals and institutions can he carried on by one assimilation as well as by another . " Fine phrases do not fit cold facts . I have encountered few signs of this assimilation between the different nationalities or between the aliens and the old . American traditions . On the contrary , there are numerous localities 86 EVENING POST where the native American stock appeared to have " gone foreign . " Just submerged in a sea of foreign faces . In an old but good hotel on Manhattan Island , a look was taken at the help . Of the maids who looked after the rooms , one was a French Canadian , one was English and one was Irish . Of the eleven waiters encountered in the restaurant , seven were German , two were Swiss and two were French  --  graduates of the " exchange professorship " under which waiters are trained in Europe around the . circuit of Berlin , London and Paris , often with a background of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the elevator boys was a Swede , another an Armenian , and two were Italians . The bellboys were German , Italian and Austrian . Not an American was connected with the service of the hotel ; the Americans were the guests and the unemployed in the streets outside . There was the same foreign service of mixed nationalities at the hotels of the Great Lakes cities  --  Buffalo , Cleveland , Detroit and Chicago , except that , in two instances , the waiters in the dining rooms were American Negroes , who were perfect in skill and attention . The help of the hotel in . Seattle was Scandinavian . American barbers , bellhops and porters , some almost venerable , were on the job at the San Francisco hotel , but the waiters were foreign . American girl waitresses predominated in the eating places of Los Angeles , San Diego , El Paso and San Antonio . In El Paso , little Mexican girls ran the hotel elevators . The helping hands in the four Southwestern states along the border were always the same brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did the clerking in many of the big stores and were installed as doormen , stenographers , window cleaners , and , in some of the offices , as secretaries . Mexicans do about all the outdoor hard labor of the Southwest . An eye flash of one class of work that they perform came when the Golden State Limited of the Southern Pacific Railroad halted less than I00 miles west of El Paso , where there had been an overflow of the Rio Grande . The 300 odd men who had repaired the tracks , who were revealed doffing their hats as the train slowly went over the newly made patch of roadway , were Mexicans . When there are railroads to be built in this country of cactus and sand , they build them . America Via Mexico Where the Mexicans excel is as vegetable laborers in the onion and lettuce fields , growers of cantaloupe and the citrus fruits , berry gatherers , cotton pickers and coal , copper and silver miners in Texas . I rode for an entire day in an automobile through the cantaloupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf , and entering the onion-growing , winter-garden district south of San Antonio without seeing a single native-horn white at work . Although termed the most unassimilable of aliens , Mexicans have leap-frogged from the Rio Grande into the sugar-beet fields of Colorado , and on beyond into Illinois , Indiana and Michigan , where they are active in the meat-packing plants of Chicago , the steel industry of Gary and the copper mines of the Calumet region , Others than Mexicans come out of Mexico . Not long ago two foreign-looking men wore picked up by the January TS , 5926 Immigration Border Patrol near El Paso , Texas . They were i ' standing in a puzzled mood on the El Paso and Soutthwestern Railroad tracks when apprehended . Under pressure of sharp questioning which necessitated the employment of an Italian interpreter , one of the men broke down and confessed that each had paid an immigrant agent back in Italy 8300 to land them in Chicago . They were Italians who had come to Mexico , and an alien smuggler had waded them across the Rio Grande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , pointing in two directions , said " That way is Chicago and this way is Los Angeles . Take your choice and keep walking . " The two Italians were deported to Italy , but nothing further was developed concerning this undoubted underground route for shipping Italians to America via Mexico . Loopholes in the Allen Wall The immigration patrolmen of the El Paso district , embracing Arizona , New Mexico and West Texas , are expected to guard a border line of about 1100 miles . The present authorized personnel for that purpose consists of eighty-three patrol inspectors and twenty-seven senior patrol inspectors , a total force of 110 men . Apparently this would give each officer a distance of ten miles to patrOl . But at least two officers must work together as a measure of self-protection , so that in theory , the border has one man  --  or one team  --  patrolling twenty miles of territory twenty-four hours of every day , which is a physical impossibility . The work is accordingly apportioned in shifts of eight hours each , which in effect places upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of frontier . But being human beings they are subject to illness and need time off to rest , and when there is a criminal prosecution they must attend court to testify , a procedure requiring three appearances , one each before the United States Commissioner , the Federal grand jury and the trial jury , in addition to which is the time lost in the general turnover resulting from deaths , transfers , resignations and dismissals . It is estimated that the loss of manpower from purely patrol work attributable to these several causes is about 25 per cent , so that instead of ten miles , each man or team must account for a border line of not less than seventy-five miles . The entire frontier of the United States is some 10,000 miles , about half land and half water . There are 172 ports of entry and sixteen airports designated as ports for aliens . To cover the intervening space between ports of entry with the total present border patrol of 900 men on the yardstick of the assignments of the El Paso district is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3898 miles of Canadian border , Is it not possible that thousands of aliens from Europe have flocked to Mexico and Canada also , to use those countries as bases from which to walk into the United States , legally if possible , illegally if not ? What is to prevent the bulk of them getting in ? The Mexican peon can not understand the reason for any border line between his native land and the United States . In either case , when he works , so Far as Southern Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California are concerned , he is among other Mexicans . There is this difference : In Mexico he is always ( Continued en Page 89 ) ( Continued from Peg . 86 ) paid starvation wages , and only when he works , but in America , upon his standard of living , he is bountifully fed and housed , whether he works or not .

There are 45,000 Filipinos in this country , and 50 per cent of them were in gainful occupations in California , Oregon and Washington . More than 8000 of the total are chauffeurs , butlers and domestic servants , and 17,000 are farm laborers , chiefly in California . " Independence for Filipinos make much out-of-work in Manila , " was one Filipino 's verdict on the gift of political freedom to the Philippines . The Chinese Invasion Seventy-five thousand Chinese are permanently domiciled in this country , 55 per cent upon the Pacific slope . In 1932-33 there was an anti-Chinese agitation in Mexico , and thousands of Chinese fled across the border into the United States , whence they were deported to China at the expense of the American Government . All Chinese seeking admission to the United States claim American citizenship , and newcomers declare themselves American citizens born abroad . The Chinese Exclusion Act was passed more than a generation ago . In California , 5000 Chinese are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shopkeepers , 1200 are laundry owners and operatives , and 500 are sailors .

No Japanese in the United States has appealed for relief , according to the official records I have seen and the statements of relief workers . The Japanese are in jobs . They help one another . Of the 140,000 in America , 70 per cent are employed , and the others are women looking after the homes . Three thousand Japanese own or operate farms , and 15,000 are farm laborers in California . However , nearly 5000 are domestic servants in American households . George Washington , first President , and outstandingfounderof our country , said : " My opinion with respect to immigration is that except of useful mechanics and some particular descriptions of men or professions , there is no need of encouragement . . . I have no intention to invite immigrants , even if there are no restrictive acts against it , I am opposed to it altogether .

Finley could n't abandon his case  --  at least , that would be my we already have among us that must imperatively be raised to a higher standard of living and a safer citizenship . " From 1784 to 1794 , immigration to the United States did not average more than 4000 per year , and from 1794 to 1810 , the average did not exceed 6000 per annum . From 1810 to 1816 , there was a cessation in immigration , due to the War of 1812 . Beginning in 1817 , immigration was resumed , and that year about 20,000 came . This caused the legislation of 1819 requiring that a list , or manifest , of all passengers on arriving ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total recorded immigration to . the United States since 1819 , in round numbers , is 38,000,000 persons .

Among the fifteen foreign-horn members of the House of Representatives , Samuel Dickstein , lawyer and Democrat , of New York City , is recognized as the most outstanding voice in opposing the so-called " unjust discrimination " against aliens .

We might as well be frank about it . " On February 6 , 1934 , when economic conditions would seem to have warranted discouraging new citizenship instead of encouraging it , Mr. Dickstein reported from the House Immigration and Naturalization Committee a bill which substantially reduced naturalization fees .
