One midnight last week Dr. Gonzalo Vazquez Vela , newly elected Governor of Vera Cruz , was inaugurated amid the bursting of skyrockets . Thirty-six hours later Governor Vela signed his first decree . It created the rank of Favored Son of Vera Cruz , bestowed this rank and a medal ( to be designed and struck as soon as possible ) on " all citizens who heroically resisted the American invasion of Vera Cruz in 1914 . " <P> Next day , confident that he had won the good will of numberless Favored Sons , Governor Vazquez Vela was ready for 5,000 ill-favored men , women &; children who hunger-marched into Jalapa crying , " Bread and Shelter ! " As the pleading throng approached the Governor 's Palace police rushed forth , clubbed them back , jailed 60 , drove the rest out of Jalapa.
