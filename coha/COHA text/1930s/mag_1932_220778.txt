Once again unruly John Thomas Lang , Labor Premier of New South Wales , thumbed his big nose last week at the Commonwealth Government which is still trying to impound state taxes to pay off New South Wales 's defaulted foreign debts . Australian newspapers announced that Premier Lang had capitulated and handed over the keys of the State tax offices to Commonwealth officers . Next morning they learned the truth . Sparring for time , John Thomas Lang had merely handed over a great bundle of lists of paupers in New South Wales . <P> It was almost his last trick . In Canberra Australia 's Parliament passed laws seizing one-sixth of the new Sydney Harbor Bridge tolls , death duties , liquor and automobile taxes . Further , it rushed through a bill aimed straight at John Thomas Lang himself : any State official impeding the Commonwealth Government in the seizure of State revenues to meet defaults in the State 's foreign debt is liable to a fine of $5,000 or three years ' imprisonment .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
