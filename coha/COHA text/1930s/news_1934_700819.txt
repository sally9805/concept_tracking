txt City taxes on salaries above $20 a week and a 1 per cent sales tax ; were advocated yesterday by the city 's bankers in a letter to Mayor LaGuardia as alternatives to the present program for local income taxes and gross business taxes . As soon as the suggestions were made , a strong likelihood developed that the Mayor would scrap the present program , including the city lottery plan , which is to be the sub , ject of a public hearing in City wall at 10 o'clock this morning . Controller Joseph D. said definitely that the bankers will have the final word in the matter , because they have the funds the city needs to finance relief for the next year . In discussing the program put forward by the bankers the Controller said : " The ultimate decision whether these tax measures become law lies with those having the money . The bankers were reluctant to finance a relief program that had as its start a bad obligation . The bankers feel that the city should not unhinge its credit again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks indicate that they will not lend to us until we have what they consider a proper program . " Strong Opposition Looms. : Strong opposition to a salary tax was held certain to develop in the Board of Aldermen , which , with the Board of Estimate , must legalize the measure . The local income tax sponsored by Alderman Walter R. Hart and the gross business tax have now reached the stage as city bills where they await only the Mayor 's signature to make them law . Having defeated the Mayor 's original proposal for a business tax of one-half of 1 per cent on gross income , the Aldermen felt that they had a workable program in the local income tax and the reduced business tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent . Alderman Hart , one of the leaders in the Democratic majority in the board , said yesterday : " I do n't think the payroll tax would have a chance in the Board of Aldermen . The Board of Aldermen will never descend to taxing the office boys , clerks and stenographers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers ' new suggestions , the need for immediate relief funds became more acute . Controller said he had used $10,000,000 from other funds to finance relief , adding that he must borrow more not later than Oct. 1 . The city 's minimum requirements on Oct. 1 run to more than $4,000,000. $37,000,000 Revenue Seen . The bankers and the city 's fiscal officers believe that $2,000,000,000 a year represents the total paid yearly in salaries in this city . A 1 per cent tax on that amount would therefore yield $20,000,000 a year . In the fourteen-month period of the State sales tax , $20,500,000 was collected in one district including Manhattan , the Bronx. , Westchester and Rockland counties , and another including Brooklyn , Queens , Suffolk and Nassau . " Our calculations for New York City indicates that the sales tax would bring a revenue of $17,000 , - 000 , " Controller said . " If the salary tax is enacted at 1 per cent and the return is $20 , - 000,000 , of course the relief requirements will not be met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it up to its proper total . " No definite conclusion has been reached on the possible exemptions from the salary tax . The Controller said the bankers felt that where salaries were $20 a week or less the employer should pay the entire tax . Between $20 and $60 a week.he said they believed the employer should pay half the tax and the employe the other half . Above S60 a week the bankers believed the employe should pay the entire tax , the Controller said . All compensation derived from work , labor and services is included in this tax plan . " Win city employes be included in the tax ? " Controller was asked . " That depends entirely on the way the bill is drawn , " he replied . " We do not look with favor upon a tax that will be paid entirely by small wage earners . We believe that people with incomes ought to make a contribution too . " The administration began by saying that relief must be put upon a tax basis . The bankers agree . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax . There 's one thing we should do and that is not to have the whole proposition cluttered up with taxes . It would make ridiculous the whole procedure . We know the relief problem next Winter will not be any less , and we hope it will not be any greater . We are not the masters of that situation . " The bankers made clear in their letter their belief that neither the local income tax nor the gross business tax could be depended upon to provide the required revenues . Mayor LaGuardia and the Controller told the bankers that they could not estimate what the yield from these taxes would be . The lottery plan was dismissed by the bankers as unworthy of consideration because of its doubtful legality . Doubtful legality of the suggested two-cent tax on transit fares was also stressed by the banking group . Neither the banks nor the transit companies want this tax , which has been urged by business leaders as an alternative to the Mayor 's plan . When the Mayor was told that the bankers doubted the legality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one time the bankers and I are in agreement . " The bankers ' letter discussed six tax proposals , including those already under consideration . Hold Bank Plan Sufficient . " As to the two remaining methods of taxation referred to above , namely the payroll tax and the sales tax , the best information is that if these be adopted their yield would be sufficient to produce the amount required without attempting to rely upon other sources doubtful as to legality or as to yield , " it said . " The policy adopted by you that the entire relief program should be financed on the pay-as-you-go basis is in our opinion eminently sound . " The letter was signed by Winthrop W. Aldrich , chairman of the board of the Chase National Bank . Other signers were George Whitney of J. P. Morgan &; Co. ; Co. ? Seward Prosser of the Bankers Trust Company ; Jackson E. Reynolds of the First National Bank ; William C. Potter of the Guaranty Trust Company and Gordon S. ( Rentschler of the National City Bank . They comprise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After reading the letter of the bankers , Aldermanic President Bernard S.

Any payroll tax for which I would Note , if it came to a point where I would be required to vote , would provide for the payment of the tax by both employers and employes . " I do not understand from the statement of the bankers to the Mayor that it is their intention that the entire burden be placed upon the employes solely . If so , that in my opinion would be inadequate . Deutsch Foresees Fight . " After the proposed sales tax , the business interests recently demonstated most emphatically against any sales tax . Do the bankers speak with any authority , or have they assurances of the support of the business interests for such a tax ?

" I am glad to see the interest of the banking group in the continuance of relief . It would have been infinitely better if their suggestions could have been had before a tax program had been decided upon . " With the payroll and sales taxes facing almost certain adoption , today 's public hearing on the lottery plan will be pretty much " like kicking a dead horse , " one official said yesterday . Mrs. Jacob Riis of 522 Fifth Avenue wrote to the Mayor declaring that she was for the lottery , and his recent mail has contained many similar expressions .

WALL ST . FAVORS PLAN . Holds Bankers ' Tax Program Is Sound in Practice . The Wall Street banking community was generally in agreement yesterday that the letter of Winthrop W. Aldrich , chairman - of the board of the Chase National Bank , to Mayor LaGuardia , expressing the opinion that a payroll tax and a city-wide sales tax would be the most likely of the several tax plans considered to yield sufficient revenues to warrant a bank loan for unemployment relief , epitomized sound banking practice . It was explained that the letter was written in response to a request from the Mayor for an opinion of the bankers on taxes to finance relief . The bankers made the point yesterday that while the city would require about $50,000,000 for relief over a twelve-month period , and would need close to $40,000,000 in the first six months , it would not have to borrow the money for so long a period , inasmuch as the inflow of new taxes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that the mechanics of the lending had not been determined hut that it would probably take the form of a banking credit against which the city could draw as it required .
