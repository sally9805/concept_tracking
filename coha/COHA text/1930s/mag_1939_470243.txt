ON THE softly sloping green of St. John 's College in Annapolis there stands a tree that was old when the Susquehanna Indians played Czechoslovakia to the white man . It is a great tulip poplar , known to two centuries of St. Johnnies as the Liberty Tree . They say that fifty years ago the Liberty Tree was dying . It looked healthy enough from a distance ; its branches were rich and luxuriant , but its wondrous trunk was hollowed with rot . The Liberty Tree required desperate and drastic surgery . One Fourthof July a crowd of St. Johnnies stuck some explosive ? dynamite , they say ? inside the trunk and blasted out the rot . The Liberty Tree revived , and if you happen to be in Annapolis you may see it approaching its sixth or seventh hundred birthday in its pristine vigor . Two years ago there arrived at St. John 's College a couple of young men who believe that the tree of human liberty is dying ? dying not of old age or of wounds inflicted from without , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trunk of the tree of liberty is education , and American education , they say , is rotten . So they threw up their jobs as professors in a great university and went to St. John 's College and stuck some dynamite inside the trunk of the human liberty tree . " Winkie " Barr ? no one knows how Stringfellow got to be " Winkie " ? and Scott Buchanan take the ancient view that liberty ? human liberty ? is something more than the animal liberty of bacon and beans , that it is first and foremost the freedom of the human mind . And they hold that the mind can not be freed from ignorance and prejudice , any more than the body can be freed from disease , except by the exercise of painful discipline . For fifteen years as students and another fifteen as professors ( both are about forty years old ) they watched American education flourish externally while the proportion of really free men and women produced by the schools and colleges grew smaller and smaller , while the discipline of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as President Woodrow Wilson of Princeton once observed , the sideshows of education were putting the main tent out of business . They decided to do something about it . And , unlike so many of us , they knew what they wanted to do . They wanted to revive the liberal education that the Adamses and Jefferson and Jay and Madison had in college . They wanted to restore to American education the books that Washington , Franklin , and Lincoln read without the benefit of four comfortable years in an expensive university ; they wanted to discipline young men 's minds in reading , writing , and reasoning , the human arts of understanding and communication , the historic liberal arts from which our " liberal arts colleges " take their name . This is the education for which President Robert M. Hutchins of Chicago has been touting for ten years , and St. John 's College to-day is the answer to the question , " Yes ? but will it work ? " The purpose of St. John 's , according to the charter granted it in 1784 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of virtue , knowledge , and useful literature . " One of the petitioners for that charter was William Paca , who had signed the Declaration of Independence , and three other signers , Charles Carroll , Samuel Chase , and Thomas Stone , served on the college 's Board of Visitors and Governors . To St. John 's , Washington sent his adopted son and his two nephews , and at St. John 's the privileged few who in those days went to college learned to read and to read good books . This liberal education , which , strangely enough , is labeled " experimental " these days , had been given at St. John 's since 1696 , when the institution was founded as King William 's School and its object was stated , not as preparation for jobs nor as four years of fun , but as " the propagation of good Learning . " Good learning eventually finds its way into books . We all admit that good books are somehow good . We recognize that there exists an unbroken tradition , going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals are rooted . We concede that this tradition is most classically recorded and expressed by the best men and the greatest teachers in every age , men who , though they may have lived centuries apart , went to school together , refining , reworking , and bequeathing the tradition they inherited . We know that man alone , through the medium of language , hands down to his descendants something more than mere reflexes . We know all this . We know what most of the great books are , beginning with Homer . We pay them homage whenever we hear them mentioned , and we quote them impressively out of Bartlett 's Quotations . They are the books we all intend to read some day , thoughwe did n't read them in school or college . Most of them are found in every standard library . They are published and sold in standard sets , most of them selling for less than a dollar . We do n't have to go to college to read them ; most of the Harvard Classics , indeed , are not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , we can read these books if we want to . And we can understand them if we try : there is nothing anyone can teach a man that a man ca n't learn by himself . But a " classic " is , by popular definition , a book that nobody reads . The very word is odious , suggesting drudgery and dust , something we can leave to professors ? who , incidentally , do n't read them either . We tell ourselves that most of these books are " dated , " that things have changed since they were written . But we forget that while things have changed , men have not . To-day we have Reno and radio , incendiary bombs instead of the stake , and tanks instead of rams ; but we love , hate , work , and fight for the same reasons as the ancient Greeks ; and we live and die with or without the same aspirations . Details have altered , the scale is larger , new instruments and technics have been devised ; but human nature and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these problems and is as good to-day as it was yesterday . It is a book that is contemporary in any age and in any place . What are the best sellers ? Uncle Tam 's Cabin ? Horatio Alger ? Peck 's Bad Boy ? Gone with the Wind ? Not compared with the Bible , The Divine Comedy , Don Quixote , Hamlet , or Paradise Last . These books have been read by millions in every language . It may be estimated , so conservatively as to raise no dispute , that the Iliad has been read , over the last 3,000 years , by 25,000,000 people . Last year 's best sellers are forgotten or out of print . The first American college class in fifty years to have read these books , to have had firsthand contact with the original sources of our civilization , are the members of the Class of ' 41 at St. John 's College . Not only are they reading them ; they are learning how to read . They are not memorizing snatches from them or learning their dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will do in later life the arts of language , the processes of analyzing and criticizing terms and propositions , arguments and contradictions . They are sharpening the instruments ? the only instruments ? with which men are able to distinguish ends and means , significant and trivial , general and particular , and straight and crooked . This is the education that was given at the liberal arts colleges of the country a century and two ago . To-day it is given in no other liberal arts college in America but St. John 's . A century ago the selected few went to college ; to-day the unselected many . Is this the best education for the many , as it was for the few ? The Messrs . Barr and Buchanan have undertaken to find that out , bringing with them the faith , without which democracy itself must be a fraud , that ordinary boys and girls can be educated ? can learn something more than a trade ? if the schools will only give them a chance . And the St. John 's boys are ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small towns of Maryland , and few of them would be admitted to Harvard or Chicago . At least half of them are working their way through school . If the members of the Class of ' 41 at St. John 's are able to absorb the best education , if they turn out to be free men ? in the historic sense of that word ? then the excuse that the " masses " can not cope with the best education will no longer serve as an excuse for handing out the worst . As to whether the Class of ' 41 will turn out to be free men , we shall have to wait ten or fifteen years . As to whether they are able to master the books , we shall see in a moment . II Two years ago St. John 's was probably the worst example extant of the kind ofeducational philosophy that is gradually putting the American college on the rocks . This once proud institution , older than any college in America except Harvard and William and Mary , had fallen to low estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overdue mortgage on its own property . Faculty morale was nonexistent . Standards had been abandoned in a futile effort to attract students . There had been three presidents in seven years , the last of whom suggested making the school co-educational , doubtless with the notion that the proximity of the Naval Academy would serve as bait . Mr. H. L. Mencken , a big Maryland taxpayer , observed just before Barr and Buchanan took over that the most impressive thing about St. John 's was that it received $67,000 a year from the State and that every student cost the taxpayers $249 . Hundreds of small colleges were ? and are ? as sorely straitened as St. John 's was . Their decline , paralleled by the enrichment of the universities , may be traced , in part , to the spread of the elective system . Two generations ago the required curriculum gave way to an assortment of " offerings . " The educator , who was once thought qualified to prescribe for ignorance as the physician does for disease , was reduced to the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , selecting whichever kind of pill looked easiest to swallow . The universities rapidly abandoned the effort to do good teaching and became research institutions , offering the undergraduates , as a substitute for mental discipline , lavish accommodations for fun and frolic . The colleges , instead of picking up the teaching burden , made the fatal mistake of trying to compete with the universities at their own game . It is said of a small boy , but it might as well have been a college freshman , that he came home from a " progressive " school in Virginia and said , " Mama , I do n't want to learn what I want to learn ; I want to learn how to read and write . " With the exception of a few Copeys or Frosts ? vestiges of the time when teaching was a great profession ? the college and university faculties came to consist of specialists , mediocre or renowned . The colleges began to complain that they could not do good teaching because the best men went into research . They ignored the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Methuselah , were still available . Modern America is the first country since Athens which believes that Socrates actually died when he took the hemlock . Most of the colleges survived by offering diplomas to children who could not meet the entrance or financial requirements of attending a big university . American parents continued to want their boys and girls to be Bachelors of Arts , even though the Arts had disappeared from education and the Bachelors never matured into intellectual Benedicts . The failure of charm-school education , designed to develop the " whole man " and leave his mind alone , has become so notorious that even business men , according to a recent poll in Fortune , have lost their faith in college graduates as prospective successes . By 1936 St. John 's had reached the bottom of its bag of tricks and was ready to close its doors , when one of its trustees heard about the great books . In its modern form the great books idea was John Erskine 's , who taught them to a selected group of Columbia students from 1920 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Amherst boy in the great days of Meiklejohn , had been at Oxford together as Rhodes scholars and eventually teamed up again at the University of Virginia . There they reworked and expanded Erskine 's list and later Hutchins invited them to Chicago . They went on tinkering with the list , adding the classics of science , from Euclid to the present , to those of philosophy , history , politics , economics , and belles lettres . The present list numbers something like one hundred and twenty ; it is changing all the time , mostlyat the modern end . Joyce , for instance , has been added to the books that the present sophomore class at St. John 's will study in their senior year , and Mob ) Dick and Mark Twain seem to be about to make the grade . Early in 1937 Barr and Buchanan accepted the presidency and deanship of St. John 's and Hutchins took a place on the Board . The board was reorganized six months later , with Hutchins as chairman and Surgeon General Thomas Parran as vice-chairman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mystery . Neither of them wanted to be an administrator ; both wanted to teach . The likelihood is that they tossed a coin and Barr lost and took the job . The fact is that Hutchins and Barr on the one hand and the St. John 's trustees on the other were all skeptical ? Hutchins and Barr at taking over so sick a baby as St. John 's , the trustees at undertaking so " revolutionary " and " experimental " a program as the great books . The man who carried off both camps was Buchanan , the most excited and infectious book agent of modern times . How he did it and goes on doing it is another mystery . Superficially he 's a phlegmatic type , slouching round in old clothes , staring vacantly at the stars or at nothing at all , sitting in the center of a circle of students and scratching his head and grinning . But Barr insists that St. John 's is all Buchanan 's : " Scott repairs the plumbing , teaches the books , wipes the undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious mission while I 'm out grubbing for money for the next payroll . " Barr 's tribute to his team-mate is more than slightly exaggerated . Actually , the two men happen to be one of those happy combinations that are made , so to speak , in heaven . Barr is just as phrenetic as Buchanan is phlegmatic , just as precise as Buchanan is whimsical , just as striking as Buchanan is slouchy . The two of them are selfless , devoted to each other , and indifferent to worldly goods . Barr , though his heart was in the books , reluctantly accepted the role of front man , leaving Buchanan free to handle the curriculum . As an historian , editor of the Virginia Quarterly Review , and orator of no ordinary parts , " Winkie " Barr has always been closer to the public than his philosopher associate , and the division of labor turned out to be a good one . By the time the Great Books Twins set out for Annapolis in the fall of 1937 they knew what they wanted to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for " practical " men . Barr and Buchanan have been practical men ever since , though they both teach evening seminars to faculty and students . Finances ? their budget is $210,000 and their income is $140,000 ? are still far from rosy , for donors are not as adventurous as educators . " The first year , " says Barr , " I lost twenty pounds ? two pounds before each payday . I 've got the twenty pounds back . The difference now is that the faculty is with us . If we ran out of money to-morrow ? and we might , we might ? every man on the staff would go right on teaching . " I H The real miracle of St. John 's is not the books or the students , but the teachers . When the faculty ? an ordinary collection of specialists ? were invited to go to school again , they learned that they would have to familiarize themselves with every field of knowledge , a few of them quit , a few more could n't stand the gaff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few bright young men from Columbia , Virginia , and Chicago , the St. John 's staff that is teaching a liberal arts curriculum is the same that was frozen in departmental ruts three years ago . Many of the critics of the St. John 's program argue that , even if the curriculum is good , the teachers are not prepared , or not competent , to teach it . But Barr and Buchanan have demonstrated that ordinary teachers can be taught to teach a good curriculum to ordinary boys . And the reason is that the St. John 's idea of a teacher is not Mark Hopkins on one end of a log but Socrates in the middle of a question . The teacher is merely an instrument , a mediator which the student uses . The student is the active party ; he is a learner . The educability is within the student , the education in books and laboratories ; and the teacher 's job is to bring them together . One reason why college graduates look back on education as a grind is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas ? is as stale as a stone after the first few years of doing his stuff . His stuff is n't good enough to galvanize the teacher himself or his students . To-day at St. John 's the teachers are excited . They are meeting old and eternally exciting ideas , and since they are meeting them for the first time those ideas are not only exciting but novel . To the degree that the teachers are stimulated , they stimulate their charges . Shakespeare is no longer memorized or covered a scene at a time ; the world and wonder of Shakespeare are lived by men and boys to whom they have suddenly become as real as the current newspaper , and infinitely more readable . Books are read not once , but twice or three times , until their prose and poetry are drained , their arguments dissected , their themes and their situations lifted out of cold print into the life that modern people live and the problems they confront . The St. John 's books are no more in number than the textbooks that the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters , or books about books about masters , the St. Johnnies , students and faculty alike , sit at the feet of the masters themselves . And why not ? These books are the original masterpieces of the human tradition ; why should n't we prefer them to imitations , just as we prefer a Rembrandt to a copy of a Rembrandt , a live singer to a phonograph recording , a story told first-hand , new goods to used ? The timelessness of great art , great architecture , great music we recognize ; we can enjoy them casually . But the beauty of human thinking has to be sought , the wisdom extracted . In Flexner 's phrase , you have to tear the heart out of a book . At St. John 's they arc learning their mathematics from the great mathematicians ? Euclid , Apollonius , Descartes , Newton , Russell ; their science from the original giants of science ? Galen , Ptolemy , Copernicus , Galileo , Harvey , Kepler , Boyle , Dalton , Faraday , Darwin , Mendel , Maxwell , Pasteur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2Eschylus , Aristophanes , Virgil , Dante , Chaucer , Shakespeare , Milton , Cervantes , Balzac , Swift , Goethe , Moliere , Tolstoi , Ibsen , Lewis Carroll ; their philosophy from Plato , Aristotle , the Bible , Augustine , Aquinas , Bacon , Hobbes , Locke , Spinoza , Voltaire , Hum ; Rousseau , Kant , Hegel , Schupenhauer ; their history and social sciences from Herodotus , Thucydides , Plutarch , Justinian , Machiavelli , Grotius , Montesquieu , Adam Smith , Bentham , Gibbon , Hamilton , Jefferson , Madison , Marx . These men ? and their peers ? are the real faculty of St. John 's College , the greatest college faculty ever assembled anywhere in the history of the world . Not only are they the best teachers ; they work for nothing . All of them except Joyce , Freud , Russell , and a few others are mistakenly regarded as dead by most educational institutions , and so they are not invited to join the faculties of other colleges , and the studcnts never meet them . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds , the American college boy is expected to have his intellect strengthened by teachers whose intellects are no greater ( and , not so rarely , smaller ) than his own . His only contact with great minds outside of Shakespeare and one or two others is through the medium of textbooks written by ordinary ( and , not so rarely , inferior ) pedagogues . " Are n't yousorry " ? Mr. Barr asks his interviewer ? " for the students in all the other colleges who have nobody to teach them but oafs like me ? " You can get the great books list ? the fact that they have had thousands of requests for it indicates that something is up in America ? from St. John 's . Most of us are civilized enough to recognize most of the authors by name at least . How many of them have we read ? We have read O'Neill , who is n't on the list , but O'Neill would be the first to say that he is no match for Sophocles . We have read Anthony Adverse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have read Edna St. Vincent Millay , but not Dante , Hemingway but not Dostoevsky , Ogden Nash but not ( since childhood ) Lewis Carroll , Will Durant but not Plato , How to Win Friends and Influence People but not Aristotle 's Rhetoric , Bertrand Russell 's Marriage and Morals but not his Principles of Mathematics or Freud 's Theory of Sex , and we have seen Gilbert and Sullivan but not Aristophanes , Abie 's Irish Rose but not Mohere 's Bourgeois Gentilhomme . Homer 's description of the encampment before Troy in Book VIII of the Iliad makes a " ham " out of the modern war correspondent , and the orations of Pericles and Cicero grow greater compared with the greatest utterances in the United States Senate . " The Greeks , " said someone , " could not broadcast the trilogy of lEsehylus , but they could write it . " A college faculty every one of whose members teaches from the first year through the fourth , a faculty who start with Homer and teach Jefferson and Freud before they teach Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the rut and avoiding the stoopshouldered banality that characterizes the teacher five or ten years in harness . In addition , the St. John 's faculty has another reason for living and growing : it has undertaken to revise , improve , and embellish the present list of classics . St. John 's does not claim to have chosen all the best books ? though no educated man would quarrel with most of the selections . What it is trying to do is to find out which are the most readable and teachable books of all time and present its findings to American education . Of course these are not all the books that a person ought to read . Of course the intelligent citizen should read the best of the current books and magazines and the news and views of the day . The point is that these arc not enough ; by themselves they may startle and bewilder , but they lack significance . What good does it do our elders to-day to have memorized the boundaries of AustriaHungary instead of studying the nature of justice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply by telling him how many people are starving ? The students , says Alexander Meiklejohn , do not need more information to begin with ; " the essential difficulty , " he adds , " is that they do not think about the information which they already have . " The great books , say Barr and Buchanan , are simply those that can most effectively induce thinking . Each of them should create in the reader a neversated hunger for knowledge . Each of them should be the jumping-off place to a dozen or a hundred books that the citizen ought to read outside of school and college and until the end of life . These educators look upon college not as the end of good reading , but the beginning . Great books do not inform the student of the bargains at the stores ; they do not contain this week 's map of Greater Germany . But they argue ? and they teach the student to argue back ? the enduring principles and problems that underlie the actions of men and nations . Some educators mistrust books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " experience " or " observation " or " living . " But , say the Great Books Boys , what else are the classics but the collective experience , observation , and living of the human race ? If individual experiencewere the greatest teacher , war veterans would all hate war . If individual experience teaches , how can the average college boy learn anything about tyranny , love , infidelity , betrayal , sacrifice , or perseverance in the face of dishonor or death ? Must he wait until Hitler is here before he learns to recognize a Hitler when he sees one ? Human experience ? not the experience of the individual , but the experience of the race ? is full of Hiders . We want to be able to recognize the arrows of outrageous fortune before they are lodged in our back . Some of the books they read at St. John 's arc very old . Some were old when Chief Justice Marshall said ( Ogden v. Saunders , 1 B27 ) , " When we advert to the course of reading generally pursued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framers of our Constitution were intimately acquainted with the writings of those wise and learned men , whose treatises on the laws of nature and nations have guided public opinion . " Some of these books were old when Tom Paine read them , when Voltaire and Milton and Spinoza read them , when Newton and Galileo read them . But they are new because they deal , every one of them , with Twentieth-Century human nature ; and Freud and Russell and Joyce , though they write in the Twentieth Century , deal with the same human nature , the nature of the Greeks , the Middle Ages , the Renaissance , and modern America . The D.A.R . may be worried when it learns that the St. John 's books include only four American works . But Barr and Buchanan point out that the one hundred and fifty years of the United States is a continuation of the three thousand years of Europe . " The world , " says " Winkie " Barr , " did not begin last Tuesday . " The American classics are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Psychology , and Veblen 's and Young 's Projective Geometry . Has any patriot any additions to offer ? They will be courteously received and rigorously tested by the five rules formulated by St. John 's for admission to the hall of intellectual fame . Here they are ? try them on your latest best-seller : 1 . A great book is one that has been by the greatest number of persons read ? not from week to week , but from year to year and from age to age . 2 . A great book has the largest number of possible interpretations ? not ambiguities but significances ? each interpretation possessing a clarity and force that will allow other interpretations to stand by its side without confusion . 3 . A great book raises questions about the great themes in human thought ? questions , for instance , concerning number and measurement , matter and form , ultimate substance , tragedy , and God , questions on whose constant cultivation hang the issues of orthodoxy , heresy , and freedom which are always with us. 4 . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have an immediate intelligibility and style which will excite and discipline the ordinary mind by its form alone . 5 . A great book must be a masterpiece of the liberal arts , a work whose author was or is a master of thought and imagination , whose writing has been faithful to the ends of these arts . Those are the entrance requirements , and when books so written are read chronologically they illuminate one another and simplify one another 's understanding . Newton takes on new meaning from Euclid , Freud from Sophocles , Kant from Plato , Marx from Hegel , the American Constitution from Locke . The best commentary on a great book , Barr and Buchanan hold , is another great book . Current textbooks in special subject matters are the best examples of books that are detached from the intellectual tradition of the race and are doomed , therefore , to early death . IV Scientists are sometimes contemptuous of books , but St. John 's is the only liberalarts college in America that is genuinely respectful of science . Four years of laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books alone shall a St. Johnnie be saved , " says President Barr . And he points to the college motto , with its succession of Latin puns ? " Facia Liberos ex Liberis Libris Libraque , " which means , in literal and awkward English , " I Make Free Men out of Children by Means of Books and Balances . " " Balances " ? laboratory work ? occupy every St. Johnnie three hours a week , thirty-six weeks a year . Ernest L. Midgette , a rising star in engineering , abandoned his post at Johns Hopkins last year to teach St. Johnnies how their world was made ? and how to make parts of it themselves . St. John 's recognizes that principles can be understood in other media than words , that men understand through their hands as well as their heads . Mr. Midgette ? his title is merely that of tutor , the professors being Euclid , Galileo , et al ? shudders every time he considers that the man who drives an automobile has the power of from ninety to one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there or what it means . " Is it any wonder , " he asks himself and you , " that some of our scientific marvels are as much a curse as a boon ? " In the laboratory ? on its outside a lovely red brick , white-colonnaded building like the rest of St. John 's , on its inside a cavernous old place with a striking absence of mystifying machinery ? the St. Johnnie freshman , or " rat , " begins by constructing a straight edge and a ruler with a piece of string and a stick of chalk . Then he goes on to the manufacture of scales and thermometers , to the reproductions of Archimedes ' work on gravity , hydrostatics , and the lever . The freshmen stick to mathematics and measurement , carrying out their book study in the solids of Euclid , the conics of Apollonius . Geometry is the tool of all the sciences , and the St. Johnnie who came to college glorying in the possession of an new-programmers , who do n't seem to have much time for fun but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the Ban-Buchanan administration the entering freshmen were allowed to choose between the old program and the new . Two-thirds took the old . But something funny happened : six upper classmen , one of them a senior and all of them student leaders , sacrificed from one to three years of standing and began over again in the new program . Last year ( and from now on ) the new program was the only one offered the entering freshmen . The subdued civil war ? it sometimes breaks out in the blowing of the lights or minor vandalism ? does not make life any easier for Dean Buchanan , nor , incidentally , for the faculty teaching in both programs and going to school itself . But two years on the barricades have hardened the administration and the teachers to toil and turmoil . With the graduation of the Class of ' 41 ( the present sophomores , who are split between the old and new programs ) St. John 's will get under way full-steam as the kind of college it wants to be . The new-program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do and they say they do ? and that after two years of an education designed to make them act and talk for themselves . Barr and Buchanan are amazed that they like it as well as they do , for St. John 's is run on the basis that an educator is a physician , and patients do n't always like the doctor , even if he cures them . Intercollegiate athletics -- consuming $17,000 out of a $210,000 budget ? is being thrown out next fall , and the intramural program is being extended to afford participation to every boy in five sports , at least two of which he will be able to play through life . There were squawks at this from new-programmers , old-programmers , and alumni , but they could not meet the Barr-Buchanan argument that a bad football team was bringing St. John 's neither money nor students nor glory . The five campus fraternities , which for years have enjoyed college-owned houses at a nominal rent , were given a chance to enforce social discipline , and when they failed they were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's is an educational institution , not a picnic ground . Hard work ? Yes , it is hard work , but it is n't dull . The backs of the classroom benches are completely carved up with initials , class numerals , and fraternity letters ? mutely recalling the days when college was so dull and empty that the boys turned to whittling while their parents paid tuition for their education . There 's no more whittling going on , and it is n't because there 's a rule against it but because you 've got to read and write and listen and think ? or you 'll bust out of school and the old man will make you go to work . In 1937 Dean Buchanan dropped 26 boys ? despite the desperate need of tuition money ? and put 51 more ? approximately one-third the student body ? on probation , with the remainder of the year to get off or get out . They got off . Hard work ? Of course it is . And why not ? How old should a boy be before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen or eighteen years old , spend his time at football games , dances , and beer sessions , while a graduate student , a year or two older , spends his time at his studies ? Hard work has stunted the growth of children , but it was n't hard work with the mind . Chinning oneself is hard work , but boys do it anyway ; at St. John 's they 're chinning the head along with the body . The St. Johnnie spends no more time in class than the average student , and not much more time at his books . But the time he spends is spent working hard . If he works , he has time for shows and dances and campus activities . V John Dewey , the leading opponent of the Hutchins-Barr-Buchanan curriculum , admits that the great books and the liberal arts are the best education for those who are able to master it ? an education , he admits further , for which the reformers have found no substitute . It may be too early to say that ordinary ? very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they have . But they are lapping it up and liking it , and they and their teachers are satisfied that it is not too hard for boys who are willing to exert themselves for an education . We Americans are victims of the pernicious notion that good books arc beyond the comprehension of the average mind . But millions of average minds have comprehended them in ages past , boys of fourteen and men of eighty . In one important sense they are easier than the books most of us read , because they are more intelligibly written . They are harder only in the sense that they are more meaningful , more compact ; instead of demanding of the reader that he have two ? or no ? ideas per one hundred pages , they compel him to think about something at every page , or at every paragraph . The reader who opens Plato the way he opens E. Phillips Oppenheim is likely to find that Plato does n't make sense . Barr and Buchanan hold that the best education is best for any boy or girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John 's program is " aristocratic " ? a charge arising from the fact that it was popular in the days when only the children of the rich went to college ? St. John 's replies that this is indeed an aristocratic education , but for an aristocracy of brains and character , an aristocracy that anyone can join regardless of wealth or caste . In Plato 's ideal state kings were going to be philosophers and philosophers were going to be kings . The world is not suffering just now from overproduction of idealism , and Barr and Buchanan are not ashamed of being idealists . Whether an education that trains boys to think for themselves and transmits to them the wisdom of the race is useful depends on what we mean by useful . In so far as it teaches them to read , write , and reason it is not likely to keep them out of a job . But it is not designed to get them a job . Education so designed , says Barr , is not education but training . " The St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with preparing men for the business of living ? concerned that they meet not only their bills , but other and subtler obligations which free men must meet . " Every animal can be trained for a job ; man alone can be educated in the use of reason and free will . Are these powers worth cultivating ? Not if we live to eat , not if man shall live by bread alone . But if he has higher hopes than these , if , unlike his closest anthropoid cousins , he is not satisfied with an infinity of bananas and female companionship , then he will cultivate the values that are truly and uniquely human . Reason and free will do not operate mechanically to make man better ; if he uses them for evil , if he chooses vicious ends or lets his animal instincts distract him from the worthy ends he has chosen , then , through the exercise of his superior powers , he may be more effectively savage than the most savage brute . The tortures to which men , women , and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used by the beasts . The men who have restored the liberal arts to a small segment of American education are interested in producing liberal men . And by liberal men they mean men who are sufficiently liberated from animality to use their will and intelligence . They do not want to indoctrinate boys with the kind of sentimental " liberalism " that falls away under the pressures of life , They do not want to produce " liberals " who hate bad men , but liberals who understand what makes men bad , how to protect themselves against them , and how to avoid becoming bad men themselves . " The day 's news suggests that the liberal democracies are paralyzed , " says Stringfellow Barr . " If they are , it is because we Twentieth-Century liberals have missed the point of our own faith . We have slithered into the belief that liberty meant being left alone , and nothing else . We have come to assume that liberalism is the absence of authority , because we can no longer distinguish between authority and tyranny . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason falls under the tyranny of caprice . We have forgotten that he who will not answer to the rudder must answer to the rock . We have allowed totalitarian dictators to take out a copyright on wards like ' authority ' and ' discipline , ' although their tyranny is a caricature of authority and their terrorism is a caricature of discipline . " American liberalism has erred , Barr suspects , through having asked too little . We have asked for what animals and small children want , but not what free men and women require . We have shouted for freedom of speech , a free press , and free assembly , while one by one these freedoms have disappeared in one modern state after another . We have asked ourselves fearfully whether we too would lose those freedoms . But we have not demanded , as our ancestors did , both for themselves and their children , a mind freed from ignorance , an awakened imagination , and a disciplined reason , without which we can not effectually use our other freedoms or even preserve them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them proclaim their faith in human liberty , and the most illiberal of them proclaim It the loudest . What kind of education did they have ? Though few of them were ever likely to starve , they insisted on being educated for a job . Most jobs require little or no knowledge of the books that deal with the great problems of men and nations , and most college degrees require no more , Is it possible that so few of these five million are " men of principle " because they failed to find out what principles were in the course of their education ? There is no magic in books ; no guarantee goes with them . Men have read them and still turned out bad . But we want our children to learn how to think ; the men who wrote these books thought well . We want our children to think about important things ; the men who wrote immortally did that . Books are only teachers , and , as such , are only means to an end . The end is men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty or one hundred years , St. John 's College hopes to have contributed liberally educated men to their support . Mr. Walter Lippmann , who is not given to hysteria , ventures that men will some day say that St. fohn 's was the seedbed of the American Renaissance . If the higher learning in America has failed to produce high and learned men , it is sometimes hard to see how those same men will ever reform American education . But we know that even in bad systems , as in bad states , good men arise to provide leadership . The elder Holmes once said in the early days of this country that the United States , by its very existence , threatened every government in Europe . So St. John 's College , insignificant as it is in buildings , endowment , and prestige , by its very existence threatens every college and university in America .
