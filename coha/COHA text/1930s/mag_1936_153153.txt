Blue-eyed , sailor-suited Kelvin Arthur Rodgers , Australian 3-year-old , left a freighter at a New York dock last week for the last lap of a 9,000-mile voyage of life &; death . Frisky , unconcerned , he carried in his right lung a 3-in. packing nail which he had gulped down 18 months ago . Unless it came out , Australian doctors agreed , Baby Rodgers ' days were numbered . Twice they attempted to remove the nail without a Chevalier Jackson bronchoscope . Both attempts failing , they wrote to Dr. Jackson . He told them to send the child to Philadelphia , that the nail would be removed gratis . Soon Kelvin Arthur Rodgers and his pleasant young mother , wife of a $20-a-week mechanic , were on their way ( TIME , June 1 ) . <P> The American Pioneer Line provided free passage for child and mother . Philanthropist Sir Charles Conibere of Melbourne put up the cash for incidental expenses on the 106-day round trip . Schoolchildren chipped in . The U. S. waived immigration restrictions . Surrounded by reporters , Baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okey-dokey , " was whisked off by the Y. W. C. A. to Philadelphia where , in the strict privacy of Dr. Jackson 's operating room , the nail was withdrawn from his lung in seven minutes .
