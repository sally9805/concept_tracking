txt Will Rogers Offers a Word Of Advice to His Uncle Sam To the Editor of The Nato York nines : SANTA MONICA , Cal. , May 1 . ? Well , about all you can see in the papers is Honolulu . The whole thing just proves that the islands have n't got any use for the navy and the mainland . Course I guess I am all wet , but I never have seen any reason why us , or any other nation , should hold under subjection of any kind any islands or country outside of our own . We say we have to have it to protect the Pacific . Why do n't we have to have the Azores to protect the Atlantic ? We are going to get into a war some day either over Honolulu or the Philippines . Let 's all come home and let every nation ride its own surfboard , play its own eukaleles and commit their devilment on their own race . Yours for remaining on the home grounds , WILL ROGERS .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
