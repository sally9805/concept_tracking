One More River " I 'm not , " said Clare . " You ought to be . I 'll let Foch out for his run , and we 'll all go up . " The General rose . " Enough 's as good as a feast . I suppose we 'd better . " Dinny opened the French window and watched the dog Foch trotting out in semblance of enthusiasm . It was cold , with a ground mist , and she shut the window . If she did n't he would neglect his ritual and with more than the semblance of enthusiasm trot in again . Having kissed her father and Clare , she turned out the lights and waited in the hall . The wood fire had almost died . She stood with her foot on the stone hearth , thinking . Clare had spoken of trying to get a secretaryship to some new Member of Parliament . Judging by the returns that were coming in , there would be plenty of them . Why not to their own new Member ? He had dined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A nice man , well read , not bigoted . He even sympathised with Labour , but did not think they knew their way about as yet . In fact he was rather notably what the drunken youth in the play called : a Tory Socialist . ' He had opened out to her and been very frank and pleasant . An attractive man , with his crisp dark hair , brown complexion , little dark moustacheand rather high soft voice ; a good sort , energetic and upright-looking . But probably he already had a secretary . However , if Clare was in earnest , one could ask . She crossed the hall to the garden door . There was a seat in the porch outside , and under it Foch would be crouched , waiting to be let in . Sure enough , he emerged , fluttering his tail , and padded towards the dogs ' communalwater-bowl . How cold and silent ! Nothing onOne More River 41the road ; even the owls quiet ; the garden and the fields frozen , moonlit , still , away up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her fate , disbelieving in the Voice o'er Eden ; old and permanent and beautiful , even though the pound had gone off gold . Dinny gazed at the unfeverish night . Men and their policies  --  how little they mattered , how soon they passed , a dissolvingdew on the crystal immensity of God 's toy ! How queer  --  the passionate intensity of one 's heart , and the incalculablecold callousness of Time and Space ! To join , to reconcile ? . . . She shivered and shut the door . At breakfast the next morning she said to Clare : " Shall we strike while the iron 's hot , and go and see Mr. Dornford ? " " Why ? " " In case he wants a secretary , now he 's in . " " Oh ! Is he in ? " " Very much so . " Dinny read the figures . The usual rather formidable Liberal opposition had been replaced by a mere five thousand Labour votes . " The word national ' is winning this election , " said Clare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Liberals . I just used the word national , ' and they fell . " Hearing that the new Member would be at his headquartersall the morning , the sisters started about eleven o'clock . There was so much coming and going round the doors that they did not like to enter . " I do hate asking for things , " said Clare . Dinny , who hated it quite as much , answered : " Wait here and I 'll just go in and congratulate him. 42 One More RiverI might have a chance of putting in a word . He 's seen you , of course . " " Oh ! yes , he 's seen me all right . " Eustace Dornford , K.C. , new Member elect , was sitting in a room that seemed all open doors , running his eye over the lists his agent was putting on the table before him . From one of those doors Dinny could see his ridingboots under the table , and his bowler hat , gloves and riding whip upon it . Now that she was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and she was just slipping away when he looked up . " Excuse me a moment , Minns . Miss Cherrell ! " She stopped and turned . He was smiling and looking pleased . " Anything I can do for you ? " She put out her hand . " I 'm awfully glad you 've won . My sister and I just wanted to congratulate you . " He squeezed her hand , and Dinny thought : Oh ! dear ! this is the last moment to ask him , ' but she said : " It 's perfectly splendid , there 's never been such a majority here . " " And never will be again . That 's my luck . Where 's your sister ? " " In the car . " " I 'd like to thank her for canvassing . " " Oh ! " said Dinny , " she enjoyed it " ; and suddenly feeling that it was now or never , added : " She 's at a loose end , you know , badly wants something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is too bad  --  but I supposes he would n't be of any use to you as a secretary , would she ? There , it 's out ! She does know the countyOne More River 43pretty well ; she can type , and speak French , and German a little , if that 's any use . " It had come with a rush , and she stood looking at him ruefully . But his eager expression had not changed . " Let 's go and see her , " he said . Dinny thought : Gracious ! I hope he has n't fallen in love with her ! ' and she glanced at him sidelong . Still smiling , his face looked shrewd now . Clare was standing beside the car . I wish , ' thought Dinny , I had her coolness . ' Then she stood still and watched . All this triumphalbusiness , these people coming and going , those two talking so readily and quickly ; the clear and sparklingmorning ! He came back to her . " Thank you most awfully , Miss Cherrell . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your sister is very modest . " " I thought you 'd never forgive me for asking at such a moment . " " Always delighted for you to ask anything at any moment . I must go back now , but I 'll hope to see you again very soon . " Gazing after him as he re-entered the building , she thought : He has very nicely cut riding breeches ! ' And she got into the car . " Dinny , " said Clare , with a laugh , " he 's in love with you . " " What ! " " I asked for two hundred , and he made it two hundred and fifty at once . How did you do it in one eve-ning ? " " I did n't . It 's you he 's in love with , I 'm afraid . " " No , no , my dear . I have eyes , and I know it 's you ; 44 One More Riverjust as you knew that Tony Croom was in love with me . " " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dinny said quietly : " That 's absurd . When do you begin ? " " He 's going back to Town to-day . He lives in the Temple  --  Harcourt Buildings . I shall go up this afternoon , and start in the day after to-morrow . " " Where shall you live ? " " I think I shall take an unfurnished room or a smallstudio , and decorate and furnish it gradually myself . It 'll be fun . " " Aunt Em is going back this afternoon . She would put you up till you find it . " " Well , " said Clare , pondering , " perhaps . " Just before they reached home Dinny said : " What about Ceylon , Clare ? Have you thought any more ? " " What 's the good of thinking ? I suppose he 'll dosomething , but I do n't know what , and I do n't care . " " Have n't you had a letter ? " " No . " " Well , darling , be careful . " Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Could he get leave if he wanted ? " " I expect so . " " You 'll keep in touch with me , wo n't you ? " Clare leaned sideways from the wheel and gave her cheek a kiss . CHAPTER VITHREE days after their meeting at The Coffee House , young Croom received a letter from Sir Lawrence Mont , saying that his cousin Muskham was not expecting the Arab mares till the spring . In the meantime he would make a note of Mr. Croom and a point of seeing him soon . Did Mr. Croom know any vernacular Arabic ? No , ' thought young Croom , but I know Stapylton . ' Stapylton , of the Lancers , who had been his senior at Wellington , was home from India on leave . A noted polo player , he would be sure to know the horse jargon of the East ; but , having broken his thigh-bone schooling a steeple-chaser , he would keep ; the business of finding an immediate job of work ' would not . Young Croom continued his researches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' On the morning after the election , therefore , he issued from Ryder Street with the greater expectation , and , on the evening after , returned to the Coffee House with the less , thinking : I might just as well have gone to Newmarketand seen the Cambridgeshire . ' The porter handed him a note , and his heart began to thump . Seeking a corner , he read : " DEAR TONY , " I have got the job of secretary to our new Member , Eustace Dornford , who 's a K.C. , in the Temple . So I 've come up to Town . Till I find a tent of my own , I shall be at my Aunt Lady Mont 's in Mount Street . I hope4546 One More Riveryou 've been as lucky . I promised to let you know when I came up ; but , I adjure you to sense and not sensibility , and to due regard for pride and prejudice . Your shipmate and well-wisher , CLARE CORVEN . " The darling ! ' he thought : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it beneath the cigarette case in his lefthandwaistcoat pocket , and went into the smoking room . There , on a sheet of paper stamped with the Club 's immemorialdesign , he poured out an ingenuous heart : " DARLING CLARE , " Your note has perked me up no end . That you will be in Town is magnificent news . Your uncle has been very kind to me and I shall simply have to call and thank him . So do look out for me about six o'clock to-morrow . I spend all my time hunting a job , and am beginning to realise what it means to poor devils to be turned down day after day . When my pouch is empty , and that 's not far away , it 'll be even worse for me . No dole for this child , unfortunately . I hope the pundit you 're going to take in hand is a decent sort . I always think of M. P.s as a bit on the wooden side . And somehow I ca n't see you among Bills and petitions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 're splendid to want to be independent . What a thumping majority ! If they ca n't do things with that behind them , they ca n't do things at all . It 's quite impossible for me not to be in love with you , you know , and to long to be with you all day and all night , too . But I 'm going to be as good as I can , because the very last thing I want is to cause youOne More River 47uneasiness of any sort . I think of you all the time , even when I 'm searching the marble countenance of some fish-faced blighter to see if my piteous tale is weakening his judgment . The fact is I love you terribly . To-morrow , Thursday , about six ! " Good-night , dear and lovely one , YOUR TONY . " Having looked up Sir Lawrence 's number in Mount Street , he addressed the note , licked the envelope with passion , and went out to post it himself . Then , suddenly , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place had a grudge against his state of mind . Clubs were so damned male , and their whole attitude to womenso after-dinnerish  --  half contempt , half lechery ! Funk-holes they were , anyway , full of comfort , secured against women , immune from writs ; and men all had the same armchair look once they got inside . The CoffeeHouse , too , about the oldest of all clubs , was stuffed with regular buffers , men you could n't imagine outside a club . No ! ' he thought ; I 'll have a chop somewhere , and go to that thing at Drury Lane . ' He got a seat rather far back in the upper boxes , but his sight being very good , he saw quite well . He was soon absorbed . He had been out of England long enough to have some sentiment about her . This pictorial pageant of her history for the last thirty years moved him more than he would have confessed to any one sitting beside him . Boer War , death of the Queen , sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , health to 1931  --  if any one asked him afterwards , he would probably say : Marvellous ! but gave me the " pip " rather ! ' While sit-48 One More Riverting there it seemed more than the ' ; the heartache of a lover , who wants happiness with his mistress and cannote ach it , the feeling of one who tries to stand upright and firm and is forever being swayed this way and that . The last words rang in his ears as he went out : Greatness and dignity and peace . ' Moving and damned ironical ! He took a cigarette from his case and lighted it . The night was dry and he walked , threading his way through the streams of traffic , with the melancholy howling of street-singers in his ears . Skysigns and garbage ! People rolling home in their cars , and homeless night-birds ! Greatness , and dignity , and peace ! ' I must absolutely have a drink , ' he thought . The Club seemed possible again now , even inviting , and he made towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Marvellous that scene , where those Tommies marched up in a spiral through the dark mist , whistling ; while in the lighted front of the stage three painted girls rattled out : " We do n't want to lose you , but we think you ought to go . " ' And from the boxes on the stage at the sides people looked down and clapped ! The whole thing there ! The gaiety on those girls ' painted faces getting more and more put-on and heartbreaking ! He must go again with Clare ! Would it move her ? And , suddenly , he perceived that he did n't know . What did one know about any one , even the woman one loved ? His cigarette was scorching his lip and he spat out the butt . That scene with the honeymooningcouple leaning over the side of the " Titanic , " everything before them , and nothing before them but the cold deep sea . Did that couple know anything except that they desired each other ? Life was damned queer , One More River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coffee House steps , feeling as if he had lived long since he went down them . . . . It was just six o'clock when he rang the bell at Mount Street on the following day . A butler , with slightly raised eyebrows , opened the door . " Is Sir Lawrence Mont at home ? " " No , Sir . Lady Mont is in , Sir . " " I 'm afraid I do n't know Lady Mont . I wonder if I could see Lady Corven for a moment ? " One of the butler 's eyebrows rose still higher . Ah ! ' he seemed to be thinking . " If you 'll give me your name , Sir . " Young Croom produced a card . " Mr. James Bernard Croom , ' " chanted the butler . " Mr. Tony Croom , tell her , please . " " Quite ! If you 'll wait in here a moment . Oh ! here is Lady Corven . " A voice from the stairs said : " Tony ? What punctuality ! Come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stair-rail , and the butler had disappeared . " Put your hat down . How can you go about without a coat ? I shiver all the time . " Young Croom came close below her . " Darling ! " he murmured . She placed one finger to her lips , then stretched itdown to him , so that he could just reach it with his own . " Come along ! " She had opened a door when he50 One More Riverreached the top , and was saying : " This is a shipmate , Aunt Em . He 's come to see Uncle Lawrence . Mr. Croom , my aunt , Lady Mont . " Young Croom was aware of a presence slightly swayingtowards him . A voice said : " Ah ! Ships ! Of course ! How d' you do ? " Young Croom , aware that he had been placed , ' saw Clare regarding him with a slightly mocking smile . If only they could be alone five minutes , he would kiss that smile off her face ! He would ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croom , Auntie . Tony Croom . Better call him Tony . It is n't his name , but everybody does . " " Tony ! Always heroes . I do n't know why . " " This Tony is quite ordinary .

' The river here used to be full of punts , I remember . " " It still is , Aunt Em . " Young Croom had a sudden vision of Clare and himself in a punt up a quiet backwater . He roused himself and said : " I went to Cavalcade ' last night . Great ! " " Ah ! " said Lady Mont : " That reminds me . " She left the room . Young Croom sprang up . " Tony ! Behave ! " " But surely that 's what she went for ! " " Aunt Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse her kindness . " One More River 51 " But , Clare , you do n't know what " " Yes , I do . Sit down again . " Young Croom obeyed . " Now listen , Tony ! I 've had enough physiology to last me a long time . If you and I are going to be pals , it 's got to be platonic . " " Oh , God ! " said young Croom . " But it 's got to ; or else  --  we simply are n't going to see each other . " Young Croom sat very still with his eyes fixed on hers , and there passed through her the thought : It 's going to torture him . He looks too nice for that . I do n't believe we ought to see each other . ' " Look ! " she said , gently , " you want to help me , do n't you ? There 's lots of time , you know . Some day  --  per-haps .

" Clare sat examining the glace toe of her slowly wigglingshoe ; suddenly she looked straight into his broodingeyes . " If , " she said , " I had not been married , you would wait cheerfully and it would n't hurt you . Think of me like that . " " Unfortunately I ca n't . Who could ? " " I see . I am fruit , not blossom  --  tainted by physi-ology . " " Do n't ! Oh ! Clare , I will be anything you want to you . And if I 'm not always as cheery as a bird , forgive me. " 52 One More RiverShe looked at him through her eyelashes and said : " Good ! " Then came silence , during which she was conscious that he was fixing her in his mind from her shingled dark head to her glace kid toe . She had not lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail of her body . She could not help its grace or its provocation . She did not want to torture him , but she could not find it unpleasant that she did . Queer how one could be sorry and yet pleased , and withal , sceptical and a little bitter . Give yourself , and after a few months how much would he want you ! She said abruptly : " Well , I 've found rooms  --  a quaint little hole  --  used to be an antique shop , in a disused mews . " He said eagerly : " Sounds jolly . When are you going in ? " " Next week . " " Can I help ? " " If you can distemper walls . " " Rather ! I did all my bungalow in Ceylon , two or three times over . " " We should have to work in the evenings , because of my job . " " What about your boss ? Is he decent ? " " Very , and in love with my sister . At least , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croom , dubiously . Clare smiled . He was so obviously thinking : Could a man be that when he sees you every day ? ' " When can I come first ? " " To-morrow evening , if you like .

Life is real , life is earnest . ' " Grinning ruefully , he put his hand on his heart . " And you must go now . I 'll take you down and see if my uncle 's come in . " Young Croom stood up . " What is happening about Ceylon ? " he said , abruptly : " Are you being worried ? " Clare shrugged . " Nothing is happening so far . " " That ca n't possibly last . Have you thought things out ?

" I do n't think I 'll try to see your uncle , " said young Croom . " To-morrow at half-past six , then . " He raised her hand to his lips , and marched to the door . There he turned . She was standing with her head a little on one side , smiling . He went out , distracted . A young man , suddenly awakened amid the doves of Cytherea , conscious for the first time of the mysterious magnetism which radiates from what the vulgar call a grass widow , ' and withheld from her by scruples or convention , is to be pitied . He has not sought his fate . It comes on him by stealth , bereaving him ruthlessly of all other interest in life . It is an obsession replacing normal tastes with a rapturous aching . Maxims such54 One More Riveras Thou shalt not commit adultery , ' Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , ' Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young Croom had been brought up to the tinkling of the school bell : Play the game ! ' He now perceived its strange inadequacy . What was the game ? Here was she , young and lovely , fleeing from a partner seventeen years older than herself , because he was a brute ; she had n't said so , but of course he must be ! Here was himself , desperately in love with her , and liked by her  --  not in the same way , but still as much as could be expected ! And nothing to come of it but tea together ! There was a kind of sacrilegein such waste . Thus preoccupied he passed a man of middle height and alert bearing , whose rather cat-like eyes and thin lips were set into a brown face with the claws of many little wrinkles , and who turned to look after him with a slight contraction of the mouth which might have been a smile . CHAPTER VIIAFTER young Croom had gone Clare stood for a moment in the hall recollecting the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fawn-coloured suit and a little brown hat , between rows of people saying : " Good luck ! " and " Good-bye , darling ! " and " Give my love to Paris ! " Eighteen months ago , and so much in between ! Her lip curled , and she went into her uncle 's study . " Oh ! Uncle Lawrence , you are in ! Tony Croom 's been here to see you . " " That rather pleasant young man without occupation ? " " Yes . He wanted to thank you . " " For nothing , I 'm afraid . " And Sir Lawrence 's quick dark eyes , like a snipe 's or woodcock 's , roved sceptically over his pretty niece . She was not , like Dinny , a special favourite , but she was undoubtedly attractive . It was early days to have messed up her marriage ; Em had told him and said that it was n't to be mentioned . Well , Jerry Corven ! People had always shrugged and hinted . Too bad ! But no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Sir Gerald Corven has called , Sir Lawrence . " Involuntarily Sir Lawrence put his finger to his lips . The butler subdued his voice still further . " I put him in the little room and said I would see if Lady Corven was in. " 5556 One More RiverSir Lawrence noted Clare 's hands hard pressed down on the back of the chair behind which she was standing . " A 're you in , Clare ? " She did not answer , but her face was hard and pale as stone . " A minute , Blore . Come back when I ring . " The butler withdrew . " Now , my dear ? " " He must have taken the next boat . Uncle , I do n't want to see him . " " If we only say you 're out , he 'll probably come again . " Clare threw back her head : " Well , I 'll see him . " Sir Lawrence felt a little thrill . " If you 'd tell me what to say , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle , but I do n't see why you should do my dirty work . " Sir Lawrence thought : Thank God ! ' " I 'll be handy in case you want me . Good luck , my dear ! " And he went out . Clare moved over to the fire ; she wanted the bell within reach . She had the feeling , well known to her , of settling herself in the saddle for a formidable jump . He sha n't touch me , anyway , ' she thought . She heard Blore 's voice say : " Sir Gerald Corven , my Lady . " Quaint ! Announcinga husband to his wife ! But staff knew everything ! Without looking she saw perfectly well where he was standing . A surge of shamed anger stained her cheeks . He had fascinated her ; he had used her as every kind of plaything . He had ! One More River 57His voice , cuttingly controlled , said : " Well , my dear , you were very sudden . " Neat and trim , as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those daring despoiling eyes ! " What do you want ? " " Only yourself . " " You ca n't have me . " " Absurd ! " He made the quickest kind of movement and seized her in his arms . Clare bent her head back and put her finger on the bell . " Move back , or I ring ! " and she put her other hand between his face and hers . " Stand over there and I 'll talk to you , otherwise you must go . " " Very well ! But it 's ridiculous . " " Oh ! Do you think I should have gone if I had n't been in earnest ? " " I thought you were just riled , and I do n't wonder . I 'm sorry . " " It 's no good discussing what happened . I know you , and I 'm not coming back to you . " " My dear , you have my apology , and I give you my word against anything of the sort again . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . Some women adore it , if not at the time . " " You are a beast . " " And beauty married me . Come , Clare , do n't be silly and make us a laughing stock ! You can fix your own conditions . " " And trust you to keep them ! Besides , that 's not my idea of a life . I 'm only twenty-four . " 58 One More RiverThe smile left his lips . " I see . I noticed a young man come out of this house . Name and estate ? " " Tony Croom . Well ? " He walked over to the window , and after a moment 's contemplation of the street , turned and said : " You have the misfortune to he my wife . " " So I was thinking . " " Quite seriously , Clare , come back to me . " " Quite seriously , no . " " I have an official position , and I ca n't play about with it . Look at me ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but I 'm neither a humbug , nor old-fashioned . I do n't trade on my position , or on the sanctity of marriage , or any of that stuff .

" " I know nothing except that I 'm not coming back . " " Just because of ? " " And a great deal else . " The cat-like smile had come back and prevented her from reading what he was thinking . " Do you want me to divorce you ? " Clare shrugged . " You have no reason . " " So you would naturally say . " " And mean . " " Now look here , Clare , this is all absurd , and quite unworthy of any one with your sense and knowledge of things . You ca n't be a perpetual grass widow . You did n't dislike the life out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that ca n't be done to me and you have done them . " " I 've said that they sha n't be done again . " " And I 've said that I ca n't trust you . " " This is going round the mulberry bush . Are you going to live on your people ? " " No . I 've got a job . " " Oh ! What ? " " Secretary to our new Member . " " You 'll be sick of that in no time . " " I do n't think so . " He stood staring at her without his smile . For a moment she could read his thoughts , for his face had the expression which preludes sex . Suddenly he said : " I wo n't stand for another man having you . " It was a comfort to have seen for once the bottom of his mind . She did not answer . " Did you hear me ? " " Yes . " " I meant it . " " I could see that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I had been . " He took a turn up and down the room , and came to a stand dead in front of her . " Look at me ! I 'm not going back without you . I 'm staying at the Bristol . Be sensible , there 's a darling , and come to me there . We 'll start again . I 'll be ever so nice to you . " Her control gave way , and she cried out : " Oh , for God 's sake , understand ! You killed all the feeling I had for you . " 6o One More RiverHis eyes dilated and then narrowed , his lips became a line . He looked like a horse-breaker . " And understand me , " he said , very low , " you either come back to me or I divorce you . I wo n't leave - ou here , to kick your heels . " " I 'm sure you 'll have the approval of every judicious husband . " The smile reappeared on his lips . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a kiss . " And before she could stop him he had fastened his lips on hers . She tore herself away and pressed the bell . He went quickly to the door. " flu revoir ! " he said , and went out . Clare wiped her lips . She felt bewildered and exhausted , and quite ignorant whether to him or to her the day had gone . She stood leaning her forehead on her hands over the fire , and became aware that Sir Lawrence had come back and was considerately saying nothing . " Awfully sorry , Uncle ; I shall he in my digs next week . " " Have a cigarette , my dear . " Clare took the cigarette , and inhaled its comfort . Her uncle had seated himself and she was conscious of the quizzical expression of his eyebrows . " Conference had its usual success ? " Clare nodded . " The elusive formula . The fact is , human beings are never satisfied with what they do n't want , however cleverly it 's put . Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as I 'm concerned . " " Pity there are always two parties to a conference . " One More River 61 " Uncle Lawrence , " she said suddenly , " what is the law of divorce now ? " The baronet uncrossed his long thin legs . " I 've never had any particular truck with it . I believe it 's less old-fashioned than it was , but see Whitaker . " He reached for the red-backed volume . " Page 258  --  here you are , my dear . " Clare read in silence while he gazed at her ruefully . She looked up and said : " Then , if I want him to divorce me , I 've got to commit adultery . " " That is , I believe , the elegant way they put it . In the best circles , however , the man does the dirty work . " " Yes , but he wo n't . He wants me back .

" " If it were n't for my people , " she said , " I 'd give him cause to-morrow and have done with it . " " You do n't think a better way would be to give partnershipanother trial ? " Clare shook her head . " I simply could n't . " " That 's that , then , " said Sir Lawrence , " and it 's an awkward that . What does Dinny say ? " " I have n't discussed it with her . She does n't know he 's here . " " At present , then , you 've no one to advise you ? " " No . Dinny knows why I left , that 's all . " " I should doubt if Jerry Corven is a very patient man .

He 's very able , you know . " Sir Lawrence shrugged . " To me , " he said , " and to all your kin , his career is nothing to your good name . How long has he got over here ? " " Not long , I should think . " " Would you like me to see him , and try to arrange that you go your own ways ? " Clare was silent , and Sir Lawrence , watching her , thought : Attractive , but a lot of naughty temper . Any amount of spirit , and no patience at all . ' Then she said : " It was all my fault , nobody wanted me to marry him . I hate to bother you . Besides , he would n't consent . " " You never know , " murmured Sir Lawrence . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be lovely of you , only " " All right , then . In the meantime young men withoutjobs  --  are they wise ? " Clare laughed . " Oh , I 've lamed ' him . Well , thank you frightfully , Uncle Lawrence . You 're a great comfort . I was an awful fool ; but Jerry has a sort of power , you know ; and I 've always liked taking risks . I do n't see how I can be my mother 's daughter ; she hates them ; and Dinny only takes them on principle . " She sighed . " I wo n't bore you any more , now . " And , blowing a kiss , she went out . Sir Lawrence stayed in his armchair thinking : ' Puttingmy oar in ! A nasty mess , and going to be nastier ! Still at her age something 's got to be done . I must talk to Dinny .

" " Does n't it make you tremble , Dad , to think what these fellows ' deserts will be if they do n't succeed in putting it over now ? " The General smiled . " Sufficient unto the day , ' Dinny . Has Clare settled down ? " " She 's in her diggings . Her work so far seems to have been writing letters of thanks to people who did the dirty work at the cross-roads . " " Cars ? Does she like Dornford ? " " She says he 's quite amazingly considerate . " " His father was a good soldier . I was in his brigade in the Boer War for a bit . " He looked at his daughter keenly , and added : " Any news of Corven ? " " Yes , he 's over here . " " Oh ! I wish I was n't kept so in the dark . Parents have to stand on the mat nowadays , and trust to what they can hear through the keyhole . " Dinny drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so careful of their feelings . Sensitive plants , are n't you , Dad ? " " Well , it seems to your mother and me an extraordinarilyhad lookout . We wish to goodness the thing could be patched up . " " Not at the expense of Clare 's happiness , surely ? " 64One More River 65 " No , " said the General , dubiously , " no ; but there you are at once in all these matrimonial things . What is and will be her happiness ? She does n't know , and you do n't , and I do n't . As a rule in trying to get out of a hole you promptly step into another . " " Therefore do n't try ? Stay in your hole ? That 's rather what Labour wanted to do , is n't it ? " " I ought to see him , " said the General , passing over the simile , " but I ca n't go blundering in the dark . What do you advise , Dinny ? " " Let the sleeping dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You think it will ? " " I do . " " Bad ! " muttered the General . " Clare 's too young . " That was Dinny 's own , " remained her conviction . But how was she to get free ? Knowledge of divorce had been no part of Dinny 's education . She knew that the process was by no means uncommon , and she had as little feeling against it as most of her generation . To her father and mother it would probably seem lamentable , doubly so if Clare were divorced instead of divorcing  --  that would be a stigma on her to be avoided at almost all cost . Since her soul-racking experience with Wilfrid , Dinny had been very little in London . Every street , and above all , the park , seemed to remind her of him and the desolation he had left in her . It was now , however , obvious to her that Clare could not be left unsupported in whatever crisis was befalling . " I think I ought to go up , Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One More River " I wish to God you would . If it 's at all possible to patch things up , they ought to be . " Dinny shook her head . " I do n't believe it is , and I do n't believe you 'd wish it , if Clare had told you what she told me . " The General stared . " There it is , you see . In the dark . " " Yes , dear , but till she tells you herself I ca n't say more . " " Then the sooner you go up the better . " Free from the scent of horse , Melton Mews was somewhatstrikingly impregnated with the odour of petrol . This bricked alley had become , indeed , the haunt of cars . To right and to left of her , entering late that afternoon , the doors of garages gaped or confronted her with more or less new paint . A cat or two stole by , and the hinder parts of an overalled chauffeur bending over a carburetto could be seen in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word mews ' no longer justifiedby manure . No. 2 had the peacock-green door of its former proprietress , whom , with so many other luxury traders , the slump had squeezed out of business . Dinny pulled a chased bell handle , and a faint tinkle sounded , as from some errant sheep . There was a pause , then a spot of light showed for a moment on a level with her face , was obscured , and the door was opened . Clare , in a jadegreenoverall , said : " Come in , my dear . This is the lioness in her den , the Douglas in her hall ' ! " Dinny entered a small , almost empty , room hung with the green Japanese silk of the antique dealer and carOneMore River 67peted with matting . A narrow , spiral staircase wormed into it at the far corner , and a subdued light radiated from a single green-paper-shaded bulb hanging in the centre . A brass electric heater diffused no heat . " Nothing doing here so far , " said Clare . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stepped into a rather smaller sitting-room . It had two curtained windowslooking over the mews , a couch with cushions , a littleold bureau , three chairs , six Japanese prints which Clare had evidently just been hanging , an old Persian rug over the matted floor , an almost empty bookcase and some photographs of the family standing on it . The walls were distempered a pale grey , and a gas fire was burning . " Fleur gave me the prints and the rug , and Aunt Em stumped up the bureau . I took the other things over . " " Where do you sleep ? " " On that couch  --  quite comfy . I 've got a little bathdressing-roomnext door , with a geyser , and a whatd'ye-call-it , and a cupboard for clothes . " " Mother told me to ask what you wanted . " " I could do with our old Primus stove , some blankets and a few knives and forks and spoons , and a small tea set , if there 's one to spare , and any spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , darling , how are you ? " " Bodily fine , mentally rather worried . I told you he was over . " " Does he know of this place ? " " Not so far . You and Fleur and Aunt Em  --  oh ! and Tony Croom  --  are the only people who know of it . My68 One More River official address is Mount Street . But he 's bound to find out if he wants to . " " You saw him ? " " Yes , and told him I was n't coming back ; and I 'm not , Dinny , that 's flat to save breath . Have some tea ? I can make it in a brown pot . " " No , thank you , I had it on the train . " She was sit- ting on one of the taken-over chairs , in a bottle-green suit that went beautifully with her beech-leaf coloured hair . " How jolly you look , sitting there ! " said Clare , curl- ing up on the sofa . " Gasper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grace- ful creature , one of those people who could n't look un- graceful ; with her dark short hair , and dark , alive eyes , and ivory pale face , and not too brightened lips holding the cigarette , she looked  --  well , desirable . ' And , under all the circumstances , the word appeared to Dinny an awkward one . Clare had always been vivid and attrac- tive , but without question marriage had subtly rounded , deepened and in some sort bedevilled that attraction . She said , suddenly : " Tony Croom , you said ? " " He helped me distemper these walls ; in fact , he practically did them , while I did the bathroom  --  these are better . " Dinny 's eyes took in the walls with apparent interest . " Quite neat . Mother and Father are nervous , dar- ling . " " They would be . " " Naturally , do n't you think ? " Clare 's brows drew down . Dinny suddenly remem- One More River 69bered how strenuously they had once debated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Clare never had yet ! " I ca n't help it , Dinny . I do n't know what Jerry 's going to do . " " I suppose he ca n't stay long , without giving up his job ? " " Probably not . But I 'm not going to bother . What will be will . " " How quickly could a divorce be got ? I mean against him ? " Clare shook her head , and a dark curl fell over her forehead , reminding Dinny of her as a child . " To have him watched would be pretty revolting . And I 'm not going into Court to describe being brutalised . It 's only my word against his . Men are safe enough . " Dinny got up and sat down beside her on the couch . " I could kill him ! " she said . Clare laughed . " He was n't so bad in many ways . Only I simply wo n't go back . If you 've once been skinned , you ca n't . " Dinny sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , at last , " how you stand with Tony Croom . " " He 's on probation . So long as he behaves I like to see him . " " If , " said Dinny , slowly , " he were known to come here , it would be all that would be wanted , would n't it ? " Clare laughed again . " Quite enough for men of the world , I should think . I believe juries can never withstand being called that . But you see , Dinny , if I begin to look at things from a jury 's point of view , I might as well be dead . And as a matter of fact , I feel very much alive . So I 'm going straight ahead . Tony knows I 've had enough physiology to last me a long time . " " Is he in love with you ? " Their eyes , brown and blue , met . " Yes . " " Are you in love with him ? " " I like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling at present . " " Do n't you think that while Jerry is here ? " " No . I think I 'm safer while he 's here than when he goes . If I do n't go back with him he 'll probably have me watched . That 's one thing about him  --  he does what he says he 'll do . " " I wonder if that 's an advantage . Come out and have some dinner . " Clare stretched herself . " Ca n't , darling . I 'm dining with Tony in a little grubby restaurant suited to our joint means . This living on next to nothing is rather fun . " Dinny got up and began to straighten the Japanese prints . Clare 's recklessness was nothing new . To come the elder sister ! To be a wet blanket ! Impossible ! She said : " These are good , my dear . Fleur has very jolly things . " " D' you mind if I change ? " said Clare , and vanished into the bathroom . Left alone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessness which comes to all but such asOne More River 71constitutionally know better . ' She went dejectedly to the window and drew aside the curtain . All was darkish and dingy . A car had drawn out of a neighbouring garage and stood waiting for its driver . Imagine trying to sell antiques here ! ' she thought . She saw a man come round the corner close by and stop , looking at the numbers . He moved along the opposite side , then came back and stood still just in front of No. 2 . She noted the assurance and strength in that trim overcoated figure . Good heavens ! ' she thought : Jerry ! ' She dropped the curtain and crossed quickly to the bathroom door . As she opened it she heard the desolate tinkling of the sheep-bell installed by the antique dealer . Clare was standing in her underthings under the singlebulb , examining her lips with a hand-glass . Dinny filled the remains of the four feet by two of standing room . " Clare , " she said , " it 's him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , the shimmerof her silk garments , the startled light in her dark eyes , made her even to her sister something of a vision . " Jerry ? " Dinny nodded . " Well , I wo n't see him . " She looked at the watch on her wrist . " And I 'm due at seven . Damn ! " Dinny , who had not the faintest desire that she should keep her rash appointment , said , to her own surprise : " Shall I go ? He must have seen the light . " " Could you take him away with you , Dinny ? " 72 One More River " I can try . " " Then do , darling . It 'd be ever so sweet of you . I wonder how he 's found out . Hell ! It 's going to be a persecution . " Dinny stepped back into the sitting room , turned out the light there and went down the twisting stair . The sheep-bell tinkled again above her as she went . Crossing that little empty room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must pull it to behind me . ' Her heart beat fast , she took a deep breath , opened the door swiftly , stepped out and pulled it to with a slam . She was chest to chest with her brother-in-law , and she started back with an admirably impromptu : " Who is it ? " He raised his hat , and they stood looking at each other . " Dinny ! Is Clare in ? " " Yes ; but she ca n't see anyone . " " You mean she wo n't see me ? " " If you like to put it that way . " He stood looking intently at her with his daring eyes . " Another day will do . Which way are you going ? " " To Mount Street . " " I 'll come with you , if I may . " " Do . " She moved along at his side , thinking : Be careful ! ' For in his company she did not feel towards him quite as in his absence . As everybody said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me bad marks , I suppose ? " " We wo n't discuss it , please ; whatever she feels , I do too . " " Naturally . Your loyalty 's proverbial . But consider , Dinny , how provocative she is . " His eyes smiled roundOne More River 73at her . That vision  --  of neck , and curve , and shimmer , dark hair and eyes ! Sex appeal  --  horrible expression ! " You 've no idea how tantalising . Besides I was always an experimentalist . " Dinny stood still suddenly : " This is my sister , you know . " " You 're sure , I suppose ? It seems queer when one looks at you both . " Dinny walked on , and did not answer . " Now listen , Dinny , " began that pleasant voice . " I 'm a sensualist , if you like , but what does it matter ? Sex is naturally aberrational . If anyone tells you it is n't , do n't believe them . These things work themselves out , and anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , in two years ' time she wo n't even remember . She likes the sort of life , and I 'm not fussy . Marriage is very much a go-as-you-please affair . " " You mean that by that time you 'll be experimenting with some one else ? " He shrugged , looked round at her and smiled . " Almost embarrassing this conversation , is n't it ? What I want you to grasp is that I 'm two men . One , and it 's the one that matters , has his work to do and means to do it . Clare should stick to that man because he 'll give her a life in which she wo n't rust ; she 'll be in the thick of affairs and people who matter ; she 'll have stir and movement  --  andshe loves both . She 'll have a certain power , and she 's not averse from that . The other man  --  well , he wants his fling , he takes it , if you like ; but the worst is over so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be when we 've settled down again . You see , I 'm honest , or shamelessif you like it better . " 74 One More River " I do n't see , in all this , " said Dinny drily , " where love comes in . " " Perhaps it does n't . Marriage is composed of mutualinterest and desire . The first increases with the years , the latter fades . That ought to be exactly what she wants . " " I ca n't speak for Clare , but I do n't see it that way . " " You have n't tried yourself out , my dear . " " No , " said Dinny , " and on those lines I trust I never may . I should dislike alternation between commerce and vice . " He laughed . " I like your bluntness . But seriously , Dinny , you ought to influence her . She 's making a great mistake . " A sudden fury seized on Dinny . " I think , " she said , between her teeth , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do certain things to certain horses you 're never on terms with them again . " He was silent at that . " You do n't want a divorce in the family , " he said at last , and looked round at her steadily . " I 've told Clare that I ca n't let her divorce me . I 'm sorry , but I mean that . Further , if she wo n't come back to me , she ca n't go as she pleases . " " You mean , " said Dinny , between her teeth , " that if she does come back to you she can . " " That 's what it would come to , I dare say . " " I see . I think I 'll say good-night . " " As you please . You think me cynical . That 's as may be . I shall do my best to get Clare back . If she wo n't come she must watch out . " They had stopped under a lamp-post and with anOne More River 75effort Dinny forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameless and mesmerically implacable as a cat , with that thin smile and unflinching stare . She said , quietly : " I quite understand . Good-night ! " " Good-night , Dinny ! I 'm sorry , but it 's best to knowwhere we stand . Shake hands ? " Rather to her surprise she let him take her hand , then turned the corner into Mount Street . SHE entered her aunt 's house with all her passionate loyalty to her own breed roused , yet understanding better what had made Clare take Jerry Corven for husband . There was mesmerism about him , and a clear shameless daring which had its fascination . One could see what a power he might be among native peoples , how ruthlessly , yet smoothly , he would have his way with them ; and how he might lay a spell over his associates . She could see , too , how difficult he might he to refuse physically , until he had outraged all personal pride . Her aunt 's voice broke her painful absorption with the words : " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs her Uncle Adrian 's goateebeardedface was looking over his sister 's shoulder . " Your things have come , my dear . Where have you been ? " " With Clare , Auntie . " " Dinny , " said Adrian , " I have n't seen you for nearly a year . " " This is where we kiss , Uncle . Is all well in Bloomsbury , or has the slump affected bones ? " " Bones in esse are all right ; in posse they look dicky  --  no money for expeditions . The origin of Homo Sapiens is more abstruse than ever . " " Dinny , we need n't dress . Adrian 's stoppin ' for dinner . Lawrence will be so relieved . You can pow-wow while I loosen my belt , or do you want to tighten yours ? " 76CHAPTER IXOne More River 77 " No , thank you , Auntie . " " Then go in there . " Dinny entered the drawing room and sat down beside her uncle . Grave and thin and bearded , wrinkled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of interest in her , he seemed as ever the ideal pillarboxfor confidences . " Heard about Clare , Uncle ? " " The bare facts , no whys or wherefores . " " They 're not nice . ' Did you ever know a sadist ? " " Once  --  at Margate . My private school . I did n't know at the time , of course , but I 've gathered it since . Do you mean that Corven is one ? " " So Clare says . I walked here with him from her rooms . He 's a very queer person . " " Not mentally abnormal ? " said Adrian , with a shudder . " Saner than you or I , dear ; he wants his own way regardlessof other people ; and when he ca n't get it , he bites . Could Clare get a divorce from him without publicly going into their life together ? " " Only by getting evidence of a definite act of mis-conduct . " " Would that have to be over here ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , and doubtful at that . " " Clare does n't want to have him watched at present . " " It 's certainly an unclean process , " said Adrian . " I know , Uncle ; but if she wo n't , what chance isthere ? " " None . " " At present she 's in the mood that they should leave78 One More Rivereach other severely alone ; but if she wo n't go back withhim , he says she must look out for herself . ' " " Is there anybody else involved , then , Dinny ? " " There 's a young man in love with her , but she saysit 's quite all right . " " H 'm ! Youth 's a stuff  --  ' as Shakespeare said .

" " You know her better than I do , my dear ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long can Corven stay over here ? " " Not more than a month , at most , she thinks ; he 's been here a week already . " " He 's seen her ? " " Once . He tried to again to-day . I drew him off . She dreads seeing him , I know . " " As things are he has every right to see her , you know . " " Yes , " said Dinny , and sighed . " Ca n't your Member that she 's with suggest a way out ? He 's a lawyer . " " I would n't like to tell him . It 's so private . Besides , people do n't like being involved in matrimonial squab-bles . " " Is he married ? " " No . " She saw him look at her intently , and rememberedClare 's laugh and words : " Dinny , he 's in love with you . " " You 'll see him here to-morrow night , " Adrian wentOne More River 79on . " Em 's asked him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quite candidly , Dinny , I do n't see anything to be done . Clare may change her mind and go back , or Corven may change his and let her stay without botheringabout her . " Dinny shook her head . " They 're neither of them like that . I must go and wash , Uncle . " Adrian reflected upon the undeniable proposition that every one had his troubles . His own at the moment were confined to the fact that his step-children , Sheila and Ronald Ferse , had measles , so that he was something of a pariah in his own house , the sanctity attaching to an infectious disease having cast his wife into purdah . He was not vastly interested in Clare . She had always been to him one of those young women who took the bit between their teeth and were bound to fetch up now and again with broken knees . Dinny , to him , was worth three of her . But if Dinny were going to be worried out of her life by her sister 's troubles , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have the knack of hearing vicarious burdens : Hubert 's , his own , Wilfrid Desert 's , and now Clare 's . And he said to his sister 's parakeet : " Not fair , Polly , is it ? " The parakeet , who was used to him , came out of its open cage on to his shoulder and tweaked his ear . " You do n't approve , do you ? " The green bird emitted a faint chattering sound and clutched its way on to his waistcoat . Adrian scratched its poll . " Who 's going to scratch her poll ? Poor Dinny ! " His sister 's voice startled him : 8o One More River One More River 8t " I ca n't have Dinny scratched again . " " Em , " said Adrian , " did any of us worry about the others ?

" Dinny looked up . " Fleur 's father ? Was he a nice man , Uncle ? " " Nice ? " repeated Sir Lawrence : " It 's not the word . Straight , yes : careful , yes  --  too careful for these times . He got a picture on his head , you know , in the fire  --  poor old chap . He knew something about French art , though . This exhibition that 's coming would have pleased him . " " There 'll be nothing in it to touch The Birth of Venus , ' " said Adrian . Dinny gave him a pleased look . " That was divine , " she said . Sir Lawrence cocked his eyebrow . " I 've often thought of going into the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Italians  --  and look at them now ! " " Is n't poetry an effervescence , Uncle ? Does n't it mean youth , or at least enthusiasm ? " " The Italians were never young , and they 're enthusiasticenough , now . When we were in Italy last May you should have seen the trouble they took over our pass-ports . " " Touchin ' ! " agreed Lady Mont . " It 's only a question , " said Adrian , " of the means of expression . In the fourteenth century the Italians were expressing themselves in daggers and verse , in the fifteenthand sixteenth in poison , sculpture and painting , in the seventeenth in music , in the eighteenth in intrigue , in the nineteenth in rebellion , and in the twentieth their poetry is spelled in wireless and rules . " " I did get so tired , " murmured Lady Mont , " of seein ' rules I could n't read . " 82 One More River " You were fortunate , my dear ; I could . " " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " century by century they throw up really great men of one sort or another . Is that climate , blood , or scenery , Lawrence ? " Sir Lawrence shrugged . " What do you think of the claret ? Put your nose to it , Dinny . Sixty years ago , you two young women would n't he here , and Adrian and I would be soppy about it . It 's as near perfect as makes no matter . " Adrian sipped and nodded . " Absolutely prime ! " " Well , Dinny ? " " I 'm sure it 's perfect , dear  --  wasted on me . " " Old Forsyte would have appreciated this ; he had wonderful sherry . Do you get the bouquet , Em ? " Lady Mont , who was holding her glass with her elbow on the table , moved her nostrils delicately . " Such nonsense , " she murmured , " almost any flower beats it . " The remark caused complete silence . Dinny 's eyes were the first to come to the level . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tellin ' Adrian : Boswell 's taken to rollin ' the stone terrace , and Johnson 's lost his wife  --  poor thing . He 's a different man . Whistles all the time .

" " No ; who wrote it ? " " Surtees . You should . It 's a corrective . " " Of what , Uncle ? " " Modernity . " Lady Mont lowered her glass ; it was empty . " So wise of them to be stoppin ' this picture exhibition at 1900 . D' you remember , Lawrence  --  in Paris , all those wiggly things we saw , and so much yellow and light blue  --  scrolls and blobs and faces upside-down ? Finny , we 'd better go up . " And when presently Blore brought the message  --  Would Miss Dinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about Jerry Corven . Do n't encourage your uncle  --  he thinks he can do good , but he ca n't . " . . . " Well , Dinny ? " said Sir Lawrence : " I always like talking to Adrian ; he 's a well-tempered fellow with a mind of his own . I told Clare I would see Corven , but it 's no good seeing him without knowing what one wants to say . And not much then , I 'm afraid . What do you think ? " Dinny , who had seated herself on the edge of her chair , set her elbows on her knees . It was an attitude from which Sir Lawrence augured ill . " Judging from what he said to me to-day , Uncle Lawrence , his mind 's made up . Either Clare must go back to him or he 'll try to divorce her . " " How will your people feel about that ?

" " Form matters very little when a man 's monkey is up . I suppose you could n't get Clare to apply the closure to young Croom ? " " I 'm afraid Clare will refuse to be dictated to about whom she sees . She thinks the break-up is entirely Jerry 's fault . " " I , " said Sir Lawrence , emitting a slow puff , " am in favour of having Corven watched while he 's over here , and collecting a shot , if possible , to fire across his bows , but she does n't like the idea of that .

And yet he was the last sort of man to incur the epithet go-getter . ' His pale-brown , hazeleyed , well-featured face had a considerate , even a sensitivelook , and a pleasant smile . He had kept a little fine dark moustache , and his wig had not yet depleted his natural hair , which was dark and of rather curly texture . After Oxford he had eaten dinners and gone into the Chambers of a well-known Common Law Junior . Being a subaltern in the Shropshire Yeomanry when the war broke out , he had passed into the Cavalry , and not long after into the trenches , where he had known better luck than most people . His rise at the Bar after the war had been rapid . Solicitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a cross-examiner stood out , be-8586 One More Rivercause he almost seemed to regret the points he scored . He was a Roman Catholic from breeding rather than observance . Finally he was fastidious in matters of sex , and his presence at a dinner table on circuit had , if not a silencing , at least a moderating effect on tongues . He occupied in Harcourt Buildings a commodious set of chambers designed for life as well as learning . Early every morning , wet or fine , he went for a ride in the Row , having already done at least two hours ' work on his cases . By ten o'clock , bathed , breakfasted , and acquainted with the morning 's news , he was ready for the Courts . When at four those Courts rose , he was busy again till half-past six on his cases . The evenings , hithertofree , would now be spent at the House ; and since it would be seldom that he could go to bed without workingan hour or so on some case or other , his sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even four . The arrangement come to with Clare was simple . She arrived at a quarter to ten , opened his correspondence and took his instructions from ten to a quarter past . She remained to do what was necessary , and came again at six o'clock ready for anything fresh or left over . On the evening after that last described , at the hour of eight-fifteen , he entered the drawing room in Mount Street , was greeted and introduced to Adrian , who had again been bidden . Discussing the state of the pound and other grave matters , they waited , till Lady Mont said suddenly : " Soup . What have you done with Clare , Mr. Dorn ford ? " His eyes , which had hitherto taken in little but Dinny , regarded his hostess with a faint surprise . One More River 87 " She left the Temple at half-past six , saying we should meet again . " " Then , " said Lady Mont , " we 'll go down . " There followed one of those discomfortable hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are anxious upon a subject which they must not broach to the fifth , and the fifth becomes aware of this anxiety . They were , indeed , too few for the occasion , for all that each one of them said could be heard by the others . It was impossible for Eustace Dornford to be confidentialwith either of his neighbours ; and since he instinctivelyfelt that without a preliminary confidence he would only put his foot into it , he was careful to be public-minded and keep to such topics as the Premier , the undiscovered identity of certain poisoners , the ventilationof the House of Commons , the difficulty of knowing exactly what to do with one 's hat there , and other subjects of general interest . But by the end of dinner he was so acutely aware that they were burning to say things he must n't hear , that he invented a professionaltelephone call , and was taken out of the room by Blore . The moment he had gone Dinny said : " She must have been waylaid , Auntie . Could I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better wait till we break , Dinny ; a few minutes ca n't matter now . " " Do n't you think , " said Adrian , " that Dornford ought to know how things stand ? She goes to him every day . " " I 'll tell him , " said Sir Lawrence. 88 One More River " No , " said Lady Mont . " Dinny must tell him . Wait for him here , Dinny . We 'll go up . " Thus it was that , returning to the dining room after his trunk-call to someone whom he knew to be away from home , Dornford found Dinny waiting . She handed him the cigars and said : " Forgive us , Mr. Dornford . It 's about my sister . Please light up , and here 's coffee . Blore , would you mind getting me a taxi ? " When they had drunk their coffee and were standing together by the fire , she turned her face to it and went on hurriedly : " You see , Clare has split from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back . She wo n't go , and it 's rather a difficult time for her . " Dornford made a considerate sound . " I 'm very glad you told me . I 've been feeling unhappyall dinner . " " I must go now , I 'm afraid , and find out what 's happened . " " Could I come with you ? " " Oh ! thank you , but " It would be a real pleasure . " Dinny stood hesitating . He looked like a present help in trouble ; but she said : " Thank you , but perhaps my sister would n't like it . " " I see . Any time I can help , please let me know . " " Your taxi 's at the door , Miss . " " Some day , " she said , " I 'd like to ask you about divorce . " In the taxi she wondered what she would do if she could not get in ; and then what she would do if sheOne More River 89could get in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the Mews . " Stay here , please , I 'll let you know in a minute if I want you again . " Dark and private loomed that little backwater . Like one 's life , ' thought Dinny , and pulled at the ornamental bell . It tinkled all forlorn , and nothing happened . Again and again she rang , then moved backwardto look up at the windows . The curtains  --  she rememberedthey were heavy  --  had been drawn close ; she could not decide whether or no there was light behind them . Once more she rang and used the knocker , holding her breath to listen . No sound at all ! At last , baffledand disquiet , she went back to the cab . Clare had said Corven was staying at the Bristol , and she gave that address . There might be a dozen explanations ; only why , in a town of telephones , had Clare not let them know ? Half-past ten ! Perhaps she had by now ! The cab drew up at the hotel . " Wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood for a momentat a loss . The setting seemed unsuitable for privatetrouble . " Yes , Madam ? " said a page-boy 's voice . " Could you find out for me , please , if my brotherin-law , Sir Gerald Corven , is in the hotel ? " What should she say if they brought him to her ? Her figure in its evening cloak was reflected in a mirror , and that it was straight filled her with a sort of surprise  --  she felt so as if she were curling and creeping this way and that . But they did not bring him to her . He was not in his room , nor in any of the public rooms . She went out again to her cab. 90 One More River One More River 91 " Back to Mount Street , please . " Dorn ford and Adrian were gone , her aunt and uncle playing piquet . " Well , Dinny ? " " I could n't get into her rooms , and he was not in his hotel . " " You went there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " Sir Lawrence rose . " I 'll telephone to Burton 's . " Dinny sat down beside her aunt . " I feel she 's in trouble , Auntie . Clare 's never rude . " " Kidnapped or locked up , " said Lady Mont . " There was a case when I was young . Thompson , or Watson  --  a great fuss . Habeas Corpus , or something  --  husbands ca n't now . Well , Lawrence ? " " He has n't been in the Club since five o'clock . We must just wait till the morning . She may have forgotten , you know ; or got the evening mixed . " " But she told Mr. Dornford that they would meet again . " " So they will , to-morrow morning . No good worrying , Dinny . " Dinny went up , but did not undress . Had she done all she could ? The night was clear and fine , and warm for November . Only a quarter of a mile or so away was that backwater of Mews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She threw off her evening frock , put on a day dress , hat and fur coat , and stole downstairs . It was dark in the hall . Quietly drawing back the bolts , she let herselfout , and took to the streets . When she entered theMews  --  where a couple of cars were being put away for the night  --  she saw light coming from the upper windows of No. 2 . They had been opened and the curtainsdrawn aside . She rang the bell . After a moment Clare , in her dressing-gown , opened the door . " Was it you who came before , Dinny ? " " Yes . " " Sorry I could n't let you in . Come up ! " She led the way up the spiral stairs , and Dinny followed . Upstairs it was warm and light , the door into the tiny bathroom open , and the couch in d'sorder . Clare looked at her sister with a sort of unhappy defiance . " Yes , I 've had Jerry here ; he 's not been gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spine . " After all , he 's come a long way , " said Clare . " Good of you to worry , Dinny . " " Oh ! darling ! " " He was outside here when I got back from the Temple . I was an idiot to let him in . After that  --  oh ! well , it does n't matter ! I 'll take care it does n't happen again . " " Would you like me to stay ? " " Oh ! no . But have some tea . I 've just made it . I do n't want any one to know of this . " " Of course not . I 'll say you had a bad headache and could n't get out to telephone . " When they were drinking the tea Dinny said : " This has n't altered your plans ? " " God ! no ! " 92 One More River " Dornford was there to-night . We thought it best to tell him you were having a difficult time . " Clare nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems to me tragic . " Clare shrugged , then stood up and threw her arms round her sister . After that silent embrace , Dinny went out into the Mews , now dark and deserted . At the cornerleading into the Square she almost walked into a young man . " Mr. Croom , is n't it ? " " Miss Cherrell ? Have you been at Lady Corven 's ? " " Yes . " " Is she all right ? " His face was worried , and his voice anxious . Dinny took a deep breath before answering : " Oh ! yes . Why not ? " " She was saying last night that man was over here . It worries me terribly . " Through Dinny shot the thought : If he 'd met " that man " ! ' But she said , quietly : " Walk with me as far as Mount Street . " " I do n't mind your knowing , " he said , " I 'm over head and ears in love with her . Who would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be in that place alone . She told me he came yesterday while you were there . " " Yes . I took him away with me , as I 'm taking you . I think my sister should be left to herself . " He seemed to hunch himself together . " Have you ever been in love ? " " Yes . " One More River 93 " Well , then you know . " Yes , she knew ! " It 's absolute torture not to be with her , able to see that she 's all right . She takes it all lightly , but I ca n't . " Takes it all lightly ! Clare 's face looking at her ! She did not answer . " The fact is , " said young Croom , with incoherence , " people can say and think what they like , but if they felt as I feel , they simply could n't . I wo n't bother her , I really wo n't ; but I ca n't stand her being in danger from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think Clare 's in any danger . But she might be if it were known that you  --  " He met her eyes squarely . " I 'm glad she 's got you . For God 's sake look after her , Miss Cherrell . " They had reached the corner of Mount Street , and she held out her hand . " You may be certain that whatever Clare does I shall stick by her . Good-night ! And cheer up ! " He wrung her hand , and went off as if the devil were after him . Dinny went in , and slid the bolts quietly . On what thin ice ! She could hardly drag one foot before the other , as she went upstairs , and sank down on her bed exhausted . CHAPTER XIWHEN Sir Lawrence Mont reached Burton 's Club the following afternoon he was feeling , in commonwith many who undertake to interfere in the affairs of others , an uneasy self-importance coupled with a desireto be somewhere else . He did not know what the deuce he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should say it , since , in his opinion , by far the best solution would be for Clare to give her marriage another trial . Having discovered from the porter that Sir Geraldwas in the Club , he poked his nose gingerly into three rooms before locating the back of his quarry seated in the corner of an apartment too small to he devoted to anything but writing . He sat down at a table close to the door , so that he could simulate surprise when Corven came up to leave the room . The fellow was an unconscionabletime . Noting a copy of the British Statesman'svade mecum beside him , he began icily looking up the figures of British imports . Ile found potatoes : consumption sixty-six million five hundred thousand tons , production eight million eight hundred and seventy-four thousand tons ! Somebody the other day had written to say that we imported forty million pounds ' worth of bacon every year . Taking a sheet of paper he wrote : " Prohibition and protection , in regard to food that we can produce here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say  --  12,000,000 ; Potatoes  --  God knows how much ! All this bacon , all these eggs , and half these potatoescould be produced here . Why not a five-year plan ? 94One More River 95By prohibition lessen the import of bacon and eggs onefifthevery year , and the import of potatoes by one-tenth every year , increasing home production gradually to replacethem . At the end of five years our bacon and eggs and half our potatoes would be all-British . We should save eighty millions on our Imports Bill and our trade would practically be balanced . " Taking another sheet of paper , he wrote : " To the Editor of The Times . " THE THREE P. PLAN . " " SIR , " A simple plan for the balancing of our trade would seem to merit the attention of all those not wedded to the longest way round . There are three articles of food on importing which we expend annually some pounds , but which could be produced in our own country without , I venture to think , causing the price of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple precautionof hanging a profiteer at the beginning . These articles are Pigs , Poultry , Potatoes . There would be noneed to put on duties , for all that is required is ) , But at this moment becoming aware that Corven was passing from the room he said : " Hallo ! " Corven turned and came towards him . Hoping that he showed as little sign of embarrassment as his nephew twice removed by marriage , Sir Lawrence rose . " Sorry I did n't see you when you called the other day . Have you got long leave ? " 96 One More River " Another week only , and then I shall have to fly the Mediterranean probably . " " Not a good month for flying . What do you think of this adverse balance of trade ? " Jerry Corven shrugged . " Something to keep them busy for a bit . They never see two inches before their noses . " " Tiens ! Une montagne ! ' Remember the Caran d'Ache cartoon of Buller in front of Ladysmith ? No , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterdoes n't change much , does it ? How 's Ceylon ? Not in love with India , I hope ? " " Nor with us particularly , but we jog on . " " The climate does n't suit Clare , apparently . " Corven 's expression remained watchful and slightly smiling . " The hot weather did n't , but that 's over . " " Are you taking her back with you ? " " Yes . " " I wonder if that 's wise . " " To leave her would be less so . One 's either married or not . " Sir Lawrence , watching his eyes , thought : Sha n't go further . It 's hopeless . Besides , he 's probably right . Only I would bet " Forgive me , " said Corven , " I must get these lettersoff . " He turned and moved away , trim and assured . H 'm ! ' thought Sir Lawrence , not exactly what you 'd call fruitful . ' And he sat down again to his letter to The Times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll turnOne More River 97Michael on to it . " . . . And his thoughts went back to Corven . Impossible , in such cases , to know where the blame really lay . After all , a misfit was a misfit , no amount of pious endeavour , or even worldly wisdom , would cure it . I ought to have been a judge , ' he thought , then I could have expressed my views . Mr. Justice Mont in the course of his judgment said : " It is time to warn the people of this country against marriage . That tie , which was all very well under Victoria , should now only be contracted in cases where there is full evidence to show that neither party has any individuality to speak of . " . . . I think I 'll go home to Em . ' He blotted the perfectly dry letter to The Times , put it into his pocket , and sought the darkening placidity of Pall Mall . He had stopped to look in at the window of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider once more where the extra ten per cent on his surtax was to come from , when a voice said : " Good-evening , Sir Lawrence ! " It was the young man called Croom . They crossed the street together . " I wanted to thank you , Sir , for speaking to Mr. Muskham . I 've seen him to-day . " " How did you find him ? " " Oh ! very affable . Of course I agree it is a bee in his bonnet about introducing that cross of Arab blood into our race-horses . " " Did you show him you thought so ? " Young Croom smiled : " Hardly ! But the Arab horse is so much smaller . " " There 's something in it , all the same . Jack 's only wrong in expecting quick results . It 's like politics ; peo-98 One More Riverple wo n't lay down for the future . If a thing does n't work within five years , we think it 's no good . Did jack say he 'd take you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm to go down for a week , so that he can see me with horses . But the mares are not going to Royston . He 's got a place for them above Oxford near Bablock Hythe . I should be there if I pass muster . It 's not till the spring , though . " " Jack 's a formalist , " said Sir Lawrence , as they enteredThe Coffee House ; " you 'll have to mind your p 's and q 's . " Young Croom smiled . " You bet . Everything 's simply perfect at his stud farm . Luckily I really am frightfully keen about horses . I did n't feel at sea with Mr. Muskham . It 's an immense relief to have a chance again ; and there 's nothing I 'd like better . " Sir Lawrence smiled  --  enthusiasm was always pleasant . " You must know my son , " he said ; " he 's an enthusiast , too , though he must be thirty-seven by now . You 'll be in his constituency  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dornford 's , I expect . By the way , you know my niece is acting secretary for him ? " Young Croom nodded . " I do n't know , " murmured Sir Lawrence , " whether that 'll go on now Corven 's over . " And he watched the young man 's expression . It had perceptibly darkened . " Oh ! it will . She wo n't go back to Ceylon . " It was said with frowning suddenness , and Sir Lawrencethought : This is where I weigh myself . ' YoungOne More River 99Croom followed him to the weighing machine , as if he did not know how not to . He was very red . " What makes you sure of that ? " said Sir Lawrence , looking up from the historic chair . Young Croom went even redder . " One does n't come away just to go back . " " Or one does . If Life were a race-horse it 'd be always up before the stewards for running in and out . " " I happen to know Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sir Lawrence that he had lighted on a moment when feeling gets the better of discretion . So the young man was in love with her ! Was this a chance to warn him off the course ? Or was it more graceful to take no notice ? " Just eleven stone , " he said ; " do you go up or down , Mr. Croom ? " " I keep about ten twelve . " Sir Lawrence scrutinised his lean figure . " Well , you look very fit . Extraordinary what a shadowcan be cast on life by the abdomen . However , you wo n't have to worry till you 're fifty . " " Surely , Sir , you 've never had any bother there ? " " Not to speak of ; but I 've watched it darken so many doors . And now I must be getting on . Good-night to you ! " " Good-night , Sir . I really am awfully grateful . " " Not at all . My cousin Jack does n't bet , and if you take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said heartily : " I certainly sha n't , Sir . " They shook hands and Sir Lawrence resumed his progress up St. James 's Street . That young man , ' he was thinking , impresses meI00 One More Riverfavourably , and I ca n't think why  --  he appears to be going to be a nuisance . What I ought to have said to him was : " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife . " But God so made the world that one does n't say what one ought ! ' The young were very interesting ; one heard of them being disrespectful to Age and all that , but really he could n't see it . They seemed to him fully as wellmanneredas he himself had been at their age , and easier to talk to . One never knew what they were thinking , of course ; but that might be as well . After all , one used to think that the old  --  and Sir Lawrence winced on the curbstone of Piccadilly  --  were only fit to be measuredfor their coffins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that true ? No more really than the difference in the pronunciation of Latin since one 's youth . Youth would always be Youth and Age would be Age , with the same real divergence and distrust between them , and the same queer hankering by Age to feel as Youth was feeling and think as Youth was thinking ; the same pretence that it would n't so feel and think for the world , and , at the back of all , the instinct that , really given the chance , Age would n't have its life over again. lc , Merciful  --  that ! With stealthy quietude Life , as it wore one out , supplied the adjustment of a suitable lethargy . At each stage of existence the zest for living was tailored to what man had before him and no more . That fellow Goethe had attained immortality to the tunes of Gounod by fanning a dying spark into a full-blown flame . Rats ! ' thought Sir Lawrence : and very German rats ! Would I choose the sighing and the sobbing , the fugitive rapturesand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could ? I would not ! Sufficient unto the oldOne More River I0Ibuffer is the bufferism thereof . Is that policeman never " going to stop this blamed traffic ? ' No , there was no real change ! Men drove cars now to the same tick as the old horse-'bus and hansom-cab drivers had driven their slipping , sliding , clattering gees . Young men and women experienced the same legal or illegal urge towards eachother . The pavements were different , and the lingo inr which those youthful hankerings were expressed . But  --  Lord Almighty !  --  the rules of the road , the collisions and slips and general miraculous avoidances , the triumphs , mortifications , and fulfilments for better for worse , were all the same as ever . No , ' he thought ; the Police may make rules , Divines write to the papers , Judges express themselves as they like , but human nature will find its own way about as it did when I was cuttingmy wisdom teeth . ' The policeman reversed his sleeves and Sir Lawrence crossed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ! The houses of the great were going fast . Piecemeal , without expressed aim , almost shamefacedly , in true English fashion , London was being rebuilt . The dynastic age was gone , with its appendages , feudalism and the Church . Even wars would now be fought for peoples and their markets . No more dynastic or religious wars . Well , that was something ! We 're getting more like insects daily , ' thought Sir Lawrence . And how interesting ! Religion was nearly dead because there was no longer real belief in future life ; but some- thing was struggling to take its place  --  service  --  social service  --  the ants ' creed , the bees ' creed ! Communism had formulated it and was whipping it into the people from the top . So characteristic ! They were alwaysIO2 One More Riverwhipping something into somebody in Russia . The quick way , no doubt , but the sure way ? No ! The voluntary system remained the best , because when once it got hold it lasted  --  only it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the sense of social service was almost the perquisite of the older families , who had somehow got hold of the notion that they must do something useful to pay for their position . Now that they were dying out would the sense of service persist ? How were the people ' to pick it up ? Well , ' thought Sir Lawrence , after all , there 's the ' bus conductor ; and the fellow in the shop , who 'll take infinite trouble to match the colour of your socks ; and the woman who 'll look after her neighbour 's baby , or collect for the waifs and strays ; and the motorist who 'll stop and watch you tinkering at your car ; and the postman who 's grateful for a tip ; and the almost anybody who 'll try and pull you out of a pond if he can really see you 're in it . What 's wanted is the slogan : " Fresh air and exercise for good instincts . " One might have it on all the ' buses , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange Sweepstake Swindle . " And that reminds me to ask Dinny what she knows about Clare and that young man . ' So thinking he paused before his house door and insertedhis key in its latch . CHAPTER XIIIN spite of Sir Gerald Corven 's assurance , the course before a husband wishing to resume the society of his wife is not noticeably simple , especially if he has but a week wherein to encompass his desire . The experience of that evening had made Clare wary . On leaving the Temple at lunch time the day after , a Saturday , she took train for Condaford , where she carefully refrained from saying that she had sought asylum . On Sunday morning she lay long in bed , with the windows wide open , watching the sky beyond the tall denuded elms . The sun shone in upon her , the air was mild and alive with sounds surprisedinto life , the twittering once more of birds , the lowing of a cow , the occasional caw of a rook , the continualcrooing of the fantails . There was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her easeful stretched-out being came a certain perception of the symphonywhich is this world . The lacing of the naked boughs and those few leaves against the soft , goldbright , moving sky ; that rook balancing there ; thegreen and fallow upland , the far line of trees ; and all those sounds , and the pure unscented air on her face ; the twittering quietude and perfect freedom of each separatething , and yet the long , , composure of designall this for a moment drew her out of herself into a glimpse of the universal . The vision passed ; she thought instead of Thursday night , and Tony Croom , and the dirty little boy outside the restaurant in Soho , who had said in such endearingtones : " Remember the poor old guy , Lady ; remem-503104 One More Riverber the poor old guy . " If Tony had seen her the next night ! How irrelevant was event to feeling , how ignorantwere even the closest of each other ! She uttered a little discomfited laugh . Where ignorance was bliss , in-deed ! The village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother continued to go every Sunday , hoping  --  she supposed  --  for the best ; or was it because if they did n't the village would n't , and the church would fall into disuse , or at least behind the chapel ? It was nice to lie here in one 's own old room , feel safe , and warm , and idle , with a dog on one 's feet ! Till next Saturday she was at hay , like a chased vixen taking advantage of every cover ; and Clare drew taut her lips , as a vixen does at sight of hounds . Go back he must  --  he had said  --  with her or without . Well , it would be without ! Her sense of asylum was rudely shaken about four o'clock , when , returning from a walk with the dogs , she saw a car outside and was met by her mother in the hall . " Jerry 's with your father . " " Oh ! " " Come up to my room , dear . " In that first-floor room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope than in the rest of the old , tortuous , worn-down house , so full of relics and the past tense . This room 's verbena-scented , powder-blue scheme had a distinct if faded elegance . It had been designed ; the rest of the house had grown , emerging here and there into small oases of modernity , but for the most part a wilderness strewn with the debris of Time . One More River 105Clare turned and turned a china figure , in front of the wood fire . She had not foreseen this visit . Now were conjoined the forces of creed , convention and comfort , and against them was only a defence that it was hateful to lay bare . She waited for her mother to speak . " You see , darling , you have n't told us anything . " But how tell one who looked and spoke like that ? She flushed , went pale , and said : " I can only say there 's a beast in him . I know it does n't show ; but there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had flushed . It did not suit her , being over fifty . " Your father and I will help you all we can , dear ; only , of course , it is so important to take a right decision now . " " And I , having made a wrong one already , can only be trusted to make another ? You 've got to take my word , Mother , I simply ca n't talk about it , and I simply wo n't go back with him . " Lady Charwell had sat down , a furrow between her grey-blue eyes which seemed fixed on nothing . She turned them on her daughter , and said , hesitating : " You 're sure it 's not just the beast that is in nearly all men . " Clare laughed . " Oh ! no . I 'm not easily upset . " Lady Charwell sighed . " Do n't worry , Mother dear ; it 'll be all right once we 've got this over . Nothing really matters nowadays . " " So they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . " At this near approach to irony Clare said quickly : Io6 One More River " It matters that one should keep one 's self-respect . Really , with him I could n't . " " We 'll say no more then . Your father will want to see you . You 'd better take your things off . " Clare kissed her and went out . There was no sound from below , and she went on up to her room . She felt her will-power stiffening . The days when men disposed of their women folk were long over , and  --  whatever Jerry and her father were concocting  --  she would not budge ! When the summons came , she went to the encounter , blade-sharp , and hard as stone . They were standing in the General 's office-like study , and she felt at once that they were in agreement . Noddingto her husband , she went over to her father . " Well ? " But Corven spoke first . " I leave it to you , Sir . " The General 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've been going into this , Clare . Jerry admits that you 've got much on your side , but he 's given me his word that he wo n't offend you again . I want to appeal to you to try and see his point of view . He says , I think rightly , that it 's more to your interest even than to his . The old ideas about marriage may have gone , but , after all , you both took certain vows  --  but leaving that aside " " Yes , " said Clare .

She felt that he could have stood it with equanimity of some one else 's daughter ; she remembered that he had even sympathised with her brother 's flogging of the muleteer which had brought such a peck of trouble on them all . How little detached , how delightfully personal , people were ! Feeling and criticising in terms of their own prejudices ! Well !

Unemployment decreased ; the adverse balance of trade increased ; seven foxes escapedfor every one killed ; the papers fluttered from the storms in their tea-cups ; a great deal of income tax was paid ; still more was not ; the question : " Why has prosperitygone to pot ? " continued to bewilder every mind ; the pound went up , the pound went down . In short , time flowed , but the conundrum of existence remained unsolved . At Condaford the bakery scheme was dropped . Every penny that could be raised was to be put into pigs , poultryand potatoes .

With a little organisation , a fractional change in the nature of the Briton , and the increase of wheat offals , the thing was as good as done . In the meantime , the General borrowed slightly on his life assurance policy and paid his taxes . The new Member , visiting his constituency , spent Christmas at Condaford , talking almost exclusively of pigs , instinct telling him that they were just then the surest line of approach to Dinny 's heart . Clare , too , spent Christmas at home . How , apart from secretarial duties , she had spent the intervening time , was tacitly assumed .

Even Sir Lionel and Lady Alison drove down for lunch on New Year 's Eve . With such an overwhelming Conservativemajority it was felt that 1932 would be important . Dinny was run off her legs . She gave no sign of it , but had less an air of living in the past . So much was she the party 's life and soul that no one could have told she had any of her own . Dornford gazed at her in speculation . What was behind that untiring cheerful selflessness ? He went so far as to ask of Adrian , who seemed to be her favourite .

" " Sorry if it 's hurt , " murmured Adrian ; " but better , perhaps , to have one 's eyes open . " " Much . " Resuming the tune on his pipe , Adrian stole several glances at his silent neighbour .

Through the windowopposite was the dark sky , the elm tree brushing at the stars  --  no sound , no scent , no colour . And she lay quite still , drawing deep breaths to get the better of her anguish . It was long since she had felt Wilfrid so close to her , or been so poignantly bereaved once more . She got up , and , having bathed her face in cold water , stood at her window looking into the starry dark , still shuddering a little from the vivid misery of her dream . One more river ! ' Some one tapped on the door . " Yes ? " One More River 131 " It 's old Mrs. Purdy , Miss Dinny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but " Betty ! Does Mother know ? " " Yes , miss , she 's going over . " " No ! I 'll go . Stop her , Annie ! " " Yes , miss . It 's a seizure  --  nurse sent over to say they ca n't do nothing . Will you have the light on , miss ? " " Yes , turn it up . " Thank God they had managed to put the electric light in , at last ! " Get me this little flask filled with brandy , and put my rubber boots in the hall . I sha n't be two minutes coming down . " " Yes , miss . " Slipping on a jersey and cap , and catching up her moleskin fur coat , she ran downstairs , stopping for a second at her mother 's door to say she was going . Puttingon her rubber boots in the hall , and taking the filled flask , she went out . It was groping dark , but not cold for January . The lane was slithery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the half mile took her nearly a quarter of an hour . The doctor 's car , with its lights on , stood outside the cottage . Unlatching the door , Dinny went into the ground floor room . There was a fire burning , and one candle alight , but the crowded homely space was deserted by all but the goldfinch in its large cage . She opened the thin door that shut the stairs off , and went up . Pushing the feeble top door gently , she stood looking . A lamp was burning on the window-sill opposite , and the low , sagging-ceilinged room had a shadowyradiance . At the foot of the double bed were the132 One More Riverdoctor and village nurse , talking in low tones . In the window corner Dinny could see the little old husband crouched on a chair , with his hands on his knees and his crumpled , cherry-cheeked face trembling and jerking slightly . The old cottage woman lay humped in the old bed ; her face was waxen , and seemed to Dinny to have lost already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her lips . The eyes were not quite closed , but surely were not seeing . The doctor crossed to the door . " Opiate , " he said . " I do n't think she 'll recover consciousness . Just as well for the poor old soul ! If she does , nurse has another to give her at once . There 's nothing to be done but ease the end . " " I shall stay , " said Dinny . The doctor took her hand . " Happy release . Do n't fret , my dear . " " Poor old Benjy ! " whispered I ) inny , pointing . The doctor pressed her hand , and went down the stairs . Dinny entered the room ; the air was close and she left the door ajar . " I 'll watch , nurse , if you want to get anything . " The nurse nodded . In her neat dark blue dress and bonnet she looked , but for a little frown , almost inhumanlyimpassive . They stood side by side gazing at the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " whispered the nurse suddenly . " I 'm going to get some things I 'll want  --  back under the half hour . Sit down , Miss Cherrell , do n't tire your-self . " When she had gone Dinny turned and went up to the old husband in the corner . One More River 133 ( Benjy . " He wobbled his pippin head , rubbing his hands on his knees . Words of comfort refused to come to Dinny . Just touching his shoulder , she went back to the bed and drew up the one hard wooden chair . She sat , silently watching old Betty 's lips , whence issued that faintly stertorousbreathing . It seemed to her as if the spirit of a far-off age were dying . There might be other people as old still alive in the village , but they were n't like old Betty , with her simple sense and thrifty order , her Biblereadingand love of gentry , her pride in her eighty-three years , in the teeth that she ought long since to have parted from , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treating her old husband as if he were her rather difficult son . Poor old Benjy  --  he was not her equal by any manner of means , but what he would do alone one could n't think . Perhaps one of his granddaughterswould find room for him . Those two had brought up seven children in the old days when a shilling fortunately went as far as three now , and the village was full of their progeny ; but how would they like little old Benjy , still argumentative and fond of a grumble and a glass , ensconced by their more modern hearths ? Well , a nook would turn up for him somewhere . He could never live on here , alone . Two old-age pensions for two old people made just the difference as against one for one . How I wish I had money ! ' she thought . He would not want the goldfinch , anyway . She would take that and free and feed it in the old greenhouse till it got used to its wings , and then let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . Dinny started and leaned forward . Absorbed in her134 One More Riverthoughts , she had not noticed how faint the breathing had become . The pale lips of the old woman were nearly closed now , the wrinkled lids almost fast over the unseeing eyes . No noise was coming from the bed . For a few minutes she sat looking , listening ; then passed round to the side and leaned over . Gone ? As if in answer the eyelids flickered ; the faintest imaginable smile appeared on the lips , and then , suddenly as a blown-out flame is dark , all was lifeless . Dinny held her breath . It was the first human death she had seen . Her eyes , glued to the old waxen face , saw it settle into its mask of release , watched it being embalmedin that still dignity which marks death off from life . With her finger she smoothed the eyelids . Death ! At its quietest and least harrowing , but yet  --  death ! The old , the universal anodyne ; the common lot ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years under the low sagged ceiling , a great little old lady had passed . Of what was called birth , ' of position , wealth and power , she had none . No plumbing had come her way , no learning and no fashion . She had borne children , nursed , fed and washed them , sewn , cooked and swept , eaten little , travelled not at all in all her years , suffered much pain , never known the ease of superfluity ; but her back had been straight , her ways straight , her eyes quiet and her manners gentle . If she were not the great lady , ' who was ? Dinny stood , with her head bowed , feeling this to the very marrow of her soul . Old Benjy in that dim cornercleared his throat again . She started , and , trembling a little , went over to him . " Go and look at her , Benjy ; she 's asleep . " One More River 135She put her hand under his elbow to help the action of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her shoulder , a little dried-up pippin of a man . She kept at his side , moving across the room . Together they looked down at the forehead and cheeks , slowly uncreasing in the queer beauty of death . The little old husband 's face went crimson and puffy , like that of a child who has lost its doll ; he said in a sort of angered squeak : " Eh ! She 'm not asleep . She 'm gone . She wo n't never speak agen . Look ! She a n't Mother no more ! Where 's that nurse ? She didn ' ought to ' ave left ' er " H'ssh ! Benjy ! " " But she 'm dead . What 'll I do ? " He turned his withered apple face up to Dinny , and there came from him an unwashed odour , as of grief and snuff and old potatoes . " Ca n't stop ' ere , " he said , " with Mother like that . ' Tai n't nateral . " " No ; go downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . " " Tell ' er ; I 'll tell ' er  --  shoulden never ' ave left ' er . Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! " Putting her hand on his shoulders , Dinny guided him to the stairway , and watched him stumbling and groping and grieving his way down . Then she went back to the bed . The smoothed-out face had an uncanny attraction for her . With every minute that passed it seemed the more to proclaim superiority . Almost triumphant it was , as she gazed , in its slow , sweet relaxation after age and pain ; character revealed in the mould of that brief in-136 One More Riverterval between torturing life and corrupting death . Good as gold ! ' Those were the words they should grave on the humble stone they would put over her . Wherever she was now , or whether , indeed , she was anywhere , did not matter . She had done her bit . Betty ! She was still standing there gazing when the nurse came back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Croom constantly , but always at the stipulated arm'slength . Love had made him unsociable , and to be conspicuouslyin his company was unwise , so she did not make him known to her friends ; they met where they could eat cheaply , see films , or simply walk . To her rooms she had not invited him again , nor had he asked to come . His behaviour , indeed , was exemplary , except when he fell into tense and painful silences , or gazed at her till her hands itched to shake him . He seemed to have paid several visits to Jack Muskham 's stud farm , and to be spending hours over books which debated whether the excellence of Eclipse ' was due to the Lister Turk , rather than to the Darley Arabian , and whether it were preferable to breed-in to Blacklock with St. Simon on Speculum or with Speculum on St. Simon . When she returned from Condaford after the New Year , she had not heard from him for five consecutive days , so that he was bulking more largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to him at the Coffee House : " Where and how are you ? I am back . Very happyNew Year ! " Yours always , " CLARE . " The answer did not come for three days , during which she felt at first huffy , then anxious , and finally a little scared . It was indited from the inn at Bablock Hythe : 137-i. 138 One More River " DARLING CLARE , " I was ever so relieved to get your note , because I 'd determined not to write until I heard from you . Nothing'sfurther from my thoughts than to bore you with myself , and sometimes I do n't know whether I am or not . So far as a person can be who is not seeing you , I 'm all right ; I 'm overlooking the fitting up of the boxes for those mares . They ( the boxes ) will be prime . The difficulty is going to be acclimatisation ; it 's supposed to be mild here , and the pasture looks as if it would be tip-top . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . Thank God the inn 's cheap , and I can live indefinitely on eggs and bacon . Jack Muskham has been brick enough to start my salary from the New Year , so I 'm thinking of laying out my remaining sixty odd pounds on Stapylton 's old two-seater . He 's just off back to India . Once I 'm down here it 'll be vital to have a car if I 'm to see anything of you , without which life wo n't be worth living . I hope you had a splendid time at Condaford . Do you know I have n't seen you for sixteendays , and am absolutely starving . I 'll be up on Saturday afternoon . Where can I meet you ? " Your ever devoted " TONY . " Clare read this letter on the sofa in her room , frowninga little as she opened , smiling a little as she finished it . Poor dear Tony ! Grabbing a telegraph form , she wrote : " Come to tea Melton Mews.  --  C. " and despatched it on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the meeting of two young people depends on the importance which others attach to their not meeting . Tony Croom approached Melton Mews without thinking of any one but Clare , and failed to observe a shortish man in horn-rimmed spectacles , black boots and a claret-coloured tie , who looked like the secretary of a learned society . Unobtrusive and unobserved , this individual had already travelled with him from Bablock Hythe to Paddington , from Paddington to the Coffee House , ' from the Coffee House ' to the corner of Melton Mews ; had watched him enter No. 2 , made an entry in a pocket-book , and with an evening paper in his hand was now waiting for him to come out again . With touching fidelity he read no news , keeping his prominent glance on that peacock blue door , prepared at any moment to close himself like an umbrella and vanish into the street-scape . And while he waited ( which was his normal occupation ) he thought , like other citizens , of the price of living , of the cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her collection of foreign stamps , and of whether he would now have to pay income tax . His imagination dwelled , also , on the curves of a young woman at the tobacconist 's where he obtained his gaspers . ' His name was Chayne , and he made his living out of a remarkable memory for faces , inexhaustible patience , careful entries in his pocket-book , the faculty of self-obliteration , and that fortunate resemblance to the secretaries of learned societies . He was , indeed , employed by the Polteed Agency , who made their living by knowing more than was good for those about whom they knew it . Having received his instruction on the day Clare returned to London , he had already been140 One More Riverfive days on the job , ' and no one knew it except his employerand himself . Spying on other people being , according to the books he read , the chief occupation of the people of these islands , it had never occurred to him to look down on a profession conscientiously pursued for seventeen years . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capable sleuth . ' Though somewhat increasinglytroubled in the bronchial regions owing to the draughts he had so often to stand in , he could not by now imagine any other way of passing his time , or any , on the whole , more knowing method of gaining a livelihood . Young Croom 's address he had obtained by the simple expedient of waiting behind Clare while she sent her telegram ; but having just failed to read the messageitself , he had started at once for Bablock Hythe , since when until now he had experienced no difficulty . Shifting his position from time to time at the end of the street , he entered the Mews itself when it became dark . At half past five the peacock door was opened and the two young people emerged . They walked , and Mr. Chayne walked behind them . They walked fast , and Mr. Chayne , with an acquired sense of rhythm , at exactly the same pace . He soon perceived that they were merely going to where he had twice followed Lady Corven already  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of the cup of tea he pined for . Picking his way in and out among the backs of people large enough to screen him , he watched them enter Middle Temple Lane , and part at Harcourt Buildings . Having noted that Lady Corven went in , and that the young man began parading slowly between the entrance and the Embankment , he looked at his watch , doubled back intoOne More River 141the Strand , and bolted into an A.B.C . with the words " Cup of tea and Bath bun , miss , please . " While waiting for these he made a prolonged entry in his pocketbook . Then , blowing on his tea , he drank it from the saucer , ate half the bun , concealed the other half in his hand , paid , and re-entered the Strand . He had just finished the bun when he regained the entrance to the Lane . The young man was still parading slowly . Mr. Chayne waited for his back view and assuming the air of a belated solicitor 's clerk , bolted down past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a doorway , he scrutinised names until Clare came out . Rejoined by young Croom , she walked up towards the Strand , and Mr. Chayne walked too . When , shortly , they took tickets for a cinema , he also took a ticket and entered the row behind . Accustomed to the shadowing of people on their guard , the open innocencethey were displaying excited in him a slightly amused if not contemptuous compassion . Regular babes in the wood '  --  they seemed to him . He could not tell whether their feet were touching , and passed behind to note the position of their hands . It seemed satisfactory , and he took an empty seat nearer to the gangway . Sure of them now for a couple of hours , he settled down to smoke , feel warm , and enjoy the film . It was one of sport and travel in Africa , where the two principals were always in positions of danger , recorded by the camera of some one who must surely have been in a position of still greater danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other : " Gee ! He 's on us ! " with an interest which never prevented his knowing that his two young people were listening too . When the142 One More Riverlights went up he could see their profiles . We 're all young at times , ' he thought , and his imagination dwelled more intensively on the young lady at his tobacconist 's . They looked so settled-in that he took the opportunity to slip out for a moment . It might not occur again for a long time . In his opinion one of the chief defects in detective stories  --  for he was given to busmen 's holidays  --  wasthat authors made their sleuths ' like unto the angels , watching for days without , so to speak , taking their eye off the ball . It was not so in real life . He returned to a seat almost behind his young couple on the other side just before the lights went down . One of his favourite stars was now to he featured , and , sure that she would be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full , he put a peppermint lozenge in his mouth and leaned back with a sigh . He had not had an evening watch so pleasant for a long time . It was not always beer and skittles ' at this season of the year ; a proper chilly job sometimes  --  no error . ' After ten minutes , during which his star had barely got into her evening clothes , his couple rose . " Ca n't stand any more of her voice , " he heard Lady Corven say ; and the young man answering : " Ghastly ! " Wounded and surprised , Mr. Chayne waited for them to pass through the curtains before , with a profound sigh , he followed . In the Strand they stood debating , then walked again , but only into a restaurant across the street . Here , buying himself another paper at the door , he saw them going up the stairs . Would it be a private room ? He ascended the stairs cautiously . No , it was the gallery ! There they were , nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More River 143Descending to the lavatory , Mr. Chayne changed his horn spectacles to pince-nez and his claret-coloured tie to a rather floppy bow of black and white . This was a device which had often served him in good stead . You put on a tie of a conspicuous colour , then changed it to a quieter one of a different shape . A conspicuous tie had the special faculty of distracting attention from a face . You became that man with the awful tie ! ' and when you no longer wore the tie , you were to all intents some one else . Going up again to a table which commanded a view , he ordered himself a mixed grill and pint of stout . They were likely to be some two hours over their meal , so he assumed a literary air , taking out a pouch to roll himself a cigarette and inviting the waiter to give him a light for it . Having in this way established a claim to a life of his own , he read his paper like any gentleman at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing ; large landscapes with blue skies , seas , palms , and villas , suggestive of pleasure in a way that appealed to him strongly . He had never been further than Boulogne and , so far as he could see , never would . Five hundred pounds , a lady , a suite in the sun , and gaming tables handy was not unnaturally his idea of heaven ; but , alas , as unattainable . He made no song about it , but , when confronted with allurements like these on the wall , he could not help hankering . It had often struck him as ironical that the people he watched into the Divorce Court so often went to Paradiseand stayed there until their cases had blown over and they could marry and come to earth again . Living in Finchley , with the sun once a fortnight and an income averaging perhaps five hundred a year , the vein of poetry144 One More Riverin him was dammed almost at source ; and it was in some sort a relief to let his imagination play around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there , good-lookers ' both of them , would go back together in a taxi and as likely as not he 'd have to wait hours for the young man to come away . The mixed grill was put before him , and he added a little red pepper in view of his probable future . This bit of watching , however , and perhaps another one or two , ought to do the trick ; and on the whole easy money . ' Slowly savouring each mouthful so that it might nourish him , and blowing the froth off his stout with the skill of a connoisseur , he watched them bending forward to talk across the table . What they were eating he could not see . To have followed their meal in detail would have given him some indication of their states of mind . Food and love ! After this grill he would have cheese and coffee , and put them down to expenses . ' He had eaten every crumb , extracted all the informationfrom his paper , exhausted his imagination on the mural paintings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoked three gaspers ' before his quarry rose . He was into his overcoat and outside the entrance before they had even reached the stairs . Noting three taxis within hail , he bent his attention on the hoardings of an adjoining theatre ; till he saw the porter beckon one of them , then , walking into the middle of the Strand , he took the one behind it . " Wait till that cab starts and follow it , " he said to the driver ; " not too close when it stops . " Taking his seat , he looked at his watch and made an entry in his pocket-book . Having before now followedOne More River 145a wrong cab at some expense , he kept his eyes glued on the taxi 's number , which he had noted in his book . The traffic was but thin at this hour before the theatres rose , and the procession simplicity itself . The followed cab stopped at the corner of the Mews . Mr. Chayne tapped the glass and fell back on the seat . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying . They walked down the Mews . Mr. Chayne also paid and followedto the corner . They had reached the peacock door and stood there , talking . Then Lady Corven put her key into the lock and opened the door , the young man , glancing this way and that , followed her in . Mr. Chayne experienced a sensation as mixed as his grill . It was , of course , exactly what he had hoped for and expected . At the same time it meant loitering about in the cold for goodness knew how long . He turned up his coat collar and looked for a convenient doorway . A thousand pities that he could not wait , say half an hour , and just walk in . The Courts were very particular nowadaysabout conclusive evidence . He had something of the feeling that a sportsman ' has seeing a fox go to ground and not a spade within five miles . He stood for a few minutes , reading over the entries in his pocketbookunder the lamp , and making a final note ; then walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In half an hour or so the cars would be coming back from the theatre , and he would have to be on the move to escape attention . There was a light in the upstairs window , but in itself , of course , that was not evidence . Too bad ! Twelve shillings the return ticket , ten and six the night down there , cabs seven and six ; Cinema three and six , dinner six bob  --  he would n't charge the tea146 One More River  --  thirty-nine and six  --  say two pounds ! Mr. Chayne shook his head , put a peppermint lozenge in his mouth , and changed his feet . That corn of his was beginning to shoot a bit ! He thought of pleasant things : Broadstairs , his small daughter 's back hair , oyster patties , his favourite star ' in little but a corset belt , and his own nightcap of hot whisky and lemon . All to small purpose ; for he was waiting and waiting on feet that ached , and without any confidence that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got into such a habit of expecting the parties to be called with a cup of tea ' that anything short of it was looked upon as suspect . He took out his watch again . He had been here over half an hour . And here came the first car ! He must get out of the Mews ! He withdrew to its far end . And then , almost before he had time to turn his back , there came the young man with his hands thrust deep into his pockets , and his shoulders , hunched , hurrying away . Heaving a sigh of relief , Mr. Chayne noted in his pocket-book : " Mr. C. left at 11:40 p.m. " ; and walked towards his Finchley bus ! CHAPTER XVIITHOUGH Dinny had no expert knowledge of pictures , she had , with Wilfrid , made an intensive examination of such as were on permanent show in London . She had also enjoyed extremely the Italian Exhibition of 1930 . It was , therefore , natural to accepther Uncle Adrian 's invitation to accompany him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piccadilly they passed through the turnstile at one o'clock on January the 22nd , and took stand before the Primitives . Quite a number of people were emulatingtheir attempt to avoid the crowd , so that their progresswas slow , and it was an hour before they had reached the Watteaus . " Gilles , ' " said Adrian , resting one leg , " that strikes me as about the best picture yet , Dinny . It 's queer  --  when a genre painter of the decorative school gets hold of a subject or a type that grips him , how thoroughly he 'll stir you up . Look at the Pierrot 's face  --  what a brooding , fateful , hiding-up expression ! There 's the public performer , with the private life , incarnate ! " Dinny remained silent . " Well , young woman ? " " I was wondering whether art was so conscious . Do n't you think he just wanted to paint that white dress , and his model did the rest ? It 's a marvellous expression , but perhaps he had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail of his eye . Yes ! People did . Paint her in repose , render her when she was n't aware of how she was looking , of keeping her end up , or whatever you might call it , and would n't you147148 One More Riverhave a face that stirred you with all that lay behind it ? Art was unsatisfactory . When it gave you the spirit , distilledthe essence , it did n't seem real ; and when it gave you the gross , cross-currented , contradictory surface , it did n't seem worth while . Attitudes , fleeting expressions , tricks of light  --  all by way of being real , ' and nothing revealed ! He said suddenly : " Great books and portraits are so dashed rare , because artists wo n't high-light the essential , or if they do , they overdo it . " " I do n't see how that applies to this picture , Uncle . It 's not a portrait , it 's a dramatic moment , and a white dress . " " Perhaps ! All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you truly are , people would say you were n't real . " " How fortunate ! " " Most people ca n't even imagine you . " " Forgive imperence , Uncle , but  --  can you ? " Adrian wrinkled up his goatee . " I like to think so . " " Oh ! Look ! There 's the Boucher Pompadour ! " After two minutes in front of its expanse Adrian continued : " Well , for a man who preferred it nude , he could paint what covers the female body pretty well , could n't he ? " " Maintenon and Pompadour . I always get them mixed . " " The Maintenon wore blue stockings , and ministered to Louis the XIVth . " " Oh , yes ! Let 's go straight from here to the Manets , Uncle . " One More River 149 " Why ? " " I do n't think I shall last much longer . " Adrian , glancing round , suddenly saw why . In front of the Gilles were standing Clare and a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Dinny 's and they passed into the next room but one . " I noticed your discretion , " he murmured , in front of ' the Boy Blowing Bubbles . ' " Is that young man a snake in the grass , or a worm in the bud , or ? " " A very nice boy . " " What 's his name ? " " Tony Croom . " " Oh ! the young man on the ship ? Does Clare see much of him ? " " I do n't ask her , Uncle . She is guaranteed to behave for a year " ; and , at the cock of Adrian 's eyebrow , added : " She promised Aunt Em . " " And after the year ? " " I do n't know , nor does she . Are n't these Manets good . " They passed slowly through the room and came to the last . " To think that Gauguin struck me as the cream of eccentricity in 1910 , " murmured Adrian ; " it shows how things move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese pictures in the B. M. Cezanne , Matisse , Gauguin , Van Gogh  --  the last word then , hoary now . Gauguin certainly is a colourist . But give me the Chinese still . I fear I 'm fundamentally of the old order , Dinny . " " I can see these are good  --  most of them , but I could n't live with them . " 150 One More River " The French have their uses ; no other country can show you the transitions of art so clearly . From the Primitives to Clouet , from Clouet to Poussin and Claude , from them to Watteau and his school , thence to Boucher and Greuze , on to Ingres and Delacroix , to the Barbizon lot , to the Impressionists , to the Post-Impressionists ; and always some bloke  --  Chardin , Lepicie , Fragonard , Manet , Degas , Monet , Cezanne  --  breaking away or breaking through towards the next . " " Has there ever before been such a violent break as just lately ? " " There 's never before been such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor such complete confusion in the minds of artists as to what they exist for . " " And what do they exist for , Uncle ? " " To give pleasure or reveal truth , or both . " " I ca n't imagine myself enjoying what they enjoy , and  --  what is truth ? " Adrian turned up his thumbs . " Dinny , I 'm tired as a dog . Let 's slip out . " Dinny saw her sister and young Croom passing through the archway . She was not sure whether Clare had noticed them , and young Croom was clearly noticingnothing but Clare . She followed Adrian out , in her turn admiring his discretion . But neither of them would admit uneasiness . With whom one went about was now so entirely one 's own business . They had walked up the Burlington Arcade , whenAdrian was suddenly startled by the pallor of her face . " What 's the matter , Dinny ? You look like a ghost ! " " If you do n't mind , Uncle , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place in Bond Street . " Scared by theOne More River 151bloodlessness of her smiling lips , he held her arm firmly till they were seated at a little table round the corner . " Two coffees  --  extra strong , " said Adrian , and with that instinctive consideration which caused women and children to confide in him , he made no attempt to gain her confidence . " Nothing so tiring as picture-gazing . I 'm sorry to emulate Em , and suspect you of not eating enough , my dear . That sort of sparrow-pecking we did before going in does n't really count . " But colour had come back to her lips . " I 'm very tough , Uncle ; but food is rather a bore . " " You and I must go a little tour in France . Their grub can move one 's senses if their pictures ca n't move one 's spirit . " " Did you feel that ? " " Compared with the Italian  --  emphatically . It 's all so beautifully thought out . They make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unreasonable to ask for more , and yet  --  perhaps , fundamentally unpoetic . And that reminds me , Dinny , I do hope Clare can be kept out of the Divorce Court , for of all unpoetic places that is IT . " Dinny shook her head . " I 'd rather she got it over . I even think she was wrong to promise . She 's not going to change her mind about Jerry . She 'll be like a bird with one leg . Besides , who thinks the worse of you nowadays ! " Adrian moved uncomfortably . " I dislike the thought of those hard-boiled fellows playing battledore with my kith and kin . If they were152 One More Riverlike Dornford  --  but they are n't . Seen anything more of him ? " " He was down with us for one night when he had to speak . " He noticed that she spoke without batting an eyelid , ' as the young men called it nowadays . And , soon after , they parted , Dinny assuring him that she had " come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked like a ghost ; he might betterhave said she looked as if she had seen one . For , coming out of that Arcade , all her past in Cork Street had come fluttering like some lonely magpie towards her , beaten wings in her face and swerved away . And now , alone , she turned and walked back there . Resolutely she went to the door , climbed the stairs to Wilfrid 's rooms , and rang the bell . Leaning against the windowsillon the landing , she waited with closed hands , thinking : I wish I had a muff ! ' Her hands felt so cold . In old pictures they stood with veils down and their hands in muffs , but the old order changeth ' and she had none . She was just going away when the door was opened . Stack ! In slippers ! His glance , dark and prominent as ever , fell to those slippers and his demeanourseemed to stammer . " Pardon me , miss , I was just going to change ' em . " Dinny held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , as if about to confess ' her . " I was passing , and thought I 'd like to ask how you were . " " Fine , thank you , miss ! Hope you 've been keeping well , and the dog ? " " Quite well , both of us . Foch likes the country . " One More River 153 " Ah ! Mr. Desert always thought he was a country dog . " " Have you any news ? " " Not to say news , miss . I understand from his bank that he 's still in Siam . They forward his letters to their branch in Bangkok . His lordship was here not long ago , and I understood him to say that Mr. Desert was up a river somewhere . " " A river ! " " The name escapes me , something with a Yi ' in it , and a sang '  --  was it ? I believe it 's very ' ot there . If I may say so , miss , you have n't much colour consideringthe country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it did me a power of good . " Dinny took his hand again . " I 'm very glad to have seen you , Stack . " " Come in , miss . You 'll see I keep the room just as it was . " Dinny followed to the doorway of the sitting room . " Exactly the same , Stack ; he might almost be there . " " I like to think so , miss . " " Perhaps he is , " said Dinny . " They say we have astral bodies . Thank you . " She touched his arm , passed him , and went down the stairs . Her face quivered and was still , and she walked rapidly away . A river ! Her dream ! One more river ! ' In Bond Street a voice said : " Dinny ! " and she turned to see Fleur . " Whither away , my dear ? Have n't seen you for an age . I 've just been to the French pictures . Are n't they divine ? I saw Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " 154 One More River " A shipmate  --  Tony Croom . " " More to come ? " Dinny shrugged , and , looking at her trim companion , thought : I wish Fleur did n't always go so straight to the point . ' " Any money ? " " No . He 's got a job , but it 's very slender  --  Mr. Muskham 's Arab mares . " " Oh ! Three hundred a year  --  five at the outside . That 's no good at all . You know , really , she 's making a great mistake . Jerry Corven will go far . " Dinny said drily : " Further than Clare , anyway . " " You mean it 's a complete breach ? " Dinny nodded . She had never been so near disliking Fleur . " Well , Clare 's not like you . She belongs to the new order , or disorder . That 's why it 's a mistake . She 'd have a much better time if she stuck to Jerry , nominally at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't care about money , " said Dinny coldly . " Oh , nonsense ! Money 's only being able to do what you want to do . Clare certainly cares about that . " Dinny , who knew that this was true , said , still more coldly : " It 's no good to try and explain . " " My dear , there 's nothing to explain . He 's hurt her in some way , as , of course , he would . That 's no reason in the long run . That perfectly lovely Renoir  --  the man and woman in the box ! Those people lived lives of their own  --  together . Why should n't Clare ? " " Would you ? " Fleur gave a little shrug of her beautifully fitted shoulders . One More River 155 " If Michael were n't such a dear . Besides  --  children . " Again she gave that little shrug . Dinny thawed . " You 're a fraud , Fleur . You do n't practise what you preach . " " My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody 's . " " Well , do n't let 's squabble . Michael says your new Member , Dornford , is after his own heart . They 're working together on pigs , poultry and potatoes . A great stunt , and the right end of the stick , for once . " " Yes , we 're going all out for pigs at Condaford . Is Uncle Lawrence doing anything at Lippinghall ? " " No . He invented the plan , so he thinks he 's done his bit . Michael will make him do more when he 's got time . Em is screamingly funny about it . How do you like Dornford ? " Asked this question twice in one morning , Dinny looked her cousin by marriage full in the face . " He seems to me almost a paragon . " She felt Fleur 's hand slip suddenly under her arm . " I wish you 'd marry him , Dinny dear . One does n't marry paragons , but I fancy one could fault ' him if one tried . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight before her . CHAPTER XVIIITHE third of February was a day so bland and of such spring-like texture that the quickened blood demanded adventure . This was why Tony Croom sent an early wire and set out at noon from Bablock Hythe in his old but newlyacquiredtwo-seater . The car was not his dream , ' but it could do fifty at the pinch he liked to give it . He took the nearest bridge , ran for Abingdon , and on past Bensonto Henley . There he stopped to snatch a sandwich and fill up , ' and again on the bridge for a glimpse at the sunlit river softly naked below the bare woods . From there on he travelled by the clock , timing himself to reach Melton Mews at two o'clock . Clare was not ready , having only just come in . He sat in the downstairs room , now furnished with three chairs , a small table , of quaint design , cheap owing to the slump in antiques , and an amethyst-coloured chased decanter containing sloe gin . Nearly half an hour he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fawncolouredtweeds and hat , with a calfskin fur coat over her arm . " Well , my dear ! Sorry to have kept you . Where are we going ? " " I thought you might care to have a look at Bablock Hythe . Then we might come back through Oxford , have high tea there , wander about a bit among the colleges , and be back here before eleven . That do ? " " Perfect . And where will you sleep ? " " I ? Oh ! tool along home again . I 'd be there by one . " One More River 157 " Poor Tony ! A hard day ! " " Oh ! Not two hundred and fifty miles . You wo n't want your fur on yet , the car does n't open  --  worse luck . " They passed out at the westward mouth of the mews , narrowly missing a motor cyclist , and slid on towards the Park . " She goes well , Tony . " " Yes , she 's an easy old thing , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a terribledoing . And I do n't like a light-coloured car . " Clare leaned back , by the smile on her lips she was enjoying herself . There was little conversation on that , the first long drive they had taken together . Both had the youthful love of speed , and young Croom got every ounce out of the car that the traffic would permit . They reached the last crossing of the river under two hours . " Here 's the inn where I dig , " he said presently . " Would you like tea ? " " Not wise , my dear . When I 've seen the boxes and paddocks , we 'll get out of here to where you 're not known . " " I must just show you the river . " Through its poplars and willow trees the white way of the river gleamed , faintly goldened by the sunken sun . They got out to look . The lamb's-tails on the hazels were very forward . Clare twisted off a spray . " False spring . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A current of chilly air came stealing down the river , 156158 One More Riverand mist could be seen rising on the meadows beyond . " Only a ferry here , then , Tony ? " " Yes , and a short cut into Oxford the other side , about five miles . I 've walked it once or twice : rather nice . " " When the blossom and meadow flowers come , it 'll be jolly . Come along ! Just show me where the paddocks lie , and we 'll get on to Oxford . " They got back into the car . " Wo n't you see the boxes ? " She shook her head . " I 'll wait till the mares are here . There 's a subtle distinction between your bringing me to look at boxes , and my coming to look at mares . Are they really from Nejd ? " " So Muskham swears . I shall believe or not when I 've seen the syces in charge of them . " " What colour ? " " Two bays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and were sheltered by a long spinney . " Ideal drainage and all the sun there is . The boxes are round that corner under the spinney . There 's a good deal to do still ; we 're putting in a heater . " " It 's very quiet here . " " Practically no cars on this road ; motorcycles now and then  --  there 's one now . " A cycle came sputtering towards them , stopped , wrenched round and went sputtering back . " Noisy brutes ! " murmured young Croom . " However , the mares will have had their baptism by the time they get here . " One More River 159 " What a change for them , poor dears ! " " They 're all to be golden something : Golden Sand , Golden Houri , and Golden Hind , these three . " " I did n't know Jack Muskham was a poet . " " It stops at horses , I think . " " Really marvellous , the stillness , Tony ! " , " Past five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they'reconverting . " " How many rooms ? " " Four . Bedroom , sitting-room , kitchen , bathroom . But one could build on . " He looked at her intently . But her face was averted . " Well , " he said abruptly , " all aboard . We 'll get to Oxford before dark . " Oxford  --  between lights , like all towns , at its worst  --  seemed to say : " Doomed to villadom , cars and modernity , I am beyond your aid . " To those two , hungry and connected with Cambridge , it offered little attraction till they were seated in the Mitre before anchovy sandwiches , boiled eggs , toast , muffins , scones , jam , and a large pot of tea . With every mouthful the romance of Oxford became apparent . This old inn , where they alone were eating , the shining fire , red curtains being drawn , the unexpected cosy solitude , prepared them to find it marvellous ' when they should set forth . A motorcyclist in leather overalls looked in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected a table for dinner , and passed on . Now and again a waitress renewed their toast or fiddled at some table . They were deliciously alone . Not till past seven did they rise . " Let 's scout , " said Clare . " We 've lots of time . " 16o One More RiverThe Oxford world was dining , and the streets were almost empty . They wandered at random , choosing the narrower ways and coming suddenly on colleges and long old walls . Nothing seemed modern now . The Past had them by the throat . Dark towers and old half-lit stonework ; winding , built in , glimpsy passages ; the sudden spacious half-lighted gloom of a chanced-on quadrangle ; chiming of clocks , and the feeling of a dark and old and empty town that was yet brimming with hidden modern life and light , kept them almost speechless ; and , since they had never known their way , they were at once lost . Young Croom had entwined her arm in his , and kept his step in time to hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then had a feeling as if they had wandered into the maze of history . " I rather wish , " said Clare , " that I 'd been up here or at Cambridge . " " One never got a nooky feeling like this at Cambridge . In the dark this is much more mediaval . There the colleges are together in a line . The backs ' lay over anything they 've got here , but the old atmosphere here is far stronger . " " I believe I could have enjoyed the past . Palfreys and buff jerkins . You 'd have looked divine , Tony , in a buff jerkin , and one of those caps with a long green feather . " " The present with you is good enough for me . This is the longest time we 've ever spent together without a break . " " Do n't get soppy . We 're here to look at Oxford . Which way shall we go now ? " " All the same to me , " said his remote voice . " Hurt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One More River 161 " They 'll be coming out of hall . Past eight ; we 'd better stick to the streets . " They wandered up the Cornmarket to the Broad , stood before the statues on the right , then turned into a dim square with a circular building in the centre , a church at the end and colleges for its side walls . " This must be the heart , " said Clare . " Oxford certainlyhas its points . Whatever they do to the outside , I do n't see how they can spoil all this . " With mysterious suddenness the town had come to life ; youths were passing with short gowns over their arms , flapping free , or wound round their necks . Of one of them young Croom asked where they were . " That 's the Radcliffe . This is I3rasenose , and the High 's down there . " " And the Mitre ? " " To your right . " " Thanks . " " Not at all . " He bent his uncapped head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Let 's go in and have cocktails . " A motorist , well capped and leathered , standing by his cycle , looked after them intently as they went into the hotel . After cocktails and biscuits , they came out feeling , as young Croom said : " Bright and early . We 'll go back over Magdalen Bridge , through Benson , Dorchester and Henley . " " Stop on the bridge , Tony . I want to see my name-sake. " 162 One More River One More River 163The bridge lights threw splashes on the Charwell 's inky stream , the loom of Magdalen lay solid on the dark , and away towards the Christchurch meadows a few lamps shone . Whence they had come the broad , half-lighted strip of street ran between glimpsed grey frontages and doorways . And the little river over which they were at standstill seemed to flow with secrecy . " The Char ' they call it , do n't they ? " " In the summer I shall have a punt , Clare . The upperriver 's even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punt ? " " Wo n't I ! " " Nearly ten ! Well , I 've enjoyed that , Tony . " He gave her a long side-glance and started the engine . It seemed as if he must always be moving on ' with her . Would there never be a long and perfect stop ? " Sleepy , Clare ? " " Not really . That was a mighty strong cocktail . If you 're tired I could drive . " " Tired ? Gracious , no ! I was only thinking that every mile takes me that much away from you . " In the dark a road seems longer than by day , and so different . A hundred unremembered things appear  --  hedges , stacks , trees , houses , turnings . Even the villages seem different . In Dorchester they stopped to make sure of the right turning ; a motorcyclist passed them , and young Croom called out : " To Henley ? " " Straight on ! " They came to another village . " This , " said young Croom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it 's thirty-five miles . We shall be up by twelve . " " Poor dear , and you 've got to do all this back again . " " I shall drive like Jehu . It 's a good anodyne . " Clare touched his coat cuff , and there was anothersilence . They had reached a wood when he slackened suddenly . " My lights have gone ! " , A motorcyclist skidded past , calling : " Your lights are out , sir ! " Young Croom stopped the engine . " That 's torn it . The battery must he used up . " Clare laughed . He got out and moved round , examining the car . " I remember this wood . It 's a good five miles to Henley . We must creep on and trust to luck . " " Shall I get out and walk ahead ? " " No , it 's so pitch dark . I might run over you . " After a hundred yards or so he stopped again . " I 'm off the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed again . " An adventure , my dear . " " I 've got no torch . This wood goes on for a mile or two , if I remember . " " Let 's try again . " A car whizzed past , and the driver shouted at them . " Follow his lights , Tony ! " But before he could start the engine the car had dipped or turned and was gone . They crept on slowly . " Damn ! " said young Croom , suddenly , " off the road again ! " " Pull her right in off the road then , and let 's think . Is n't there anything at all before Henley ? " 164 One More River " Not a thing . Besides , recharging a battery ca n't be done just anywhere ; but I expect it 's a wire gone . " " Shall we leave the car and walk in ? She 'll be all right here in the wood . " " And then ? " muttered young Croom . " I must be back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll walk you in to the hotel , borrow a torch and come back to her . With a torch I could get her down , or stay with her till daylight , and then come down and pick you up at the Bridge . " " Ten miles walking for you ! Why not both stay with her and see the sun rise ? I 've always wanted to spend a night in a car . " In young Croom a struggle took place . A whole night with her  --  alone ! " D' you mean you 'd trust me ? " " Do n't be old-fashioned , Tony . It 's much the best thing to do , and rather a lark . If a car came into us , or we were run in for driving without lights , that would be awkward if you like . " " There 's never a moon when you want one , " mutteredyoung Croom . " You really mean it ? " Clare touched his arm . " Pull her further in , among the trees . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight bump . Clare said : " We 're up against a tree , and our tail 's to the road . I 'll get out and see if any one can see us . " Young Croom waited , arranging the cushions and rug for her . He was thinking : She ca n't really love me , or she 'd never take it so coolly ! ' Quivering at the thought of this long dark night with her , he vet knew it was going to be torture . Her voice said : One More River 165 " All right . I should say no one could see the car . You go and have a look . I 'll get in . " He had to feel his way with his feet . The quality of the ground showed him when he had reached the road . It was less densely dark , but he could see no stars . The car was completely invisible . He waited , then turned to feel his way back . So lost was the car that he had to whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark , indeed ! He got in . " Window down or up ? " " Half way down , I should say . I 'm very comfy , Tony . " " Thank God for that ! D' you mind my pipe ? " " Of course not . Give me a cigarette . This is almost perfect . " " Almost , " he said in a small voice . " I should like to see Aunt Em 's face . Are you warm ? " " Nothing goes through leather . Are you ? " " Lovely ! " There was a silence ; then she said : " Tony ! Forgive me , wo n't you ? I did promise . " " It 's quite all right , " said young Croom . " I can just see your nose by your pipe 's glow . " By the light of her cigarette he , in turn , could see her teeth , her smiling lips , her face lasting just to the eyes , and fading out . " Take off your hat , Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " " Do n't let me snore . " " You snore ! " " Every one snores on occasion . This will be it . " They talked for a little . But all seemed unreal , ex-166 One More Rivercept just being beside her in the dark . ' He could hear now and again a car passing ; other noises of the night there were none ; too dark even for the owls . His pipe went out , and he put it away . She lay back beside him so close that he could feel her arm against his . He held his breath . Had she dropped off ? Oh ! He was in for a sleepless night , with this faint perfume from her egging on his senses and the warmth of her arm tingling into his . Even if this were all , it would be sheer waste to sleep . Drowsily she said : " If you really do n't mind , I will put my head on your shoulder , Tony . " " Mind ! " Her head snuggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which carried with it reminder of a sunny pine wood , increased . Was it credible that she was there against his shoulder , and would be for another six or seven hours ? And he shuddered . So still and matter-of-fact ! No sign in her of passion or disturbance ; he might have been her brother . With the force of revelation he perceivedthat this night would he a test that he must pass ; for if he did not she would recoil , and drop away from him . She was asleep . Oh ! yes . You could n't counterfeitthat little regular cluck , as of the tiniest chicken  --  a perfect little sound , faintly comic , infinitely precious ! Whatever happened to him now , he would have passed a night with her ! He sat  --  still as a mouse , if mice are still . Her head grew heavier and more confidingwith the deepening of her slumber . And , while he sat and listened , his feeling for her deepened too , became almost a passion of protection and of service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no cars were passing now  --  keptOne More River 167him company ; like some huge , dark , enveloping , just breathing creature , it was awake . The night did not sleep ! For the first time in his life he realised that . Night was wakeful as the day . Unlighted and withdrawn , it had its sentience ; neither spoke nor moved , just watched , and breathed . With stars and moon , or , as to=night , lampless and shuttered , it was a great companion . His arm grew stiff , and , as if that reached her consciousness , she withdrew her head but did not wake . He rubbed his shoulder just in time , for almost at once her head lolled back again . Screwing round till his lips just touched her hair , he heard again chicklike and bland , that faint rhythmic cluck . It ceased and became the deeper breathing of far-down slumber . Then drowsinesscrept on him too ; he slept . CHAPTER XIXYOUNG Croom awoke , stiff and unconscious of where he was . A voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I ca n't see to read the hymn . " He sat up . " Heavens ! Have I been asleep ? " " Yes , poor dear . I 've had a perfect night , just a little achey in the legs . What 's the time ? " Young Croom looked at his watch 's illumined hands . " Nearly half past six . Pins and needles . Wow ! " " Let 's get out and stretch . " His voice , far away , even from himself , answered : " And so it 's over . " " Was it so terrible ? " He put his hands to his head , and ( lid not answer . The thought that next night and all the nights to come he would be apart from her again , was like a blow over the heart . She opened the door . " I 'm going to stamp my feet a hit . Then we might have a stroll to warm ourselves . We sha n't get breakfast anywhere till eight . " He started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood ; he could see the beech tree against whose trunk they had passed the night . Then he , too , got out and walked towards the road . Still greydarkand misty , the wood on either side of its dim open streak looked mournful and mysterious . No wind , no sound ! He felt as Adam might have felt dragging towards the Park Gates of Eden without having earnedx68One More River 169the right to be expelled . Adam ! That quaint , amiable , white , bearded creature . Man before he fell ' , a nonconformistpreacher in a state of nature , with a pet snake , a prize apple , and a female secretary coy and unshingled as Lady Godiva ! His blood began to flow again , and he returned to the car . Clare was kneeling and attending to her hair with a pocket comb and mirror . " How are you feeling , Tony ? " " Pretty rotten . I think we 'll shove along , and have breakfast at Maidenhead or Slough . " " Why not at home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good coffee . " " Fine ! " said young Croom : " I 'll do fifty all the way . " On that very fast drive they spoke little . Both were too hungry . " While I 'm getting breakfast , Tony , you can shave and have a bath . You 'll save time and feel comfy drivinghack . I 'll have mine later . " " I think , " said young Croom , at the Marble Arch , " I 'd better park the car . You go on in alone ; it 's too conspicuous driving up at this time in the morning ; the chauffeurs are sure to be working . I 'll slip along in ten minutes . " When , at eight o'clock he reached the Mews , she was in a blue wrapper , the little table in the downstair room was set for breakfast , and there was already a scent of coffee . " I 've turned the bath on , Tony , and you 'll find a razor . " " Darling ! " said young Croom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River I One More River 171He was back again in twelve , and sat down opposite to her . There were boiled eggs , toast , quince jam from Condaford , and real coffee . It was the most delicious meal he had ever eaten , because it was so exactly as if they were married . " Are n't you tired , darling ? " " Not a bit . I feel thoroughly chirped up . All the same , I do n't think we must do it again  --  too near the hambone altogether . " " Well , we did n't mean to . " " No , and you were an angel . Still , it 's not exactly what I promised Aunt Em . To the pure all things are not pure . " " No  --  blast them ! God ! How shall I live till I see you again ! " Clare stretched her hand across the little table and gave his a squeeze . " Now I think you 'd better slip off . Just let me look out and see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kissed her hand , got back to his car , and by eleven o'clock was standing alongside a plumber in a horse box at Bablock Hythe . . . . Clare lay in a very hot bath . It was of the geyser type and not long enough , but it provided a good soak . She felt as when , a little girl , she had done something unpleasing to her governess , without discovery . But poor dear Tony ! A pity men were so impatient . They had as little liking for cool philandering as for shopping . They rushed into shops , said : Have you such and such ? No ? ' and rushed out again . They hated trying on , being patted here and there , turning their heads to look at their back views . To savour what was fitting was to them anathema . Tony was a child . She felt herself much older by nature and experience . Though much in request before her marriage , Clare had never come into close contact with those who , centered in London and themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion and enough money to have from day to day a good ' - time . At country houses she had met them , of course , but withdrawn from their proper atmosphere into the air of sport . Essentially an open-air person , of the quick and wiry , rather than the hefty , type , she observed unconsciouslythe shibboleths of sport . Transplanted to Ceylon , she had kept her tastes , and spent her time in the saddle or on the tennis ground . Reading many novels , she professed , indeed , to keep abreast of the current , with all its impatience of restraint ; but lying in her bath , she was uneasy . It had not been fair to put " Pony to such strain as that of last night . The closer she allowed him to come to her , short of the contacts of love , the more she would be torturing him . Drying hersel f , she made good resolutions , and only with a rush did she reach the Templeby ten o'clock . She might just as well have stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an important case . She finished what jobs there were , lookingidly out over the Temple lawn , whence fine weather mist was vanishing , and sunlight , brightening to winter brilliance , slanted on to her cheek . And she thought of Ceylon , where the sun was never coolly comforting . Jerry ! How , in that horrible , common phrase , was he keeping ' ? And what doing about her ? All very well to determine that she would not torture Tony , would keep away from him and spare his senses , but without him  --  she would be dull and lonely . He had become a172 One More Riverhabit . A bad habit perhaps  --  but bad habits were the only ones it was painful to do without . I 'm naturally a light weight , ' she thought . So is Tony ; all the same he would never let one down ! ' And the grass of the Temple lawn seemed suddenly the sea , and this window-sill the ship 's bulwark , and he and she leaned there watching the flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green-blue water . Warmth and colour ! Airy shining grace ! And she felt melancholy . A good long ride is what I want , ' she thought . I 'll go down to Condaford to-morrow , and on Saturday be out all day . I 'll make Dinny come out with me , she ought to ride more . ' The clerk entered and said : " Mr. Dornford 's going straight from the Courts to the House , ' this afternoon . " " Ah ! Do you ever feel hipped , George ? " The clerk , whose face always amused her because it so clearly should have had mutton-chop whiskers on its rosy roundness , replied in his cushiony voice : " What I miss here is a dog . With my old Toby I never feel lonely . " " What is he , George ? " " Bull terrier . But I ca n't bring him here , Mrs. Cal-. der 'd miss him ; besides if he bit a solicitor " " But , how perfect ! " George wheezed . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I should have liked a dog , George , but when I 'm out there 's no one in . " " I do n't fancy Mr. Dornford 'll be residential here much longer . " One More River 173 " Why ? " " He 's looking for a house . I 've an idea he 'd like to marry . " " Oh ! Who ? " George closed an eye . " You mean my sister ? " " Ah ! " " Yes . But I do n't see how you know . " George closed the other eye . " A little bird , Lady Corven . " " He might do worse , certainly . Not that I 'm a great believer in marriage . " " We do n't see the right side of marriage in the Law . But Mr. Dornford would make a woman happy  --  in my opinion . " " In mine , too , George . " " He 's a very quiet man , but a fund of energy , and considerate . Solicitors like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will like him . " " Of course he 's a Catholic . " " We all have to be something . " " Mrs. Calder and I 've been Anglicans ever since my old dad died . He was a Plymouth Brother  --  very stiff . Express an opinion of your own , and he 'd jump down your throat . Many 's the time I 've had him threaten me with fire and slaughter . All for my good , you understand . A fine religious old feller . And could n't bear others not to be . Good red Zummerzet blood , and never forgot it , though he did live in Peckham . " " Well , George , if Mr. Dornford wants me again after all , would you telephone me at five o'clock ? I 'll look in at my rooms in case . " 174 One More RiverClare walked . The day was even more springlike than yesterday . She went by the Embankment and St. James 's Park . Alongside the water , clusters of daffodil spikes were pushing up , and tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on her back . It could n't last ! There would be a throw-hack to winter , for sure ! She walked fast out under the chariot , whose horses , not too natural , worried but exhilarated her , passed the ArtilleryMemorial without a glance , and entered Hyde Park . Warmed up now , she swung out along the Row . Ridingwas something of a passion with her , so that it always made her restive to see someone else riding a good horse . Queer animals , horses , so fiery and alive at one moment , so dull and ruminative the next ! Two or three hats were raised to her . A long man on a good-looking mare reined up after he had passed and came back . " I thought it was you . Lawrence told me you were over . Remember me  --  Jack Muskham ? " Clare  --  thinking : Lovely seat for a tall man ! '  --  murmured : " Of course ! " and was suddenly on her guard . " An acquaintance of yours is going to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tony Croom . " " Nice young chap , but I do n't know if he knows enough . Still , he 's keen as mustard . How 's your sister ? " " Very well . " " You ought to bring her racing , Lady Corven . " " I do n't think Dinny cares much for horses . " " I could soon make her . I remember  --  " he broke off , frowning . In spite of his languid pose , his face seemed to Clare purposeful , brown , lined , ironic aboutOne More River 175the lips . She wondered how he would take the news that she had spent last night with Tony in a car . " When do the mares come , Mr. Muskham ? " " They 're in Egypt now . We 'll ship them in April . I might go over for it ; possibly take young Croom . " " I 'd love to see them , " said Clare ; " I rode an Arab in Ceylon . " " We must get you down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " About six miles ; nice country . I 'll remember . Good-bye ! " He raised his hat , touched the mare with his heel , and cantered off . My perfect innocence ! ' she thought . Hope I did n't over-do it . I would n't like to " get wrong " with him . He looks as if he knew his mind terribly well . Lovely boots ! He did n't ask after Jerry ! ' Her nerves felt a little shaken ; and she struck away from the Row towards the Serpentine . The sunlit water had no boats on it , but a few ducks on the far side . Did she mind what people thought ? Miller of Dee ! Only did he really care for nobody ? Or was he just a philosopher ? She sat down on a bench in the full sunlight , and suddenly felt sleepy . A night in a car , after all , was not quite the same as a night out of a car . Crossing her arms on her breast , she closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of people straggled past between her and the bright water , surprised to see one in such nice clothes asleep before lunch . Two little boys carrying toy aeroplanes stopped dead , examining her dark eyelashes resting on her cream-coloured cheeks , and the little twitchings of her just touched-up lips . Having a French176 One More Rivergoverness , they were well-bred ' little boys without prospect of sticking pins into her or uttering a sudden whoop . But she seemed to have no hands , her feet were crossed and tucked under her chair , and her attitude was such that she had abnormally long thighs . It was interesting ; and after they had passed one of them kept turning his head to see more of her . Thus , for a full hour of elusive spring , Clare slept the sleep of one who has spent a night in a car . CHAPTER XXND three weeks passed during which Clare saw young Croom but four times in all . She was packing for the evening train to Condaford , when the sheep bell summoned her down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles , who gave her a vague impression of being connected with learning . He raised his hat . " Lady Corven ? " " Yes . " " Pardon me , I have this for you . " Producing from his blue overcoat a longish document , he put it into her hand . Clare read the words : " In the High Court of JusticeProbate Divorce and Admiralty Division . The Twenty-sixth day of February , 1932 . " In the Matter of the Petition of Sir Gerald Corven . " A weak feeling ran down the back of her legs , and she raised her eyes to the level of those behind the horn- rimmed spectacles . " Oh ! " she said . The shortish man made her a little bow . She had a feeling that he was sorry for her , and promptly closed the door in his face . She went up the spiral stairs , sat down on the sofa , and lit a cigarette . Then she spread the document on her lap . Her first thought was : But 177178 One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Her second : I suppose I must read the foul thing ! ' She had not read more than : The humble petition ofGerald Corven , K.C.B. , ' when she had her fourththought : But this is exactly what I want . I shall be free ! ' More calmly she read on till she came to the words : That your Petitioner claims from the said James BernardCroom as damages in respect of his said adultery so committed the sum of two thousand pounds . ' Tony ! If he had two thousand shillings , it was all ! Beast ! Revengeful brute ! This sudden reduction of the issue to terms of hard cash not only rasped her feelings , but brought her a sort of panic . Tony must not , should not be ruined through her ! She must see him ! Had they  --  but of course they had served it on him too . She finished reading the petition , took a long draw at her cigarette and got up . She went to the telephone , asked for a trunk call and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Croom ?  --  Gone up to London ?  --  In his car ?  --  When ? " An hour ago ! That could only mean that he was coming to see her ! A little soothed , she made a rapid calculation . She could not now catch the train to Condaford ; and she got another trunk call through to the Grange . " Dinny ? This is Clare . I ca n't possibly get down to-night  --  to-morrow morning instead . . . . No ! I 'm all right ; a little worried . Good-bye ! " A little worried ! She sat down again , and once more read the foul thing ' through . They seemed to knowOne More River 179everything , except the truth . And neither she nor Tony had ever seen a sign that they were being watched . That man with the horn specs , ' for instance , evidently knew her , but she 'd never seen him before ! She went into the bathroom and washed her face in cold water . Millerof Dee ! The part had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat , ' she thought . She set the table downstairs with what she had , made some coffee , and sat down to smoke and wait . Condaford , and the faces of her people came before her ; the face , too , of Aunt Em ; and of Jack Muskham ; above all the face of her husband , with its faint , hard-bitten , catlikesmile . Was she to take this lying down ? Apart from the damages , was she to let him triumph without a fight ? She wished now she had taken her father 's and Sir Lawrence'sadvice and clapped a detective on to him . ' Too late now  --  he would be taking no risks till the case was over . She was still brooding by the electric fire when she heard a car stop outside , and the bell ' rang . Young Croom looked chilled and pale . He stood as if so doubtful of his welcome that she seized both his hands . " Well , Tony , this is pleasant ! " " Oh ! darling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " While he was drinking , she said : " Do n't let 's talk of what we ought to have done ; only of what we 're going to do . " He groaned . " They must have thought us terribly green . I never dreamed " 1 80 One More River " Nor I. But why should n't we have done exactly what we have done ? There 's no law against innocence . " He sat down and leaned his forehead on his hands . " God knows this is just what I want ; to get you free of him ; but I had no business to let you run the risk . It would be all different if you felt for me what I feel for you . " Clare looked down at him with a little smile . " Now , Tony , be grown-up ! It 's no good talking about our feelings . And I wo n't have any nonsense about it 's being your fault . The point is we 're innocent . What are we going to do about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . " " I have a feeling , " said Clare , slowly , " that I shall have to do what my people want me to . " " God ! " said young Croom , getting up : " To think that if we defend and win , you 'll still be tied to him ! " " And to think , " murmured Clare , " that if we do n't defend and win , you 'll be ruined . " " Oh ! Damn that  --  they can only make me bank-rupt . " " And your job ? " " I do n't see  --  I do n't know why " I saw Jack Muskham the other day . He looks to me as if he would n't like a co-respondent who had n't given notice of his intentions to the petitioner . You see I 've got the jargon . " " If we had been lovers , I would have , at once . " " Would you ? " " Of course ! " " Even if I 'd said Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One More River 181 " I do n't know that . " " Well , anyway , it does n't arise . " " Except that if we do n't defend , you 'll feel a cad . " " God ! What a coil ! " " Sit down and let 's eat . There 's only this ham , but there 's nothing like ham when you feel sick . " They sat down and made motions with their forks . " Your people do n't know , Clare ? " " I only knew myself an hour ago . Did they bring you this same lovely document ? " " Yes . " " Another slice ? " They ate in silence for a minute or two . Then young Croom got up . " I really ca n't eat any more . " " All right . Smoke ! " She took a cigarette from him , and said : " Listen . I 'm going down to Condaford to-morrow , and I think you 'd better come over . They must see you , because whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a solicitor ? " " No . " " Nor I. I suppose we shall have to have one . " " I 'll see to all that . If only I had money ! " Clare winced . " I apologise for a husband capable of asking for dam-ages . " Young Croom seized her hand . " Darling , I was only thinking of solicitors . " " Do you remember my answering you on the boat : Often more damnable , things beginning . ' " " I 'll never admit that . " 182 One More River " I was thinking of my marriage , not of you . " " Clare , would n't it be far better really not to defend  --  just let it go ? Then you 'd be free . And after  --  if you wanted me , I 'd be there , and if you did n't , I would n't . " " Sweet of you , Tony ; but I must tell my people . Besides  --  oh ! a lot of things . " He began walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe us if we do defend ? I do n't . " " We shall be telling the exact truth . " " People never believe the exact truth . What train are you going down by ? " " Ten-fifty . " " Shall I come too , or in the afternoon from Bablock Hythe ? " " That 's best . I 'll have broken it to them . " " Will they mind frightfully ? " " They wo n't like it . " " Is your sister there ? " " Yes . " " That 's something . " " My people are not exactly old-fashioned , Tony , but they 're not modern . Very few people are when they 're personally involved . The lawyers and the judge and jury wo n't be , anyway . You 'd better go now ; and promise me not to drive like Jehu . " " May I kiss you ? " " It 'll mean one more piece of exact truth , and there 've been three already . Kiss my hand  --  that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God bless you ! " and , grabbinghis hat , went out . One More River 183Clare turned a chair to the unwinking warmth of the electric fire , and sat brooding . The dry heat burned her eyes till they felt as if they had no lids and no capacity for moisture ; slowly and definitely she grew angrier . All the feelings she had experienced , before she made up her mind that morning in Ceylon to cut adrift , came back to her wtih redoubled fury . How dared he treat her as if she had been a light of love ' ?  --  worse than if she had been one  --  a light of love would never have stood it ! How dared he touch her with that whip ? And now how dared he have her watched , and bring this case ? She would not lie down under this ! She began methodically to wash up and put the things away . She opened the door wide and let the wind come in . A nasty night , little whirlwinds travelling up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Slamming-to the door , she took out her little mirror . Her face seemed so natural and undefended that it gave her a shock . She powdered it and touched her lips with salve . Then , drawing deep breaths , she shrugged her shoulders , lit a cigarette , and went upstairs . A hot bath ! CHAPTER XXITHE atmosphere at Condaford into which she stepped next day was guarded . Her words , or the tone of her voice on the telephone , seemed to have seeped into the family consciousness , and she was aware at once that sprightliness would deceive no one . It was a horribleday , too , dank and cold , and she had to hold on to her courage with both hands . She chose the drawing-room after lunch for disclosure . Taking the document from her bag , she handed it to her father with the words : " I 've had this , Dad . " She heard his startled exclamation , and was conscious of Dinny and her mother going over to him . At last he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took her foot off the fender and faced them . " That is n't the truth . We 've done nothing . " " Who is this man ? " " Tony Croom ? I met him on the boat coming home . He 's twenty-six , was on a tea plantation out there , and is taking charge of Jack Muskham 's Arab mares at BablockHythe . He has no money . I told him to come here this afternoon . " " Are you in love with him ? " " No . I like him . " " Is he in love with you ? " " Yes . " " You say there 's been nothing ? " 184One More River 185 " He 's kissed my cheek twice , I think  --  that 's all . " " Then what do they mean by this  --  that you spent the night of the third with him ? " " I went down in his car to see his place , and coming back the lights failed in a wood about five miles from Henley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were till it was light . We just slept and went on up when it was light . " She heard her mother give a faint gasp , and a queer noise from her father 's throat . " And on the boat ? And in your rooms ? You say there was nothing , though he 's in love with you ? " " Nothing . " " Is that absolutely the truth ? " " Yes . " " Of course , " said Dinny , " it 's the truth . " " Of course , " said the General . " And who 's going to believe it ? " " We did n't know we were being watched . " " What time will he be here ? " " Any time , now . " " You 've seen him since you had this ? " " Yesterday evening . " " What does he say ? " " He says he 'll do whatever I wish . " " That , of course . Does he think you 'll be believed ?

" When he comes , " said the General , suddenly , re-186 One More Riverturning from the window , " I 'll see him alone . Nobody before me , please . " " Witnesses out of court , " murmured Clare . The General handed her the document . His face looked drawn and tired . " I 'm terribly sorry , Dad . I suppose we were fools . Virtue is not its own reward . " " Wisdom is , " said the General . He touched her shoulder and marched off to the door , followed by Dinny . " Does he believe me , Mother ? " " Yes , but only because you 're his daughter . He feels he ought n't to . " " Do you feel like that , Mother ? " " I believe you because I know you . " Clare bent over and kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cheering . " " You say ' you like this young man .

Perhaps never ! " " Why not ? " Clare shook her head . " I wo n't go into my life with Jerry , not even now , when he 's been such a cad as to ask for damages . I 'm really much more upset about that than I am about myself . " " I suppose this young man would have gone away with you , at any moment ? " " Yes ; but I have n't wanted to .

Ca n't you see the papers , Mummy ? They 'll be all over it . " " I think , " said Lady Charwell , slowly , " it will come back in the end to the feeling your father has about that whip . I 've never known him so angry as he was over that . I think he will feel you must defend . " " I should never mention the whip in court . It 's too easily denied , for one thing ; and I have some pride , Mother . . . " Dinny had followed to the study , or barrack-room , as it was sometimes called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " burst out the General . " Yes , and I like him . He is deeply in love with Clare . " " What business has he to be ? " " Be human , dear ! " " You believe her about the car ? " " Yes . I heard her solemnly promise Aunt Em to behavefor a year . " " Queer sort of thing to have to promise ! " " A mistake , if you ask me. " 188 One More River " What ! " " The only thing that really matters is that Clare should get free . " The General stood with head bent , as if he had found food for thought ; a slow flush had coloured his cheekbones . " She told you , " he said , suddenly , " what she told me , about that fellow having used a whip on her ? " Dinny nodded . " In old days I could and would have called him out for that . I agree that she must get free , but  --  not this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would n't tell a lie to us all like that . " " Good , Dad ! But who else will believe them ? Would you , on a jury ? " " I do n't know , " said the General , glumly . Dinny shook her head . " You would n't . " " Lawyers are damned clever . I suppose Dornford would n't take up a case like this ? " " He does n't practise in the Divorce Court . Besides , she 's his secretary . " " I must get to hear what Kingsons say . Lawrence believes in them . Fleur 's father was a member there . " " Then  --  " Dinny had begun , when the door was opened . " Mr. Croom , sir . " " You need n't go , Dinny . " Young Croom came in . After a glance at Dinny , he moved towards the General . " Clare told me to come over , sir . " The General nodded . His narrowed eyes were fixedOne More River 189steadily on his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if on parade , his eyes replyingto the General 's without defiance . " I wo n't beat about the bush , " said the General , suddenly . " You seem to have got my daughter into a mess . " " Yes , sir . " " Kindly give me your account of it . " Young Croom put his hat down on the table , and , squaring his shoulders , said : " Whatever she has told you is true , sir . " Dinny saw with relief her father 's lips twitching as if with a smile . " Very correct , Mr. Croom ; but not what I want . She has told me her version ; I should be glad to hear yours . " She saw the young man moisten his lips , making a curious jerking motion of his head . " I 'm in love with her , sir : have been ever since I first saw her on the boat . We 've been going about rather in London  --  cinemas , theatres , picture galleries , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , five times altogether . On February the third I drove her down to BablockHythe for her to see where I 'm going to have my job ; and coming back  --  I expect she told you  --  my lights failed and we were hung up in a pitch dark wood some miles short of Henley . Well  --  we  --  we thought we 'd better just stay there until it was light again , instead of risking things . I 'd got off the road twice . It really was pitch black and I had no torch . And so  --  well , we waited in the car till about half past six , and then came up , and got to her place about eight . " He paused and moistened his lips , then straightened himself again and said with a rush : " Whether you believe me or not , sir , I swear190 One More Riverthere was nothing whatever between us in the car ; and  --  and there never has been , except  --  except that she 's let me kiss her cheek two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never dropped his eyes , said : " That 's substantially what she told us . Anything else ? " " After I had that paper , sir , I motored up to see her at once  --  that was yesterday . Of course I 'll do anything she wants . " " You did n't put your heads together as to what you would say to us ? " Dinny saw the young man stiffen . " Of course not , sir ! " " Then I may take it that you 're ready to swear there 's been nothing , and defend the action ? " " Certainly , if you think there 's any chance of our being believed . " The General shrugged . " What 's your financial po-sition ? " " Four hundred a year from my job . " A faint smile curled his lips : " Otherwise none , sir . " " Do you know my daughter 's husband ? " " No . " " Never met him ? " " No , sir . " " When did you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voyage home . " " What were you doing out there ? " " Tea planting ; but they amalgamated my plantation with some others , for economy . " " I see . Where were you at school ? " " Wellington , and then at Cambridge . " " You 've got a job with Jack Muskham ? " One More River 191 " Yes , sir , his Arab mares . They 're due in the spring . " " You know about horses , then ? " " Yes . I 'm terribly fond of them . " Dinny saw the narrowed gaze withdraw from the young man 's face and come to rest on hers . ' " You know my daughter Dinny , I think ? " " Yes . " " I 'll leave you to her now . I want to think this over . " The young man bowed slightly , turned to Dinny , and then , turning back , said with a certain dignity : " I 'm awfully sorry , sir , about this ; but I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Clare . It would n't be true . I love her terribly . " He was moving towards the door , when the General said : " One moment . What do you mean by love ? " Involuntarily Dinny clasped her hands . An appalling question ! Young Croom turned round . His face was motionless . " I know what you mean , sir , " he said , huskily . " Desireand that , or more ? Well ! More , or I could n't have stood that night in the car . " He turned again to the door . Dinny moved and held it open for him . She followed him into the hall , where he was frowning and taking deep breaths . She slipped her hand through his arm and moved him across to the wood fire . They stood , looking down into the flames , till she said : " I 'm afraid that was rather dreadful . But soldiers like to have things straight out , you know . Anyway  --  I know my father  --  you made what 's called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a ghastly kind of wooden idiot . Where is Clare ? Here ? " " Yes . " " Can I see her , Miss Cherrell ? " " Try calling me Dinny . You can see her ; but I think you 'd better see my mother too . Let 's go to the draw-ing-room . " He gave her hand a squeeze . " I 've always felt you were a brick . " Pinny grimaced . " Even bricks yield to a certain pres-sure . " " Oh ! sorry ! I 'm always forgetting my ghastly grip . Clare dreads it . How is she ? " With a faint shrug and smile , Dinny said : " Doing as well as can be expected . " Tony Croom clutched his head . " Yes , I feel exactly like that , only worse ; in those cases there 's something to look forward to and  --  here ? D' you think she 'll ever really love me ? " " I hope so . " " Your people do n't think that I pursued her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to have a good time ? " " They wo n't after to-day . You are what I was once call e d  --  transparent . " " You ? I never quite know what you 're thinking . " " That was a long time ago . Come ! " CHAPTER XXIIWHEN young Croom had withdrawn into the sleet and wind of that discomforting day , he left behind him a marked gloom . Clare went to her room saying her head was bad and she was going to lie down . The other three sat among the tea things , speaking only to the dogs , sure sign of mental disturbance . At last Dinny got up : " Well , my dears , gloom does n't help . Let 's look on the bright side . They might have been scarlet instead of white as snow . " The General said , more to himself than in reply : " They must defend . That fellow ca n't have it all his own way . " " But , Dad , to have Clare free , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ever so much less fuss ! " " Lie down under an accusation of that sort ? " " Her name will go even if she wins . No one can spend a night in a car with a young man with impunity . Can they , Mother ? " Lady Charwell smiled faintly . " I agree with your father , Dinny . It seems to me revolting that Clare should be divorced when she 's done nothing except been a little foolish . Besides , it would be cheating the law , would n't it ? " " I should n't think the law would care , dear . How  --  ever  --  ! " And Dinny was silent , scrutinising their rueful faces , aware that they set some mysterious store by mar-193Pt194 One More Riverriage and divorce which she did not , and that nothing she could say would alter it . " The young man , " said the General , " seemed a decentfellow , I thought . He 'll have to come up and see the lawyers when we do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , and get Uncle Lawrence to arrange you a meeting with the lawyers for after lunch on Monday . I 'll telephoneyou and Tony Croom from Mount Street in the morning . " The General nodded and got up . " Beast of a day ! " he said ; and put his hand on his wife 's shoulder : " Do n't let this worry you , Liz . They can but tell the truth . I 'll go to the study and have another shot at that new pigsty . You might look in later , Dinny . . . " At all critical times Dinny felt more at home in Mount Street than she did at Condaford . Sir Lawrence 's mind was so much more lively than her father 's ; Aunt Em 's inconsequence at once more bracing and more soothing than her mother 's quiet and sensible sympathy . ' When a crisis was over , or if it had not begun , Condafordwas perfect , but it was too quiet for nerve storms or crucial action . As country houses went , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county family who had been in the district for more than three or four generations . The Grange had an almost institutional repute . " Condaford Grange " and " the Cherrells of Condaford " were spoken of as curiosities . The weekendingor purely sporting existence of the big places ' was felt to be alien to them . The many families in the smaller places ' round seemed to make country life intoOne More River 195a sort of cult , organising tennis and bridge parties , villageentertainments , and the looking of each other up ; getting their day 's shooting here and there , supporting the nearest golf course , attending meets , hunting a bit , and so forth . The Charwells , with their much deeper roots , yet seemed to be less in evidence than almost anyone . They would have been curiously missed , but , except to the villagers , they hardly seemed real . In spite of her always active life at Condaford Dinny often felt there , as one does waking in the still hours of the night , nervous from the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years before , her own crisis of two years ago , or this of Clare 's , she craved at once to be more in the swim of life . Having dropped Clare at her Mews , she went on in the taxi , and arrived at Mount Street before dinner . Michael and Fleur were there , and the conversation turned and turned from literature to politics . Michael was of opinion that the papers were beginning to pat the country 's back too soon , and that the Government might go to sleep . Sir Lawrence was glad to hear that they were still awake . Lady Mont said suddenly : " The baby , Dinny ? " " Frightfully well , thank you , Aunt Em . He walks . " " I was countin ' up the pedigree , and he makes the twenty-fourth Cherrell of Condaford ; and before that they were French . Is Jean havin ' any more ? " " You bet , " said Fleur . " I never saw a young woman more like it . " " There 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll wangle their futures all right . " " Such a singular word , " said Lady Mont. 196 One More River " Dinny , how 's Clare ? " " All right . " " Any developments ? " And Fleur 's clear eyes seemed to slide into her brain . " Yes , but Michael 's voice broke the silence . " Dornford has a very neat idea , Dad ; he thinks The neat idea of Dornford was lost on Dinny , wondering whether or not to take Fleur into confidence . She knew no one of quicker brain , or of a judgment on social matters more cynically sound . Further , she could keep a secret . But it was Clare 's secret , and she decided to speak to Sir Lawrence first . Late that night she did so . He received the news with his eyebrows . " All night in a car , Dinny ? That 's a bit steep . I 'll get on to the lawyers at ten o'clock to-morrow . Very young ' Roger Forsyte , Fleur 's cousin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's likely to have more credulity than the hoarier members . You and I will go along , too , to prove our faith . " " I 've never been in the City . " " Curious place ; built upon the ends of the earth . Romanceand the Bank rate . Prepare for a mild shock . " " Do you think they ought to defend ? " Sir Lawrence 's lively eyes came to rest on her face . " If you ask me whether I think they 'll be believedno . But at least we can divide opinion on the question . " " You do believe them yourself , do n't you ? " " I plank on you there , Dinny . Clare would n't try to take you in . " Thinking back to her sister 's face and to youngOne More River 197Croom 's , Dinny had a revulsion of feeling . " They are telling the truth , and they look like it . It would be wicked not to believe them . " " No end to that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear ; better go to bed . " In that bedroom , where she had spent so many nights at ' the time of her own trouble , Dinny had again that half-waking nightmare , the sense of being close to Wilfridand unable to reach him , and the refrain : One more river , one more river to cross , ' kept running in her tired head . . . . In that quiet and yellow backwater , the Old Jewry , the offices of Kingson Cuthcott and Forsyte were triballyinvaded at four o'clock next day . " What 's become of old Gradman , Mr. Forsyte ? " Dinny heard her uncle say . " Still here ? " Very young ' Roger Forsyte , who was forty-two , answered , in a voice which seemed to contradict his jaw : " I believe he 's still living at Pinner , or Highgate , or whatever it was . " " I should be glad to think so , " murmured Sir Lawrence . " Old For  --  er , your cousin thought a lot of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger smiled . " Wo n't you all sit down ? " Dinny , who had never yet been in a lawyer 's office , looked at the law books along the walls , the bundles of papers , the yellowish blind , the repellent black fireplace with its little coal fire that seemed to warm nothing , the map of an estate hanging unrolled behind the door , the low wicker basket on the table , the pens and198 One More Riversealing-wax , and very young ' Roger , and thought of an album of seaweed , compiled by her first governess . She saw her father rise and place a document in the solicitor 's hands . " We 've come about this . " Very young ' Roger glanced at the heading of the paperand over it at Clare . How does he know which of us it is ? ' thought Dinny . " There 's no truth in the allegations , " said the General . Very young ' Roger caressed his jaw , and began reading . Dinny , from the side , could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Noticing that Dinny could sec him , he lowered the paper and said : " They seem in a hurry . The petitioner signed the affidavit in Egypt , I see . He must have come over there to save time . Mr. Croom ? " " Yes . " " You wish us to represent you as well ? " " Yes . " " Then Lady Corven and you . Later , perhaps , Sir Conway , you 'd come in again . " " Do you mind if my sister stays ? " said Clare . Dinny met the solicitor 's eyes . " Not at all . " She did not know if he meant it . The General and Sir Lawrence went out , and there was silence . Very young ' Roger leaned against the fireplace , and most unexpectedly took a pinch of snuff . Dinny saw that he was lean and rather tall , and that his jaw jutted . There was a faintly sandy tinge in his hair , and in the ruddiness of his hollowed cheeks . One More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no truth in these  --  er  --  allegations . " " The facts are as stated ; the inferences are wrong . There 's been nothing between Mr. Croom and myself , except three kisses on my cheek . " " I see . About this night in the car , now ? " " Nothing , " said Clare : " Not even one of those kisses . " " Nothing , " repeated young Croom ; " absolutely noth-ing . " Very young ' Roger passed his tongue over his lips . " If you do n't mind , I think I should like to understandyour feelings for each other  --  if any . " " We are speaking , " said Clare , in a clear voice , " the absolute truth , as we 've told it to my people ; that 's why I asked my sister to stay . Tony ? " Very young ' Roger 's mouth twitched . To Dinny he did not seem to be taking it quite as a lawyer should ; something in his dress , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his tie ? That snuff , too  --  as if a dash of the artist had been suppressed in him . He said : " Yes , Mr. Croom ? " Young Croom , who had gone very red , looked at Clare almost angrily . " I 'm in love with her . " " Quite ! " said very young ' Roger , reopening the snuff-box . " And you , Lady Corven , regard him as a friend ? " Clare nodded  --  a faint surprise on her face . Dinny felt a sudden gratitude towards the questioner , who was applying a bandana to his nose . " The car was an accident , " added Clare , quickly ;
