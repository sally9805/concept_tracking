I WAS so happy to see our dear patient apparently gaining in health in the fall of 1922 , from the peaceful and congenial life with which we tried to surround him . In December the incredible old Clemenceau came . Since his miraculous escape from death by an assas  --  sin 's bullet , he said explosions made him nervous . As he had asked that no photographs be taken when it was necessary to explode a flashlight , we made every effort ourselves to protect him . However , he arrived at 5:30 on a winter day for tea . As he got out of his cur a loud explosion and flash of light startled the old gentleman , so that I feared he would be ill . I was furi  --  ous at the discourtesy to a foreign guest in our coun  --  try , but M. Clemenceau 's poise returned in a mo  --  ment . How his familiar figure brought back the months in Paris when , nearly every day , he came to our house for those interminable conferences . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger , who claimed that idealism was not a thing Germans could understand . He looked younger than in 1919 and less grim and bitter . Scorning the elevator , he tripped up the steps to the library to embrace my husband in the French fashion . He said it was fifty-three years since he had last seen the United States and that he felt so improved by his visit , and had enjoyed it so much , he had decided to come back every fifty-third year to renew his youth . On my husband 's birthday he received four mem  --  bers of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation , who came to bring him greetings from the board . Such demon  --  strations of thought and affection touched Mr. Wil  --  son very deeply , and he would say to me , after friends were gone : " I wish I could have controlled my voice , so I could really have expressed what 1 felt. ; but I could not trust myself , lest I break down and cry like a schoolboy . " Days afterward he would revert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my silence . " The only foreign decoration my husband ever ac  --  cepted was the Order of the White Eagle , of Poland . During the war he could decline such honors by say  --  ing that a special authorization of Congress wa-s neces  --  sary to their acceptance . In 1922 , when the Polish Government asked to present Mr. Wilson this medal , he could think of no polite reason for refusing . The only time he wore the decoration was on Jan  --  uary 5 , 1923 , at a family dinner in honor of my dear mother 's eightieth birthday . My husband put on full evening dress for the occasion . Diagonally across his chest was the broad blue ribbon with a big star on it . About his neck was suspended the gleaming insignia of the Order of the White Eagle . Mother and he re  --  ceived in the library , and she , bless her heart , was overcome when all the family presented themselves in fancy dress . An S Street Pageant D AN DOLPH was an Indian chief with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sheik in a long silk robe , a green turban wound about his head , in the front of which blazed my best jewel . My brother Julian was in an Abyssinian costume , with headdress and shoulder piece adorned with a lion 's mane . Anklets , bracelets and a long spear made him a fitting match for Randolph . Hunter Galt , my brother-in-law , was a Chinaman . Bertha was a Japanese geisha girl . It would be too long a story to describe us all , so I will end with my own dis  --  guise  --  that of a Turkish lady , with a long veil , purple trousers and velvet cape . Mr. Norman H. Davis had asked to bring his friend , Dean Robbins , to call , and they came for tea the following day . Dean Robbins has since published an account of this visit from which I take the liberty of quoting : " Mr. Davis and I spoke of what appeared to us to be the more favorable trend of thought in this coun  --  try with reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and then he said this : ' I am not sorry that I broke down . ' We looked at him in surprise , and then he went on to ex  --  plain that if , by his personal influence , he had been able to secure the-acceptance by this country of the Covenant , and its entry into the League of Nations , it would have been a great personal and political triumph . ' But , ' he added , ' as it is coming now , the American people are thinking their way through , and reaching their own free decision , and that is the bet  --  ter way for it to come . ' " Those were his words , as nearly as I can recollect them . Nothing could have been more moving than the sight of that stricken figure , uncomplaining , so full of noble fortitude , looking forward with un  --  shaken con fidence to the time when his beloved coun  --  try would in its own way vindicate his hope , and take its full and great and helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same to me . He wanted the League to be the people 's triumph , not Wilson 's triumph . " Therefore , " he would say , " it is better to wait . " And so he waited , cheered constantly by old friends and fellow believers . When Lord Robert Cecil , a partner of my husband in the creation of the Covenant , , was chosen to receive the first award of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation , I attended the dinner in New York as Mr. Wilson 's represen tative . My one hope was that , through the radio , he could share some of the pleasure of the evening . Though up to this time he had ( Continued on Page 71 ) should have told the reporters that , to take the rap off Duroeher , but he had the floor when the question was popped and he answered it in the only honest way . " Since Ruth did not bother to refute the statement , it undoubtedly was true . And neither party bothered to dispel the gossip that Ruth and Du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubhouse a few weeks before the close of the season . Under those circum  --  stances it hardly was logical for Ruth to serve as a subordinate to the man who was a rookie on the Yankees in 1928 when he was at the very peak of his career . MacPhail , when reminded of his flat statement to the effect that Durocher never would be manager of the Dodg  --  ers , retorted that unforeseen conditions forced him to renege , and that 's all there was to it . Despite his bard-boiled attitude , MacPhail is just a fan at heart . He was one of the nation 's leading football officials for ten years , but he will de  --  nounce the decisions of umpires  --  espe  --  cially when they go against his team  --  with a vehemence and virtuosity sel  --  dom heard from the customers in the cheap seats . Yet his concept of base  --  ball is on a lofty plane far above the sordid scrambling in the market place . " I like to think of the game as a semi-civic enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more amateur spirit and sportsmanship in profes  --  sional baseball than there is in inter  --  collegiate athletics . History shows that few owners have ever made a profit from the game , but the losses are over  --  whelming . The best that men like Ruppert , Yawkey , Wrigley and Briggs can hope to make is bare expenses , if that . " There 's not another sport that can offer such absolute proof of honesty as baseball has shown in the recent World Series . I know for a fact that Stone  --  ham ordered Hubbell to be pitched out of turn in the ' 33 series , even though winning the game meant losing a Sun  --  day date in New York . And look at the Yankees , returning one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash for tick  --  ets already sold when they won four straight from the Cubs last year . No  --  body in the world would 've criticized Joe McCarthy if he had not come back with Ruffing in the fourth game , but Colonel Ruppert was n't thinking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the cleanest , most sincere business I know . " It is obvious MacPhail has a soft spot in his heart for his chosen profes  --  sion . But not in his head . always said that he did not want a radio , he had accepted our suggestion of installing one , that he might hear the speeches at this dinner . Lord Robert 's speech of acceptance of the award of 825,000 was replete with appreciation , but what pleased me was a clear exposition of the League and his unfaltering endorsement of it as it stood . I knew this was what my hus  --  band hoped for , and if he was listening it would cheer him greatly . Alas , the electrician had been over  --  zealous and had gone to the War De  --  partment to get a special kind of bat  --  tery used during the war , which he thought would bring more volume . These batteries worked perfectly for the preliminaries , but just as Lord Rob  --  ert began his speech they went dead . It turned out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oper  --  ator had worked so hard and taken such an interest , that when the sound ceased and he could not bring it back he turned perfectly white . Randolph thought for a minute the man was going to faint . I was heartbroken , for the experience queered the radio with Mr. Wilson for  --  ever  --  just when I had hoped it would open a new interest in his life , now so circumscribed . Vainly I tried to interest him in other good programs . He would listen for a. while and then say , with a whimsical smile : " Please , ma'am , may I be ex  --  cused from that infernal thing now ? " My husband would rest on the sunlit little loggia at the back of the house , overlooking the garden , while I read aloud to him . I read so many detective stories that one day I told Woodrow , in a state of alarm , that I had suddenly found myself thinking in terms of crime . This amused him very much and he said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to something else . So we reread Walter Bagehot and biographies . Finally he proposed many we turn again to Dickens and Scott , re  --  reading almost every one of those authors ' best books . In the evenings Mr. Wilson took pleasure in looking over the illustrated magazines , including the movie maga  --  zines . These did not strain his eyes , which , however , became more and more impaired . A rack beside him held his reading glasses , as well as a magnifying glass , so he could study details , a pocket electric light. , writing paper and pencils . Wherever he sat , this little stand was placed at hand . Thus I would find him every night after I had finished my din  --  ner , he having eaten earlier and set out to entertain himself until my coming . He always held out his hand to welcome me with a radiant smile . We would play double solitaire until he was ready for bed . We played Canfield , a game I had taught Mr. Wilson during the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played was old-fashioned whist . He played chess , and tried to teach me , but without success , and so I taught him Canfield  --  both the double and single games . During the war I have seen him , with only five minutes to spare , relax his mind over a hand of Canfield . This diversion came to his rescue now . He kept , on ruled paper , a precise record of his running score . I have pages of these , showing the results of thousands of hands . Mr. Wilson de  --  veloped considerable skill at play , one time being more than a thousand points ahead . In that spring of 1923 , Mr. Wilson began to betray anxiety over the signs of the times and to speak to me of call  --  ing the public 's attention to the ills to  --  ward which we were drifting . It was a labor for him to write , on account of a return of the old enemy , neuritis , which had bothered him since the Princeton days . So he had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and tedious work , for ho could use only his right hand . At length he gave it up , but the thoughts in his mind clamored for ex  --  pression , and I undertook to write them down at his dictation . Often , when we believed him sleeping , his bell would // ring and he would send Scott to ask me to come and take down a sentence or two . Thus was written his last published message , which he called The Road Away From Revolution . It is brief , but , even so , took its toll of his strength ; for lie pruned and polished the diction over and over . Much of it was done in the night hours , when he would say : " I hate to disturb you , but I just ca n't sleep till I get this written down , " My husband gave it to Stockton Axson , George Creel , and one or two others to read . Mr. Creel begged that he be con  --  stituted an agent without pay to get a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not written it with the idea of making money , but just " to get it out of my system . " Mr , Creel was so insistent , however , that he allowed him to take the manuscript . A letter came from " the agent , " saying he had an offer which ran into the thousands , but that if he could shop around he knew he could do better . The publication which had made the offer was one my husband said he did not care to have his name appear in ; so he would not consider it . Neither did he want his work hawked about for the highest bid  --  der . He wrote Mr. Creel to refuse the offer and return the manuscript . My husbaud sent it to the Atlantic Monthly , with which he had had long and pleasant relations , saying that if the editors eared to publish the article they could have it at their regular rate . Mr. Ellery Sedgwick replied that they would be honored to publish the article , and that their regular rate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough sledding meeting expenses , and the first offer would have been a god  --  send . But Mr. Wilson knew nothing of our financial troubles , His burden was already heavy enough and , besides , I knew just what he would do  --  insist on dispensing with one of his nurses , or making some other personal sacrifice . The article was afterward published as a tiny booklet , remarkable now as an evidence of Mr. Wilson 's powers of premonition . Difficult Days Now let me tell another story con  --  cerning unusual powers  --  extrasensory perception , I think the learned people call it . I saw that the more than two years of constant service without a day 's rest was telling on our faithful lit  --  tle Scott . More and more my husband depended on him , finding that Scott could arrange pillows or do other per  --  sonal service more understandingly than the nurses ; so he was always on call , night as well as day . I knew he could not go on indefinitely , and that I must contrive some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new per  --  son was a trial to my husband ; so my problem was a real one . Of course , all the world knew that the President and Mrs. Harding had gone on the trip to Alaska , which was to end so tragically ; but until I picked up the paper one morning , I did not know that the White House was closed for repairs and all the servants off for a month . Here was my answer  --  to get Wilkins , who had been at the White House many years , and who had served my husband often when Brooks , the regular valet , was off duty . Of course , I would never have thought of doing this had Wilkins not been on leave . Wilkins said he would he glad to come and do whatever I wanted . So Scott and Mary left for a two weeks ' holiday . To my dismay I found that , though hetried hard to disguise it , the change in routine completely upset my husband . He became frightfully nervous , could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed me , and caused poor Wilkins to grow nervous too . This made him clumsy , and he became discour  --  aged . Scott had been so faithful and so needed a change that it was not in my heart to recall him . On the fifth day after Scott 's depar  --  ture my husband was looking really ill . I was in his room , trying to do some small services myself . This also irri  --  tated and worried him , for while he loved to have me near he said I was spoiling both him and the servants , and that I ought to make them relieve me and not I them . Poor dear ! He could not see that the one thing I wanted above all else was his comfort . The Death of President Harding This was August 2 , 1923 . I was rend  --  ing aloud to Mr. Wilson when lunch  --  time came , and I rang for Wilkins to place the table , and so on . When the door opened I thought I must be dreaming , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott , " I exclaimed , " what does this mean ? " He said : " Well , madam , I had stayed long enough , so decided my duty was here , and Mary and I are both back on the job . " I never was gladder to see anyone and , indeed , his presence was a bene  --  diction . The nerves that had been cry  --  ing out relaxed ; the head that had ached constantly was eased ; and in a few hours the whole atmosphere seemed to clear . Wilkins was not at fault , and I was more than grateful to him fur coming . It was just that he was differ  --  ent and that , despite fond hopes , my husband remained a very sick man . Later that day I questioned Scott again . This is what he said : " I can only tell you , madam , what happened . I went to bed last night with no thought of returning , and suddenly woke wide-awake , as though someone called me ; and they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home . ' I tried to go to sleep again , but could not . Then I called Mary and told her I was leav  --  ing ou the bus at six in the morning for Washington . She asked what was the matter , and I told her I did not know , except I felt I was needed , and was go  --  ing . So she said she would come too . Really , madam , I expected to find Mr , Wilson ill . " Then he laughed and added : " But I 'm mighty glad to see that is not the case . " This made me wonder if something ominous was hanging over us . The rest of the day passed quietly , however , and when ' I went to my room it was with the thought of peaceful sleep , until a few minutes later when there came from the street a chorus of voices call  --  ing : " Extra ! Extra ! " Then one voice more penetrating than the rest : " Death of President Harding ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him propped up in bed and the night nurse already at the front door for the extra , Like the whole world , we were shocked by this unlooked-for tragedy in San Francisco , and at once tried to express our sym  --  pathy in a telegram to Mrs. Harding . Not until the next morning , when I read in the paper that the servants had been hastily summoned to put the White House in order for the return of the official party , did I connect this event also with Scott 's sudden return , Then the significance was plain . Wil  --  kins having to return to his duties at the White House , Mr. Wilson would have been without an attendant . Thus had some psychic influence , which as yet we do not undeest and , conveyed a message to the humble little servant , who had unquestioningly obeyed . When , OD August eighth , the Presi  --  dent 's funeral service was held at the White House , Mr , Wilson and I , ac  --  companied by Doctor Grayson , drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's lameness we did not go inside , but waited and followed the procession to the Capitol . The summer had been extremely hot and , in spite of my efforts to appear well , everyone told me I looked worn out . The fact is that I felt my splendid health deserting me , and could hardly drag myself around . Among the many friends who seemed concerned about me were Mr. and Mrs. Charles Sumner Hamlin , who begged that I come to them for a visit at Ma ttapoisett , Massachusetts , where the air was brac  --  ing . My husband endorsed their plea and Doctor Grayson told me plainly : " You will break down completely if you do n't go . " With his usual kindness , the doctor said he would come and stay at our house to relieve me of anxiety . At last I yielded . It was the first time I had left Mr. Wilson since illness had changed the current . of our lives in September , 19I9 , except for the one day I went to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington much re  --  freshed , and would I could have found my dear one so . In my absence of only a week , he had grown more and more depressed . In October , Mr. and Mrs. David Lloyd George and their daughter came to tea . He and my husband had an in  --  teresting hour , for while they did not agree very often on public questions their personal relations had been in  --  variably delightful . October also brought two other charming people into our lives  --  Mr. and Mrs. Bernard M. Baruch 's oldest . daughter , Belle , and her close friend , Miss Evangeline Johnson . These girls had been silent devotees of Mr. Wil  --  son , and had worked steadily for the League of Nations through an organi  --  zation known as the Nonpartisan League , which is not to be confused with the former political movement in the Dakotas . Not only did they largely finance the organization but each young woman was at her desk at nine ieat , and worked through until closing time . Two Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come and tell him of a wonderful plan they had to promote in terest in the League of Nations . We asked them to come to dinner and go to Keith 's Theater with us . They arrived promptly , and I shall always recall them as they looked that night . They are both more than six feet in height , and were dressed in velvet evening gowns of the latest Parisian stamp . Long earrings matched the costumes . They were two as stunning-looking young creatures as I ever saw , and so full of native vivacity and charm . Their " wonderful plan " was to have Mr. Wilson speak over the radio on November tenth on The Significance of Armistice Day . This meant a tremen  --  dous effort and a brand-new experience , for radio was then a strange instrument in the hands of ordinary mortals . The time my husband had used it or , I only believe , seen it used was when he had communicated with airplanes in flight a feat that left him awed at the wonder of man 's achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their sweeping enthusiasm for the League ? Those girls stand out like birds of brilliant plumage against a dark sky , for since my brief visit to the Hamlins ' I had seen with clearer eyes how much my beloved invalid was failing . The eye and the mind accustom themselves to daily conditions , whatever they are . but after an interval of absence one sees with a fresh vision . Things hitherto unobserved , or imperfectly observed , stand out with startling clarity in their true significance . So , after my return from the Hamlins ' , I saw that , unmis  --  takably , a decline had set in . I gath  --  ered my resources to arrest it if I could , and , if not , to accept the issue with such fortitude as my womanhood would allow . Ordeal by Air About two weeks remained in which to prepare the radio address . For a well person that seems a long time . For the old Woodrow Wilson it would have been an eternity in which to prepare a. speech . On that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of a single speech prepared in ad  --  vance . Now , alas , failing vitality and eyesight . made the creation of every sentence a problem . At length I sug  --  gested that he abandon the speech , and that I would write to the girls ; but hav  --  ing once put his hands to the plow , it was not in Woodrow 's make-up to turn back . " No , " he said . " I can not disappoint those Mr. ls ; I should feel like the most arrant coward . " He was greatly cheered when Evan  --  geline Johnson , who was in charge of publicity , said she hoped to work up a debate for and against the League of Nations . She wrote to public men everywhere , asking them to take one side or the other , and reported to Mr. Wilson that while pro-Leaguers were legion and ready to help , she could get no one  --  not even Senator Lodge  --  to take the negative . Work on the address continued every day . As when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call me or my brother to write down a sentence while he was resting in bed . Mr. Wilson spoke at 8:30 in the eve  --  ning . When the hour came , he put on his dressing gown and descended to the library . He had always said he could not speak unless he was on his feet , and he stuck to that resolution now , though he had to support himself with a cane . His head ached so that he could scarcely see the words on the typed pages before him . I stood behind the microphone with a carbon copy of the address in my hand , ready to prompt him should he lose his place . For fear that her pres  --  ence would disturb her father , Nell McAdoo , who was visiting us at the time , waited in the next room with the others while he was speaking . Mr. Wil  --  son left the library utterly discouraged , saying to Nell that he had made a perfect failure . We tried to cheer him , but it was no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in low spirits  --  a thing most unusual for him  --  took the ele  --  vator to his bedroom , where he spent a restless night . This worry was needless . The address was splendidly received , one newspaper pointing out that Mr. Wilson had spoken to the largest audience ever reached at a given time by the human voice , // Next morning Mr. Wilson was cheered , but very weary . Armistice Day crowds early began to gather in the street about the house ; bands of loyal supporters of the League marched to the door with banners afloat . Flowers came in baskets and clusters ; telegrams and letters poured in . Though these manifestations comforted my husband , he could not escape the emotional re  --  action such tributes deserve . The strain of the night before made him hardly fit to he out of bed , yet he insisted upon being dressed in his morning coat and gray trousers . When the delegations arrived , Scott handed him his silk hat and his cane , and assisted him to the front door , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glass , of Virginia . I wish I had a copy of Mr. Glass ' moving little ad  --  dress , which stirred my husband deeply . Mr. Wilson 's reply was taken down in shorthand by someone in the crowd , and a transcript laterhanded to me . I reproduce it ver  --  batim , with the parenthetical re  --  marks inserted by the shorthand re  --  porter : hfn.WnsoN1 Sen  --  ator Glass , ladies and gentlemen ( great applause ) : I am indeed deeply touched and hon  --  ored by this extraor  --  dinary exhibition of your friendship and confidence ; and yet I can say without affectation that I wish you would transfer your hom  --  age from me to the men who made the armistice possible . It was possible be  --  cause our boys had beaten the enemy to a standstill . You know  --  if you will allow me to be di  --  dae tie for a mo  --  ment ? " armistice " merely means " standstill of arms . " Our late enemies , the Germans , call an armis  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and it was the boys that made them stand still . ( Laughter and applause . ) If they had nut , they would not have listened to proposals of armistice. 1 am proud to remember that I had the honor of being the commander in chief . A VOICE : The best on earth ! Mn . WILSON ( continuing ) : Of the most ideal Army that was ever thrown to  --  gether  --  pardon my emotion  --  though the real fighting commander in chief was my honored friend , Pershing , to whom I gladly hand the laurels of victory . Thank you with all my heart for your kindness . ( The band played How Firm a Founda  --  tion . ) Ma . Wii. , soN : Just one word more ; I can not refrain from saying it : l am not one of those that have the least anxiety about the triumph of the prin  --  ciples I have stood for . 1 have seen fools resist Providence before , and I have seen their destruction , as will come upon these again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as sure as that God reigns . Thank you . ( Great and long-continued applause . ) He turned and moved slowly back into the house , and thus ended the long crusade . " That we shall prevail is as sure as that God reigns . " As he said it , the fire came back to his eyes , the ring to his voice . There was no premonition that this was to be his last public utter  --  ance . In fact , hope kindled in my breast . Armistice Day behind us , the releasefrom pressure seemed to bring new strength to my beloved patient . its brightened up something like his old self , and took an interest in everything . My young niece , Lucy Maury , came from Virginia for a visit , At Woodrow 's insistence , I had two luncheon parties with ten or twelve persons present . Each day he joined us after lunch , and seemed to enjoy seeing old friends . December twenty-eighth was always a red-letter day , for it was my dear one 's birthday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a beautiful Rolls Royce , with in  --  terchangeable touring and limousine bodies  --  the latter specially built for his needs , with an unusually high top and wide doors . The bodies were painted black with a narrow orange trim  --  the Princeton colors  --  with the monogram W. W. This magnificent gift was wait  --  ing at the door when he came out to take his daily drive . Of course , every one in the house except Mr. Wilson knew about it . Also , the news  --  paper people had got word of it . So when he came out , the car was in the center of photo  --  graphers , reporters and onlookers . The surprise was complete , but a lit  --  tle too much ; for it was almost a shock , which was something I al  --  ways tried to avoid . He was overwhelmed by such a princely re  --  membrance , and his poor nerves set so on edge that he could not restrain his emotion . Among the last letters my hus  --  band wrote were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracious act . Here I want to express our deep gratitude to them again , and to record the other gift these same friends had made to my husband some time before . It was a cheek which covered the entire amount we had spent in putting in the elevator and other necessary changes in the house and for building the garage , driveway and wall . This came at a time when it eased things for us , making my husband 's last days free of financial anxiety  --  for which I can never be sufficiently grateful . In January , Doctor Grayson had planned to go to South Carolina for a week 's shooting with Mr. Baruch . My heart sank , for , though things seemed normal , I had a feeling that a subtle change had taken place , as if the im  --  provement Mr. Wilson had enjoyed in November had spent itself . Each morning , as before , he dictated replies to his mail , but sometimes the letters would lie on his table for days unsigned . I tried to attribute this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ho could hardly see where to affix his sig  --  nature , but actually I knew that the reason lay deeper . I asked the doctor if lie shared that fear . " No , " he said . " If I did , I would not leave him ; and if you want me to give up the trip , I will . But I think you are mistaken . " I wanted to think myself mistaken , and was cheered by what Doctor Gray  --  son said . Still , I could not rid myself of a premonition . How vividly it all comes back ! The doctor , himself fatigued , took my hand in parting and descended the stairs . I went to Mr. Wilson 's room , finding him seated with his head bowed , deeply de  --  pressed . I asked if he felt badly . He said wearily : " I always feel badly now , little girl , and somehow I hate to have Grayson leave . " I said : " He is still downstairs . Let me run and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand to ' stay me . " No , that would he a selfish thing on my part . Ho is not well himself and needs the change . " Then he added , slowly : " It wo n't be very much longer , and I had hoped he would not desert me ; but that I should not say , even to you . " Though the words were like an echo of the death knell that had already sounded in my own heart , I set myself to divert and cheer him . Mr. Wilson spent a restless eve  --  ning on January twenty-ninth . At one A.M. ? January thirtieth  --  he was not asleep , and I asked Randolph to tele  --  graph Doctor Grayson . About that time Scott readjusted our patient 's pillows and he dozed off . On waking after daybreak . he did not leave his room , but had Randolph bring his Communism , Nazism , Fascism  --  I do n't believe they can ever grow in countries that have this way of thinking . We think for ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be led , but not bullied . As to anti-Semitism  --  why , long be  --  fore most people had heard of Zionism , we were getting Doctor Weizmann to meet Mr. Arthur Balfour at our house . We certainly had but one idea in that  --  to help the Jews . Yet I believe I am described now not only as a Hitlerite , but as a violent anti-Jew . Is it . not right to call the fiction outrageous ? How deeply Cliveden must have compromised Will Rogers ! He was a frequent guest at Cliveden , and a much-honored one . He arrived one day with a note from my brother-in-law , Dana Gibson . I realized at once that he was no comedian , but a wise and sagacious thinker . He met peers and poets at our home , and his meeting with J. M. Barrie was not only a high spot in his life but a high spot in Bar  --  rio 's life . We dined and talked  --  at least Will Rogers talked and we laughed  --  until one o'clock . Then this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flat , and there , at Adelphi Terrace , they talked until dawn . That did n't often happen to Barrie . Will Rogers ' humor was just what people here like . It made a good , hon  --  est thing better , but it punctured sham things . How he loved to prick a bub  --  ble with some sharp little wisecrack , and how wo loved him to do it , and how we miss him . Como and look at the Cliveden Vis  --  itor 's Book , which everybody signs . Then you 'll see what the Cliveden Sets are . They 're all there , or nearly all , ex  --  cept the visitors for a day , like the Rhodes scholars , who have been deeply compromised by Cliveden for twenty years ! Like Will Rogers , they have met politicians of all sorts and conditions , writers and artists . I can show you a photograph of Bernard mail , to which he dictated no answers , only indicating the replies my brother should make . On his table lay , un @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigh tfall he was very ill . I called in Doctors Ruffin and Fowler . The next day , when Doctor Grayson reached the bedside , there seemed little hope . We sent for Margaret and Nell . Jessie was in Siam . My dear one lay in a stupor , but when I would leave the room for a mo  --  ment and return , he would lift his hand to take mine . Night succeeded day , and the day the night , the hours ticking on unheeded . Thus passed Friday and Saturday , the first and second of Feb  --  ruary . The nights were chill , but throughout them both knots of men and women remained in the street . Sunday , Feb ? ruary third , dawned radiant and beau  --  tiful . While church bells called people to worship and crowds were kneeling in the street watching and praying , the frail body which had been racked with pain for so many years relaxed , and the enduring spirit took its flight . The peace which passeth all under  --  standing had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lent of a aeries of articles by Mrs. Wilson Shaw receiving them . That 's a Clive-den Set with a purpose  --  that they should meet people like Bernard Shaw . Not sinister enough ? Well , here 's another . Do you remember when Krassin was sent to England by the Soviet. ? E. F. Wise , an Englishman who represented certain Russian inter  --  ests in Britain , happened to he a friend of my husband . He told us that Kras  --  sin was eager to see some financiers , and that he understood Sir Ernest Cassell was willing to meet him under a neutral roof . Would we have them both to meet ? Remember , this was in the days when people in England felt as strongly about Bolshevik persecutions and mas  --  sacres in Russia as they do now about what 's going on in Germany . We told him to bring them along to lunch . What a luncheon it was . Krassin , Sir Ernest Cassell , Lord Robert Cecil and Joe Devlin . How Joe Devlin got there , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an Irish Na  --  tionalist M.P. , a real orator and a great friend . He leaned over and whispered in my ear , one night when I was mak  --  ing a speech in the House , " I do n't know what you are going to say , but I am here to back you . " So at our house Krassin met his capitalist . We enter  --  tained Krassin not because we sympa  --  thized with Communists but because I sympathized with the starving children in Russia . Sokolni koff , too , when Soviet ambassador to England , often came . Be was intensely interesting . He had accompanied Lenin on his entry into Russia , in disguise , to overthrow Ker  --  ensky . Some time ago ? Yes , certainly . But typical . It would be better called a Kremlin Set than a Cliveden Set , would it not ? There are dozens of in  --  stances like it and like the Weizmann  --  Balfour meeting I 've mentioned . What it all means is that we like people with every kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians , Jews , Americans , Germans or British .
