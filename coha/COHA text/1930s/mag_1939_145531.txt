Of the 11,000,000 radio receiving sets in Germany , some 5,000,000 are equipped to receive short-wave broadcasts . Not generally known is the fact that the U. S. has quietly entered the short-wave news propaganda battle . Every day in the week for the past year and a half , NBC 's 25-kilowatt **27;2204;TOOLONG , its power stepped up to the equivalent of some 150 kilowatts by a directional beam antenna , has sent in the direction of Germany 's 5,000,000 shortwave receivers an hour of news , music and Americana calculated to reach Germans between eight and nine o'clock at night . <P> Last week , for example , German listeners could hear in German news that might not otherwise have reached their ears-that Bridget Hitler , the Fhrer 's sister-in-law , had been arrested in London for not paying her rent ; that the U. S. viewed Dr. Schacht 's dismissal with alarm . <P> How widely and cordially these broadcasts are received in Germany was evident last week in a fanmail file prepared by NBC 's International Division for the Federal Communications Commission . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 82 foreign points , 300 to 400 are in German , and 60% of these from inside Germany . A few typical excerpts , translated : <P> From Stuttgart : " Already a small group of listeners has formed which meets regularly and listens to your presentations . " <P> From Munich : " As I was obliged to go to the meeting on Friday . . . against the Jews , I could not listen , but a friend heard your program and told me about it . " <P> From Vienna : " Your news service is objective for our needs , though too short , as we are starved for the truth . " <P> From Prague : " Perhaps we are too much in the middle of things to see clearly , or else we do not learn everything here in Europe . . . . You succeed in giving European news before it is given in Europe . " <P> From Bratislava : " I have seldom heard so much truth about the fate of the Jews as in your broadcast ... we never hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cologne : " We do not hear Cologne as loud . " <P> These communications and other news last week indicated a few hitches in the Reich 's campaign to limit public information . The cheap People 's Radios are designed to receive mainly the medium-waveband domestic German broadcasts . But the popular British Broadcasting Corp . ' s medium-wave news periods are frequently as easily received on People 's Radios . <P> In the short-wave bands , Germany 's most galling intruder is Moscow , which , by some underground means the Gestapo has not yet uncovered , gets German news and broadcasts it back to Germany almost as soon as it happens . In spite of all the Reich 's counteracting efforts , many Germans can and do learn what goes on .
