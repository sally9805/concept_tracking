Few minutes before 4 o'clock one morning last week passengers on the S.S. Havana woke up with a sharp jolt . Three hours later when they were called for breakfast they learned that hard luck had again overtaken the Ward Line . Stuck on a shoal 60 mi. east of Jupiter Light on the Florida coast was the S. S. Havana . While the passengers were eating breakfast Captain Alfred W. Peterson sent an SOS . While they were dancing the rumba in the lounge , he let down an empty lifeboat to test sea conditions . He found them rough . But the Havana was pounding , threatening to break up . Taking no chances , Captain Peterson lowered two boatloads of passengers , lowered four more when the Southern Pacific liner El Oceano arrived . Of the Havana 's 51 passengers , all were saved but one man died of apoplexy in a lifeboat . Fifty of the Havana 's crew of 126 , including the purser , were survivors of the Ward Line 's Mono Castle . <P> Threading its way up Manhattan 's crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Colonial Line steamship Lexington ( New York-Providence ) sighted the freighter Jane Christenson dead ahead , shrilled a warning . Before the Lexington could get out from under the freighter knifed her amidships , nearly broke her in half . While the ship 's orchestra played " Somebody Stole My Gal , " passengers waded across decks knee-deep in water . Tooting furiously , harbor tugs bustled to the Lexington 's side , took off passengers &; crew almost before they knew it . The Lexington sank in ten minutes , took four seamen with her .
