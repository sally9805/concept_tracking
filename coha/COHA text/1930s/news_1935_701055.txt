txt Art Workshop Needs Help . The Art Workshop for Women Workers , one of the pioneers in seeking worth-while occupation for leisure time , is asking for contributions to help It continue its work . Despite efforts to provide resources for constructive leisure , the demand far exceeds the supply needed to brighten the lives bound by dreary monotony , petty annoyances , long hours of work and worry , crowded flats , hall bedrooms and hunger . The girls we help are from the metropolitan area . They engage in every kind of labor , and many of them go long periods without anything at all to do . These girls are imaginative , talented , courageous and undefeated . We believe that they must be sustained through these grim years by some interest beyond the struggle not to starve . Will you help us ? Checks may be sent to me at 309 East Thirty-fourth Street . EDITH MORGAN KING . New York , Feb. 18 , 1935.                  @ @ @
