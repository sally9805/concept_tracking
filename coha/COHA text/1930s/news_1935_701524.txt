txt The protests by various groups of Americans against participation by the United States in the Berlin Olympic Games next year appear to be making an Impression in Germany , and German Olympic authorities are seeking means to counteract this aspect of the American response to the policies of the Hitler - egime . Dr. Theodor Lewald , German chairman of the Olympic organization committee , gave your correspondent the following statement on the German attitude toward the apparently growing unwillingness of many Americans to have anything to do with the coming Olympics as long as they remain scheduled in Berlin . Denies Two Things Are Linked . Denying that attendance at the Olympic Games either by competitors or visitors involved recognition of the Hitler government 's claim to moral equality with other political regimes , Dr. Lewald de-clared : " The Olympic Games have nothing to do with any political or any religious question , irrespective of whether the charges against Germany are false or true . Let me call attention in this connection to a letter I recently received from Count Ballet Latour , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Everybody is at liberty to dislike a regime . The competitors are not even guests of the German Gov-ernment ' " I can assure you on my own account that every guest will be cordially received , irrespective of his opinions . It is an offense to the German people to hear it said that those who differ with us will not be cordially received . Perhaps guests who are hostile to us will be especially welcome , as they will have an opportunity to see what we have done . " As to Jewish guests at the Olympics , I saw plenty of foreign Jews in the streets of Berlin this Summer . Were any of them molested ? The fact is that , irrespective of race questions , everybody will be glad to see the greatest number of foreigners possible attending the games . " Why should Americans distrust the sporting spirit of the German people ? To Jews will be offered the same accommodations as to any one else . In the making of plans for the housing of and caring for Olympic visitors in Berlin there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wo n't Answer on Placards . " As far as anti-Semitic placards and the like are concerned I do not know whether they will be removed during the games or not . I refuse to answer that question . I am not responsible . " You say The Catholic . Commonweal asserts Catholic athletes are being discriminated against . That is not true . There is no discrimina- tion of any sort against Catholic candidates for the Olympics . If it is true that they are not allowed in independent sport clubs that is not discrimination . " Other sport organizations , which are open to every athlete , ask a candidate for Olympic honors no questions about his religion or his politics . For that matter , Catholic athletes of Olympic calibre are never trained in the Catholic Jugendkraft organization , which The Commonweal referred to . They are trained in ordinary athletic clubs , where they have always had the necessary facilities . " The assertion of The Christian Century that Protestants should stay away from the Olympics because the Hitler government is alleged to be attacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answer . Such charges are entirely beside the point . I know nothing about such matters . I do not see what such allegations have to do with the Olympic games . " Dr. Lewald repeatedly asserted he could not see any connection between political or religious questions and the Olympic games . He willingly went into considerable detail , however , in regard to the opportunities of Jewish athletes to compete for places on the German Olympic team . He said : " I have given my word in this matter . If that promise could not be carried out I would not be here . I would have resigned my position . " One Serious Jewish Candidate . " " At present there is only one serious Jewish candidate in Germany for Olympic honors . She is Miss Gretel Bergmann of Stuttgart , high jumper . Unfortunately she has to date placed only sixth among German women high jumpers . " Her record is 1.55 meters . This year 's German women 's record is 1.60 meters . The American record is 1.65 meters . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given nation . On that basis Miss Bergmann 's chances are not very good . " Nevertheless , she has been kept in the group of those who are still receiving special training . She has taken part in four Olympic elimination contests  --  at Hannover , Ulm , Ettlingen and Munich . " As to the German light athletic championships in Berlin last August they had nothing to do with the Olympics . It is true Miss Bergmann did not take part , but that has in no way affected her Olympic chances . " Miss Helene Mayer , fencer , has been invited to become a member of the German team . She has written us that she does not regard herself as a candidate now , but she left the door open by saying she might come over to Germany next Spring from her present home in California . She is only half Jewish . Her mother is a thoroughly German Aryan . " We had two Olympic training courses for Jewish athletes at Ettlingen and at Baden , where our largest and best Olympic training camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The other lasted about three weeks in June of this year . " The candidates who were trained were sent to us by the Maccabee Sports League and the League of Jewish Veterans . Only Miss Bergmann proved to come anywhere near Olympic standards , however . Jewish sport clubs are not ham-pered . They have their own fields and facilities . " It is not discrimination not to have Jews in other sport clubs . Other clubs have a right to choose their own members , do n't they ? Does the New York Athletic Club have Jewish members ? I can tell you that it does not . Were Negroes admitted to all American athletic clubs before the Los Angeles games ? No one even thought of it . All the Olympic committee did or was asked to do was to assure them equality of opportunity in the Olympic elimination contests . " More specific information as to the chances of Jews in finding places on the German Olympic team was received from Werner Gaertner , official press spokesman for the Reich sports leader , Hans von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and training of German Olympic candidates . He built up a nationwide system of training camps , now closed , and developed a corps of coaches , who are still hard at work on Olympic groups in training . These groups I are getting rather small now through elimination contests and are settling down to the final , thorough drilling before the official eliminations next Spring . Speaking for the sports leader , Mr. Gaertner gave the names of several more Jewish athletes who had been admitted to Olympic training groups under special Olympic coaching but who , he said , failed to show sufficient ability to receive serious consideration . He said three Jews had been admitted to the light athletic training group in Berlin . Two of them , Werther and Herzstein , were soon dropped because they showed no evidence of approaching the minimum Olympic requirements , he said . One , Schattmann , is still a member of the training group . He is a sprinter who has not been able to make the time expected of a member of the group . Tells of Eliminations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinter , Dr. Lewin , took part in the Brandenburg Olympic eliminations on June 6 and 7 , but that neither was able to make a good showing . Another Jewish athlete failed to make a satisfactory showing in the 400-meter race , Mr. Gaertner explained . He said the Olympic training group in Leipzig reported the participation in its training group of the Jewish athlete Bernt Meyel , swimmer , during October , 1934 . His best showing , it was reported , was 22.5 seconds in the 100-meter backstroke event . This was declared to be insufficient for an Olympic candidate . Neither Dr. Lewald nor Mr. Gaertner was able to assert that Jewish athletes were receiving the same amount of opportunity for competition with good athletes as non-Jewish athletes . Mr. Gaertner pointed out that there might occasionally be some difficulty in obtaining publicly owned training fields for Jews at convenient hours . He asserted the central sports authorities were not always able to control such matters , but that they frowned on any evidence of discrimination .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
