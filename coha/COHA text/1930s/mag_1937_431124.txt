 | @# The Art of Opening a Conversation Condensed from " Idohenzollerns in America " Stephen Leacock Author of " Over the Footlights , " " Afternoons in Utopia ; " etc. 0 pening a conversation is really the hardest part . It may best be studied in the settings and surroundings of the Evening Reception , where people stand upright and agonize , balancing a dish of ice cream . Here conversation reaches its highest pitch of social importance . One must talk or die . Something may be done to stave it off a little by vigorous eating . But the food at such affairs is limited . There comes a point when it is absolutely necessary to say something . The beginning , as I say , is the hardest problem . Other communities solve it better than we do . In China , conversation between strangers after introduction is always opened by the question , " And how old are you ? " This strikes me as singularly apt and sensible . Here is the one thing that is common ground between any two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far are you in your pilgrimage in life ? Compare with the Chinese method the grim , but very significant , formula that is employed in the exercise yards of our penitentiaries . " What have you brought ? " asks the San Quentin or Sing Sing convict of the new arrival , meaning , " And how long is your sentence ? " There is the same human touch about this , the same common ground of interest , as in the Chinese formula . But in our polite society we have as yet found no better method than beginning with a sort of medical diagnosis - " How do you do ? " This admits of no answer . Convention forbids us to reply in detail that we are feeling if anything slightly lower than last week , but that though our temperature has risen from gi-So to 91-75 , our respiration is still normal . Still worse is the weather as an opening topic . For it either begins and ends as abruptly as the medical diagnosis or it leads the two talkers on into a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day before yesterday , of last month , of last year and the last fifty years . Let one beware , however , of a conversation that begins too easily . This can be seen at any evening reception , as when the hostess introduces two people who are supposed to have some special link to unite them at once with an instantaneous snap - as when , for instance , they both come from the same town .  | " Let me introduce Mr. Sedley , " says the hostess . " I think you and Mr. Sedley are from the same town , Miss Smiles . Miss Smiles , Mr. Sedley . " Off they go at a gallop . " I 'm so delighted to meet you , " says Mr. Sedley . " It 's good to find somebody-who comes from our little town . " " Oh , yes , " answers Miss Smiles . " I 'm from Winnipeg , too . I was so anxious to meet you to ask you if you knew the McGowans . They 're my greatest friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The McGowans - on Selkirk Avenue . " " No-o , I do n't think I do . I know the Prices on Selkirk Avenue . Of course you know them . " " The Prices ? No . I do n't believe I do . You do n't mean the Pearsons ? " " No , I do n't know the Pearsons . The Prices live near the park . " " No , then I 'm sure I do n't know them . The Pearsons live close to the college . " This is the way the conversation goes for ten minutes . Both Mr. Sedley and Miss Smiles are getting desperate . Their faces are fixed . Their sentences are reduced to - " Do you know the Petersons ? " " No . Do you know the Applebys ? " 1Vo . " Then at last comes a rift in the clouds . One of them happens to mention Beverly Dixon . The other is able to cry exultingly - " Beverly Dixon ? Ch , yes , . rather . At least , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the App.lebys speak of him . " And the other exclaims with equal delight - " I do n't know him very well , either , but . I used to hear the Willie Johnsons talk about him all the time . " They are saved . Half an hour later they are still standing there talking of Beverly Dixon , An equally unsuccessful type of conversation is one in which one of the two parties is too surly or too self-important to talk , and the other labors in vain . Mr. Grunt , capitalist , is approached by a willowy lady , " Oh , Mr. Grunt , " she is saying , " how interesting it must be to be in your place . Our hostess was telling me about your shoe machinery factories . " " Honk , " says Mr. Grunt . " I should love so much to see one of your factories . They must be so interesting . " " Honk , " says Mr. Grunt . Then he turns and moves away . Into his little piggy eyes has come a fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something . Yet she is probably as rich as he , and has n't the faintest interest in his factories . Only she is fit to move and converse in polite society and Mr. Grunt is not .
