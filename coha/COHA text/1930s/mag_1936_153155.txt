Motorists have driven around the world but between North and South America no wheel has ever rolled . This fact largely explains the backwardness and poverty of Central America 's seven sequestered little nations . It is therefore with genuine delight and excitement that all of them have looked forward for months to the dedication this week of a modern motor highway reaching nearly a quarter of the 3,200 miles from the U. S. to Panama and filling in one more great gap in the long-awaited Inter-American Highway* ( see map ) . <P> By far the greatest highway project in the world , the Inter-American , if ever completed , will stretch some 12,000 miles from Alaska to Argentina . First proposed at the Fifth International Conference of American states in Santiago , Chile in 1923 , the road immediately fired the imagination of the delegates , was undertaken after enthusiastic endorsement by subsequent conferences and by Presidents Coolidge and Hoover . When the U. S. Congress appropriated $50,000 in 1929 for a reconnaissance survey to start the work in Central America , the first Inter-American Highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has driven the work ahead at a great rate in Central America . <P> In all the Central American countries except Mexico and El Salvador the road-building is largely due to U.S. paternalism and funds . Last November President Roosevelt gave $340,000 to Panama , Honduras and Guatemala for three bridges . U. S. donations to date : some $1,500,000 . In Mexico and El Salvador , however , the roads have been almost entirely national work . This week 's dedication is of the first section so completed in Mexico , the 770 miles from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico , D. F. <P> Already open to traffic for several months , this $20,000,000 road is paved all the way except for one 69-mile gap . To dedicate it , Mexico planned elaborate ceremonies at Nuevo Laredo , including a motorcade of 50 distinguished U. S. , Mexican and Guatemalan citizens traveling over the road . Leaving the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week , Vice President Garner journeyed south to Texas to head the U. S. delegation part way . <P> Tourists taking the new road face a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateau which fills the centre of Mexico . First real town is famed old Monterrey , scene in 1846 of one of the greatest battles of the U. S.-Mexican War , now the centre of Mexican industry . At Ciudad Victoria the tropics really begin . <P> Beyond the Mexican capital , the Inter-American Highway is paved for 165 miles to Tehuacan , after which it gradually degenerates from gravel to dirt to cow tracks . At Chiapas , 185 miles from Guatemala , it halts completely in a maze of mountains . From the Guatemala border to Guatemala City there are 310 miles of road , of which 192 are impassable in wet weather . From Guatemala City there is a fine gravel road for some 200 miles to San Salvador . Beyond lie 87 miles of dry-weather road , which trickles into nothing but a track with occasional good patches as it cuts across a corner of Honduras into Nicaragua . In that country the 214 miles of Inter-American Highway are universally bad . Costa Rica is next , with 356 miles , mostly impassable trail . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-class road for 300 miles to Panama City .
