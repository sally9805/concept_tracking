World affairs lately have made bad news to most people , but they have proved a godsend to the art of David Low . By far the best British cartoonist , Low has been drawing brilliant political cartoons for 36 of his 47 years , but never before have events so played into his dexterous hands , given him a cast of characters so suited to his talents , created so many situations to outrage his liberalist sensibilities , or presented him with so much international double-dealing , blundering and inhumanity to whet the anger that guides his pen . <P> Five years ago Cartoonist Low complained that he did not have an opportunity to do justice to ' ' the vulture glare in Mr. Neville Chamberlain 's eye . " Since that time Mr. Chamberlain has become Prime Minister , and it is hard to see how he could have undertaken policies more offensive to David Low than those he has followed . How offended Low has been was revealed last week when copies of his latest book of cartoons- reached the U. S. from London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London Evening Standard , the book contained an entire new gallery of subjects for Low 's caricatures . But it was principally notable for its merciless caricatures of tall , lean , sloping Neville Chamberlain . <P> For all their acid comments , Low 's cartoons have usually had an owlish , good-natured air that kept them from being really bitter . He presented people as stupid and self-righteous rather than wicked or frightening . For years his satire has been summed up in Colonel Blimp , a pathetically pompous old walrus who inhabits a Turkish bath and periodically sounds off . " Gad , sir , " exclaims the Colonel , in a cartoon called Onward , Colonel Blimp ! " the reason our government is always getting kicked in the pants is that it does n't stand with its back to the wall . " Although Low has carried on systematic campaigns against English politicians in the past , native good nature suffused his drawings of them : Eden always looked timid and well-meaning ; Squire Baldwin crafty and battered but not dangerous ; Lloyd George disarmingly arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was up to no good . There is no such warmth in Low 's caricatures of Chamberlain . His overhanging eyebrows matching the steep curve of his mustache , his cadaverous features alternately harried and self-righteous , he appears in one Low drawing after another as sly , sad and sinister . <P> Low Again shows him in predicaments inglorious enough to bring about the fall of any government . His eyebrows upped with vague uneasiness , he hands a match to Mussolini , who is lighting a bomb under his chair . Perched beside Colonel Blimp on a raging volcano , he spurns Litvinoff 's assistance in putting out the fire : " Sorry , " he says , as the flames roast his rear , " but we do n't want to burn our fingers . " Cartoonist Low is almost as good in his caricatures of General Franco , but his drawings of Franco are in his old mood , give the General something of the air of a small boy unaware of the ruination around him . Only in his drawings of Chamberlain does Cartoonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister gives promise of belonging with the great performances of its type , the war of Thomas Nast against Boss Tweed , of Homer Davenport against Mark Hanna .
