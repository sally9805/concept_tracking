It was Franklin Roosevelt who , in one of his inspired moments , launched the Florida Ship Canal with $5,000,000 of relief money last autumn , day after the S. S. Dixie went aground in the treacherous Florida Keys . But it was Florida 's senior Senator Duncan Upshaw Fletcher , to whom the President owed much gratitude for important New Deal service in the chairmanship of the Senate Banking &; Currency Committee , who got credit for selling the idea at the White House and who became its champion in the Capitol . An inland waterways enthusiast since he went to the Senate in 1909 , the 77-year-old son of Captain Thomas Jefferson Fletcher , C.S.A. , was gravely dismayed when Michigan 's Vandenberg last winter convinced the Senate that his latest &; greatest project was not only useless but dangerous , might turn south Florida into a near-desert . <P> President Roosevelt washed his hands of the Canal and its legislative mate , Maine 's Passamaquoddy Dam . Last fortnight he reconsidered , had Majority Leader Joe Robinson attempt to hitch them to the First Deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a long , earnest plea for the Canal , and his colleagues , largely out of affection for the man who was senior in service to all of them except Idaho 's Borah and senior in age to all except Virginia 's Glass , voted a conditional $10,000,000 for the Florida ditch , though rejecting the Maine dam . <P> In his Washington apartment one morning last week a heart attack brought Senator Fletcher 's life to a swift close . That afternoon the House rejected the Senate 's Canal amendment , 108-to-62 . Next morning the Senate , convening after a recess in honor of its dead colleague , accepted the House 's action without protest , let Duncan Fletcher 's ditch die with him .
