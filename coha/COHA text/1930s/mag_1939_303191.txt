When 1 , 066 tons of munitions exploded at Black Tom Terminal near Jersey City in 1916 , the U. S. was at war with Germany only to the extent of peddling supplies to the Allies . War for the U. S. was still three months away when in 1917 a munitions plant blew up near Kingsland , N. J. , eight miles from the ruins of Black Tom . <P> Whether Kaiser Wilhelm 's Germany was then waging an undeclared war of sabotage on the U. S. was the issue in the famed , long-lived Black Tom and Kingsland Cases . Last week no less an adjudicator than Supreme Court Justice Owen Josephus Roberts found that Germany 1 ) did indeed war by sabotage on the U. S. and other neutrals ; 2 ) caused the Black Tom and Kingsland disasters ( killing three men and a child ) ; and 3 ) by continuously presenting perjured testimony , through its Foreign Office officials tried to hide the proof of its guilt . Therefore , said he , Germany must pay some $50,000,000 in accrued damages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Tom , Canadian Car &; Foundry Co. , which owned the Kingsland plant , and Bethlehem Steel Corp. , maker of some of the sabotaged shells ) . <P> Nazi Germany promptly declined to pay , holding that since its member of the German-American Mixed Claims Commission recently withdrew , Justice Roberts as umpire had no right to make a decision . <P> After twelve years of bickering , with or without Adolf Hitler 's consent , Germany will at last have to pay about 40 on the dollar . In custody of the U. S. Treasury is some $20,000,000 , including property seized from German nationals during the War and income from bonds which Ger many posted as collateral , later defaulted.
