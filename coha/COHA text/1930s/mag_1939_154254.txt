Mamba 's Daughters ( dramatized by Dorothy &; DuBose Heyward from his novel ; produced by Guthrie McClintic ) is not another Porgy . It equals Porgy as a document on Negro dialect and folkways , has some exciting , a few touching moments . But if Mamba 's Daughters took one step more it would topple over into sheer ten-twent-thirt . <P> Mamba 's Daughters tells of big , awkward , blundering , childlike Hagar ( Ethel Waters ) and her passionate , inarticulate love for her daughter , Lissa . Her dream is to make a lady of Lissa . But a misstep on the girl 's part threatens her reputation . To keep it intact the frantic mother commits both murder and suicide . <P> Violent and anarchic the life of Charleston Negroes may be , and fierce and swelling the power of mother love . But the Heywards , using an old sucked orange of a plot , have squashed the pulp all over the stage . Only the mildness of Charleston 's climate keeps Hagar from doing another Eliza crossing the ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waters ' playing of Hagar . In her first dramatic role the famed singer of blues and hotcha shames the play 's bogus tear-jerking with her own deep and honest intensity . More moving than anything in the story are the fugitive looks of love and suffering that every so often cross Ethel Waters ' plain , brown , human face . <P> Three days after Mamba 's Daughters opened , 19 notables-including Actresses Judith Anderson , Tallulah Bankhead and Dorothy Gish , Scene-Designer Norman Bel Geddes , Author Carl Van Vechten , and Publishers Cass Canfield and John Farrar - ran a testimonial in the N. Y. Times : <P> " The undersigned feel that ETHEL WATERS ' superb performance in Mamba 's Daughters at the Empire Theatre is a profound emotional experience which any playgoer would be the poorer for missing . It seems indeed to be such a magnificent example of great acting . . . that we are glad to pay for the privilege of saying so . " <P> The Gentle People ( by Irwin Shaw ; produced by The Group Theatre ) . Usually propaganda plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message of Irwin Shaw 's " Brooklyn fable " is as softly conveyed as a woman 's " Yes . " The Gentle People is the story of two benevolent middle-aged cronies down Coney Island way who love to fish of an evening . A tough young gangster ( Franchot Tone ) extorts " protection money " from them . He seduces one man 's daughter ( Sylvia Sidney ) . At length he demands their savings . Their patience pushed too far , the outraged cronies decide to drown their tormentor . Once they do , everybody becomes as happy as a clam at high tide . <P> Clearly Playwright Shaw 's soft-spoken melodrama is a parable of how the gentle souls of the world , taxed too far , rise up and destroy their oppressors , whether neighborhood bullies or world-famed Reichsfhrers . Put as blithely as Shaw puts it , it is a cheering idea . The trouble is that , while it makes The Gentle People a likable fable , it makes it an absurd play . Humorous mood and melodramatic plot refuse to jell . Murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried out by two good-natured fishermen should be fairly agonizing . Instead it becomes a piece of hanky-panky , awkward , grotesque , unreal .
