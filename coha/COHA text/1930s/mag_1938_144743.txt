Last week the American Medical Association convened in San Francisco and for the first time in that professional body 's 92 years the attending members ( 6,000 ) showed more interest in the business than in the science and art of medicine . Hard times for doctors and patients , changing social attitudes have caused doctors to consider new ways of distributing medical care . Traditionally , the American Medical Association , now representing 109,435 of the country 's 165,163 licensed doctors , stands for decentralized administration and private initiative . The political and economic tendency of the times , however , is toward larger-scale corporate activity , and many a U. S. doctor-with about a sixth of the population living on relief and another sixth also unable to support private medicine-would agree to some sort of medical socialization . <P> Ponderers of this dilemma argued at length with one another in San Francisco last week . Assistant Surgeon General Warren Fales Draper of the U. S. Public Health Service hinted that the Federal Government , which already runs a tremendous medical establishment for soldiers , sailors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others pointed out that 2,000,000 U. S. citizens pay two cents or more a day to insure themselves against hospital bills ; that 15,000,000 citizens who work for railroads , public utilities and industries are already accustomed to having company doctors look after their accidents and ills ; that insurance company agents are itching to sell health insurance to the populace . <P> A large majority of the A. M. A. 's delegates last week held firm to this tenet : that the health of all the people of this country will be protected best if : 1 ) each locality is permitted to adapt one of several endorsed social-economic-medical procedures to its own local needs ; 2 ) doctors are put in charge of all governmental and corporate medical systems . Greatest desideratum to them is a medical Secretary of Health in the President 's Cabinet . Great fear is a nonmedical Secretary of Welfare . <P> Hero . In spite of their preoccupation with strictly professional problems , the delegates paused this year for the first time to salute a colleague for high general medical achievement . To Surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Medal , given for " meritorious service in the science and art of medicine . " Stout , little Dr. Matas , 1895-1927 Tulane professor of surgery , was one of the world 's first doctors to use local anesthetics . He invented a splint for broken jaws and aluminum binders for bulging arteries . He discovered safe ways of operating in cavities of the chest and sure ways of testing for blocked circulation in fingers and toes . Probably his boldest procedure ( the Matas Operation ) is to slit the paper-thin wall of an artery which is about to burst , stitch the walls together like a seamstress taking in a pleat , and leaving the artery with a normal size bore . Last week 's was the most recent of many honors for Dr. Matas . <P> For Patients &; Practitioners the convention , assembled in various special groups , listened to some 275 member physicians reveal what tricks of the profession the past year had turned up :                   @ @
