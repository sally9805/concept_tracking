WHEN Corbett and I returned to America after our European junket , the goose was hanging higher still . As I 've already indicated , with grim details to match , the junket itself was a financial flop . But the American public , whom we had plied with long and judiciously spaced cables about playing the Folies-Bergere in Paris and having the horses taken out of Corbett 's carriage in Dublin , did n't know the grim details . As Corbett 's manager , I struck New York as a conquering hero , besieged by reporters at quarantine , and all the rest of it . Corbett 's new play , A Naval Cadet , a better job than Gentleman Jack , written by the same man , immediately started the money rolling in again , and Corbett was doing even better as an actor , because I 'd hired McKee Rankin , a magnificent director as well as a fine actor , to play the villain in the piece and coach Jim up to a really professional standard . Between A Naval Cadet and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still playing for all it was worth , I was raking in two or three thousand dollars ' clear profit every week , rain or shine . Big money in the 90 's , and nothing to sneeze at in the 1930 's . And the best thing I could think of to do with all this money was use it to renew my frantic efforts to become a topnotch theatrical producer . However snooty the theatrical world might feel about seeing a fight manager elbowing his way into their midst , I figured I would eventually get somewhere , if I could just keep on sluicing money over Broadway . When I was n't buying up failing productions just because they inhabited Broadway theaters , I was investing in new scripts and producing them myself . In other words , I was behaving like a theatrical version of Coal Oil Johnny , making myself a financial godsend to managers with dubious productions on their hands and playing an important role in keeping the national currency circulating . " Stage-struck " is probably the word , but not exactly the classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an old story to me . A veteran of West Coast barnstorming and an eminent producer of Bowery melodramas was hardly the conventional type of amateur angel . It was kudos I wanted for my money  --  uptown-Broadway kudos . Nobody under fifty can hope to comprehend what that meant , how the new play was literally the talk of the town in those days and the mainstay of the papers the morning of ter , how the actors and actresses were lionized socially . Why , Grover Cleveland 's most intimate friends , coming and going at the White House more freely than any politicians in the land , were Joseph Jefferson , Stuart Robson , William H. Crane , Lawrence Barrett  --  actors all . A hostess who landed Edwin Booth for a dinner party was as set up as if she 'd married off her daughter to a prince . Something like that situation exists in certain European capitals even now , but it 's been dead in America these forty years and more . The Evolution of a Syndicate I T WAS already on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , although nobody knew it yet . I was part of the younger generation of producers , along with Belasco and Charles and Dan Frohman , who supplanted the Golden Age of the 70 's and 80 's . But that is n't quite fair . It was n't the youngsters as individuals who did the fatal damage . That was the work of the famous theatrical syndicate , formed during this period , which kept a strangle hold on the American theater clear up to the World War , and eventually fixed it so the strictly commercial manager , the strictly commercial play and the strictly commercial actor dominated the stage . People lamenting the well-known " decline of the American theater " give you every reason for it from the introduction of co-educational drinking to the periodic recurrence of sun spots . As one who saw the syndicate rise and fall , and fought it every step of the way , I can tell you that in my opinion its injection of big business into the theatrical game had more to do with the decline of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its beginnings were queerly casual , way back when Joseph R. Grismer , the man who taught me the theater business , was playing in the Baldwin Theater stock company in San Francisco . The Hayman brothers , AI and Alf , later kingpins in the syndicate setup , were manager and treasurer of the Baldwin Theater respectively . At the same time Dan and Charles Frohman hit town with Callender 's Minstrels ; a troupe which , for a novelty , carried real Negroes instead of blacked-up white men  --  Dan managing the outfit , Charles going ahead of the show as advance man , and occasionally beating the bass drum outside the theater to bring in business . I can see him yet , whaling away at the thing , red-faced , puffing and worried . Neither outfit was doing so well , so Dan Frohman suggested a combination of forces , using the Negro troupe for background in the plantation and steamboat stuff of a production of that old stand-by , The Octoroon . That put the Hay mans and Frohmans in the same boat . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then just inconspicuous New York booking agents , the combination was all set . Steadily , they reached out and reached out , until , within ten years or so , they had every big theater in every big town either sewed up tight or scared to death . It was a neat and versatile layout . The Frohmans were the highbrow , swanky side of the picture , an invaluable front of well-deserved prestige , producing pretentious drama for one market , while the other end of the outfit went in for whipped-cream and spun-sugar musical shows for another market . The Caymans and Klaw &; Erlanger were the real works behind the front , contrasting sharply with the Prohnians ' genuine love of the theater and ability to make plays worth while . It was easy to see what would happen . The same thing was happening at the same time in steel and oil . But steel and oil are straight business . The theater is flesh and blood too . The syndicate 's raids on talent had more than anything else to do with the breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by Augustin Daly and A. M. Palmer . Before long , the syndicate was forcing no less an immortal than Sarah Bernhardt to troupe the United States under canvas iu a circus tent , because she could not get a theater . Mrs. Fiske had to play schoolhouses and lodge halls , as if her company had been a fly-by-night troupe with only six rags of scenery and too broke to pay its way to the next stand . When the AMerican theater does come back  --  as it will  --  hard times will have finally purged it of the syndicate 's legacy of commercialism . I fought and got away with it . Belasco started out by playing ball with the syndicate in New York . But then they turned him loose , and it looked like curtains for a while . He lacked my advantage of having slathers of money rolling in every week  --  and , if the syndicate thumbed you down , you needed the whole United States Treasury to fight back with . I remember coming down Broadway one cold winter night during this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wind , hat pulled down , threadbare overcoat up round his nose  --  an uncomfortably obvious picture of a man down on his luck , with nowhere to go and not so much as one hope to sharpen on another . I said " Hello , Dave " and passed on , stifling my impulse to slip him twenty dollars , because I knew there was n't a chance in the world he 'd take it . Presently , however , he acquired Mrs. Leslie Carter , got some backing on the strength of her prospects , and snaked himself out of the swamp in spite of the syndicate . After her tremendous triumph in The Heart of Maryland , he went on to become the greatest producer of his time . Bout With Dramatic Critics SY OWN first production on my own hook  --  in a . VI Broadway theater , which was the only point in it  --  was a play called The New South , for which I brought Grismer and his wife , Phoebe Davis , in from the Coast . James A. Herne was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grismers had brought with them from the Coast a youth named Holbrook who had a two-line walk-on at twenty-five a week . The only profit I ever derived from The New South was my first lesson in what not to do about dramatic critics . AU of them  --  Nym Crinkle , Willie Winter , Alan Dale , Acton Davies  --  slammed it galley-west in their various styles . To a man fresh from the rough-and-tumble methods of the prize ring , that kind of treatment meant fight . I took big ads in the papers , quoting the worst reviews  --  an embarrassment of riches  --  and daring the public to come and see for themselves what a raw deal a splendid play had got ; money back if not satisfied . But nobody bothered to take advantage of what I still think was a highly sporting offer . The theater was costing me $3000 a week , and it was a good night when we took in more than $100 at the box office . But I kept The New South running till the loss was more than $30,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of them . But I did n't even get that satisfaction for my money . They paid no attention whatever . This business of critic-hailing is one of the surest signs of a tenderfoot theatrical producer . Some never do get over it , and we 've recently had the spectacle of United States congressmen swatting newspaper reviewers over the head with a stuffed club as a way of getting into the headlines . Everybody does it when he starts . I learned my lesson after some ton years of trying to sweep back the sea , which is a pretty good record for the event . For there 's really no more point in hollering about bad notices than there is in firing a shotgun at a Kansas tornado . Nobody can play roulette forever without hitting a winning number now and again . I saw the Boston opening of A. M. Palmer 's production of Trilby , Du Maurier 's famous novel , took the midnight train and walked into Palmer 's office the next day with a proposition . " You 've got a freak attraction there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up quick or not at all . I want the road rights , leaving the six key cities for yourself . How much ? " I knew the old gentleman was pretty near bankruptcy and ready money would go a long way with him . He coughed , looked down and pulled his whiskers . " That will cost you some money , young man , " he said . " Something like $20,000 in advance " ? cough ? " on 20 per cent of the gross . " Such terms as that were unheard of in the 00 's . But I had all the cash in the world , so I wrote him out a check and walked out , leaving him gaping at it and obviously wondering if any check that size could possibly be good . In no time I had six road companies taking Svengali and his beautiful stooge all over the smaller places in the United States . Palmer 's big-city company coined money , but the spots I played did n't cotton at all to Svengali 's hypnotic wiles and , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pup again . But the string I had on Palmer 's further exploitation of Trilby saved the day . When he wanted to take his company to San Francisco , he had to play a route all the way from St. Louis west to get there , and I owned the rights every step of the way . He had to cut me a large slice of pie to get me to bow out in his favor . And then , when I discovered that Trilby was not copyrighted in England and the colonies , the old gentleman had to give me 50 per cent of the gross in Australia to keep me from taking my own company out there , playing Svengali myself . First and last , I got some $50,000 out of my $20,000 investment . Threatening to play Svengali myself was no bluff . I 'd already been doing it , since I was still a good trouper in emergencies . Shortly after they went on tour , one of my road companies wired me from North Adams , Massachusetts , that Lawrence Hanley , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . What to do ? I hopped a train and found that Hanley was definitely out of the running , leaving the company and worried about the $200 he owed me in advance on salary . " Never mind the money , " I said ; " I 'll settle for your wig and whiskers . " Then I humped myself back to New York on a midnight train to get a wardrobe  --  Hanley was double my size and his version of Svengali 's shabby frock coat fitted me like a nightshirt .. All the way to New York and all the way hack to Poughkeepsie , the next stand , I was studying up the part . Without years of training as a hair-trigger utility man in barnstorming companies , I never could have got up in it in time . While waiting for a change of trains at a Godforsaken junction at two in the morning , I was hammering away at it , walking up and down the platform , script in hand , working by the light leaking through the station agent 's office window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage truck and spouting : " It is the morgue . Be careful , my Trilby , you come not back to sleep on one of those marble slabs . " Presently the station agent came popping his head round the corner to see what all the excitement was . When he went away again  --  apparently in some alarm  --  I was much too busy to pay any attention . I came to out of the fog of Svengali 's sinister personality only when a policeman arrived to arrest me as a dangerous lunatic . But in spite of the law and lack of time , I threw a Svengali in Poughkeepsie that still cheers me to think of . It 's a fine , fat part and the chief reason why Trilby has been movieized probably more than any other story in the world . Outwitting Frohman T STILL get some cream out of it even now . A little I later I sank $1500 buying the rights to the acting script when Paul Potter , its author , needed cash . His script is the only actable play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , every time they make another movie out of the old campaigner , they have to settle with me . No . I did n't always get stuck in these experimental days . I got cash as well as satisfaction out of paying off Charles Frohman for a fast one he pulled on me once . My chance came when a one-act play called The Cat and the Cherub turned up on the variety bill at Hammerstein 's Olympia  --  they tore the old place down just the other day  --  with Holbrook Blinn in the leading role . It was a nice little thing , the first piece ever to use the business of propping a dead man up against a wall so naturally that the cop walks by swinging his club without noticing anything wrong . That gag has since been developed in all kinds of directions , including the Apache dance-hall business where the murderer fools the law by dancing with the girl 's corpse . A couple of weeks after The Cat and the Cherub came to town , Frohman and Belasco  --  this was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called The First Born , using the same corpse-against-the-wall notion . It was a better play and had prior claim on the idea . They announced that they would immediately send a First Born company to London . I thought fast and worked quick . Without announcing anything . I bought The Cat and the Cherub and loaded it , actors , scenery and all , on a boat sailing four days before Frohman 's company was try leave . It opened in London as a curtain raiser on the Saturday evening before The First . Born was to ( Continued on Faze 44 ) open on Monday . The corpse made it an instantaneous smash success , while The First Born fell flat as a pancake because the ground had been cut from under it . Inside a week , Frohman 's company was sailing back home , while The Cat and the Cherub stayed on for months , paying me ? 150 regularly every week , and , incidentally , making Blinn so conspicuous on the London stage that his subsequent brilliant career can be said to have started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for news from London to begin to consider the venture worth while . That came only a few hours after the boat sailed , when rumors that The Cat and the Cherub was on its way to London brought Belasco into my office , tearing his hair and whooping about how I could n't do that ; I must n't do that . I let him rave as long as he wanted , and then had them take him away , indicating that I thought Frohman could probably figure out why I 'd done it . After all , I was young then , and given to pointless antics of kinds other than critic-baiting . The theatrical syndicate was n't the only sign of changing times in the amusement world . Nobody was exactly taking the movies seriously , but they had just barely come into existence and were feeling round for commercial possibilities . It was still the period of the Edison Mutuscope  --  a device you can still find in less-progressive shooting galleries , consisting of a slot machine with the customer turning a crank to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The early Mutuscope called for plenty of violent action to cover up the flicker , and prize fighting meant action ; so , presently , the Kineograph Company , Edison 's outfit , was approaching Corbett and me to do a fight for them  --  six one-minute rounds . Edison 's Movie Technique So here we were , out at the Edison laboratory near Llewellyn Park , New Jersey , pioneering in the movie business . To stand up with Corbett they 'd hired a large tenth-rater named Peter Courtney , supposed to he champion of New Jersey or something . Corbett could have flattened him in ten seconds fast asleep , but , with careful rehearse ' , he could be made to look like a fighter  --  and we rehearsed as religiously as the chorus of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera . Edison ran that end of it himself . He did n't know much about fighting and still less about dramatic effects , but I was thoroughly impressed by the way this straight scientist , absolutely inexperienced in such things , knew his way around by sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , sitting there with his hands folded and his mouth pursed up , had the fundamentals of movie technique worked out on his own hook twenty years before Hollywood was anything more than a sandlot suburb . " Keep your face to the camera , , Jim . . . . Back him round so your face is to the camera . . . And now , this round , remember you come in from the side . . . . Hold up that right-hand punch till you get him out in the middle . . . . We do n't want your back ; give us Courtney 's back . . . " And by the same token , the good movie tradition of taking forever to get anything done also got its start with this job . We wore two solid days getting a picture of those six minutes of fighting . That six minutes of fight , recorded on limber little cards , went all over the world . The Klondike and Australia and Capetown and Suez put coins in slots to see this lively record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plausible-looking but clumsy fighter in the scrub-pine back country of New Jersey . The ? Kineograph Company made pots of money out of it , which began to sell me on the idea of movies  --  and besides , it intrigued my imagination to think of what you could probably do with the things . It fitted very neatly , because it was prize-fight films that brought in the first real money the movies ever knew . I guess that 's my lead into the Fitzsimmons fight . There 's enough low comedy scattered through it to keep it from being too melancholy to talk about . Fitzsimmons on the Trail By this time , Bob Fitzsimmons ' relentless campaign to force Corbett into a fight bad reached a point where there was no longer any possibility of saying no . Corbett 's funny feeling about Fitz had grown stronger every day since he 'd won the title . I repeat it was n't fear in any ordinary sense  --  just a loony , illogical repugnance to the idea of getting into the ring with him . Fitz was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dangerous enough for anybody with Corbett 's speed to be scared of . We tried to stall him off and keep the public diverted from our own procrastination by making Fitz fight a new Australian heavyweight named Steve O'Donnell whom we were more or less sponsoring . We matched O'Donnell against the aging Jake Kilrain with the idea of building him up to where Fitzsimmons would have to fight him to justify a match with Corbett . A good idea , but Kilrain spoiled it by licking the tar out of O'Donnell . The old fellow was shaky and feeble , but he knew a lot about fighting still , and , what 's more , he had John L. Sullivan in his corner , abusing and bullyragging O'Donnell all through the fight . With more experience , O'Donnell could have taken the ragging and gone on to win , but , being green , he lost his head and the fight . There was a good deal of excuse  --  Sullivan was a savage performer with his tongue and had put his heart in his work . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met O'Donnell , Corbett and me in a hotel lobby , he started the tongue lashing all over again . I had to get between them and tell Sullivan to shut up , with appropriate verbal embroidery . That was n't so risky as it sounds , perhaps . Although Sullivan was down and out , he could still have knocked me across the lobby with one tap , no doubt . But then , as now , fighters are afraid of out-of-the-ring brawls with nonprofessionals . In plenty of cases , fighters have been killed in such fracases , and the killers have been acquitted ; and , in any case , courts and public both would be whole-heartedly against ( Continued en Page 48 ) // ( Conitnuald from Pogo 44 ) the professional bruiser who had beaten up a civilian . Why , when I mot Fitzsimmons and Martin Julian , his manager , to sign articles for the Corbett fight , Fitz started abusing Corbett , and I had to tell him that , if ho did n't pipe down and tend to business , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had refused to attend the meeting at all  --  that was the way he felt about Fitz . I left the place ahead of them  --  it was the office of the old Now York Herald , at 35th and Broadway  --  but I was n't going to let that look like running away . So I hung 2ouud the door on the sidewalk and waited for them  --  made both Fitz and Julian walk out and look me in the eye as they passed up a chance to do something about our little conversation upstairs . We were in a grudge fight and no mistake this time . The grudge fight is one of the oldest gags in boxing  --  as badly overworked as " Hello , ma , I 'm all right and I 'll be right home " over the ringside microphone . But there was no fictional ballyhoo about the way Gentleman Jim and Ruby Robert felt about each other . Half in dread , half in contempt , Corbett was ragingly eager to show Fitzsimmons that he had bitten off more than he could chew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think Fitz was even worse . When the two men accidentally met on the road while training for the fight in Carson , it was Corbett who offered to shake hands and Fitz who refused : " I 'll shake hands with you in the ring , but nowhere else , " he said . It was the public that had forced us into this fight . It seemed as if the whole world was hollering for Corbett to stop play-acting and give Fitz a chance at the title . But , when we did sign articles , it looked as if there was n't a state in the Union that would let us stage the fight . We were n't going to try Florida again in our right minds . Louisiana had recently repealed the law permitting boxing , which had been passed specially for the Sullivan fight . And nasty business involving fake matches and men killed in the ring had soured all the other likely spots . For a while the only offer we got was a bid from the Klondike  --  Dawson City . Seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas , a side partner of Colonel Bradley , of Palm Beach and Kentucky Derby fame , persuaded us that he could fix it so we could hold the fight in Texas . That sounded all right , and his offer of a $40,000 purse , with an extra $5000 for training expenses , was satisfactory , so both fighters headed for Texas and started training . But we had n't been there a week when the governor , a man named Culberson , told us politely , to wit , that wo were in the wrong pew . He hated to spoil any arrangements we might have made , but there were going to be no prize fights in the sovereign state of Texas . We replied , as we had in Florida on a similar occasion , that , since Texas had no antiboxing law , we did n't see what was going to stop us from fighting . That led to a long and complicated newspaper controversy about it , and I must admit that Stuart put up some brilliant arguments on our side . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , when properly cornered , he got out by calling a special session of the legislature , which cost the state some thousands of dollars , to have an antiboxing statute passed to order . In a way , it was nattering to have a special session called just to keep two men from taking a poke at each other . But it was also unhandy when you had lots of potential money tied up in the thing . Stuart 's next move was to persuade Hot Springs , Arkansas , that a heavyweight championship fight would attract a lot of money to the place . Arkansas also lacked au antiboxing law , but by this time we knew that was n't to be counted on ; the moral backing of Hot Springs would probably prove a lot more . Corbett and I moved over there immediately . Fitzsimmons and company stayed in Texas . I did n't like the look of that , for two good reasons . For one thing , I suspected that Fitz had been getting cold feet and was probably only too willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the other , both Stuart and Fitzsimmons had been feeling unhappy about the terms of the agreement , which gave me and Corbett all revenues from the movies that were to be taken of the fight , as a bonus for condescending to sign . As the Corbett-Courtney film was already demonstrating , there was a lot of gravy in pictures , and their only chance of getting in for a cut was to get the present agreement abrogated . Hot Water at Hot Springs Arkansas also was infested with governor trouble . With great promptness , the governor announced that there would be no fight in Arkansas . Hot Springs , rallying to our defense , threatened to raise a force of vigilantes to surround the town and keep out the militia d the governor tried to stop the proceedings . The center of this scheme was the sheriff of Hot Springs , a formidable citizen named Reb Houpt , who had the reputation of having killed sixteen men . He sounded like a useful ally , but he did n't remain an ally long . The governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operate in stopping the fight or get thrown out of office . Houpt immediately promised to fetch Corbett to Little Rock , the capital , inside a week . That pretty well settled our hash , and at that point Fitzsimmons showed where he stood by crossing the Arkansas border at Texarkana and voluntarily giving himself up to the law . He might well have been leery of actually getting into the ring with Corbett . Jim was in the pink of condition , as fine as I ever saw him , and the chances are all that , if the fight had come off as scheduled , Fitz would never have been champion . of the world . When we arrived in Little Rock , we found Fitz already there in the custody of , Jesse Hurd  --  the only man in Arkansas who was said to have more notches on his gun than our Mr. Houpt . Take it all round , it was a touchy situation , and called for counting ten before you so much as dared brush your teeth . But I got too mad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail for merely making an injudicious crack about the state 's attitude toward boxing . I got on the telephone and made some pretty strong remarks about this in the process of reminding the governor that he 'd promised all of us protection if we 'd come to Little Rock peaceably . Evidently the governor used my protest to bawl Hurd out with and quoted some of my remarks . When I was down at breakfast the next morning , Hurd appeared , his hand in his coat pocket and a look on his face that soured every pitcher of cream in the dining room . He walked over to where Fitz was sitting and asked him to point out this fellow Brady . As Hurd came over to my table , I could see his fingers working on some largo object in his pocket . The only sensible thing I could think of to do was to put both my own hands on the table , palms up . " Your name Brady ? " he asked . I said yes . He looked down at my empty hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed piously on his plate and there was a distinct lull in the conversation . If I so much as twitched an ear , I expected Hurd would plug me and claim self-defense , after the immemorial custom of bad-tempered sheriffs , so I sat still as a waxwork . " Grwamph ! " he says , way down in his chest , and then walked away . It was curious to hear the way conversation picked up again and knives and forks began to clink against the plates as soon as his back was out of sight . As for me , I was still breathing a little short by noon , when we were due at the governor 's office to be told where to get off . Houpt escorted Corbett and me over to encounter the majesty of the state of Arkansas . We were ushered into a highly unpretentious room in a bungs , - low kind of building where Hurd , Fitzsimmons , Julian and the governor were already expecting us . We snubbed Fitz and looked at the governor instead ; he was well worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have made a good living playing old Southern colonels of the mint-julep school  --  long and lean and white-haired and soft-spoken as the gurgle of Bourbon out of a jug . The tenor of his remarks was in dramatic contrast to the mellifluity of his speech . He produced a long black cigar , stuck it . in his face to complete the picture , chewed it for a moment in silence , and then let us have it . The Governor Plays His Ace " Gennehmen , " he said , " I 'll lay my cahrds on the table . I do n't intend to follow the example of my brotheh goveneh in Texas and put the state of Ahkansaw to the expense of a special seession of the legislatyuh to outlaw boxing within ouah bawdubs . I have a simpleh method in mind , Mr. Fitzsimmons , " he said , letting his eye rest casually on Fitz 's red head , " Alive placed you in chahge of ouah estimable citizen , Mr. Jesse Huhd . . . .

Well , you 'd have thought the plague had broken out in Hot Springs . I never ( Continued on Pogo 48 ) THE SATURDAY ( Continued from Page 40 ) saw a crowd kick up so muds dust to get out of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even took the precaution of going to the railroad station through side streets . That ruined the fight . We declared the agreement off ourselves , considerably to the relief of both fighters , and went back to the theater hoping that the public would give us credit for having made a good try to give them a run for their money and failed through no fault of our own . But this Arkansas mess had got a lot of publielty and that had served only to sharpen the public appetite for the fight . By hook or crook , we had to come through or Corbett 's highly valuable prestige , which was coining us money in the theater , would suffer . Once again we started the weary , worrisome business of angling for a location . It was n't till after eight months of finagling that Stuart managed to persuade a good-natured German who was governor of Nevada that he ought to invite us officially to come and have it out at Carson City . I did n't like the layout worth a cent , but , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do but agree . Any way you looked at it , it was had medicine . We 'd had Corbett in fine shape and right up to fighting edge . Now he 'd slacked off again without having a chance to fight . That was bad psychology under any circumstances , and particularly unfortunate in view of the jittery way he felt about Fitzsimmons . And that was n't the only way we missed the boat this trip . The new agreement put the whole shebang in Stuart 's hands , movie rights and all , leaving only 50 per cent of all profits to be split , half to Fitz and half to Corbett . In other words , the new deal left us without a face card in our hand . Corbett 's Psychological Load But we had to play the round out , so we trekked to Carson and set up training quarters . As soon as we got there , Corbett began to show signs of a dismaying change . Day by day he grew crankier and jumpier and harder to handle . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad for Billy Delaney , the third member of the triumvirate that had trained Corbett since before the Sullivan fight . The only person who could do anything with Corbett was Judge Lawler , an old friend of his from the Olympic Club in San Francisco , who had turned up in camp to renew the friendship . The judge meant well , but he knew very little about boxing  --  nothing at all compared with a professional trainer like Delaney  --  and it was only luck when his suggestions made any sense at all . Corbett had already lost his fight two weeks before he ever stepped into the ring . The psychological load he was carrying was bad enough without adding the handicap of inadequate training . In my eagerness to keep Jim in fine mental fettle , I 'd accidentally added another ton or so to the psychological load . Ever since our first exhibition tour , Corbett 's mascot had been a mutt collie named Ned who had picked Corbett up in Boston , taken a terrific shine to him and refused to leave him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned , who had been part of the picture surrounding both the Sullivan and Mitchell fights , was a symbol of luck to him . Besides , Jim loved him for his devotion and his EVENING P057 bravery  --  that dog would fight anything on two or four legs and kill or get killed . When we went to Europe , we left Ned behind with John W. Norton , the St. Louis actor manager . As I went West to join Jim at Carson , I picked Ned up and took him along as a surprise . I did n't know , you see , that Harry Corbett , Jim 's brother , had already bought Jim a beautiful thoroughbred collie and installed him at the Carson camp . The new dog was a fine specimen , bright and affectionate , and Jim was crazy about him . When Ned and I arrived unannounced at the training quarters , we found Corbett sitting with the new dog in his lap . Ned did n't even stop to say hello to Corbett . He left the ground in a savage spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbett and I could tear them apart . Obviously , there was going to be murder if the two were allowed together , so Ned was relegated to the kitchen , while the new dog went to sleep at the foot of Corbett 's bedNed 's traditional post  --  in the cottage across the road . Rn Omen of Defeat I do n't know how it happened . We thought we locked the kitchen up tight . Anyway , it was still winter in Carson , several inches of snow on the ground , . the temperature well below freezing , and the next morning we found Ned frozen to death with his chin on the doorstep of Corbett 's cot-tage . That was a fine omen to start training on . You can imagine how it affected Jim just , when brooding was the worst thing in the world for him . It was a goad ten days before he began to come out of the gloomy fit he was thrown into . But we trained on as well as Jim 's new brand of temperament permitted . About the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring with a new sparring partner named James J. Jeffries , a rugged youngster whom we 'd imported from San Francisco to make Corbett work hard . The affair could n't be stopped now . The big arena where the fight was to take place was nearing completion . When the great day came , there was n't a soul in our camp who did n't feel way down in his boots that the end of the world was right round the corner . Nobody would have admitted it to himself , Corbett least of all , but he was n't in shape and , however they might have stacked up with each at his peak , we all knew Bob Fitzsimmons was nothing to fool with . We were the glummest of parties when we reached the arena . But there was a certain amount of humor available , furnished largely by ex-Senator John J. Ingalls , of Kansas , and Mrs. Fitzsimmons . The senator was there because the Hearst papers had hired him to report the fight from the intellectual angle , whatever that was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special stories was already started then , with even less attention paid to the pertinence of the name to the event covered . So here was the senator , a very famous man in his day , parked in a ringside box , silk hat , frock coat , carnation in the lapel , stiff as a poker and solemn as an undertaker , trying to make sense out of a spectacle as foreign to his sober-minded world as a voodoo ceremony in the Haitian bush . Just to make sure ho would n't make any sense out of it at all , some inspired functionary had planted him in the same box with Mrs. Fitzsimmons . She March 7 , IPse had been Rose Julian , sister of Fitz 's - Tanager , and worked with her brother variety turn , tumbling and acrobatics , in the cellar theaters that studded old San Francisco . In her stage days she 'd been as handsome as a debutante Brunhild and some three times as husky , The senator looked a trifle put out when , as the proceedings began , this beauteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began to holler  --  and she began with the bell and never stopped till the last of the ton counts that lost Corbett his title  --  the senator huddled away into a far corner of the box . But there was no getting away from her as she jumped up and down and waved her arms and pounded the rail . " Work on him , Bob ! " she cried . " Make him stand up and fight , darling l . . . " and so forth , and so on , with the spectators all over the arena roaring with laughter and cheering Mrs. Fitz . I 'd rather not go on from there . It 's not only that the Carson fight has been described again and again . It 's even more that the recollection of how it felt to see Corbett struggling on in a sort of parody of his former brilliance , with all the marrow gone out of his bones , is something I do n't like to think of yet . He was a beautiful fighter , even at his worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jab and feint and stay away and cut your man down to size  --  the old formula , but the zip was lacking , even when , in the sixth , he landed clean and laid Fitz on the floor . Fitz was cool enough to take the full nine seconds to come back in , and managed so well the rest of the round that Corbett wore himself out trying to finish him off . It was that last minute or so of the sixth that told me the whole story . From then on , the best I could do was borrow a bottle of whisky from the man next to me  --  the first time in my life I ever appreciated the taste of straight whisky  --  and consume it in frantic gulps with no more effect than if it had been so much soda pop . Gentleman Jim Steps Down And I needed the effect the worst way when Fitz landed the famous solar-plexus punch with all the power of his Herculean torso that looked so queer balanced on his skinny little legs , and Corbett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost erect for a moment and then collapsed like a suit of old clothes . I 'd been afraid of defeat , but now that it had come , I did n't believe it . I could n't believe that Gentleman Jim , the only heavyweight I ever saw who was a perfect balance of skill and courage and strength , had actually been counted out . And if it was bad for me , think what it was for Corbett . The knockout had n't put him out  --  just paralyzed him temporarily  --  and , after the bell , he got up and , mad with rage , tried to go on fighting the winner . Take it all round , it was just as bad a mess as I had feared at the beginning . Our 25 per cent of the admission profits did n't do any more than pay training expenses . The moving picture of the fight , the first movie ever to get really big dough , took in three-quarters of a million . But by the time it reached us our quarter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got if the fight had taken place in Arkansas . Corbett went West , bent on retirement . I went East , as sick as a dog .
