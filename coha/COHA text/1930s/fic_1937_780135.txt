 | " Let 's not play any more , " Lucy Lee said abruptly . " I 'm going outside . " Dikranov stood up and bowed formally . " Shall we go out on the porch , Rosemary ? " " No . . . thanks , " Rosemary said quickly . Her voice was strained , almost harsh . Then she caught herself and said quite naturally , " You stay and talk to Dad . I 'll go out with Lucy Lee . Come on , Grace . " We went , Bill Chetwynd coming with us . From the porch we could hear the sudden burst of applause that went up , and in another minute a saxophone blared . We knew that Rex Brophy 's Band Wagon had arrived . I looked at my watch . It was just eleven . Rosemary and I ran across the lawn . Lucy Lee had disappeared . Even when the lightning flashed so that we had a momentary picture of the entire scene we could n't see her white little figure in it . We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it bouncing on the dark waves , and on the dock two other figures in white flannels and dark jackets , running down , shouting . " Is her boat out ? " Rosemary whispered . " Unless they brought it in tonight . They all thought the storm had died down for good . " We picked our way down the rock steps aided by the flashes of white light . Not that we needed it . Either of us could have gone from one end of April Harbor to the other in the dark with our eyes closed . Suddenly , in front of us , was Lucy Lee , sitting on a step . Just sitting there .  | " What 's the matter , Lucy  --  hurt your ankle ? " Rosemary asked quickly . Lucy Lee shook her head . " Go on down . I 'm all right . " Rosemary went on . I stayed . " What 's the matter , Lucy Lee ? " She laughed . . . a ghastly tear-stained laugh . " I 'm just being a silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I sat down beside her . " Look , precious , " I said . " You are being a silly fool . It 's all right if you ca n't help it , but for Heaven 's sake do n't let everybody on the place know it . " She did n't say anything , just sat , a white-faced stricken child , with a thunderstorm playing havoc with her life . " I 'll go back up , " she said suddenly . " Mother wants to go home early anyway . Tell Andy , will you . Not that he 'll care , but it . . . sort of keeps up tie joke . " WATCHED HER LONG WHITE DRESS DISAPPEAR UP the hill , and went down to the float . A drop of rain hit my shoulder , and another . It was dark , but I could make out Andy with his flashlight , trying to untie a motorboat down by the No. 4 landing . I did n't see Rosemary or Jim . Not until another flash of lightning  | came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been easier the next day , and a lot easier when the State 's Attorney began asking me questions . I do n't imagine either of them had realized that meeting in the dark there where they 'd spent so many intimate growing-up years would simply annihilate in one mindless instant all the bitterness and tragedy of those intervening years . I ran on to the end of the pier where Andy Thorp was . He had given up trying to release the motorboat and was standing there dully , staring out at the tiny light bobbing up and down where Sandra and George Barrol were . " No use , " he mumbled . " She can handle it if anybody can . I should have gone with her . " " She wo n't try it , she ca n't ! Not in this sea . " " She 'll go , all right , " he said . " She 's a fool ! " " I guess she thinks Rosemary 's trying to get him back , " he said doggedly . " He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " And I 'm not saying I do , " he went on . " Well , " I said , " of course , there is Lucy Lee . " " I 'm not saying anything about Lucy Lee . I guess it 's not her fault she 's sort of all washed up . " It was n't a particularly appropriate time , of course , to go into Andy 's domestic and emotional difficulties . Not with Jim pounding along the dock towards us and Sandra and George out there in the squall , lightning flashing and the rain beginning to come down  | in torrents . The trouble with Andy is one of the great troubles with American colleges . He 'd been one of those All-American everythings , from marbles to football , to whom just the mere fact of being out of college for a couple of years is deflation enough for one " ordinary twenty-five-year-old ego . Andy got the depression slapped on for good measure . Whenever I look at him , I hope my sons will be bandy-legged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will escape the dreadful letdown and go into the world and not onto it . " You 'd better put this on . " He pulled an oilskin coat out of the motorboat and put it over my head . Jim was coming . He was alone . Even then I do n't think any of us thought Sandra was in any real danger . " You going out , Jim ? " Andy shouted through the rain . " No . " His voice was curt to the point of rudeness . " I 'll stand by if she needs help . Rosemary 's gone to have ' em put the lights on . Sandra can manage a boat better than we can . " He came back towards us . " That sounds pretty damn offhand to me , " Andy said . He was trying hard to control a sudden anger . " If she was my wife ? " " You would n't even be down here , " Jim said angrily . Which was the first time I knew he had even noticed Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ? I guess everybody  | here knows how you 'd feel about it if she never got back in ! " " Andy . . . Jim ! " I cried . " Shut up , both of you ! " I put my hand on Andy 's arm . He shook it off angrily . " You keep out of this , Grace ! " he snarled . They stood there face to face , staring at each other for an instant in the crashing storm and the rain and the lightning . Then from above the twin beams of the great searchlights flashed out across the rain-lashed inlet . I did n't look for Sandra just then . I was looking at Jim . His tortured face was turned towards the water . " So you 'd be free . . . " Andy said deliberately . Jim turned back . " Steady , " I said . " Andy does n't know what he 's ? " " The hell I do n't . You think I 'm too dumb to know what 's going on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here for ! " I do n't think I 'd have stopped it if I could . Jim took one swift step . His fist shot out . Andy 's knees buckled like an accordion and down he went . He stayed there motionless a second , more surprised than hurt , and then leaped to his feet . Jim Gould stood square to meet him , back to the bay . Then suddenly across the rain-driven water came a high-pitched scream of terror , and with it a man 's voice shouting , " Help ! Help ! " We looked . A white sail , half unfurled , dipped and pitched crazily in the wind and rain . The jib tore  | se . I saw Sandra 's slim figure , arms up , caught ddenly by the falling mast , careen and disappear . We stood staring for one instant . Then Jim tore , ff his coat and dived . It 's probably wrong to say that dive could be impersonal , but I had that feeling very efinitely , that he was going into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning  --  a suicide off Brooklyn Bridge , a coolie off a sampan in the Yangtze , or a dog overboard . . . just because that 's the kind , of person he is . I saw him strike out in a swift powerful crawl , his shirt sleeves molded to his arms making ' quick white arcs above the dark water . Then behind him was Andy . I was only reading into it again , probably , what I knew ; but it seemed to me that there was a tensely emotional quality to the way he 'd gone in and was fighting to reach Sandra first . I would n't have been surprised in the least if he 'd caught Jim Ind pushed him back out of the way . But he did n't . He did n't even catch him . I could still see him a few yards behind , picked out in the orange path of the searchlights playing frantically across the water . Behind me I could hear them shouting on the topside , and men pounding down the stone steps . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement in me went stone-dead . Someone shouted from above : " They 're hanging onto the boat ! " I turned away , feeling curiously unmoved . Joe Bates , our life guard , pounded up . " Jeez , " he shouted breathlessly , " if she can hang on and bellow , why the hell does n't she swim ? "  | I did n't say anything . I guess I 'm pretty hardboiled about people like Sandra . " Why . does n't he let her drown , anyway ? " That was the voice of young Sally Parks , Lucy Lee 's oldest and best friend , and actually about as cruel and cynical as a newborn babe . " It 's not right to talk like that , " Joe Bates shouted . " I would if I was him . But I hope somebody saves George Barrol . I 'd miss him . " As it happened , they saved them both . Jim brought Sandra in and Andy brought George . Sandra was much the same as she was after any hard swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brave Jeem ! " until he shoved her off and said , " Skip it , for sake ! " But poor George ! He was more dead than alive . Joe Bates grabbed him and started pumping him up and down on his stomach , saying , " One , two , three ; one , two , three ! " But not much water seemed to be coming out of his mouth . Everybody else was standing about in the deluge . " Andy and Jim look the worst to me , " Sally Parks remarked coolly , in her hard practical young voice . " I move we go up and give ' em a hot toddy . " " I 'll stay here with Joe , " Jim said stiffly . " Take Sandra up , will you . " " But , Jeem , you are wet , darling ! " " Stow it , will you . Go on up . " They went . I stayed down , looking at Jim . His face was a grim tragic mask , and on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile that I do n't want ry car to see on anybody 's face again for a long , long time . Joe Bates lifted George up and down . " Jeez , " he said . " This guy ai n't drowned , he 's fainted ! " " Throw some water in his face , " Jim said curtly . Joe looked at me , completely bewildered . " Pinch him , " I said . We eventually brought him around quite decently . He opened his eyes slowly , not sure apparently whether he was waking up in this world or the next . Then he struggled up , wiping the rain off his face , staring at me , the most utter and complete terror gradually dawning in his face . " Sandra ! Where 's Sandra ! Did they save her ' ? " lie gasped . " Sure they saved her , " Joe said cheerfully . " She 's the original water baby . Could n't drown her in the middle of the Atlantic . " " Where . . . where is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you . It 's your one chance for a free drink . You do n't want to miss it . " I do n't think the idea of free liquor was very tempting to George just then . He shuddered , felt tentatively for his heart , and breathed in a sort of experimental fashion to see if he was all right . " I guess that was a pretty close shave , " he said . His voice shook and his face was still white with shock . " Why , I might have been drowned ! " " Sure , " Joe said . " That 's what some of ' em were countin ' on , all the time . "  | " Really ! " " Do n't be silly , Joe , " I said . " Get him up . " Jim and I did n't even go to the club . " They 'll take care of him , " Jim said . I imagine he did n't want another scene with Sandra doing the clinging lily . We passed by the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lounge and in the ballroom Rex Brophy 's Band Wagon was playing " The Music Goes Round and Round . " We got into my car . " What did she do it for , Jim ? " I said . " You 've got me . " " She might have drowned poor George . " " She had him by the collar , holding him up , " Jim said . We rounded the Corner and turned down our road . The rain had stopped as suddenly as it began . A star or two appeared in the cloud rift . " Why do n't you come over to my place and have a good stiff drink before you turn in ? " I said . " O.K. " I turned in my back drive and we got out . Sergeant Buck opened the kitchen door and gave what in anyone less completely granite would have been a shuddering gasp . He must have thought I 'd drowned his colonel . " This is Mr. Gould , Sergeant , " I said . " We 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire . " I almost added " if you do n't mind , " but I caught myself .  | " The Colonel 's dancing at the club . I suggest you take my car and go wait for him . " Sergeant Buck looked a little uneasy . Then he gave the impression of clicking his heels and saluting without actually doing either . " Yes , ma'am . " Jim and I lighted a fire in the living room and I got him a drink with hot water and lemon in it and a bathrobe . It was a quarter to twelve by the clock on the mantel . We sat there , Jim hunched down on the middle of his spine , his chin forward on his chest , thinking God knows what . We sat there from quarter to twelve until ten minutes of one , neither of us having spoken a word . We moved then only because we heard Sergeant Buck bringing the Colonel up the back drive . Jim got up . " I 'll be shoving , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick hot tears to my eyes . I let him out the front door and locked it again . Then I gathered up the glasses and ash tray and took them out to the kitchen . Colonel Primrose came in . " I 'm sorry we do n't seem to have any other entrance to this house , " I said . " Did you have a nice time ? " " Excellent . " " How about a nightcap ? " I noticed he glanced a little cautiously at Sergeant Buck 's dead pan . " Perhaps you 'd rather have it upstairs . There 's a tray on the sideboard . I 'll see you in the morning . Good night . Good night , Sergeant . "  | I do n't know about the Colonel , but I know Sergeant Buck was definitely and plainly relieved when I let the dog in and went upstairs , leaving them alone . 5 I 'M NOT QUITE SURE NOW WHAT WOKE ME UP . I thought as I waked that it was Sheila scratching at the door wanting to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up in bed and heard her tail wag on the floor under the foot of the bed where she sleeps . I spoke to her , then I sat quite still , listening . The illuminated clock on the table said ten minutes past three . Sheila growled , gave a deep throaty bark and shambled over to the window . She stood there with her feet up on the sill , growling uneasily . I put on my dressing gown and slipped out of bed . Sheila 's head was thrust forward , her tail straight and stiff . I went over to the window and pulled her down . A pale quarter-moon was high in the clear sky . All signs of thunder and rain were gone . Sheila growled uneasily and retired to the rug in front of the fireplace when I told her to . I peered out , but I could n't see anything . I could , however , hear the motor of a car running quietly , rather close to me . . . then suddenly I realized that it was only Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't abandon the whole business  | then and there , and put it down to an Irish setter 's nerves , I ca n't quite say . All I know is that suddenly , almost as if I 'd seen handwriting on the wall , I had an intense and unanswerable conviction of something terribly , horribly wrong . I could no more have denied it than Joe Bates could a drowning child . I slipped on a coat and a pair of sneakers , told Sheila to lie down where she was , opened my door and looked out down towards the guest wing . I half expected to see Sergeant Buck posted sentry in front of the Colonel 's door , but the hall was empty . I closed the door and went quietly downstairs , taking the big electric torch off the landing table as I went . Outside the night was quiet as the grave . I stood and listened . Still , somewhere near me , I thought I heard a car running quietly . I looked around for Sheila , but I knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the back of my house and the Bishops ' , moving quickly , and rather heavily , I thought . I crept to the end of the porch and looked out across the lawn . A man was there . For an instant I did n't recognize him  --  not , in fact , until he heard me , if it was me he heard , and stopped . The next instant he was gone , slipping into the shadow of the big cherry tree by the end of the house . I stood there a little bewildered , wondering not very happily why Rosemary Bishop 's fiance should be dodging about my garden at that time in the morning . Then I heard the Bishops ' garage door close , and again that low throbbing of a running motor , and I remembered then that Rex  | Brophy 's Band Wagon had been expected to carry on till two-thirty , so that of course ten minutes past three was n't actually late to be getting home . I stood there , nevertheless , unable to get the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back from the dance with the Goulds , why should he be so extraordinarily furtive about trespassing on my grounds ? Or had he , I wondered , had a clandestine meeting with Sandra there ? I waited , hesitating to go back inside , hesitating still more to go any farther forward , when quite suddenly a woman came through the hedge and stood in my garden , looking about . She started to turn back , then changed her mind and came on , towards the porch . She stopped under my bedroom window and called softly . " Here I am , " I said . " Down here . " Mrs. Gould started violently at the sound of my voice from the porch . " What are you doing down here ? " she said in a low voice , coming over . " I could n't sleep . It 's so hot in my room , and Sheila 's so restless . I just came down . " She looked at me a moment as if trying to make up her mind whether to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " That 's what I 'd like to know . I ca n't find half my family . " " Sandra ? " " And Andy . Jim 's in bed , Lucy Lee 's pacing the floor. ? I do n't like to wake Hawkins at night , he barricades himself in. "  | Hawkins is her old colored butler and handy nuan . She looked at me again . I noticed then that she still had on the print dress she 'd worn that evening but she 'd taken off her pearl necklace . " Sandra 's such an impulsive child , " she said . " Sometimes I 'd like to shake Andy . I know he has n't a notion of how he upsets Lucy Lee . Who 's a little ninny , of course . " She smiled wearily . " I 'm worried about Sandra , Grace . Do you realize that she tried to drown herself tonight ? " " She what ? " I gasped . Mrs. Gould nodded . " She 's been threatening to kill herself all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined Jim 's career and now she 's ruining his life . She 's so terribly impulsive ! " " You ought to go to bed , darling , " I said  --  which was an easy way of putting it . " I 'll walk back with you . Andy 's probably home by now and so 's Sandra . " I took her arm , and was startled at how curiously rigid her body was , and immovable . " You 're tired , Alice ; do come back , " I said . She relaxed suddenly . I could hear her long relieved breath . " Thanks , my dear . I suppose I am . " She pressed my hand quickly . " And you 're cold . " " No , no . I 'm just . . . disturbed . " She laughed softly . " My children are such  --  wretches . " The night wind shivered in the stiff magnolia  | leaves . The boys ' pigeons in the side yard cooed and rustled as if something strange had passed them . Somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar and voices singing . But that was far away . Around us in the dark was nothing but an eerie silence , throbbing and uneasy . " Come along , darling . " We moved across the grass . It was cold through my slippers , and the tall blades on the edge , where Julius 's sickle had missed , brushed against my bare ankles , sharply intense . At the hedge I pulled back a branch of white althea for Alice to pass . Released , it brushed , softly cool , against my shoulder . I started so that Alice stopped . " What is it , Grace ? " she whispered . " Nothing , darling . " I pressed on my flashlight . A white moth dashed out of the dark , an enormous potato bug trundled across the dirt path . " I 'll just get my bag out of the car , " Alice said . " If you 'll lend me your light and give me a hand with the doors . " The garage loomed white and ghostly above the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow path that leads to the double doors at the end of the drive from the road . Suddenly I knew what I 'd been hearing . . . what it was that had given the throbbing undertone to the clear still night . " Somebody 's left his motor running , " I said . " That 's one of Sandra 's tricks , " Alice Gould said .  | " She 's back , then . It 's funny the things that annoy husbands , " she went on . " That 's a much worse offense in Jim 's eyes than burned rice pudding . " I tugged at the white door . The padlock was n't on , but the doors seemed jammed tighter than usual . Finally I got them open , after skinning my knuckles and breaking at least two fingernails . I swung them wide , started in , and then remembered that I had no idea of how long the motor had been running and that the garage had been tightly shut . " ' We 'd better let it air out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We stood there a minute or two , looking in . Jim 's car was parked in front of me , Andy 's was in the other half . " It 's Andy 's motor that 's on , " I said . " I 'll turn it off while you get your bag . " I wriggled around behind Andy 's sedan , squeezed along the running board to the door and reached inside to switch off the engine and take out the keys . My hand struck something woolly and hard . The smell of Scotch whisky hit my nose and almost took my breath away . I caught myself sharply . Mrs. Gould 's voice was running along pleasantly as she fished around in Jim 's car for her bag . I caught my breath , and said , as casually as I could  --  knowing how she hates for people to drink too much , " Well , here 's our precious Andy . " I could hear her suddenly stop her fishing about . " Where ? " she said . " Right here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched the lights  | on . Then I stood there motionless , my hand out in front of me . It was n't Andy Thorp under that wheel . It was Sandra Gould  --  and it did n't take the ghastly openeyed stare on her strangely colored face to tell me she was dead . Hardly knowing what I was doing , I took the flash from Alice Gould 's paralyzed fingers and turned its beam on the lifeless girl . Her arms were sunk down at her sides . Clutched in one hand was the torn petal of a blue velvet flower . I held the flash on it for a long time . Only in a strange remote part of my consciousness was I aware of Alice Gould 's hands moving over the window ledge and quietly , calmly disengaging from that dead hand the evidence that might easily have hanged her son . . . or her son 's lost lady . 6 . LICE GOULD 'S SIMPLE ACT OF DISENGAGING THE torn and crushed velvet petals from her daughter-inlaw 's dead fingers was small and unobtrusive enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment , still balanced on one foot on the running board of Andy Thorp 's car , with Sandra Gould sprawled inert and so terribly silent on the seat , I recognized a few of them . First , and above all , it  | meant that we tacitly and definitely accepted the fact that Rosemary Bishop was in some way involved in whatever had happened . Second , it meant that both of us pledged ourselves to keep the fact from getting out ? lined up on Rosemary 's side , as it were , against Sandra  --  and became quite simply accessories after whatever the fact might turn out to be . " I 'll stay here , Grace , " Mrs. Gould said at last , quietly . " You go and get Jim and phone Dr. Potter . " " I 'll stay , " I said . " It 'll be better for you to tell Jim . " I 'm not sure now whether I actually shrank from telling Jim Gould that his wife was dead , or whether it was because in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to social order . ' Whether I felt it was n't safe to leave Alice Gould alone there with Sandra , or whether already I had some deepseated fear that Jim . . . But that was nonsense , of course . I think Alice Gould understood , however , because as our eyes met across Sandra 's body a faint infinitely sad smile moved in hers . " I 'd rather go , Grace , " she said . " I just did n't like to leave you alone . . . again . . . with death . " She went then , and I went over to the switch by the side door to turn on the overhead light . It seemed odd to me suddenly that neither of us had thought of it before . I squeezed in front of Andy 's car and stubbed my toe on something , making noise enough , or so it seemed in the small completely silent segment of night that engulfed me , to wake even Sandra sprawled there . I felt down on the floor to see what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had in front of Mr. Toplady 's store that morning . I put it on the shelf and went , feeling my way cautiously , in front of Jim 's coupe to the door . I turned on the light . Everything was instantly stark and dismal in the bright glare of the single unshaded bulb set in the middle of the ceiling . A huge moth miller flew in and bashed himself against the bulb ; insects of all sorts came suddenly swarming in from the night . I stood alone there with Sandra , waiting . Outside I thought I could hear someone coming . I moved back in front of Jim 's car and between his and Andy 's to the door , and looked out . No one was there . I listened a moment , but no one was moving . A dog probably , I said to myself , and looked at my wrist , but I had n't my watch on . It seemed a long time that I 'd stood there , and it was longer still before I heard a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Jim came running around to the back , took one look at me and stopped abruptly . " Is she dead , Grace ? " he asked . . . as impassively as if she were someone he scarcely knew . I nodded . Then , more like a man walking in his sleep than anything else , he went inside . " In Andy 's car , " I said , because he 'd gone straight to his own . He looked bewildered and uncertain , but he turned . I saw him catch the window ledge with both hands to steady himself , and stand there motionless . . . for ages , it seemed . Then he dropped his  | head down on the back of his hands . I thought he was sobbing  --  his shoulders moved convulsively once or twice  --  but when I went over to him and put my arm round his shoulders he raised haggard anguished eyes that had no tears in them . I had no idea what was going on in his mind . Quite abruptly over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down querulously . " Mis ' Gould , ain ' you all never goin ' to bed ? We got to be out here at seven o'clock , an ' you all can sleep till dinnertime . " Sandra 's oval face , dyed red with carbon monoxide , stared up at the ceiling . Jim tried to speak , but not a sound came . Outside we heard a car coming along the road from April Harbor , and two long white fingers of light stretched through the night and turned , flattening themselves against us as the car came into the Goulds ' drive . Jim 's mother appeared then too , in the door , and went to the car to meet Dr. Potter . And then , without the least warning , Colonel Primrose and Sergeant Buck came through the hedge from my garden . Sergeant Buck was dressed . Colonel Primrose had on a striped flannel dressing gown . He looked sleepy ; Sergeant Buck did not . The Colonel came into the garage . His black eyes darted in every corner at once before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us where the light from the ceiling struck Sandra 's head . He glanced out then at Dr. Potter and another man who were hurrying along the drive , and at me , but he said nothing . He merely backed out of their way and stood near  | the door , the massive square figure of his sergeant looming portentously behind him . Jim and I moved back into the narrow space between the fronts of the two cars . I felt his sudden involuntary start as he recognized the man with Dr. Potter . Our Mr. Shryock is something like a turkey buzzard  --  we see him only at times like this . " You say she 's dead , ma'am ? " he inquired of Mrs. Gould . He caught sight of Jim and lowered his voice . " Tragic , tragic , " he said . " Tch , tch ! " Mr. Shryock 's trouble is that he has to reconcile the difficult roles of local undertaker , wanting private business , on the one side and local coroner doing public duty on the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapin was drowned . We saw him now give Sandra 's body a perfunctory glance and look around then at the two men standing silently by the door . " I 'll have to have a jury before the body can be moved , " he said . " Will you two gentlemen act ' ? I 'll rout out some more . " He stepped briskly out and hailed a man he had left in his car . They disappeared together . In a few moments there was a little circle of our shocked and white-faced neighbors , silent and terribly distressed , standing around outside in the drive , lighting cigarettes , whispering a little among themselves . I looked them over as they came  --  Ned Bryan , Pinkie Reed , Buzz Dixon . They all lived beyond the Goulds ' . I breathed a sigh of relief as I realized that the coroner was headed away from the Bishops ' . At least , I thought , they would be spared that embarrassment . But I was  | wrong . Mr. Shryock came back at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Bishops ' caretaker and man of all work . They made up the twelve . Rodman Bishop nodded to the rest of the group , then moved over to Alice Gould and took his stand beside her . His dressing gown and rumpled gray hair seemed extraordinarily deshabille beside her coat and print dress and properly arranged coiffure . George moved in with the other men , looking about as upset as I 've ever seen him , trying to find out what had happened . Mr. Shryock stepped up on a box in the doorway . " This is a very tragic mission , gentlemen , I 've called you on , " he said . " I must ask you each , constituting the coroner 's jury , to file through the garage here and look at the body . We will then hear what Dr. Potter has to say , and adjourn to Mrs. Latham 's house  --  if she will be so kind as to allow us to do so . " I nodded quite mechanically . It seemed a horribly offhand way of disposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look carefully , gentlemen , as you will be called upon to make a decision as to the cause of death and the manner it was come by . You are all men of the world . I will ask you not to omit any fact that seems important to you  --  such as the odor in the car , for example . " Mr. Shryock went on . It was his hour  --  he did n't often come into contact with the April Harbor Colony . Most of us died decently in our town homes in the  | winter of pneumonia or old age . We came to April Harbor for rest and relaxation . " All right , gentlemen . " Jim Gould stood watching them , white-faced and haggard , as they went in , trying not to look at him , poor dears . They went one by one to the window where Jim had stood , looked in , turned away quickly , blundered back outside and lighted cigarettes again ? even Rodman Bishop . George did n't look at her , I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried out , a little green about the gills , and I could hear him protesting in an undertone to the coroner that he ought n't to have to act , because he had driven home with her . But nobody paid any attention to him , except Colonel Primrose . He stood there quietly , with his head cocked and his sparkling black eyes resting on first one , then another , listening to everything , and rather more like a turkey buzzard than Mr. Shryock , if the truth were told . That 's why I watched him when his turn came . He looked inside the car , and sniffed ; bent his head close to Sandra 's face and sniffed again , picked up her hands and looked at them . Then he opened the door . A half-empty flask of whisky fell out onto the running board . He picked it up carefully and handed it to Mr. Shryock . Then he touched the back of the seat , and bent down to look at Sandra 's slippers . After that he moved away and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel had done and moved away in his turn . We waited , the twelve men of the jury and my-  | self , for more than half an hour in my living room before the coroner and Dr. Potter and another man ? tall , stooped and dyspeptic  --  came in . " This is Mr. Owens Parran , gentlemen , " said Mr. Shryock . " He 's our State 's Attorney . Always on the job , that 's his watchword , and you 're all going to like his style , I know that . Would you like to say a word at this time , Mr. Parran ? " Mr. Parran shook his head and yawned . " Go ahead , " he said . I thought we might be going to like his style , but it was going to be hard to get over his manner . He did , however , shake hands with Rodman Bishop and Colonel Primrose . I suppose it 's part of being a good politician to be able to spot the most important men in any group without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I do n't think I 've ever seen Adam Potter look as old and completely done in as he did then . " The cause of death is quite clear , " he said in a dry expressionless voice . " The discoloration of the skin that you must all have noticed is due to carbon monoxide poisoning . I think there is no reasonable possibility of doubt that that is the cause of death . " " Thank you , doctor . Now , gentlemen , I understood from Mrs. Gould senior that she and Mrs. Latham here found young Mrs. Gould . I should like to spare the natural feelings of the bereaved as far as is in our power , so I will ask Mrs. Latham to give her account of the situation . " " I heard someone in my garden a few minutes after three , " I said . " I got up and came down . It was  | Mrs. Gould . She was hunting for Sandra  --  her daughter-in-law . " I do n't know why I left out Andy Thorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so . " I thought I heard a motor running and we went into the garage . The engine of the sedan was on . I started to turn it off , thinking somebody had just forgot it . My hand touched a wool coat . I thought it was a man until I switched on the lights and saw Sandra Gould . She had on a man 's coat . " " I wished to inquire about that jacket , " Mr. Shryock said . " Mrs. Gould got wet during the evening . I suppose someone gave it to her to wear home so she would n't catch cold , " I said . " Undoubtedly got caught in the rain . " I glanced at Colonel Primrose . He was just sitting there . " Had Mrs. Gould been drinking ? " Mr. Shryock continued . There was no answer from anyone . " I ask that , " he added , " because of the smell in the car , and because it would be extremely simple for a lady under the influence to drop off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A voice spoke up nervously . " But it was n't her car in the first place , and she 'd certainly not been drinking in the second . " We all looked around , rather startled by this sudden contribution from the ranks of the jurors . George Barrol flushed . " I mean . . . you see , I came home  | with her . I mean , Mr. Thorp drove us both home from the club house , and they let me out at The Magnolias . ' I'lhen they drove back . Unless they drank a lot after they left me , Mrs. Gould certainly was n't under the influence , as you say . " The coroner frowned , and so did everybody else except Rodman Bishop . He looked at me and shook his head a little . The thing about George Barrol is that he 's always putting his own and other people 's feet into things that had best be left quite free of feet . " Where is Mr. Thorp ? " The coroner looked about . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with him to show him the way ? " Jerry Nolan went  --  glad to get out , I think , because he 'd been quite devoted to Sandra the last two summers before he married Charlotte Putnam . The rest of us still avoided looking at each other . Even Yancy Holland was lined up on the side of the Colony , trying to keep the matter as casual as possible . Now and then somebody glanced apprehensively at Colonel Primrose and Sergeant Buck . They were the imponderables . The rest of them could be counted on to help old Jim if he needed it . In fact , as it was turning out , the coroner was doing it all for them . Even I could think of forty embarrassing questions that had not been asked or even hinted at . The doors of the garage , for instance . If Sandra had gone to sleep , she could n't very well have closed the doors and sealed herself in . Mr. Shryock was examining a piece of folded  | note paper he 'd got somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parran had examined it for a considerable time before he passed it back . I went out to the kitchen to get some glasses and some beer . I did n't feel in the mood to set fifteen men up to Scotch and soda . Moreover , I could n't in the least understand the coroner 's air . Here obviously was a group of people tremendously upset by what had happened , and he was setting about as if it were an all-night oyster roast . I had just got back when we heard Jerry Nolan 's voice outside . " Buck up , Andy  --  for God 's sake , old man ! " he was saying . They came in . Andy Thorp 's face was ghastly . His eyes were bloodshot , he looked altogether as if they 'd just swept him out from under a counter . There was a dazed and stricken look on his face and he kept muttering crazily and mumbling something about keys . He was six feet three of complete and total incoherence . He sat down , or rather Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my surprise , Sergeant Buck was at his side handing him a stiff peg of whisky , and taking the empty glass away . Andy groaned and dropped his head on his hands . He sat there kneading at his head with convulsive fingers . " Mr. Thorp , I understand you drove Mrs. Gould and Mr. Barrol home from the dance at the club ? " Andy nodded . " You dropped Mr. Barrol at The Magnolias . Now if you 'll tell us what happened next , please ? "  | Andy looked up . I think he was really nearer the point of collapse than any of us realized . " I drove home and put the car in the garage . We got out and closed the door , and walked up the path to the house . Halfway up Sandra said she 'd left something in the car . I always lock it , even in the garage ? it 's a habit you get into in New York . I said I 'd go kick and get it for her , but she said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on home . That 's all I know . ? That 's all I know , I tell you ! " His voice rose almost to a scream in that last sudden outburst . We all stared at him . He dropped his head in his hands again , making curious strangled sobs . Jerry Nolan patted him anxiously on the back . Mr. Shryock looked at him for an instant . Then he nodded soberly and picked up the note on the table in front of him . " Is there anyone here who can identify Mrs. Alexandra Gould 's handwriting ? " he asked . Jerry Nolan flushed and raised his hand . There were several others , including myself and Andy . Mr. Shryock passed the thin elegant bit of gray note paper to Jerry . " Do you recognize this as Mrs. Gould 's hand-writing ? " Jerry nodded . I thought he rather paled too . " Will you give it to the next gentleman ? " Bailey Fisher took it and handed it quickly to Frank Gerber , nodding his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He gave it to me . I looked at it .  | " Can you identify that as Mrs. Gould 's writing , Mrs. Latham ? " " I can , " I said in a low voice . I 'd seen it  --  a childish uneducated scrawl  --  a thousand times . She was always writing notes about something . I handed it back . My heart was like a lump of ice in the pit of my stomach . The coroner put on his horn-rimmed spectacles and surveyed us over them for an instant . " I have here a letter that you have heard identified as positively as possible under the circumstances . I 'm going to read it to you and then I shall ask for your verdict , gentlemen . " He looked down . We waited . I could hear Sheila scratching at the door upstairs . Outside a few early birds were chirping , getting the business of worms under way . The clock on the hall landing struck fourthirty . My dearest darling Jim , ? You must forgive your Sandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill myself , I know , but I have ruined your whole life Jim and you have been so good to me . In my country we are not afraid of death and I am not afraid now . Good-by , Jim . They say it does not hurt very much this Way. ? SANDRA . The coroner stopped . All of us sat mute and horror-stricken . To hear Sandra 's childish English in the coroner 's flat nasal Maryland whine seemed unbearably incongruous . After a long time he looked up . " Mrs. Gould senior found that note on her daughter-in-law 's dressing table tonight . That is why she was out searching for her . I think we know what happened , gentlemen . I await your verdict . "  | I waited for it too . And when it came , after the twelve men , ten of us from April Harbor and two outsiders , had adjourned to the dining room , I sat with my head down , my hands shaking so I had to hold them stuck deep down in my pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop stood up , whitehaired , square-faced , hard-jawed . " The jury finds that Alexandra Gould met her death at her own hands from inhaling carbon monoxide fumes while of an unsound mind , " he said . Mr. Shryock looked at the State 's Attorney . Mr. Parran nodded sleepily . " Thank you , gentlemen , thank you , " Mr. Shryock said . He rubbed his hands together and looked about . " I think that will be all . I 'll make my report in longhand , Mr. Parran , my typewriter 's being overhauled . " I still sat there , my hands steadied against the seams of my pockets . Suddenly I looked up . Colonel Primrose was looking intently at me . My lips were very dry . I tried to moisten them without his seeing me . Surely there was no way of his knowing what was beating in my brain until it was numb with dread ! The coroner 's hand stuck down towards me brought me to with a start . I scrambled to my feet and said good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder . " You 'd better get a little sleep , Grace , " he said . I thought he was telling me something else too . I closed the door after them , and stood a moment looking out to the bay , silvery calm in the gray dawn . I knew Colonel Primrose was standing in the middle of the room behind me , waiting . At last I turned  | around and faced him , my hands behind me holding onto the door-knob to steady me . Our eyes met , his sparkling black and penetrating , mine trying to hide what was in them . Then he smiled , suddenly and kindly . " It 's hardly fair , is it ? Especially when you did n't invite me here . " I took a deep breath . " Maybe you 'll want to tell me about it in the morning , " he said after a moment . " I do n't mind confessing to you that all this worries me. ? You 'd better go back to bed . " I 'm afraid I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth Sergeant Buck thought , because he came in just at that moment  --  after having put the bottles away and washed up the glasses , I was morally certain . I saw him give the Colonel a pained admonitory look . " Up to your old tricks , sir ! " he said severely , shaking his head . And I , stupidly , was the one who misunderstood him . 7 BY MORNING , HOWEVER , I SHOULD NEVER HAVE thought of telling him . In fact , until I saw Lilac 's solemn black face above the pink-flowered coffeepot on my breakfast tray , I had almost forgotten Sandra Gould . It 's always seemed to me a curious commentary  | on the human soul that a few hours ' sleep and the morning sun can manage to do away with the most horrible forebodings . I thought of that now as I waited for Lilac to prop the pillows behind me . " Mr. Jim 's wife done away with herself las ' night , Miss Grace , " she said ominously . " I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don ' seem lak she 'd do that , somehow . Seem lak she was too ornery . " " You ca n't tell about people , " I answered philosophically . " ' Deed an ' that 's what Annie says , at church this mornin ' . " Annie is the Bishops ' cook , and there 's a community bus that takes all the colored help into April Harbor to church at six Sunday mornings and at eight Sunday evenings . " Hawkins says the carryin 's on in the garage las ' night sumthin ' to hear . " " Really ? " " Yas 'm . " I was intent on my paper . I did n't want to discuss this business with her . . . not just then . She 's been with us fifteen years . There 's not very much she does n't know about my friends , and her judgments are shrewd . She stood , a black mountain of irresolution , at the foot of my bed a moment , then went to the door . There she stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfas ' hot , or will he get his breakfas ' while he 's in town ' ? "  | I looked up , too startled to conceal anything . " He done went out , him an ' the Sergeant , ' fore me an ' Julius got back from church . We passed ' em on the bridge , goin ' into town . " With that she went out and closed the door . The inquiry about their breakfast , of course , was merely a gambit with which I really had nothing whatsoever to do . I put my paper down and drank my orange juice , definitely disturbed by this move on the part of my guest . I knew from my father and my husband  --  both of them lawyers  --  that the most difficult thing for people involved in an unlawful conspiracy to do is to do nothing . Nevertheless , I put my hand out half a dozen times and took up the telephone to call Alice Gould , only to put it down each time . I was considerably more upset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to admit , even to myself . What if Colonel Primrose had decided that Sandra 's death was not suicide at all , and got the State 's Attorney to open an investigation ? What , for instance , would I do about the two bits of information that I had that were so damning to people I cared a great deal about  --  so much that I hardly dared think about them . The fact that they pointed in wholly different directions did n't seem to matter . Rosemary 's flower clutched in Sandra 's hand  --  the letter that Alice Gould had found on Sandra 's dressing table . What would I do ? Would I commit perjury if I had to ? I wiped the excess lipstick off my mouth with a piece of tissue , looking at myself in the mirror . I knew  | I would  --  if I had to . In a sense I 'd already done it . I was on the screened front porch when Colonel Primrose and his sergeant appeared coming around the house . That in itself seemed ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in any way except through the kitchen . His greeting was cheery , but it failed to conceal the look on Sergeant Buck 's face , even more iron-grim than usual . The Sergeant did not come in . He marched down the lawn , dug out a dandelion that I 've been carefully saving for several years , picked up an empty crumpled cigarette package and a couple of butts and went around the house . You could almost see a garbage can in his mind . " Good morning , Mrs. Latham . I hope you slept ? or did you have time ? " The Colonel smiled and sat down , straightening one rheumatic knee into place with a quite shameless grin to acknowledge the liability of years . " I 'm afraid I was up a bit early . I hope I did n't disturb you ? " " Not at all . I only heard about it through the normal domestic channels . Would you like a cup of coffee ? " I got up to ring the bell , but he put up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too well  --  at the local undertaker 's . " " It sounds bad . " " It was . But sit down , Mrs. Latham . I want to talk to you . I want to ask you something , very frankly . I want you to be equally frank  --  because it 's quite a serious matter . "  | I sat down again , trying to make myself meet his black intent gaze without telling him I was trying . " I said I 'd been to the undertaker 's this morning , " he went on . " I wanted to make sure that Sandra Gould died of carbon monoxide poisoning . " He looked at me steadily . I waited . " And she did . There 's no doubt of that . " I breathed deeply , almost without knowing that I 'd been holding my breath while I waited . " But that 's not all , Mrs. Latham , " he said quietly . " There 's a bruise on the back of her head . Only a slight abrasion , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . she died of monoxide gas , " I said quickly . " Her legs are scratched too , " he said , disregarding my interruption . " But it 's the bruise that interests me . It would have knocked her completely unconscious ? if she was n't already dead , and we 've been able to rule that out quite definitely . The bruise was made before she died . " I looked at him , not knowing what all this was leading up to . " In other words , Mrs. Latham , while Sandra Gould was actually killed by carbon monoxide poisoning , her death was not self-inflicted . She did breathe in the fumes that killed her , but she was unconscious while she was doing it . From her own point of view her death was quite unintentional . In other words again , Mrs. Latham . . . Sandra Gould was murdered . " I stared at him , speechless . Now that my own  | doubts and fears were put squarely in front of me in the form of fact , I fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cried . " You ca n't know that ! The bruises could have been made when she fell against the door handle ! " Colonel Primrose shook his head . " That 's what your coroner amicably suggested . But he 's wrong . It 's simple to prove . You see , the blood in the bruised tissue has no trace of carbon monoxide . The rest of her blood is saturated with it . " He looked at me very earnestly . " You see , Mrs. Latham , this sort of thing is my business . Buck and I make our living at it . . . keeping people from getting away with murder . And that 's what I want to talk to you about . " He hesitated a moment , and chuckled a little . " Frankly , I 've already abused your hospitality . I phoned to Washington last night . The Federal Bureau sent down a makeshift sort of laboratory this morning . l ) r . Potter and Mr. Shryock helped out . Furthermore , Mrs. Latham , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , anyway , to account for the odor in that car . I felt the seat last night , as you may have noticed . The whisky had been spilled on it , for the purpose of misdirection . " I took a cigarette out of the box on the table and held it as steadily as I could while he lighted it for me . " You see , that 's the great trouble with murder . Ordinarily , last night would have washed all this upcompletely  --  except that I happened to be here . That 's about the only thing that makes me believe there must  | be some kind of design in the universe  --  the number of times that what seems mere coincidence steps in to thwart murder ; or murderers , rather . We 've no way of knowing how many times murder itself is thwarted and does n't happen . " I looked at him for a moment . " When did you decide it was murder ? " " Last night . " " Why ? " " Why ? Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Latham . And that , I suppose , is made up of little fragments of intangible evidence  --  like , for example , the expression on your face when you saw that suicide note , and the liquor spilled on the car seat . And a pretty strong conviction that a girl like Sandra Gould would n't just throw her hand in when a beautiful rival sits in on the game . Added , my dear Mrs. Latham , to that evening at the clubhouse where at least three women had murder in their eyes , and at least four men were n't  --  well , let 's say as detached as they tried to appear . " " Meaning who ? " I asked . " Nobody that you ca n't identify as easily as I can . But that 's not the immediate point , Mrs. Latham . The immediate point is this : what are you going to do about it ? " He looked at me , a little amused and at the same time deadly earnest and calculating . " I mean , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much indeed , I 'm afraid , " I replied as casu-  | ally as I could . " Addis Ababa , just offhand . Or Perth , Western Australia . " He smiled . " I 'm sorry . I 'm staying in too , you know . I do n't like murder . It 's just an old-fashioned prejudice , and I 'm an old-fashioned man . No , I 'm only offering  --  not j wholeheartedly , because you 're so extraordinarily central  --  to go to a hotel if you ask me to . It 's not going to be easy , you know . For you , I mean . " " I 'm afraid I 'm rather prejudiced too , " I said . " I should n't like to say I approve of murder as a social pastime  --  but I think it 's possible for one to be pretty well justified . Colonel Primrose shook his head . " That 's the trouble with you moderns . You 've got such a hard , polished exterior . Scratch it , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't like consequences ; you 're glad when something comes along and removes them , even if it happens to be a murder . But you 're not going to escape a few consequences of your own . " I must have looked most astonished . " Do n't you see , Grace Latham , that you know too much ? " He looked so sober that I was a little alarmed in spite of myself . " Do n't you see that that 's the bad thing about murder ? That 's the chief reason we ca n't just let it ride and say , Fair enough and an easy way out . ' Because murderers do n't rest easy in their own minds  --  and you , my dear Mrs. Latham , are just the person that this  | murderer is going to worry about , more and more . How much you know . . . how much you saw . . . how much you guessed . " He shook his head . " I imagine that 's one of the reasons I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd like to keep an eye on you . He chuckled suddenly . " It 's very reassuring in any kind of dustup to have Sergeant Buck 's eye on you . " " You do n't think , by any chance , " I asked , " that I murdered Sandra Gould ' ? " He cocked his black eyes at me for all the world like a wicked old parrot about to take a piece out of my ear . " I should n't like to make any broad declaration of the sort just at this time . I think you 're undoubtedly a very important person in the case  --  perhaps even more important than you realize . I 've already told you that you know too much about all this ? fore and aft . Perhaps we might even work together . " " That , " I said , " is nothing but the most unmitigated flattery , and I 'm not falling for it . . . not at any rate till it 's disguised better . But you may stay here  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own idea , not mine , and that personally I should be much happier if you 'd never set foot in April Harbor . " " It would have come out eventually , Mrs. Latham . Shryock would have drunk too much one night and told Parran . Or one of your friends here would have talked over the bridge table one afternoon . It would have been worse then , and more trouble . If ,  | indeed , the Goulds ' order to ship the body to Baltimore for cremation had n't already done the trick . " " What do you mean ? " " Shryock  --  qua undertaker , not coroner  --  had that order . " " From whom ? " " From the Goulds , I imagine . " I was silent . " So you see . " I nodded . " I think I see , " I said . " When do you start . . . and where ? " " Now and here , " said Colonel Primrose cheerfully . " Mr. Parran is starting in the garage . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd speak to you first . Of course , I want to know about Sandra Gould . What 's the history ? " " I do n't know much about her , except that she married Jim in Shanghai , " I said . " They 've been coming here ever since Jim got out of the Navy . " " Why did he get out ? " " I suppose he thought he 'd rather sell bonds , or something . " He cocked his head and fastened his sparkling black parrot 's eyes on me . " Mrs. Latham  --  unless you tell me the truth , there 's not much use in taking your time or mine , " he said reproachfully . " Is it truth you want , or all the wretched gossip and malicious imaginings of a hundred busybodies ? " I demanded hotly . He smiled a rather wry subrisive smile . " Unfor-  | tunately , gossip usually has a large grain of truth in it . It 's extremely useful in my business . " " It must be a rather ghastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you think the general idea that Jim Gould got out of the Navy because a certain admiral on a certain China station requested that he be detached because of Sandra is malicious imagining ? ? The Chetwynds told me that to show how much she 'd improved under the tutelage of her mother and sisterin-law . " " She did improve , " I had to admit . " She was n't very attractive when she first came . A little too Eurasian Mae West . Very lush  --  like a ripe passion fruit . Too much make-up , hair curled too much , clothes too fancy , fingernails too red and not too clean , eye too obviously roving . But she has changed . You saw her . Sleek straight hair , marvelous make-up , exquisite clothes . Still very gay and all that but oh so toned down , and . . . Westernized . Thanks to a motherin-law with impeccable taste and a lot of money . I do n't think she 's any handicap to Jim now . " " She 's a very definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primrose said . " Well , what about his marriage , and what happened between him and Rosemary Bishop ? " " Their engagement was broken . That 's all I know . He married Sandra then  --  it frequently happens , you know . The old course of true love and the slip ' twixt cup and lip . "  | " And the fish in the sea that have n't been caught ' ? " " Precisely . That 's Paul Dikranov . Loads of money  --  which Jim has n't any more . " " I see . " " No . . . you do n't . Because I do n't mean it that way at all . That might just possibly be in Rodman Bishop 's mind . It certainly would n't ever be in Rosemary 's . " He smiled . " Then perhaps I do see , after all , " he said . We heard a car coming in my back drive . Colonel Primrose got up . He looked at me seriously . " I think I ought to tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest him . Jim Gould , of course . " I stared at him stupidly . " What for ? " " For the murder of Sandra Gould . " " Nonsense ! " " I wish it were . I 'm afraid it 's not , Mrs. Latham . Just on the face of it even , there 's a powerful case against him . Motive , opportunity . . . all the rest . " I tried frantically to find something for Jim in all this mess . " What about the letter , Colonel Primrose ? " He shook his head soberly . " It 's a forgery , Mrs. Latham . It 's got to be . Rather a transparent one , I suspect . That woman did n't kill herself . " He looked at me . I 'd recovered myself by then and said nothing . . . for which I was thankful a little later .  | At that point the wooden face of Sergeant Buck loomed through the screen at the end of the porch . The State 's Attorney Mr. Parran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , one of them in the summer khaki and helmet of the Maryland State Police . " Good morning , ma'am , " Mr. Parran said . " Ready , Colonel ? " I watched them go across to the opening in the hedge , towards the Goulds ' . The thought struck me then that Colonel Primrose had kept me there talking , asking questions whose answers he already knew , so that I could n't warn Jim . I sat down suddenly , very sick and weak in the knees . For the second time that day I resisted the impulse to fly to the telephone . I told myself that that was just what Colonel Primrose would be waiting for and watching for , some move of mine or of somebody 's to point a direction for him . So I sat there , pretty miserable , trying to picture to myself just what they 'd be doing . . . how Jim would take it , what his mother would do . I never thought of Lucy Lee until I heard a sound in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terribly frightened . " What 's the matter , Grace ? What are they doing ? why are they in the garage ? " she demanded frantically . " Colonel Primrose is there  --  Bill told Andy he 's some sort of private detective . Do n't they ? " She stopped short . " Grace . . . " " They think Sandra did n't kill herself , Lucy Lee , " I said quietly .  | She stared at me , gradually shrinking until she seemed more like a child herself than a twenty-six-yearold mother of three . Poor little Lucy Lee . . . always the prettiest , most popular girl at the Harbor , with dozens of beaux , married by the age-old process of natural selection to the biggest , handsomest and most heroic of the lot . . . and it just had n't worked . If we 'd been Vikings , Andy Thorp would have been headman ; but in Broadway offices where the headman is a very different sort , Andy does n't seem to fit . Lucy Lee 's fiercely loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing her own work in town and pretending she liked it ! ? She stood in the center of my living room staring at me , her pale soft face paler than usual , framed in her mass of soft short chestnut curls , her dark eyes bigger and more bewildered . " Listen , Lucy Lee . You 've got to buck up . This is going to be rotten for everybody . . . but it 's going to be terrible for Jim . " She looked at me as if she did n't understand at all . " For Jim ? " It was my turn to stare . The strangest kaleidoscoping of emotion and calculation went through her pretty transparent face . I was n't sure she even knew what I was talking about . " I 'm afraid they think Jim killed her , darling , " I said . Fond as I am of Lucy Lee , and devoted as I know she is to Jim , I thought I saw an expression of the most extraordinary relief relax her whole body .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could he . . . " She stared at me silently for a moment . Then she seemed rather more like herself . " Oh , no , Grace ! " she cried . " That 's not fair , he 'd never . . . Oh , Grace , will they drag out all the business about China and Rosemary ? " " I 'm afraid they will , Lucy Lee . In fact , they 've already started . " " But what if nobody tells them . They ca n't find out , and they ca n't ever prove it . . . I mean , that he . . . killed her . He was n't even with her last night . . . " She rushed on , from one thing to another , not very convincingly . Two red spots had grown in her cheeks , making her look oddly hectic . " But . . . they wo n't be after Andy , will they ? " That was what was alarming her , then , making her willing to cast Jim or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Andy clear of it . I do n't know exactly what I would have said to her , because I was pretty angry . Jim is worth so many dozen Andys  --  if only for the reason that he grew up and did n't stay a halfback when he should have been doing a job . I did n't have a chance to say anything , however . She saw the Bishops coming before I did . " I 'd better get back , " she whispered . " Do n't tell anybody I was here . " She fled just as George Barrol opened the porch door for Rosemary and her father .  | 8 THEY CAME IN , GEORGE BARROL WITH A LITTLE THE air of a deputation . I looked at Rosemary , rather alarmed . Rodman Bishop , in an old seersucker suit with the trouser legs a little shrunk from years of laundering so that his feet looked enormous , went back to the porch door and threw his half-smoked cigar out onto the lawn , and came back , wiping his flushed perspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead too . He was more flustered than hot . And between the two Rosemary stood as cool and lovely and detached as a lily . Only a shadow in the fringed gray depths of her eyes as she looked at me indicated that any of this touched her at all . Rodman Bishop sat down heavily . " Jim 's in a tight spot , Grace , " he said . I nodded . " I 've just seen this fellow Parran . Saw him on his way out . I gather it 's Primrose has let the cat out of the bag . " Rosemary smiled faintly . George was definitely upset . " We have n't anything to hide , of course , Uncle Rod , " he said hurriedly . Rodman Bishop 's brows beetled as they did practically every time anybody but Rosemary opened their mouths .  | " I did n't say we had . All I say is that if you 'd kept your mouth shut , there would n't have been any question of its not being suicide . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George said . It was just like him . " That 's one trouble with the world . Too damn many people going around doing their duty as they see it ! " " Well , I 'm sure ? " " Shut up , George , and let Dad get on with it , " Rosemary said amiably . Her father started to beetle at her , but the sight of her standing by the window tapping a cigarette on the back of her hand changed the expression on his old pirate face . He adored her , and he was disturbed about her too . " This is what I 'm getting at , Grace , " he said brusquely . " We 've got to get together on this . I 've sent for Kaufman . It 's his sort of thing . We 're going to make this suicide thing stick . " " Do you think Jim 's going to like that , dad ? " Rosemary asked quietly . " He 'll like it unless he 'd rather hang . " " But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd probably like to have the person who did it hanged instead . " Rodman Bishop snorted angrily . His old square face was set in extraordinarily determined lines  --  and I do n't know anyone who can look  --  and be  --  more determined . " It 's his one defense , " he said . " They 've got mo-  | tive enough to hang him a dozen times . I tell you that 's Parran 's case . He had the motive and the opportunity , so far as anybody knows yet  --  and he forged that suicide note and then tried to have her body cremated so the blow on the skull would n't come to light when the neighbors started talking . " We were all silent a moment . " What about that note , Grace ? " Rosemary asked , turning from the window . " I mean , is it her writing ? " I nodded . " I 'm sure it is . " " But what about the blow on the head ? " George I3arrol asked nervously . Rodman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " is where you come in . " George turned the color of an old warm oyster . " Me ? " he said . Bishop nodded . " Parran is a fool , " he said quietly . " This Primrose is an able man . I 've heard about him . " He looked inquiringly at me . I nodded . " I should say he 's a very able man . " He went on , looking steadily at George and speaking in a deliberate tone . " You were with her on the boat last night . You saw the jib give her a crack on the back of the head . " " Well . . . " George said nervously . He hesitated . " Well , as a matter of fact , it did , you know . " His face brightened . " It . . . it knocked her flat . It really did . That 's when the mast cracked and broke off and the boat capsized . I got hold of her . I nearly died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold water brought her to . I just hung on to her till she could get hold of the boat . " We stared at him in complete astonishment . That was why she had n't swum back , then  --  why she 'd let Jim bring her in . It was so simple , and so much like Sandra . " Why the devil did n't you say so before ? " Rodman Bishop growled . " Why , I just remembered it . And anyway , I could n't go around pretending I 'd saved her life when everybody knows I ca n't do much more than keep afloat . I thought she 'd mention it . " " Then she really might . . . " Rosemary 's face was quite pale now . She steadied herself against the back of the chair , swaying a little . " I think I 'll go back home , dad , " she said quickly . Before we knew it she was gone . George dashed after her with one look at his uncle . Rodman Bishop turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , " he said gruffly . " I want to talk to you alone . " I sat down again . Rodman Bishop was nodding his head with grim satisfaction . " I think that will about do it , " he said curtly . " We 've got a case now . We did n't have before . I 'll tell you frankly , Grace , it 's not Jim I was worried about . It 's Rosemary . " " You did n't by any chance think Rosemary killed her , did you , Mr. Bishop ? " I inquired . " Do n't be a fool , Grace . I mean I do n't want her  | name mixed up in it . She 's had a bad enough time without being dragged through a murder trial . " He looked at me steadily through his thick shaggy brows . " You see , Grace , this marriage of hers means a lot to her , now , and I 'm frank to tell you that while I 'd rather she was marrying an American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money , and he 's tremendously in love with Rosemary . " I did n't say anything . It seemed a reasonable enough attitude . " There have been several men I would have liked her to marry  --  that have had money and position  --  but she could n't see it . You see , we 've been hit pretty hard , Grace . Chapin 's money from his aunt went to his male cousins . Rosemary 's has shrunk , so has mine . " " So has everybody 's . " " Not Dikranov 's . He sells arms in Africa , Arabia and Turkey . " Rodman Bishop smiled a little and shook his head at the same time . " But he 's all right , and shrewd as they come . " " I 'm glad you feel that way . " " Not that it would have made any difference . Rosemary 's as headstrong as a mule . The point is , I do n't want her dragged through any scandal . I do n't want all that Chinese business brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim was a fool too . " He got up . " I can count on you , Grace  --  about the note being genuine , not a forgery ? "  | I nodded . " It 's Sandra 's writing. ? Is Rosemary in love with Paul Dikranov , Mr. Bishop ? " I asked as we came out on the porch . " Officially  --  madly . Between the two of us , she 'll never love anybody but Jim . " He shook his head . " It beats me . Never a word out of her . Just suddenly , every six months or so , Jim and I used to go there , ' or in Paris , Jim liked Paris ' ? so you know she 's always thinking about him . I want this marriage of hers to go through , Grace . It 'll kill her , if she does n't have something to take it off her mind . " " What about waiting now and marrying Jim ? " " He 's poor . Alice 'll have Lucy Lee 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway . . . " He put on his old panama . " Kaufman will be here tomorrow . I wish to God we 'd never come back . " " Why did you ? " I 'd been wondering about that . " Oh , Rosemary was set on it . George and I were both opposed . I told Dikranov it was a mistake , but he backed her up and I was too weak-kneed to hold out . I persuaded myself it might be good for her . " I went over to the Goulds ' garage as soon as he 'd gone . The bruise on the back of Sandra 's head was the bit of tangible evidence that Colonel Primrose was basing his theory of willful murder on , and I thought he would like to know there was a perfectly simple explanation of it . They were swarming over the place . I never saw  | five men  --  another state policeman had joined them ? doing so many different things at once . Except Colonel Primrose and Mr. Parran . I could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me and said , " The Colonel 's busy , ma'am . He ai n't got no time for visiting . " I must have looked annoyed this time , because he added stiffly , " He 's upstairs , ma'am . " I looked up . The window of Hawkins 's room over the garage was open , and I could hear his voice . I went on up . Colonel Primrose cocked his head down and glanced around at me as severely as Sergeant Buck had done . Then he smiled . " This is my assistant , Parran , " he said . " Sit down , Mrs. Latham . Now then . Go on , Hawkins . What time was it when you heard them ? " " It was jus ' twelve o'clock , suh . " " Sure of that ? " " Absolutely , Cunnel . Ah 'm sure of that , ' cause Ah heared the clock strike . Ah heared Mr. Jim say , It 's exactly midnight , ' an ' then Ah heared the clock strike twelve times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' that 's one consolation . Ah knows Mr. Jim 's voice when Ah hears it . He was right over there under mah bed , his voice come up right through the flo ' . " Mr. Parran listened , nodding . " They 's always goin ' on , Sa'dy night . Ah don ' mind the young folks , but it seems to me married folks ain ' no call to go gallivantin ' all night way into Sunday mornin ' . The Lawd floods an ' the Lawd sends fire ,  | the Lawd ain ' got no more patience with foreigners . Ah tol ' Mr. Jim that . " Hawkins is a preacher in Baltimore during the winter . In the summer he 's the Goulds ' butler and chauffeur , and a man of prominence at April Harbor . Mr. Parran got up . " Well , you see they do n't try to make you change your story , Hawkins , " he said . " Ain ' nobody make me change mah story . Ah don ' get no sleep to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad heart , Ah don ' like this business of bein ' kep ' up all night . Ah tol ' Miss Alice that this mornin ' . " " All right , Hawkins , " Colonel Primrose said . " You can go back to the house now . You wo n't mind , I suppose , if we use your room for headquarters ? " " No , suh . " The old darkey shambled down the stairs , his white starched coat glistening in the sun . Mr. Parran spat out of the window . " Well , " he said , in his dry nasal accent , " we 'll just see what Mr. Bishop 's fancy New York lawyer makes with that . " I had n't meant to take him in on it , but I was annoyed at that . " He 'll make plenty of it , " I said . Both of them looked at me . Colonel Primrose smiled . Mr. Parran did n't . I do n't think he liked me any more then than he did later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday night , " I said . " He got there at quarter to twelve . Your sergeant saw him come in with me . And  | he left just as you came in , Colonel Primrose  --  at ten minutes to one . " Colonel Primrose cocked his eye down at me . " You 're sure about those times ? " he said soberly . " Absolutely . There 's no possible doubt of it . And furthermore . . . you probably have n't heard that Sandra Gould was hit on the head by the jib when her mast cracked and the boat capsized . George Barrol held her up until she came to enough to hang on to the boat . That 's why he was so exhausted when they brought him in , and why she did n't swim in herself . " Mr. Parran stared at me with his eyes first wide open and then narrowed angrily . Then he looked a little doubtfully at the Colonel . Colonel Primrose took off his panama and wiped his forehead . " She was ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In any case , Parran , I should think Gould 's fairly well cleared , if Mrs. Latham is certain of her times and Hawkins is certain of his . He could mistake the voice easier than the words. ? Get him back here , Parran . " The old man had not got very far . " Yas , suh , " he said . " It was exactly midnight . There ain ' no doubt in mah min ' . " He shook his snowy kinky head , looking squarely at the State 's Attorney through his gold-rimmed spectacles . " Ah came down here at ten o'clock , an ' Ah read mah Sunday-school lesson twice over , an ' Ah went to bed . An ' Ah woke up . Ah heared Mis ' Gould quarrelin ' ,  | sayin ' she was goin ' to see anybody what she wanted to , an ' it were n't none of nobody 's business . She was talkin ' loud an ' Ah understood what she said , which Ah don ' gen'ally do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yas , sub , Ah 'm sure . She was talkin ' to a lady an ' she was mad as a hornet . " The torn velvet petals flashed into my mind . I turned away , because Colonel Primrose was looking at me with that uncanny X-ray stare of his , and I knew I 'd have to explain what had struck me then as soon as I was alone with him . " Ah thought they was gone then , ' cause Ah heared the do ' run to an ' screech lak a baby owl , the way it does jus " fore it goes plumb to ' cause they ain ' enough grease on it . Then Ah didn ' hear no mo ' soun ' till Ah heared Mis ' Gould laugh an ' start singin ' one of them songs she got . Then Ah didn ' hear no mo ' till Ah heared ' em in the cah . Ah prayed de Lawd , an ' then they was talkin ' under they breath , an ' mighty soon Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' the clock . Then Ah heared the do ' of the garage screech again , lak it was closin ' or openin' ' , but they must have changed they min 's , ' cause the cah didn ' go out . " " You heard the engine ? " " Not fo ' very long Ah didn ' . Ah didn ' hear nothin ' else till ' bout three o'clock . " " You probably dropped off to sleep ? " Colonel Primrose asked . " ' Deed ' n ' Ah didn ' , suh . Ah ain ' got a wink o ' sleep all night . "  | We stood in the tiny little chamber over the garage , listening to him . Below I could hear the men moving about and the deadened tones of their voices through the carpeted floor . I could n't have distinguished a voice through there for the life of me , unless I knew it awfully well . But , of course , Hawkins did know Jim 's voice very well indeed . He 's been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after Hawkins had gone , looking at me with a puzzled expression on his face , blowing his breath between his lips in perplexed little puffs . " Are you sure he was at your place at twelve ? " he said at last . " Quite sure , Colonel Primrose . " He nodded and turned to the State 's Attorney . " In that case , Parran , we 'll have to look a little moving about and the deadened tones of their voices further . " Mr. Parran shook his head dubiously . " If that let- f ter is O.K. , Colonel , " he said dryly , " and she did get hit on the head with the jib , I do n't see that we 've got much of a case . " Colonel Primrose nodded thoughtfully . " I have n't examined the note , " he said . " I 'll get at it this evening . Well , we 've got to find out who the man was who was down there at twelve o'clock , and who the woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his panama on the back of his head in an extremely unmilitary fashion and put his hand on the door . " It may be suicide , Parran . I may be just a nosy  | old man . But if you do n't mind I 'll keep looking around . " Mr. Parran nodded his assent . " I 'd be much obliged if you can help clear up whatever it is , " he said . " I guess I wo n't need this , however . " He took an official-looking paper out of his pocket and started to tear it in two . " You might just keep it awhile , " Colonel Primrose said . " Look in this evening if you have time . " We went downstairs and stood a moment in the garage doorway . Sergeant Buck joined us , or at least took up his accustomed position directly behind the Colonel . One of the men had turned on the radio in Andy Thorp 's car and was having a bit of music as he worked . " They 've fingerprinted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too many people been getting in and out . About all we 'll find is the coroner 's jury . " Sergeant Buck obviously did not think much of the way any of this affair was being conducted . " Found anything ? " Colonel Primrose asked . " I have n't had a chance to look . I 'm waiting till these babies go home to dinner , sir . " We headed towards the Goulds ' cottage , and found Andy at home , which was odd . He spends Sunday morning playing golf and Sunday afternoon sailing , and Sunday evening he goes back to New York . I do n't suppose Lucy Lee or the kids see more than five minutes of him the whole week end . He was lying on the sofa in the cozy chintz-hung living room of the cottage . There were three empty  | cigarette packages and a great quantity of butts and ashes all around the glass ash tray on the floor beside the sofa . Andy 's jaw was slightly bruised  --  which I hoped Colonel Primrose would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Primrose seemed to ignore both his looks and his manner . " Thorp , " he said , " I 'm trying to settle the time that Sandra Gould got here , last night . Could you help me out ? " " I 've told you all I know , " Andy said curtly . " I brought her and George Barrol home . We were all soaking wet , and getting cold . None of us were doing much sitting around . We went on out and got in the car , left Barrol at The Magnolias , came on home and put the car in the garage . And that 's all . " " When did you leave the club ? " " Right after Grace and Jim . Sandra would n't come home at first , and then when one of the colored boys came in and said Jim and a lady had left , she decided she wanted to go . I guess it was about half past eleven . " " And when did you leave the garage , after you 'd put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made his bruised jaw look positively purple . " Oh , it was about five minutes to twelve . She did n't want to stick around . She was sort of crazy wild . Not like herself . She would n't let me go back to the garage with her . " " Why not ? Did she say ? "  | Andy Thorp shook his head . " What did you think ? " " I did n't think anything  --  see ? " Andy shouted suddenly . He glared at us across the room . " Anything she wanted to do was all right with me . I do n't believe in nagging the daylights out of people . " " And you came directly here to the cottage , " Colonel Primrose said imperturbably . Andy moistened his lips and fished about for another pack of cigarettes . " What 's that got to do with it ? " he said sullenly . " Sandra Gould was heard quarreling with another woman a few minutes after she left the garage the first time , " Colonel Primrose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Andy 's purplish chin . " I thought that if you 'd happened to have stayed out for a last smoke  --  say  --  you might have seen who it was . " " Yes ? " Andy said . " Well , I did n't stay out , and I did n't see anybody in the second place . " Colonel Primrose 's eyes twinkled . " And you would n't admit it in the third . Am I right ? " " You are  --  right the first time . " Colonel Primrose nodded good-humoredly . " Is Mrs. Thorp at home ? " " No , she 's not . She 's gone to the other end of the beach to get the kids away from all this damn business . " " You know , Thorp , " Colonel Primrose said as he got up , " I 'm interested in how it happened that you gave Sandra Gould your car keys . She had n't planned going anywhere , had she ? "  | " I told you she 'd left something in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you wanted to change your story ? " " I do n't . And if you would n't mind getting the hell out of here . . . " 9 WE WENT OUT . NOT PRECIPITATELY . . . BUT I do n't think that either of us was sorry to go . I did n't wonder now that Lucy Lee was so upset . " I take it Mr. Thorp was pretty much under Sandra 's spell , " Colonel Primrose said as he went along the crape-myrtle-grown path to the big house where Sandra and Jim had lived with Alice Gould . I do n't know whether Colonel Primrose was surprised at seeing all the Bishop family there in Alice Gould 's long cool living room or not . I was . Not to see Rodman Bishop and George so much , because Rodman and Alice had been very good friends  --  there 'd even been some romantic gossip about them when I was young , after Rosemary and Chapin 's mother died . But it was strange seeing Rosemary and the tall dark man she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared , but I do n't think he was missing much either . He did not seem actually to be watching either Jim or Rosemary , but I noticed that every time Jim reached for a cigarette , even if his back was  | turned Paul Dikranov seemed to be there with his lighter . Rosemary dropped a snapshot Alice Gould was showing her , and he retrieved it , though I should have said he was entirely engrossed in the story of my life . I was only telling it to him to give Rosemary and Jim a chance to look at each other for a moment in the cold light of day . They must have looked rather different to each other those years ago under an Oriental moon . Rodman Bishop was annoyed at me , I think , for bringing the Colonel there . He kept beetling at me , regarding it , I suppose , as a form of fence-sitting on my part . But he looked definitely relieved , I thought , when Colonel Primrose got George Barrol off in a corner and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept wandering , although Paul Dikranov was intelligent and widely traveled and was certainly putting himself out to be entertaining , now that it was his turn . Nevertheless the conversation died  --  in all parts of the room  --  and we found ourselves listening intently to what George was saying . " It hit her squarely on the back of the head . She tried to catch herself . I 'm not much good , you know , at that sort of thing , but I caught hold of her . It was a job , I 'll tell you , because she was heavy , and I was . . . I was pretty scared . I could n't have hung on to her much longer , so it was lucky she came to . In fact ? I do n't really mind admitting it  --  just as she caught hold of the side of the boat I collapsed , rather , and she grabbed me . I do n't remember anything else until I came to on the dock . " " But she was quite all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shore and had a couple of stiff drinks in her , " George said . " She was a little wild . I mean , sort of singing and kicking up her heels . But of course I did n't know her well enough to know whether that 's the sort of thing she 's likely to do . " Colonel Primrose nodded . " Would you have thought it likely that she was planning to take her own life ? " George cast a sideways glance at Rodman Bishop . " Well . . . I would n't like to be awfully positive about it . I . . . I would n't be particularly surprised . Not at anything , really . " Colonel Primrose smiled . So did Rosemary . I think it was the first time they had actually looked at each other . " When they left you at The Magnolias , Mr. Barrol , did Sandra Gould and Mr. Thorp seem to be on good terms ' ? " George was a little perturbed . " I would n't like to say anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go somewhere or do something that he did n't like , or did n't approve of , or something . I 'm not clear about it . You see , they 'd given me quite a lot of straight whisky , after I 'd got up the hill , and I was awfully sleepy . I would n't say I was intoxicated ? " " Nonsense , you were potted when I saw you , " Rosemary said . George flushed . " I just tripped on the stair rug , " he said . " Anyway , you had no business snooping about in the dark . "  | He said it very stiffly . A sudden startled hush fell on the room for just an instant . Fortunately Colonel Primrose did not know the people there well enough to recognize a storm warning when one was hoisted . He turned to Jim Gould , who was standing there , his face drawn in white ridges , his eyes bloodshot from no sleep and too many cigarettes . " I think you ought to know , Mr. Gould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still some question about your wife 's death . If I might venture a piece of advice , I should like to say that for everyone 's peace of mind you ought to let it be definitely settled . . . and permanently settled . " " We want it settled , Colonel Primrose , " Jim said quietly . " We have n't any other idea . " " In that case I suggest that each one of you here give me a brief statement of his whereabouts from half past eleven last night until half past twelve . It seems to be fairly definite that Sandra Gould went into the garage at midnight and did not come out again . " Jim 's face contorted in a spasm of distress . He turned away and stood a moment with his back to us , pressing out his cigarette against the fireplace . " I was with Grace Latham , at her house , until a little before one , " he said . Colonel Primrose nodded . " And when you left her ? you went directly home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine running in the garage as you passed ? " " No. "  | We had all been looking at Jim , but as I glanced away my eye caught Rosemary 's . I do n't even now know what it was in her face that made me all at once infinitely more uneasy than I 'd ever been in my life . I felt curiously as if all these people here that I 'd known so well and so many years had become utterly strange to me  --  even Rosemary and Jim . Alice Gould , of course , I could never hope to understand intimately , or Rodman Bishop . I felt too , just then , some kind of terrible undercurrent of fear , and something more ghastly than fear  --  a sense of something present that was suavely pleasant and at the same time selfishly , callously cruel . Perhaps it does n't make sense now , but it did to me then . After all , I did n't know Dikranov  --  what he felt about Jim , or about Sandra , or about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I knew , of course , that no one there would take the last piece of cake on the plate ; but if it was bread and the last piece in the world  --  what then ? That was nearer to what we were facing . Dikranov would n't push me out of his way on the sidewalk  --  but if I were so seriously in his way that it became his life or mine . . . ? I caught myself from shaking my head abruptly . A great black and yellow bumblebee buzzed against the copper screen and buzzed away again in the lazy flower-scented afternoon . It was hot and still . From the outside April Harbor would appear as it always had done , lying green and lovely , girdled with blue water where sails nestled gaily like white butterflies in a field of cornflowers . And there was murder  | here , stealing like a black patch of tar across a white sandy road . It was then that I had my first vague feeling that we were not yet through with murder here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost a sudden primitive instinct , shocked out of the complacent safety of the summer afternoon , that death here was not satisfied . . . and that it was the more ruthless and terrible because it would wear a friendly face . I looked around at the people there . " But I know them , " I kept telling myself . I 'd known them all my life . . . Jim and little Rosemary , Alice Gould , George and Rodman . Then I remembered that after all Rosemary had been away seven years , and so had George Barrol and Rodman Bishop . Jim had been through hell ; Alice had been through hell for him . I had no way of even remotely knowing what was going on underneath the faces they showed to the world . A verse my father used to recite came into my head : Since all alone , so heaven has willed , we die , Nor even the tenderest heart and next our own Knows half the measures why we smile and sigh . Certainly none knows why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Primrose asked . " I got home with my daughter Mrs. Thorp at half past eleven , " Alice Gould said quietly . " My son came at a few minutes before one . I did n't hear Sandra come in with him . I glanced in her room . She was n't there . About half past two , when she still had n't come in , I went to her room to see if she could have come  | without my hearing her . That 's when I turned on the I ight and saw the note on her dressing table . I read it . Then I went out to look for her . " " You did n't wake your son ? " " No . . , for a number of reasons . My daughterin-law was given to melodrama , a little . I thought I 'd find her somewhere in the grounds , waiting for my son to take a gun out of her hands in the nick of time . I 'd planned to give her a piece of my mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ga-rage ? " Alice Gould paused . " I did n't pass the garage , Colonel Primrose . I went down past my daughter 's cottage and around that way . I thought I heard someone in Mrs. Latham 's garden , and I rather thought it might be Sandra . She was n't always as careful of appearances as I might have liked . I thought possibly she 'd gone back to the clubhouse to dance , and just returned . They dance till three . " She pleated the hem of her handkerchief with delicate jeweled fingers . " When I did n't see anyone in the garden , I called up at Grace Latham 's window . I was a little worried by that time . I thought she might help me find Sandra . I 've come to depend a great deal on Grace . " She smiled charmingly at me . There was too much underlying significance in that gracious tribute to make me altogether happy , but I smiled as well as I could . " She happened to be up already . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't as keen as it once was . Colonel Primrose turned to me . " What were you doing up then , Mrs. Latham ? You presumably went to bed at one o'clock . " " Sheila , my dog , heard someone in the garden and woke me up , " I said . " Did you see anyone ? " " I 'm afraid I did , " I said with a wry smile . " I 'm sorry , but it was you I thought I saw , Mr. Dikranov . " If I 'd shot off a cannon I could n't have surprised them more . Except Mr. Dikranov . He bowed . " I wondered if you had seen me , Mrs. Latham , " he said calmly . " Please do n't look so alarmed , my friends . I was out  --  walking  --  because I could not sleep . I mistook Mrs. Latham 's house for Mr. Bishop 's from the lane , and did not see my mistake until I was close to it . I should have spoken to Mrs. Latham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I did not want to alarm her . " He bowed to me again . The story seemed to me certainly to have a ring of very suave truth . I looked at Colonel Primrose . His head was cocked down and his black eyes contracted intently . He was not looking at Paul Dikranov or at me , but at Rosemary . Her face had suddenly turned as white as a sheet , her gray eyes were fixed on her fiance . Rosemary was afraid  --  that was all I could think of just then . She was white with fear . Jim Gould took a sudden step forward , his face flushed . I do n't know what might  | have happened if there had not been a sudden diversion , so startling in its implication that we forgot Rosemary and Paul Dikranov and Jim . Sergeant Buck 's iron visage appeared in the door . " Excuse me , sir , " he said . Colonel Primrose got up quickly . " What is it , Buck ? " " I found this , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic section . Colonel Primrose took it gingerly and opened it . It was the new monkey wrench that Jim Gould had bought the morning before at Mr. Toplady 's general store , and that I had seen in his hand there . Sergeant Buck pointed down at the end with a large thumb . " That 's what she was hit with , sir . It 's got blood and hair on it . I found it stuck up on a shelf under some paper . It 's got a woman 's fingerprints on it . " I stared at it , horror-stricken . And I knew , of course , that the fingerprints were mine . Colonel Primrose stood staring a long time at the brown matted blur on the bright iron . Everyone 's eyes were glued there in the hushed room . I tried to open my mouth to say , " Those prints are mine , " but my throat was too dry . It was as if somebody had written the single word " Murder " in glaring red letters across the white plaster wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair , and the size of the wound , sir , " Sergeant Buck said . Colonel Primrose looked around the room . He  | said later that each face there stood out quite apart from bodies or clothes  --  seven separate and complete portraits  --  and in not one of them was there surprise , or anything like it . " I knew very well you all knew Sandra Gould had been murdered . . . and that you 'd all known it from the first . " The thought , I suppose , that was uppermost in each mind at that moment was that the best card in the game we were playing against the plump little man and his granite-faced bodyguard  --  his guard , philosopher and friend , he once called him , though Sergeant Buck spoke of himself as the Colonel 's functotumhad been played , and trumped . Rodman Bishop drew his eyes away from that wrench . He stared stubbornly at the Colonel . " You still ca n't explain away Sandra 's own statement that she was determined to end her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " , he said doggedly . " Also , I think practically everybody who might conceivably have a motive for murdering Sandra Gould has a perfectly satisfactory alibi . " He turned to his daughter . " I 'm right in saying you went to your room when you came in at half past twelve ? " Rosemary nodded mechanically . " I had a nightcap with Dikranov , " Mr. Bishop went on , " and left him at his door about a quarter to one . That 's the lot , " he added . " And there you are . " It was n't the lot , of course , as I thought instantly . It did n't include Andy Thorp or Lucy Lee Thorp . It  | did n't include a dozen other people who might have murdered Sandra Gould . But there was another thing about it that was still worse . And Colonel Primrose saw it at once . He wrapped the comic section around the wrench and handed it to Sergeant Buck . " I 'm interested to hear you speak of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Sandra Gould , " he said slowly , " and so tacitly include all of yourselves here . May I ask what motive you yourself  --  for example  --  could have ' ? Or Dikranov , for instance ? " Rodman Bishop 's square face flushed angrily . He was silent , and Colonel Primrose did not press his advantage . He got up , shook hands with Alice Gould and Jim , and went out with his sergeant . I would have gone with him , but Sergeant Buck 's square , large and impassive back was not encouraging . I did go , however , soon after that . Rosemary left with me . Neither of us said anything as we went slowly down the path towards the gap in the hedge . It 's hard to talk to anyone you 've known very well when you are n't sure any more how they feel about important things . Women must grow apart more quickly than men . Not that Rosemary was very different . It was merely , I think , that someone I 'd always connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely unusual man at that . I could n't believe she cared deeply for Paul Dikranov . Yet she was fascinated by him . . . and she was afraid of him . I was  | sure of that ; I did n't see how Rodman Bishop could help seeing it either . As a matter of fact , if I could only have asked Rosemary about the crumpled petals Sandra had torn from her dress , I think the invisible barrier between us would have disappeared . But I could n't , of course . Not any more than I could have spoken to Alice Gould about the suicide note that Sandra had written . Rosemary caught my arm suddenly . We had just come in sight of the garage . Sergeant Buck was there with Hawkins . The old man was protesting volubly as he preceded Buck up the outside stairs that led to his room over the garage . At the same moment Colonel Primrose came out . He saw us and beckoned . " Would you mind going upstairs , Mrs. Latham ? I 'm trying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hurry , will you ? " He looked at his watch . " Quickly , please . " We ran upstairs . Buck opened the door . " Hurry if you 're coming , " he said impassively . We went in . Almost immediately , from below at a point just under Hawkins 's iron bed , came the muffled sound of a man 's voice . " It is exactly five o'clock , " it said , perfectly audibly . " This is Station WFBO , Columbus . Jim Sanderson your announcer . It is five o'clock , Central Standard Time . " And then a clock chimed : one , two , three , four , five . Old Hawkins 's face turned the color of putty . " Fo ' the love of Gawd ! " he quavered . " That 's Mr. Jim , that 's him . . . he gone crazy ! "  | Even before he spoke the little clock on his bureau struck the hour . . . except , of course , that the hour it struck was not five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Primrose stood in the door . He looked gravely at Rosemary Bishop , shaking his head a little . The two of us stood there utterly silent . " I thought there was something odd about a man 's announcing the time he 's committing a murder , " he said . " He knew he 'd have a witness upstairs here  --  if he made enough noise  --  and he knew he would have an alibi for twelve o'clock . Well  --  it 's his one-o'clock alibi we want now . " He hesitated a moment . " You said Mr. Jim Gould left your house at ten minutes to one , Mrs. Latham ? " I felt Rosemary 's fingers tighten on my arm . " Jim was with me at one o'clock , Colonel Primrose , " she said . Her voice was perfectly cool . 10 A BLUEBOTTLE BUZZED IN THROUGH THE OPEN window of Hawkins 's little room under the roof over the Goulds ' two-car garage , and out through the door . I stood there , staring from Rosemary Bishop to the plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected that her simple statement  | that she had been with Jim Gould at one o'clock would be sufficient to clear him of the murder of his wife I do n't know . I do know that the only person in the hot stuffy little room over the garage who was particularly surprised was Sergeant Buck . He made an audible " Tch , tch ! " Colonel Primrose looked rather as if he had been expecting just something of the sort . " Then . . . you both perjured yourselves ? " he inquired casually . " If you want to call it that . " Colonel Primrose shook his head with a sort of kindly impatience . " It is n't what I want to call it , Miss Bishop , " he said . " It 's what the State 's Attorney will instantly see it is . You see , that makes it right up his alley . " He hesitated a moment , looking at her queerly , and went on . " Not so much that Jim Gould was with you when his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you ca n't prove most satisfactorily that you were n't with her , I 'm very much afraid you 'll be charged with murder . " Rosemary 's fingers tightened on my arm . " You sure got yourself out on a limb , miss ! " Sergeant Buck 's harsh worried voice before he snapped back to rigid attention was curiously comforting . I did n't look at Colonel Primrose . He 'd already said that Sergeant Buck under his granite lantern-jawed exterior was a sentimental jelly that only needed a beautiful maiden in distress to make him fairly quiver . There  | was certainly no comfort or sympathy in his own voice . " It 's always a good plan , Miss Bishop , either to tell the truth in the beginning , or keep it to yourself to the very end . It depends on your position  --  in relation to the crime , of course . As it is now , I 'm afraid Buck 's quite right . You 're definitely out on a limb , and Jim Gould 's out there with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back before somebody saws it off , " Rosemary replied coolly . " By all means , if you can , Miss Bishop , " Colonel Primrose said . I did n't look back at the window over the closed garage doors as Rosemary and I crossed through the hedge to my garden . I knew nevertheless that both men were watching us and that so far as Rosemary was concerned the limb they were on was already as good as crashing to the ground . I wondered , too , what Colonel Primrose thought when we did n't go to the house but walked on slowly , down to the lane running along the top of the bank above the beach . Both of us , Rosemary and I , I think , wanted to be somewhere where nobody could listen through walls or from behind closed doors . . . and neither of us trusted Colonel Primrose or Mr. Parran the State 's Attorney further than we could see them , if indeed so far . " I 'm afraid I 'm not very bright , " Rosemary said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of her , walking automatically , quite unaware , I think , of where she was going . " As if it was n't foul enough for Jim already. ?  | And it was me that made him swear he 'd never tell anybody . . . just because I was . . . " She did n't finish . She stopped suddenly . " Oh , I 've got to see him ! " she broke out . " I 've got to , Grace ? now ! " Her dark eyes were almost wild with all sorts of mixed-up passionate emotions that I could n't begin to make out . But I did know very well that she could n't see Jim , just then ; not without cutting off the limb with her own hands , so to speak . " Look here , my dear , " I said . " From all I can see you 've made a bad enough mess as it is without rushing to Jim and making it worse . If he goes off the deep end , you 'll sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him last night . " She nodded . ' ' I ? " But this time I stopped her myself . " Look , darling . If you do n't tell me , I wo n't know anything . And therefore I wo n't have to tell Colonel Primrose anything . Because if I do know it , he 'll get it out of me whether I want to tell it or not . " I suppose I was thinking all the time about the petals clutched in Sandra Gould 's dead fingers . She shook her head . " Then he 'll figure out that the reason I did n't tell you is that I 'm trying to hide something . T think I 'd rather tell you , so . . . so you can tell him . " We had reached the white rail fence at the end of my land and were leaning against it , looking out  | over the blue Chesapeake . Suddenly Rosemary turned away . " I do n't know why we came back . . . this place is so full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten through years of being so close to it . We were looking down at the inlet where they 'd found Chapin Bishop one Sunday morning seven years before . " I might be dead , walking back through all my life that 's worth remembering , " Rosemary said . I saw then that it was n't Chapin she 'd been thinking of , but something else that I would n't know about . Something connected with Jim , and days of lost ecstasy . " Just wait till George blurts out that last night I said I 'd probably kill Sandra before I left here , " she said suddenly . Then she smiled a little . I stared at her . " I do n't know what it is about George that wo n't let him keep his mouth shut . If it was just other people he got into a mess , you could understand it , but it 's mostly himself . " I started to ask her if she had really said that , and changed my mind . If Rosemary did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in spite of a certain natural curiosity . " He has n't changed much , has he ? " I asked . " No . We thought after he got enough to live on he 'd set up a bachelor establishment , but he did n't . You know , he 's not very well . He 's got something that ought to come out , appendix or something  --  but somebody told him people act frightfully odd when they 're  | under ether or avertin and he actually wo n't risk it . Now if that were Paul . . . " She laughed , not very convincingly , and I realized that this was the point we were finally getting at . " Do you suppose that if we gave Paul ether he 'd tell us what he knows about Sandra ? " " Why do n't you just ask him ? " I said . Rosemary stared at the small white handkerchief she 'd tied into a string of hard knots . " I did , " she said shortly . " And what did he say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was yesterday when we were coming back from the club before dinner . I was going to let it go at that , because . . . well , after all , I could n't say , That 's odd , because she certainly recognized you . ' But George could , of course . And did . " " Really ? " She nodded , smiling a little in spite of herself . " He said , Is n't that funny , because I could have sworn she recognized you when you first came in ? do n't you remember , Paul ? ' " " What did Paul do ? " " Paul looked like a war cloud over the Bosporus . And George , having put his foot in it beautifully , tried to get it out . " " And made it worse ? " " Much . He giggled and said but of course Sandra was n't the sort of girl a man would be likely to forget if he 'd once even seen her , and Paul said , on the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | you saw them in every cafe and Palais de Danse in Asia . And so George , to help matters again , said was n't that funny , because that 's where Jim met her . " Rosemary smiled , trying to hide the sudden tears in her eyes . " I suppose it would have gone on indefinitely if Dad had n't told him to shut up . " " But I do n't quite see what all that 's got to do with Paul . " " Do n't you ? " She looked full at me for a moment , and looked away again . " I suppose nobody would  --  but me , " she said after a long time . " Only , you see , he did know her . He must have , because later , you remember , she came up to him and said something about his going out with her for old times ' sake . Do n't you remember ? " " I remember he looked rather blank , " I said , but she shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't want to remember . And . . . well , I would n't want to marry him , because I could n't ever forget . And . . . I 've got to forget all about her , Grace  --  all about there ever having been anybody like her . . if I 'm going on living at all . " She looked out across the water . " It 's been pretty rotten . I do n't seem to have . . . managed things very well . And if . . . if she 's been in Paul 's life too  --  well , it looks as if she 's sort of an albatross round my neck . "  | " You have n't forgotten she 's dead , by any chance , have you , darling ? " " I guess a dead albatross is harder to get rid of than a live one , " she said . " You see , I asked him again on the way home about her . I suppose I was crazy , but . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first . Then he said he thought he had known her , but he also thought we 'd be a lot happier if we did n't pry into each other 's past lives , or something of the sort . Let the dead past bury its dead , that sort of thing . Except , of course , that they do n't stay buried . " We stood looking over the bay . It was almost deserted , the last straggling sailboats heading for the basin . " She called him up while we were at dinner . Pearl recognized her voice . He came back from the phone quite angry . And , Grace , there 's no use beating about the bush . If she was murdered  --  and I guess that 's settled  --  then somebody must have done it . " I looked at her , wondering . " Jim seems to be the favorite . " I was sorry , because she drew back almost as if I 'd struck her . " Or do you really think it was Paul ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly frightened . Because  --  well  --  Paul does n't have a Western notion about the sanctity of human life . They do n't in the East . There are such billions of people  --  one more or less does n't matter , especially if he is n't in the ruling class , or . . . or happens to be a woman . I do n't mean he 's not . . . well , almost overcivilized . He 's mar-  | velous , and all that , Grace . But I 'd be a fool if I did n't see that he could be perfectly ruthless if . . . if he had to be . And if he 'd come here , knowing her before , not expecting to see her . . . oh , do n't you see ? " I did n't , quite . That is , I did n't see whether she was desperately worried for fear it was Paul , or whether deep in her subconscious mind she wanted it to be Paul  --  so that it could n't be Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man to the wolves to save another . " You are n't seriously accusing the man you 're going to marry of murder , are you , darling ? " I inquired as casually as I could . " Or are you going to marry him ? " She did n't answer for so long that I thought she was n't going to . " Last night I told him I would n't marry him unless I knew about Sandra , " she said finally , with a twisted little smile . " I 'm afraid he 'll tell me the same thing  --  after he sees the morning papers . I do n't think he 's the sort that 'll like the idea of my being out with Jim till half past one . Not when I 've told the police I went to bed at half past twelve . " I do n't know how long we would have stood there in the gradually lowering dusk , going over and over the same ground , Rosemary telling me nothing , and not knowing that I knew anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she knew a great deal that she 'd never tell . I 'm not sure that it would have done much good , because the things she did let slip meant nothing to me , and did n't later  --  not until I saw them  | neatly spliced together with others , and knotted and woven into one of the most deadly nets that ever trapped a jungle beast . Because that was what Colonel Primrose had insisted that he was after from the beginning , no matter how fair-seeming and pleasingly gentle its face or how velvet its claws . It seemed a bit fanciful when he said it . It would n't seem so now , when we know how terribly bloody those claws were , how narrow the road that some of us had walked with death . While we were still standing there , looking out over the bay , a strange thing happened . We both heard someone coming along the lane from our left . That in itself was n't startling , although the lane is n't used very much . The startling thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely stealthy fashion , coming on a little ways , stopping to give an elaborate pantomime of just standing there enjoying the evening mosquitoes and not really looking behind him at all . He was doing that for the second time when we recognized Andy Thorp and saw that he had something inside his gray flannel jacket , pinioned under his arm by the simple act of having one hand in his trousers pocket and his elbow against his side . He stopped before he got as far as my gate and looked around again . Then he dived with extraordinary speed down the bank towards the beach . We heard a few rocks fall , and after a moment Andy appeared again . He brushed the dirt off his legs , emptied the sand and gravel out of his sneakers  --  using both hands  --  and  | strolled back the way he had come . He had not looked our way once , though I discovered later that we had been pretty well concealed behind the tall bunches of Queen Anne 's lace that grew along the lane and along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Rosemary whispered . It showed how furtive an air Andy Thorp had had , in spite of his nonchalance . Neither of us had spoken . In fact we 'd practically held our breath . " It means that he got rid of whatever he had under his arm , " I said . Rosemary shivered . " It 's getting cold . Let 's go up to the house , " she said , slipping her arm into mine . It was trembling . She glanced behind us several times on our way up the path , and when a large square figure loomed quite suddenly in front of us she started violently and gave a sharp frightened gasp before she saw who it was . I had n't realized what a highly nervous state she was in till then  --  although as a matter of fact the appearance of Sergeant Buck , standing at a sort of modified attention in the shadow of the crape myrtle hedge , had been a little abrupt . " The Colonel ordered me to tell you ladies you 're not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reported stiffly . Then he added , to Rosemary , " It ai n't safe , miss , not when a killer 's loose . Take it from me , the Colonel knows what he 's talking about . I been with him twenty-eight years , and he ai n't never been wrong yet . " Then , with an almost imperceptible coming to  | present arms , he waited for us to pass , and fell in as a rear rank , and marched us up to the house in a sort of squads right . There was something very comic about it , but there was also something definitely reassuring , though it was n't at all dark yet . Rosemary had quit trembling , and she did n't look back again . " I guess I 've got the jitters , " she said as we came up on the porch into what I erroneously had regarded as the privacy of my own home . I had not counted on my guest . He was in the living room . More than that , Mr. Parran was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city . They were around a table , bending over a small gray sheet of note paper . I did n't have to get a very close look at it to see that it was Sandra 's suicide note . They had two other pieces of paper that they were apparently comparing it with . " I hope we 're not intruding , " I said . Colonel Primrose cocked his head down and peered up at me . He grinned . " Not at all , Mrs. Latham . Come right in . " He said it as cordially as later he invited me Into his own yellow brick house on P Street in Georgetown . " Awfully kind of you , " I said . The quick amused flicker in the snapping black eyes disappeared instantly as he looked past me to Rosemary . She was just inside the door . Her face was like wax , and I had a sudden feeling that it had just turned that way , from something she had seen as we came in . I glanced around as unobtrusively as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large bulk of Law  --  so  | that whatever was on the table by the fireplace was out of my view . I hesitated , with Colonel Primrose watching me , to step deliberately around to where I could see . Furthermore , it was perfectly apparent that they would be glad when we left . So we went  --  as far as the kitchen . Nobody has servants Sunday nights in April Harbor  --  they all go to church and we get our own suppers , usually everybody at somebody else 's house . I got Rosemary a glass of water . She drank some of it and put the glass down , staring at it on the table in front of her , opening and closing her fingers around it , watching the warm prints of her hot fingers against the cold surface fade out and disappear as the glass cooled . " It 's funny to think they 're still there . . . and that they could make them come out again , " she said abstractedly , nodding towards the living room door . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . I was a little worried . She did n't pay any attention to me , just kept on making the prints on the frosty glass and watching them go out . " Can they find them on cloth ? " she asked . " I think so . " She emptied the glass into the sink and started to set it down when she stopped , listening . Outside there was a faint scrabbling sound coming towards the door . It did n't sound like an animal . ' We waited , a little breathless probably , until there emerged out of the dusk the stocky sober little figure  | of young Andy Thorp junior . His face was streaked where two big tears had been wiped resolutely towards his ears with dirty little fists . He blinked at us for a moment . " Hello , Aunt Grace . Is Juyus here ? " he said sturdily . " No , Andy . He 's at church . Can I do something for you ? " He stood there irresolute , his four years weighing heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Juyus helped me find Daddy once , and I fought he 'd help me again , " he said . We stared at him for an instant . Then Rosemary sprang up and went over to him and picked him up in her arms . " Oh , you lamb ! " she said . " I 'll help you find him ! " She was weeping , but young Andy was n't . " Do n't cry . Men do n't like people that cry all the time . That 's why Daddy does n't like . . . " Some sixth sense propelled Rosemary out with him . . . or perhaps she 'd seen the pantry door move . She and young Andy were gone just as Colonel Primrose cocked his head into the kitchen and followed it immediately . " I wish you 'd go away , " I said . " I know you do . " He smiled and shook his head sympathetically . " But if I did , you 'd be out hunting Andy too , and it is n't safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant after Rosemary . " " No , " he said . " Rosemary 's safe enough . " I stared at him , my mouth slightly open , I 'm afraid . He grinned . " Do you know , Mrs. Latham , you seem to me a curious example of ' a bright woman being almost abysmally stupid  --  or perhaps obtuse is a better word ? " " Meaning ? " He sat down and looked at me intently . " Meaning that  --  like Gaul  --  all people who are around in an affair like this are divided into three parts . Those who are trying to find the murderer . The murderer himself , who is trying to hide . And thirdly , those well-intentioned  --  or not well-intentioned-people who are trying to hinder the investigation . So far , we 've got Parran and myself in the first group . The second group is X  --  still unknown . " " And . . . the third ? " " The third group is enormous , Mrs. Latham . " His eyes sharpened , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In fact , Mrs. Latham , it includes  --  besides all the Goulds and the Bishops  --  such oddly assorted people as yourself and my Sergeant Buck . " " Sergeant ? " " Exactly . I told you he had a heart of jelly . He also has a deep and abiding conviction that women are the root of all evil  --  and I 've never seen him anything but a complete fool when he meets a pretty one in trou-  | ble . Now , I have a great weakness for Woman . . . " " But not individual woman ? " He chuckled . " Perhaps that 's putting it a little strong . I ? " There was a sudden elaborate clearing of a throat just outside , and the harshly disapproving face of Sergeant Buck appeared in the open window over the sink . I felt pretty silly , and also definitely annoyed , because it was perfectly obvious that Sergeant Buck was convinced I had the basest designs on his wretched colonel . 11 IT WAS AFTER NINE WHEN I RAN ACROSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended going out alone after what Colonel Primrose had said , but when I saw him and Mr. Parran and their small cohort leaving the place I changed my mind . Rosemary and George Barrol were on the screened front porch . I spotted them by the two small red dots of their cigarettes . George got up and opened the door . " Come in  --  we were just going over . Your Hawkshaw 's got Paul on the carpet , " he said . " What 'll you have ? Scotch ? " " Nothing . " I sat down on the foot of the wicker chaise longue where Rosemary was sitting . " Did you find Andy ? "  | " He was home  --  said he had n't been out , " she answered . " He said Lucy Lee had taken the kids over to her mother 's and he guessed young Andy had decided he 'd stick with him , and probably had got scared and so on . Children are n't particularly reliable . " " They make up things , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knee that the less said about Andy 's strange antics in the lane the better . Unless we wanted George to blurt it out suddenly at the most inopportune moment . " I wonder what he 's saying to Paul ? " Rosemary said . " I wonder what he was saying to old Potter ? " George put in . I looked at him in complete astonishment . " Dr. Potter ? " " Did n't you know he was at your place this evening ? I went over to find Rosemary , and Potter was coming out , wiping the perspiration off . I said hello and he jumped a foot . What about that rumor that Sandra Gould had him going six ways for Sun-day ? " " Dr. Potter ? " I gasped . George looked at me , surprised and a little chagrined . " Do n't tell me I 've put my foot in it again , " he said sheepishly . " I thought everybody knew about it . Elsie Carter told me yesterday afternoon that he was just another one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oyster when I saw him coming out of your place . I 'm sorry , but I did n't know ? "  | " Of course you did n't . . . but , darling , if you could only keep what you do n't know to yourself , " Rosemary said patiently . It 's lucky she had eyes in the back of her head , because I should never myself have noticed that Paul Dikranov was coming . She caught my look of surprise as she turned suddenly . " It 's his cigarette , " she said softly . " They 're something special from the Balkans . " I caught the pleasant fragrance of Eastern tobacco as he came out . . . tall and slender and dark , and always polite and a little elegant . " Good evening , Mrs. Latham . Your colonel 's gone . He is a very shrewd man . " He stood in the doorway , towering above all of us , the dim light of the living room behind him making him still taller and darker . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nerves that made me suddenly intensely uneasy . Or maybe it was the slightly sibilant emphasis with which he said , " He is a very shrewd man . " George ; I Barrol must have felt something too . He laughed nervously , and would no doubt have said something unwise if Rosemary had not stepped in . " Why do n't we have a rubber of bridge ? " George jumped up . " Good idea  --  I 'll get the table . " Paul Dikranov moved aside for him to pass . Then he did a rather odd thing . He stepped to Rosemary 's side , took her hand and raised it to his lips . George , still in the door , laughed nervously again .  | " Oh , dear , " he said . " Rosemary , I 'll bet the Colonel 's told him all . " Dikranov shook his head . " On the contrary , George . The Colonel can tell me nothing . I merely salute the lady I love . " Somewhere in the house the telephone jangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's yours , Grace , " George said . " I 'll answer for you . " He went on in while I waited . We 're all on one rural line , so that you can answer your phone at anybody 's house . When George came back he had the bridge table and the cards . " It 's your colonel , Grace , " he said . " He 's bellowing Hello , hello , ' and nobody 's on the line . They must have hung up . " He set up the table , Paul Dikranov helping . Our bridge was n't very successful . Dikranov and I collected $1.8o from Rosemary and George at 11 : 30 , and I went home . George went with me  --  at least to the hedge . I did n't expect him to go farther , because he does n't like being out alone in the dark and I 've never minded . Colonel Primrose was in the living room when I came in . He 'd pulled a table out into the middle of the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced up when I came in , nodded and pushed back his chair . I looked at the table , and my heart sank to my boots . In the middle of it , on a piece of white note paper  | that had been taken from my desk , were two crumpled blue velvet petals . I stared at them while he looked calmly at me . " Sit down , Mrs. Latham , " he said . " I want to ask you some questions . " As he spoke he reached for a leather envelope and dulled the zipper around to open it . I sat down with a pretty sickening sense that he was putting it up to me , and that I 'd have to decide quite definitely whether I was hunting with the hounds or running with the foxes . He reached into the leather case and brought out the gray sheet of note paper that Alice Gould had found on Sandra 's dressing table , and laid it carefully on the table by the blue petals . He took another piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it on the table too . Then he looked at me and said , surprisingly , " I want you to tell me about your telephone . " " My telephone ? " He nodded soberly . " Well , it 's a rural phone , with a bell attachment , " I said . " There are a dozen or so of us on the line . In fact there 's only one single-party line in the place , and that 's at the club . It 's arranged so the men can have a private wire for business . The other system 's always been here , and we get along with it . You complain a lot when you ca n't ever get the line , and when you know somebody like Elsie Carter 's listening in . But that 's the country phone . Why ? "  | He looked at me for an instant , his black eyes gleaming a little . " It 's just that that interests me , " he said slowly . " The listening in . There 's somebody on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your phone . I want to know who it is . " " I 'm afraid I do n't know how you 'll find out , Colonel Primrose , " I said . " The operator in the village does n't get a signal unless you crank . " He nodded . " I guessed that , " he said . " No , I ca n't find out . But you can find out for me  --  if you will . Will you ? " I hesitated . " You 're afraid , are n't you ? Afraid of ? " " Afraid of spying on my friends ? Yes . I suppose I am . After all , Sandra Gould caused enough trouble when she was alive ? " He shook his head again , looking at me queerly . " Has n't it occurred to you , Mrs. Latham , that the person who murdered Sandra Gould may just conceivably not be a friend of yours ? " " What do you mean ? " I said . He chuckled suddenly . " The determination with which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you is a little . . . amusing . However , I 've got to have some inside help . " He stopped , thinking intently a moment . " Let 's put it this way , Mrs. Latham . You get me the information I want . If it involves someone you do n't want involved , then you can keep it to yourself ? on the condition that you do keep it to yourself .  | That you do n't , in that case , give me away either . Will you do that ? " I nodded  --  not very happily ; and he nodded with some satisfaction . " All right then . There 's one other point about your phone , Mrs. Latham . " His eyes were fastened on mine in a sharpened sort of calculation , as if he was trying to decide whether to trust me a little further . I moved uneasily . All things being equal , I 'd just as soon he did n't . " You have n't been as close to your phone as Lilac and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised , I suppose . He went on . " Someone has been calling you up , and then hanging up without speaking . Now , whether they 've expected you to answer and did n't care to talk to me or your cook , and have rung off for that reason , I do n't know . It might simply be that . " " You mean that after you answer the phone they hang up without speaking ? " He nodded . " It 's happened a number of times . Once while you were out earlier today , and three times while you and Rosemary were down at the lane this evening . " " While Dr. Potter was here ? " I asked  --  rather craftily , I thought . He shot me a quick glance . " And after he left , " he said calmly . " But what interests me most is that they called last night about 3:15 , when you were out of the house . That 's what woke me up , and that 's how I knew you were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . "  | " But you were sure they 'd not hung up  --  because you did wait so long ? " He shook his head . " No , I traced that call . This morning , after I had breakfasted with your undertaker . " I waited for him to go on , quite unconsciously holding my breath . " It came from the pay box at the foot of Church Street in the village . The operator did n't know whether it was a man or a woman . " " In the village . . . at a quarter past three ? " I demanded . " That 's ridiculous ! " " Why ? " " Well , I mean people do n't go about calling you up at quarter past three and hanging up . Not unless they 're very tight . " " Or are under a great strain , Mrs. Latham . The strain of having murdered somebody , for instance . Or of thinking perhaps that they know who did murder somebody . " All this left me completely in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up ? " Colonel Primrose hesitated . " I 've also traced this afternoon 's calls , " he said . " Where do they come from ? " " The operator ca n't tell me definitely . It 's a twoparty line . One of the parties is the vestry room of St. John 's Church in the village . I suppose that 's a semipublic phone . " " I would n't know about that . " He nodded .  | " You see , Mrs. Latham , this is a fairly common psychological phenomenon . Someone has something weighing on his mind . He 's projecting himself by means of the telephone into the heart of this wretched business for a number of possible reasons . He might want to talk and decide to talk , then back down when he gets his party . He might just want to see that we 're still here ; he might be keeping tab on you . However , that 's not the point . " " What is it , then ? " I said meekly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings ? whether it 's a genuine call or your mysterious caller who hangs up immediately I answer  --  someone is listening in . The presumption is that it 's not our shy friend at any time  --  for a reason that I 'm about to tell you . It 's some one of your neighbors , in other words , Mrs. Latham . Now . . . will you find out which one ? " " My dear man , " I said , " do n't be silly ! How can I ? " He chuckled , and then became instantly serious . " I 'll tell you , " he said . " It 's quite simple . The person who 's listening in betrays himself , unconsciously , every time he does it . He has a clock , close to his phone and quite audible . " I thought quickly of all my neighbors ' telephones . The Goulds ' clock is on the mantel , their downstairs phone in the hall , the upstairs one in Alice Gould 's room by her bed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't possibly remember , try as I would , where  | Lucy Lee 's phone was or whether there was a clock by it . " It is n't unusual for a clock to be by the phone , " I said . " A dozen people could have one there . " Colonel Primrose nodded . " I know . This is a rather special clock . It has a very odd little hippityhop in the tick . You 'll notice it the first thing . Furthermore , it 's not a big clock , I should think . Not likely to be in the living room or the hall . " He looked at me steadily . " Suggest anything to you already ? " " No , " I said . " It does n't . And you mean you 'd like me to go snooping about people 's bedrooms listening to the ticking of their clocks . " He nodded calmly . " Something of the sort . And remembering always , if you want to , that if you find out something , and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell anybody else . " He looked at me with a queer little chuckle . " Well , that 's settled , then . Now  --  about this . " He picked up the piece of gray note paper that Alice Gould had got from Sandra 's dressing table and handed it to me . I took it , trying to keep my hand from trembling as I did . " Mrs. Latham , " he said , very earnestly . " Are you sure , beyond any doubt , that that 's Sandra Gould 's writing ? " I could n't trust myself to speak , so I nodded as calmly as I could . He took it back , laid it carefully down on the  | table in front of him and looked down at it with a puzzled scowl . " This mystifies me , " he said . " I ca n't understand it . I was sure this was a forgery . Because this woman was murdered , Mrs. Latham  --  and what 's more , there 's not one of you here that has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just written a plain , definite suicide note . " He shook his head , staring down at the little gray oblong . " Is this at all like Mrs. Gould 's writing , Mrs. Latham ? " I smiled , thinking of Alice 's delicate precise little script , and the naive childish flamboyant scrawl in front of him . " Not in the least , Colonel Primrose , I should say . No , I 'm certain that 's Sandra 's writing . " His sparkling black eyes , shrewd and sharp and bright as an old parrot 's , looked steadily into mine . " It 's absurd , is n't it , " he said slowly , " to think for a minute that that woman , in such a situation , would be so obliging as to kill herself  --  or even that the idea of threatening to would enter her mind . Especially just before she was murdered . " " Are you sure she was murdered , Colonel Prim-rose ' ? " " Very sure , Mrs. Latham . So are you . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was hit over the head by the jib ? " He nodded . " Probably . Also by Mr. Jim Gould 's monkey wrench. "  | He hesitated a moment , and added  --  quite unnecessarily , I thought , " Which has your fingerprints all over it . " I probably flushed a little . " I told you I picked it up when I stumbled over it on the garage floor . " He nodded absently . " I know . " We were silent for a moment . " Do you think she knew Paul Dikranov ? " I asked . " Certainly . " " Does he admit it ? " " No . But he 's a very shrewd fellow . " " That 's just what he said about you , a few minutes ago , " I said . Colonel Primrose 's eyes brightened humorously . " That 's bad . I was just going to add that shrewd fellows often come pretty hard croppers . " " He also told Rosemary he did n't know Sandra . " " I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East  --  which is quite true , of course . " " Where does he come from ? " " He 's a Georgian . Money from oil concessions ? and also , I take it , from supplying arms to natives in one place and another . " " Has he explained what he was doing barging about in my garden at three o'clock in the morning ? " Colonel Primrose cocked his head down and gave me an amused sideways glance . " Can you have any possible doubt , Mrs. Latham , that he was interviewing  --  or planning to interview ? the late Mrs. Gould ? " I stared at him . " Do you believe that ? "  | " I do n't know , Mrs. Latham . Besides , I thought it was more important to get explanations from all the people who were barging about the Goulds ' garage at one o'clock . " " Oh . And did you ? " " Not very satisfactory ones , " he admitted cheerfully . " No . For instance  --  I still do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandra . Whether it was Rosemary ? " He paused an instant . I tried mightily not to look at the blue petals on the table . They loomed up at me as big as a peony . " Or Lucy Lee . Jealousy is one of the most powerful irritants . Or ? " He looked at me steadily a second before he added , " ? Mrs. Alice Gould . " " I suppose , " I said , " there was a woman there ? Hawkins did n't just make it all up ? " Colonel Primrose nodded . " That 'll be the defense stand , certainly . However , so far there 's no reason to believe Hawkins has misled us . " " Are you sure ? " I said . " He hated Sandra . Like everybody else he was convinced she ruined Jim 's life . He always called her a foreign devil . Anyway , could n't he have heard a quarrel over the radio , the way he did Jim announcing the time ? " " Are you the official Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a chuckle . " I 'd just like to save you from making a mistake . I understand from your sergeant that so far you 've never been known to make one . "  | He laughed . " I believe in Hawkins 's woman , myself . You know , of course , that the whole business looks definitely on the womanish side . " I looked at him aghast at that . " It was all easy for a woman to do . Nothing mannish required . The spilt whisky , the crack on the head with the wrench  --  a slight blow , Mrs. Latham ; you 'd have thought a strong person would have struck harder than that . Then this telephone nonsense . Also the motive . From the so-called a priori evidence , I should say more women would have cause to hate Sandra Gould than men  --  always excepting her husband . " " You mean you have n't excepted him ? " " We examine all sides of the business , Mrs. Latham  --  with a view to forestalling Nathan Kaufman when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Colonel Primrose stopped a little suddenly . " But . . . " I said . " But people do n't usually hire him unless they 're guilty as the devil , Mrs. Latham . " " Jim Gould did n't hire him . " Colonel Primrose smiled so that his black eyes were lost for an instant in a network of humorous wrinkles . " No  --  but Rodman Bishop did . " For a moment I did n't get the possible significance of that  --  and when I did the chance had passed .  | 12 SUDDENLY MY TELEPHONE JANGLED , EERILY IN THE silent house . One long ring , three short , sounding in every house in our end of the estate . I looked at Colonel Primrose . There was something definitely ominous about it  --  about going to the phone and finding no one there . . . no sound but a ticking clock . He nodded to me . I got up slowly . " You 'll listen for the clock , wo n't you , " he said quietly . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't , I could n't  --  but his eyes were fixed on me steadily , and there was something horribly like a command under the suave reminder . I went towards the door . The telephone jangled again . It 's strange , I thought , how an inanimate object can take on a sudden startling malevolence . My hands were icy cold as I took down the receiver and held it to my ear , listening a moment before I said " Hello . " Colonel Primrose was right . It was there ; I could hear it distinctly . Tickety-tick , tickety-tock ; ticketytick , tickety-tock . " Hello , " I said , making my voice sound as natural as I could . Instantly there came a frantic , perfectly familiar voice . " Oh , Grace , they 've stopped Andy , on the plane  | up . They would n't let him go ! What are they doing ? Grace , you 've got to find out for me ! " It was Lucy Lee 's voice . . . and beyond it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primrose , darling , " I said , a great deal more calmly than I felt with that ticketytick , tickety-tock beating in my ears  --  barely perceptible actually if I had n't been so morbidly aware of it . " They probably wanted him to be here tomorrow just in case they open the inquest again . " And then I did something that made me feel like a snake in the grass . I said , " Where are you , Lucy ? " It suddenly came to me that I had to know where that tickety-tick , tickety-tock came from . " I 'm at home  --  at Mother 's . But , Grace  --  tell Colonel Primrose Andy was in the house at twelve , last night ! He was , Grace , really ! " " I 'll tell him , Lucy Lee . You go to bed . It 'll be all right . " Tickety-tick , tickety-tock ; tickety-tick , ticketytock . I could hear it sounding in my ears when Lucy hung up , and after I hung up . I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to Colonel Primrose . The idea came to me at first that I could n't let him know I 'd heard it too . But he knew it without my telling him , although he did n't mention it . " Why have they stopped Andy ? " He glanced up inquiringly . " Was it Lucy Lee ? "  | I nodded . " He was boarding the plane . " He looked blank . I explained that a lot of the men at April Harbor had jobs in Philadelphia and New York and chartered a plane every summer . It picked them up Saturday noon or Friday night sometimes and debouched them in the landing field that was actually the first hole of the golf course , and picked them up again Sunday at midnight . " I gather Andy was boarding it to go back to New York when Parran 's men stopped him , " I said . " Do n't say you did n't know anything about it . " " I knew they had an eye on him . I should n't have supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't suppose Andy 's boss takes much interest in his family affairs , " I said . Colonel Primrose got up and went to the door . I think he was rather more disturbed than he cared to have seen . He started abruptly when the phone rang again . One long , three short . We looked at each other , I suppose both wondering whether there would be anybody there or not . " If you hear that clock again , and anybody answers you , " he said , " will you please say that I 've left April Harbor on the night plane ? " I looked blank myself . The phone rang again . " Theirs not to reason why , " said Colonel Primrose politely . " Sorry , " I said . I went through the swinging door to the inner hall . If I had known he 'd cut up to my room and was listening in himself , I should have been  | pretty sore . But I did n't . I had not yet realized what the business of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the phone . It was Jim Gould . " Grace , " he said hurriedly . " Listen ! ! " I was listening  --  for the tickety-tick , tickety-tock ; and I heard it . . . in the background , Jim 's voice urgent against it . " Tell Rosemary they 've set the time at one o'clock ? not twelve . " I could have wept . " She knows it already , Jim . And she 's told Colonel Primrose she was with you then . " There was a long silence in which I heard nothing but the odd ticking of that ghastly clock . Then Jim Gould groaned . " 0 God ! " he said . I knew then for the first time since the dreadful thing happened that Jim was really feeling something besides shock and anger and humiliation . " And listen , Jim , carefully . Colonel Primrose told me to say that he 'd gone on the night plane . " There was another pause . The clock beat its tiny rhythmic noise . " Yes ? " Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We hung up . I stood there a few seconds , wondering suddenly if Colonel Primrose had made all that up about the mysterious caller . It came to me then that I had n't seen Sergeant Buck , not since I 'd come back from the Bishops ' . I looked into the kitchen , thinking Lilac and Julius must be back from church . But they were n't . The outside door was shut and probably  | locked . Nevertheless I went over and tried it . I had a vague uneasy feeling that would n't down . went back into the living room . Colonel Primrose was not there , and he had moved the exhibits of the prosecution . I remembered then that he had n't shown me either the petals of blue velvet or the second piece of paper , the one folded into a pleated spill , the sort of thing that an Englishman keeps in a jar on the mantel to light his pipe with . I do n't suppose , actually , that it would have made any difference if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times it might have . It certainly would n't have made any difference in what happened that night , as it turned out . Sheila , my Irish setter , was lying on the cool stone hearth where she 'd been asleep all evening . She got up while I stood hesitating in the middle of the room . I did n't know whether to turn the lights out and go upstairs or not  --  having , as I said , little notion of the house habits of detectives . It was hot , and I was pretty miserable about all this . Sheila licked my hand and went over to the door , looking back , inviting me to come out with her . I went out on the porch . The stars were out , and the night perfectly still . I forgot Colonel Primrose 's repeated injunctions  --  at least I did n't think of them as I opened the porch door and went down the brick walk to the cluster of white Gibson Island chairs stationed there like sentinel ghosts in the middle of the lawn under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt her long red  | body stiffen . I caught hold of her collar . She growled again . Then I heard someone moving very softly on the grass . I could n't have told the direction that the sound came from except that Sheila was looking past the tree towards the Bishops ' place , but not towards their house . And then , as softly and undeniably as any sensory evidence can be felt , I knew that it was Paul Dikranov , somewhere in the line of shrubbery that divides my place from theirs . The faint unmistakable odor of Turkish tobacco came gently through the warm soft air . For a moment I thought of calling out , but Sheila 's deep bass growl seemed warning enough , probably , that I was not alone . I turned back to the house , and then I stopped as abruptly as I had ever stopped in my life . Somewhere behind me there was a sharp crack that split the air , and simultaneously a hot streak zip-whizzed past my ear . A sudden instinct , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my children , made me first duck and then flatten myself out on the grass . Or maybe it was sheer blue funk . Anyway , I did , and I was glad I had , because there was a second crack and another shot screamed through the air about where my shoulder blades had been . Sheila , who 's gunshy , scuttled to the house whimpering . It all happened in an instant , and in another instant I heard heavy feet pounding across the grass , and saw Sergeant Buck coming with amazing speed . He took one look at me , still lying there on the grass in the starlight . At first I thought he said , " Thank God ,  | you 're not hurt , " but he did n't ; he said , " Thank God , you 're not the Colonel , " and dashed off toward the direction of the shots . I sat up , took a trial breath  --  rather the way George Barrol had done after he was nearly drowned ? got up gingerly and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I was ever so completely and utterly scared in my life . I did n't wait for Buck to come back or for Colonel Primrose to appear from somewhere ; I went upstairs and locked my door behind me . I should very much have liked to crawl under the bed with Sheila . I turned out my light and lay there pretty shaken , trying to figure out just why Paul Dikranov wanted to shoot me , of all people under the sun . The sudden jangle of the phone on my bedside table made me jump almost out of my skin . " Hello , Grace ! " It was Alice Gould . " Are you all right ? The Sergeant was here , looking for Jim . He says you were shot at ? " " I 'm all right , " I said . " I was shot at , and missed . Tell Jim ? " " But , darling , that 's the point  --  Jim is n't here . " " Is n't there ? " " No . He 's not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and to the Colonel . " Oh , dear ! " I said . And then for the first time I realized that I was not hearing the tickety-tick , tickety-tock of the unknown clock .  | " Alice , " I almost shouted into the phone , " where " Where am I ? " The gentle worried voice was puzzled . " At home , of course , dear . We must find Jim , Grace , do n't you see ? " I 'm afraid I did see , clearly . In fact a number of things . One of them was that the clock that I 'd heard when both Lucy Lee and Jim had spoken was not near the phone their mother was using . Which meant one of two things , of course . Either Alice Gould was not at her own phone , or whoever had been listening in on my two previous conversations had not been listening to this one . And that in turn implied enough to make me even more uneasy than I 'd been before . For my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding whose phone the clock was near . I turned out the light . Colonel Primrose 's remark that Sergeant Buck was a good man to have around in case of trouble went through my head , or I doubt if I 'd have gone to sleep as promptly as I did . I turned out the light . But I did n't go to sleep . Every time I closed my eyes I could hear footsteps and creeping sounds ? on the paths outside , in the hall , downstairs . My reason knew they were nonexistent , but my nerves did n't . Nor was Colonel Primrose 's remark that Sergeant Buck was a good man to have around in case of trouble entirely reassuring . I could n't feel that he would take my removal as a great personal tragedy in any sense . If I were a logical person I suppose I should have quietly put every event of the last two days into a neat  | little category . . . and come to a perfectly erroneous conclusion . I certainly could n't have got anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I am  --  though I must admit it was all there , even then , for anyone who was logical to see . However , I 'm not ; and furthermore I was a lot nervier than I like to admit even now . There 's something definitely upsetting about being shot at like a rabbit on your own front lawn . So I lay there , not thinking it out so much as just seeing it in a jumble of sudden vivid pictures , such as Sandra saying to Dikranov , " Just for old times ' sake , hein ? " and Dikranov 's lean expressionless face . With that picture came the instant question , Why did he deny knowing her ? And why was he in my garden ' ? Why should he of all people shoot at me of all people ? What connection did he really have with Sandra , what did he mean when he told Rosemary that the less they inquired into each other 's previous lives the better off they 'd be ? I thought of Lucy Lee then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps with the lightning flashing above her , and again in my house willing to hand over Jim 's head on a charger to save her husband 's . And what about Andy ? Why had he been in such a ghastly state at the inquest ? What had he stowed away under the bank ? Why had they kept him from going to New York ? And I could see Jim Gould , with Sandra wilting against his arm , and then with his white set face in front of my fireplace , utterly silent . Why had he gone directly to his own car to find  | Sandra , instead of to Andy 's ? Why had his mother still been dressed at half past three in the morning ? Why had she insisted on going to the garage ? Did she know Sandra was there , was she definitely preparing me , when she told me Sandra had tried to kill herself , for what she had decided I must find ? And that note . . . What would Colonel Primrose say when he learned it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing that was definitely terrifying , was the business of the telephone . Who could conceivably have phoned from the pay station in the village at 3:15 on the morning Sandra was killed , and what could he have wanted ? And who was it whose clock sounded on the line with that sinister little tickety-tick , tickety-tock . . . and what did he want ? I must have gone to sleep thinking of that , because I came to suddenly and sat bolt upright in bed . The clock on the table said 3:28 . It was dark and perfectly still . For a moment I was n't quite sure what had waked me . Then I reached for the phone . " Hello , " I said . I waited . Then I spoke again , and suddenly remembered . There was no sound at the other end of the wire  --  that is , no sound of a voice ; only a steady ticking of a clock : tickety-tick , ticketytock ; tickety-tick , tickety-tock . I had a strange panicky feeling , and I rattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Tickety-tick , tickety-tock ; tickety-tick , tickety-tock . For a fleeting moment I wondered if I could n't hear someone breathing . Then I did hear a definite sound .  | It came from the telephone in my own guest room , and it came quite sharply . " Would you mind hanging up , Mrs. Latham ? I 'm trying to put a call through . " I gasped , but I hung up , the idea that I would certainly be glad when my guests had departed running through my mind . I turned over to sleep again , not even trying to figure out what this was all about . And when I woke up again it was the telephone that woke me , and I reached for it quite cheerfully . A thing that is a terror by night can be a diverting game in the broad light of day . But it was Alice Gould this time . " Grace , " she said , " would you come over as soon as you 're dressed ' ? I 'd like to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice was cool and unhurried . A quick memory of the two shots the night before and the soft persistent tickety-tick , tickety-tock in my ear again were all that made the request seem an urgent one . I got up and was dressed when Lilac came in with my tray . The idea of Alice Gould creeping about , listening in on other people 's telephone conversations , seemed pretty absurd , I thought as I took a spoonful of fragrant yellow melon . But when I came to think of it , anybody I knew doing it was equally absurd . Leaving out Elsie Carter , of course , who 's a born snooper , or Maggie Potter , who has n't anything else to do , but who , as it happens , is n't on our line . I could n't have told why her name came to my mind just then . Perhaps it was because what George had said about Sandra  | and Dr. Potter had slipped into my mind the way things do without any apparent reason . Colonel Primrose and Sergeant Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julius intercepted me as I was slipping out . " The Colonel , Mis ' Grace , he says he wants to see you as soon as it 's convenient . " " You tell him it 'll be convenient a little later , Julius . " " Yas 'm . Ah 'll tell him that mahself . " I cut through the hedge to the Goulds ' and saw him . He and Sergeant Buck and Mr. Parran , with four or five other men , were standing in front of the garage , talking earnestly . Colonel Primrose was giving directions , or so it looked from the way he was pointing this way and that . I slipped back and went farther down towards the lane . I did n't want to be seen just then , and there was another opening in the hedge , one that led directly into Andy and Lucy Lee 's side garden where the children swing and ladder set stands . It is n't used much any more , not by grownups , and the children are too busy on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crape myrtle and started to duck my head to go through when I saw something that made me hesitate . Someone else had been there quite recently . Twigs were broken off , and one spear of red blossom was purple and dead where it was hanging . I glanced back to see whether Colonel Primrose had seen me , but no one was in sight . I pushed the branches farther apart and looked at the ground . Heavy feet had gone  | through there . The longish grass was trampled noticeably in one spot , as if someone had stood there quite a long time . The cold sensation down my spine was enough to tell me that this was undoubtedly where the person had stood before he began taking pot shots at me the night before . I did n't need the little brass case that I saw shining in the grass a yard or so away . I bent down to pick it up , and for some reason changed my mind . I had an odd notion that someone was watching me in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a curious reluctance to going on through the hedge to the Goulds ' . It seemed to me now that it could n't possibly have been Paul Dikranov shooting at me . . . if , indeed , I had n't simply imagined the whole business . The morning sun and a cup of coffee work wonders with the terrors of the night . But if I had n't imagined it , how could a strange person find one of the very special intimate spots in my hedge  --  one that , furthermore , a lot of other people knew quite well ? And if it was n't Paul Dikranov , who was it , and why ? 13 WENT THROUGH THE HEDGE NEVERTHELESS . THE windows of Lucy Lee 's cottage were open , the brightly printed curtains showing dimly through the shining copper screens under the drawn shades . It seemed the  | most utter nonsense to think of anyone behind any of those windows peering out at me . I shook off the idea and went around in front . There was no sign of life about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no Lucy Lee singing as she banged her pots and pans about . The whole place was as quiet as the grave . Through the trees I could see Mrs. Gould 's house ? large and white , with its wide lawn running down to the lane along the beach . I hurried along the flagstone walk and went in through the side door . Hawkins was there in his white coat with a coffee service balanced on one pink palm . He looked at me like a great black owl and said , " Mis ' Alice she 's in the dinin ' room , Mis ' Grace . " He held open the swinging door for me , muttering something perfectly unintelligible about the general goings-on . Alice Gould was at the head of a long table pretty well littered with the remains of children 's breakfasts . The children were gone , but Lucy Lee was there , looking ill and drawn and with more rouge on her face than had ever been there in all her life before . Alice raised one delicate purple-veined hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her daughter . " If you do n't mind , Lucy Lee , I 'd like to talk to Grace alone . If I were you , darling , I 'd go get Andy and go down the beach for a swim . He ought n't to be over there by himself . " Lucy Lee shook her head as she got up . " I 've got some things to do , " she said . Her mother watched her with a troubled face .  | " I wish you 'd tell me what to do with those two , " she said . " When I was young , people did n't just get up and walk out on their husbands  --  with or without their children  --  no matter how bad they were . " " I ca n't blame Lucy Lee very much , " I said . " My dear , I 'm not blaming her . Andy 's been a terrible fool . But I 'm just old-fashioned enough , Grace , to believe that this sort of thing is largely the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't be so frightfully sorry for Jim , if I did n't think that . " She stirred her coffee and gazed a long time into the cup before she looked up at me . " Grace , it 's about Jim that I want to talk to you , " she said quietly . " I gather from something he said that he and Rosemary were pretty indiscreet . He says it was his fault . " She smiled again , faintly , and shook her head . " You think it was Rosemary 's ? " " That 's the mother in me . I 'm afraid I do . I think Jim would have died before he did anything dishonorable . " " Oh , my dear , " I said . " You do n't think one last meeting before she goes off to marry and live abroad is dishonorable ? " " Perhaps not  --  unless you go into the whole dismal past , and realize that Jim still loves her , and that the whole Sandra business was just a ghastly tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from it ,  | or get over it , you forget it , and it has no meaning for you . She looked away , her hands pleating the edge of her napkin . " I 've seen Jim  --  so many times  --  leave in the morning , and the minute he was out of the house he was like himself again . . . and in the evening I could see it all back on him the minute he got in the house and saw her there . It almost broke my heart . I never knew how it all happened , Grace , until one of his classmates drank too much one night . " She laughed mirthlessly . " He insisted on talking about it . How Jim had a week 's leave  --  he got it because Rosemary was in Shanghai and they were going to be married . Then they had their quarrel . Heaven knows what about ? they 've probably forgotten themselves . Rosemary gave him back his ring and left him cold there , and he went out and got roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then when he came to , days later , he was married to her . I suppose he did the decent thing . He got drunk again and they loaded him on board ship and the captain tried to do something about it . Jim 's a stubborn fool . . . if he could n't marry Rosemary he did n't care whom he married . " She stirred her coffee monotonously . " You know the rest of it . He had to resign  --  the Navy ca n't have that sort of thing , not the sort of person Sandra was . I think she improved a lot . But they could n't wait for that , in the Service . " She looked at me steadily .  | " It 's a terrible thing to say , Grace , but I 'm glad she 's gone . I 'm sorry it had to be this way : I tried to get her to divorce him , but she just laughed at me . You know Jim never used to drink . He 's drunk much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool of every man that came within sight of her . " She got up and went to the window , and looked out a long time . Then she came back to the table suddenly . " Colonel Primrose is coming up the walk , " she said quickly . " You 'd better go . I just told you , Grace , because I want you to know that I feel there 's nothing . . . no wrong done to her . . . that equals the wrong she 's done to Jim . And that no sacrifice of . . . con-vention ? " She shrugged her fragile shoulders . " I think you know what I mean . I just wanted to tell you . Now run along , out the back . " Which was a mistake , because Colonel Primrose , dispensing with the formality of a proper entrance , was coming in the back . " Oh , good morning , " he said cheerfully . " I 've been hunting for you everywhere . " He smiled , but his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were sharp and probing . He took my arm . " Come back inside . I want to talk to you . " Mrs. Gould rose from the table as we came in . Nothing in her manner or her face showed that she was the least surprised at the failure of her plan to get me out . " Good morning , Colonel Primrose , " she said , ex-  | tending her hand to him with a simple dignity that matched his own . They were the same generation and the same sort of people . They seemed to be meeting on common ground even if they were in opposite camps . " Let 's go in there , " she said . She led the way into t he large white living room . The Venetian blinds were drawn . The sun through the open slats made gay little ladders along the thick grass rugs . Alice Gould sat down in one corner of the deep sofa , folded her hands in her lap , and motioned me down beside her . Colonel Primrose pulled up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee with a deprecatory smile . Then he looked at me . " I was n't sure I 'd find you alive this morning , " he said soberly . " She was shot at twice last night , you know . " He turned to Alice . " Oh , it was obviously a mistake , " she said earnestly . " I ca n't think anyone would want to . . . to hurt you , Grace . " " My boy scout training came in handy , " I said . " What were you doing , Mrs. Latham ? " " Nothing . I answered the telephone and came back to the living room . You had gone . Sheila wanted to go out and I went with her . I forgot all the things you 'd said  --  I 'm so used to being perfectly safe here . Then I walked down the path as far as the white chairs under the sycamore tree . Sheila growled , and I . . . well , I began to get a little uneasy . I started back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " It came very close to being quite all , Mrs.  | Latham , " Colonel Primrose said . He shook his head seriously . " You must see now that what I told you is true  --  that you know too much for somebody 's peace of mind . . . and that one murder makes another seem simple  --  and necessary . " He turned back to Alice Gould . She was sitting perfectly still . Even her fingers that usually pleated and unpleated her handkerchief were still , almost as if she dreaded something that must come and was bracing herself for it . " This is getting to be a very serious matter , Mrs. Gould , " he said . " I 'd like you to tell me about Saturday night again , please . " " Gladly , Colonel Primrose . " I thought there was a subtle note of relief in her voice . " I 'm very happy to do so , if it will help . Of course it does involve a certain amount of public linen washing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion . " I looked at Colonel Primrose and shook my head . I had n't . From all I could make out , he would hang his grandmother with the greatest urbanity , if the necessity arose . " You were at the clubhouse when the business about taking the boat out in the storm came up ? " Alice asked . " Andy was supposed to have taken Lucy Lee home early . One of the children has a cold . But in the excitement at the dock he forgot all about that . I brought Lucy Lee home . We sat here waiting for Jim and Andy to come . Lucy Lee is a silly little goose , and  | like a great many wives who are n't awfully interested in sports she feels that Andy 's week ends are too much taken up with sailing and golf and all that . Saturday night , after I 'd got her back here , she worked herself into a fury . She 'd been looking forward to the dance , and the orchestra was late and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little before midnight , as a matter of fact  --  they had a good old-fashioned family row . " Mrs. Gould shook her head in mock despair . " It lasted until half past twelve . I put them both out then and told them to go home and stay there . " " That was at half past twelve ? " Colonel Primrose said politely . Alice nodded her snow-white curly head and raised her serious unlined face . " Yes , you see Jim had n't come in yet and I knew he 'd left the club . Andy had told me that . He did n't say he 'd brought Sandra home . But under the circumstances I think that was more than wise . Considering the state Lucy Lee was in . " I glanced uneasily at Colonel Primrose . If there was only some way I could head Alice off ! She seemed absolutely bent on putting a noose round her own daughter 's neck , drawing it tighter then with every word she spoke . Then quite suddenly I realized the dreadful situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . She did not know that her twelve o'clock alibi for her daughter and sonin-law was utterly worthless . I opened my mouth to say something , but Colonel  | Primrose looked at me steadily and I closed it again . " Where did they go , do you know , when they left here , Mrs. Gould ? " " Home . I watched them from the porch . I saw them turn on the lights in the cottage . " " And when did you find out that Andy had brought Sandra home ? " " When Lucy Lee came back to the house a few minutes later . " " After she 'd gone home , " Colonel Primrose said . Alice Gould nodded . There was obviously something wrong here , and I could see that Colonel Primrose saw it too . " She came back later . I gathered the quarrel had n't ended and she was coming home to Mother . In fact , she 's still here . She moved the children over the next morning . " " She stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " And when did she get here , that last time ? " " About one-thirty , I think , Colonel Primrose . " There was no change in the expression of polite interest on Colonel Primrose 's face . " And Jim ? " " He came in about one o'clock , and went to his room . " " Did you tell him his wife was n't in , Mrs. Gould ? " " Oh , dear , no ! " Alice exclaimed . " I should n't have thought of it . Not for an instant . You see , Sandra frequently stayed on to dance long after Jim was worn  | out . Some friend usually brought her home . Both she and Jim belong to the modern school that thinks husbands and wives cleaving together is nonsense . I 'm afraid Lucy Lee is the only old-fashioned member of my family . " " And you , Mrs. Gould  --  did n't you wonder about her ? " " Oh , of course . But I 've wondered about Sandra a good deal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sardonic note in Alice 's voice . " I did glance in her room when I came in with Lucy Lee , and later after Jim had gone to bed . That 's when I found her note . " She looked up , as guileless as a kitten , meeting those sharpened black eyes without a quiver . I forced myself not to look at Colonel Primrose . " I see , " he said . " About that note  --  I wonder if you would be good enough to show me just where you found it . " " With pleasure . " Alice led us up the wide white-paneled staircase , down a sunny hall to a room overlooking the walk to the garage . She opened the door . I think , strangely enough , it was one of the very few times I 'd been in that room since it was Sandra 's . It looked more like a stage dressing room than a lady 's bedroom . . . all the superimposed bits that were Sandra 's anyway . The basic decoration of pink sateen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing a decorator would do . Around the mirror were snapshots , mostly of men about the Harbor taken with Sandra . There were n't  | many of Jim  --  one taken several years before , another of him in a group on the club veranda , including , oddly enough , both Andy and Dr. Potter . Other bits of local interest hung about the room  --  a broken canoe paddle with a lot of names scribbled on it , invitations to cocktail parties , programs of the Harbor yacht races , the horse show and the dog show  --  and literally dozens of pictures of Sandra herself , at all hours of the day and night . Alice Gould picked her way through the room with a sort of humorous resignation . It was n't , you could see , her idea of a daughter-in-law 's room . " I found it just here . " She pointed to the dressing table with its profusion of cosmetic boxes and bottles and mirrors . " Was the light on ? " " No . I turned it on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't here . She leaves her things strewed about when she comes in , and there was nothing on that chair . So I turned on the light . " " Why did you do that ? " " I do n't know . It seems a natural thing to do . And , of course , she might possibly have got in and laid down , without taking off her things . " Colonel Primrose nodded . " Did she drink ? " " More at times than I approved of . Though I 'm an old-fashioned woman , as I think I 've said before . " " What did you do when you saw the note , Mrs. Gould ? " " I read it , and I went out to hunt for her . As I told you before , I thought it was all part of the heroic  | nonsense that began with the boat episode . I never for an instant thought it was anything but a grandstand play for Jim  --  to make him more wretched than he already was . You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tricks about appealing to a man 's sense of honor and so on . " Colonel Primrose hesitated a moment . " And you went to Mrs. Latham 's ? " " Because I think Grace is one of the few people who know Sandra as well as I do . And  --  well , I wanted some moral support when I 'd found Sandra about to slay herself , or even just pretending to be about to . " Alice shrugged , her face a little drawn , as if the strain of being casual about the things that really meant a lot to her was telling on her at last . " I do n't think it 's strange . I 've come to depend a lot on Grace . " I tried to smile back at her , but I saw too clearly the bog she was getting both of us into to be very cheerful about it . We left Sandra 's room . Colonel Primrose , a little ahead of us , was looking back , talking , and he went past the stairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . He jumped back . " I 'm so sorry ! " " Quite all right , " Alice said . " I do n't suppose the beds are made yet . " I wondered if she would have thought it was all right if she 'd suspected that Colonel Primrose was not blundering , but very coolly looking to see if she had a telephone  --  and a clock  --  in her room . I was only  | surprised that he did n't inspect the rest of the house while he was at it . Lucy Lee was in the living room when we came down the stairs . She was standing in front of the fireplace . She turned as we came , obviously expecting to see only her mother and me , and the plain fear on ' her face when she saw Colonel Primrose was a little shocking . " Oh ! " she said . " I 'm sorry , I thought you ? " " Colonel Primrose was asking about Saturday night , Lucy Lee , " Alice Gould said quietly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Andy had here . " Lucy Lee stared at her mother , her face chalkwhite , her lips parted stupidly . Alice gave me a quick alarmed glance and hurried to where Lucy Lee stood . " Child  --  what 's the matter ! " " Nothing , mother , " she said . She brushed the short chestnut curls from her forehead , trying desperately to smile . " I just heard , mother , that it was one o'clock that Sandra was . . . killed , not twelve . He found it out . " She nodded towards Colonel Primrose . " Grace knew too  --  they all knew ! Only they would n't tell us ! Oh , mother ! " She flung herself into her mother 's arms in a passion of tears . Alice Gould 's face above the dark soft head of her sobbing child was a mask of conflict ? doubt , fear and anger . " I thought you knew it , until just a moment ago ,  | Al ice , " I said weakly . " Jim knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't told you . " " I 'm afraid I prevented her from telling you , Mrs. Gould , " Colonel Primrose said quickly . " You see , I not only know that , I know a number of other things . One of them is that so far none of you has told the truth . If I may say so , I think you 're all pretty much at cross purposes . . . because you have n't told each other the truth either . " A flush deepened in Alice 's face . Her lips tightened ever so faintly . Lucy Lee raised her head and stood there , face tear-stained , staring dully at the carpet , her mother 's arm round her slim shoulders . " For instance : which one of you met Sandra as she was leaving the garage and quarreled with her , so violently that it woke Hawkins ? " He smiled at Alice Gould . Whoever it was , I thought , it plainly was n't she . I do n't think Alice had ever raised her voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he would , Mrs. Thorp . " Lucy Lee flushed . " Why do n't you go and ask him ? " she said in a low voice . " I think I shall  --  unless you 'd send Hawkins for him , Mrs. Gould . "  | 14 AND WHEN ANDY THORP CAME HE WAS N'T YET ANY more like himself than he had been the day before . He ignored Lucy Lee completely , barely nodded to his mother-in-law and me , and turned to Colonel Primrose . " I can thank you for muffing a big deal for me . " He almost snarled it . " You can thank yourself , Thorp , " Colonel Primrose said curtly . " When you begin to give right answers to the questions that are asked you , and quit telling the most childish falsehoods , you 'll be allowed to go about your business . " Andy reddened under his sun-tanned hide . " It would be rather pleasant for everybody if . you 'd stop being an idiot , Andy , " Alice said gently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandra 's death . " Andy looked at her an instant , said nothing , dug into his pocket and brought out a battered pack of cigarettes . " I 'd just like to hear again what happened after you left the club , Thorp , " Colonel Primrose said . He spoke quietly , but there was an iron undertone in his voice . It must have been like hearing the head coach again . Andy answered almost civilly , still without even a glance at Lucy Lee .  | " Sandra dried out in front of the fire , " he said . " I guess she did n't have much on but an evening dress . She borrowed somebody 's coat and was waiting for Jim . One of the colored boys came in and said Jim had gone with Grace . " He looked around at me . " Sandra wanted to go home then and said she 'd join me and Barrol in the car . We waited about ten minutes for her , I guess . George was cold , he did n't dry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to drink on us . I started back to get a pint when she showed up . She was high as a kite . " He tossed his cigarette into the fireplace and lighted another . " She 'd been drinking , inside ? " Colonel Primrose suggested . " Not while I was there , except a toddy they made her . I do n't know what she was doing that ten minutes George and I waited in the car . " Colonel Primrose nodded , looking at him steadily and I thought rather oddly . " We started off and dropped George . He was about half-tight with all the rye they 'd poured into him at the club . He staggered up the steps , and we came home . " Andy looked down at the carpet , his face a dull crimson . " I wanted her to take a ride , but she would n't . So we put the car in the garage and started up to the house . Halfway up she asked me for my keys . We had an argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back  | to the garage . I went on a little way and looked back . She was talking . . . to a woman . " " Yes , " Colonel Primrose said briskly . " Who was it ? " " I do n't know , I tell you . " " You did n't recognize her at all ? " " I did n't recognize her at all . That 's English , is n't it ? " " Yes , " Colonel Primrose said , almost cheerfully . His old black eyes were shining , for some reason that I at least did not understand . " Yes , that 's English . It was no one you knew ? " " I tell you it was n't . " " Was it light ? " Andy nodded . " It was pretty light . " " You probably could have told , for instance , if it had been Mrs. Latham , say ? " Colonel Primrose smiled at me . I tried to smile back , but I do n't think my attempt amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should think so . " Or . . . Mrs. Gould , for instance ? " " It was n't . I tell you again , and I hope to God for the last time , I did n't know her . " Colonel Primrose nodded absently , as if he were thinking hard about something else . Then he looked at Andy very queerly . " It 's rather strange , is n't it , " he said slowly , " that you should have looked back there and seen Sandra talking to a strange woman . . . a woman that you 'd never seen before ? "  | He shook his head a little . " I guess it is , " Andy said . " That 's what happened just the same . " " All right , " Colonel Primrose said . " What did you do ? " " I started back . Sandra ran up to me and said to go on , she 'd take care of it . I asked her who it was . She said , Oh , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attention to it . There are plenty of crazy women around . I came on up . " " She said just those words ? " Andy nodded . " Just them . " " Have you got any idea of what the woman looked like ? " There was silence for a moment . Then Andy spoke rather hesitatingly . " I got the idea she was sort of old , from what I could see . I just looked at her for a second . She was standing outside the light at the side of the door there . " " And that was just before midnight ? " Andy nodded . " Sandra did n't tell you what she wanted with the car ? " Lucy Lee moved a little , and Andy 's face flushed still darker . " I thought she had a date she wanted to keep . " He kept his eyes fixed on the floor . " You do n't know who with ? " " I guess you could ask Rosemary 's dago friend if you wanted to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded politely . " And you did n't see her again . . . after you left this house at half past twelve ? " " I did n't . " " Sure about it ? " " Why ? " Andy said . He stared at Colonel Primrose aggressively , his chin out a little . " Are n't you ? " Colonel Primrose got up . " Thank you , " he said suavely . The telephone out in the hall rang : one long , three short . Colonel Primrose glanced at me . " That 's mine , " I said . I felt a queer little sensation along my spine . " May I answer it , Alice ? " " If you do n't mind , " Colonel Primrose said calmly , " I 'll answer it myself . " He hesitated a moment , standing there , looking from one of us to the other , and added , " I 've got an idea it 's the woman Mr. Thorp saw Saturday night . " He chuckled a little at the expressions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But when he came back his face was a dead giveaway . " It was n't ? " I asked . " It was Sergeant Buck . He 's back from the village . I think we might be getting along , Mrs. Latham ? " I glanced at Alice Gould , trying to let her know I 'd do my best . She nodded imperceptibly . I followed Colonel Primrose out . We walked down the flagstone path past the Thorps ' cottage , and stopped in front of the door .  | " There 's a path to your place from here , " he said with a smile . " Where is it ? " " How do you know ? " I asked . " Because one of my men lost you somewhere in here this morning . " " Lost me ? " " Yes . You 're being escorted places , after last night . I do n't want you killed , you know . After all , my hostess . . . " He chuckled . I was quite touched  --  until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decoy . " He chuckled again . I took him down to the break in the hedge . There was obviously no point in not doing it . I saw his eyes sharpen as he spotted the broken spear of crape myrtle . On my side I glanced down at the plantain leaf that concealed the brass jacket of the shell , and started in spite of myself . It was gone . It had been there less than an hour before . " There 's another matter , Mrs. Latham , " Colonel Primrose was saying , just behind me . " When young Andy was hunting his father , and his father denied being out of the house , he was seen by one of the colored boys from the club . He was going to the Bishops ' , along the lane from the club . The boy says Mr. Thorp looked as if he did n't want to be seen . He told Buck that this morning . " He looked at me and smiled . " Buck has a great way of getting information , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve of his methods . The queer thing here is that the boy also says he saw  | you and Miss Bishop leaning on the fence there . So it would seem you 'd seen Andy too . " " Is that why we 're going down this way ? " asked . " Do n't tell me you thought we were taking a morning stroll . " " No , " I said . " I thought maybe you were turning my house inside out , and wanted me out of the way for a while . " I was thinking , desperately fast . Andy had hidden something under the bank . I did n't know what it was , but I knew that it was something that connected him very closely with the death of Sandra Gould . " I do n't suppose , " Colonel Primrose said placidly , " that your duty as a citizen . . . " " Rodman Bishop says the trouble with the world is that too many people are dashing about doing their duty  --  and getting everybody else in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he admitted cheerfully . " In this case it just happens you do n't have to do yours . There 's Buck . I 've no doubt he 's done it for you . " The Sergeant 's massive figure was there ahead of us in the lane . He had taken off his coat and was in his vest , with two fancy pink ribbon armbands holding up his shirt sleeves . He was peering over the bank , not far from where Andy had gone down . It must have looked as if an army had gone over , I thought , remembering the rocks we had heard crashing to the beach . I took a deep breath , hoping for the best . It was about all there was left to do .  | I followed the Colonel through the wicket into the lane , and peered over the edge . Sergeant Buck was leaning forward , burrowing into the bank like an otter with his great hands . His face had n't the slightest expression , not even when he abruptly stopped burrowing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I watched him pull out  --  of all things under the sun  --  a pair of tiny stained rose-satin slippers . He held them up towards Colonel Primrose . Then he peered inside them , and pulled out of the toe of one of them a crumpled bunch of blue velvet flowers . I stared . The slippers were Lucy Lee 's . . . but why should Andy have hidden them , and still more why should he have hidden Rosemary 's flowers ' ? It was beyond me . I think it even puzzled Colonel Primrose . He took them from Buck , who scaled the bank with the most astonishing agility , and turned them over in his hand . The slippers were a mess . The thin soles were t sodden as if they had tramped miles in wet grass , and the brown stain covered the scratched torn toes . Colonel Primrose examined them intently . The thing that seemed to hold him longest was the black grease spotted on the toes and heels . Finally , without saying a word , he handed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a moment he gave that to the Sergeant too , and smiled at me . He shook his head a little .  | " I think that cleans up one little matter , " he said calmly . He turned to Buck . " You can run me into the village . Have you got the car ? " " It 's along at the clubhouse , sir . " " You can pick me up at Mrs. Latham 's . " " Yes , sir . " Sergeant Buck passed me with a fish-eyed stare , giving at the same time the general appearance of a snappy salute , and turned on his large heel . I have n't the slightest doubt that he wished the bullet or bullets ? one or both  --  had got me squarely in the back . Indeed I was n't at all sure , now that I came to think of it , that it was n't Sergeant Buck firing them . Colonel Primrose held the wicket and I went through . " You probably thought I was extremely rude last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last night ? " He chuckled . " In the middle of the night , when you were on the phone . I just wanted you to hang up . I did n't want our listener to suspect we knew he was there . And the caller had already hung up . " " Oh , " I said . " Then they are different . " " Yes . They are . " We walked on a moment . Then he said , " The call last night came from the same place . The same party line . " " You mean the St. John 's vestry room ? " " That 's one party . "  | " Who 's the other ' ? " " The other , " he said deliberately , and looking queerly at me , " I think is the crazy woman ' Sandra Gould talked to  --  and of course later had her quarrel with . " I stared at him in perfect astonishment . " It 's quite impossible , " he said soberly . " However , as Sherlock Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossible must be true . That 's where I am now , Mrs. Latham . I 'm going to the village to try to prove it . By the way , this gossip about Dr. Potter  --  did you know the village is full of it ' ? He and Jim Gould had a sort of mild run-in in the club bar just before dinner Saturday night . " " Oh , that 's nonsense ! " I said warmly . " Though I do n't see how you could blame Adam Potter really , with Sandra always acting like Circe on her pillar . " " Island , " Colonel Primrose said . There was a little twinkle in his eyes . " Not a pillar . Aeaea , it was called . Nice name . " " Island , then . And poor Maggie ! " " I know , " he said . " An invalid , is n't she . For a long time ' ? " " Years . It 's perfectly foul . " We had come the length of the garden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the hedge . " Someone shot at you from there last night , Mrs. Latham , " he said very seriously . " Will you stay indoors till I get back ' ? "  | I shook my head . " No . But I 'll go over to the Bishops ' . " " All right . " He hesitated a moment . " While you 're there you might tell Rosemary that if she lures Jim Gould out again when there happens to be trouble brewing , just about once more , she 'll succeed in hanging him where Parran may fail . " A horn sounded in the back drive as I nodded . " There 's Buck . We 'll take you as far as the Bishops ' . " We went around the side walk and Julius , seeing me through the window over the sink , called out : " Mis ' Grace ! Oh , Mis ' Grace ! They 's a lady here to see you . She 's in the livin ' room . She wants to see somebody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's you , Colonel , " I said . " Come and see . " Sergeant Buck had jumped out of the car and was standing at attention on the other side . " Just a minute , Buck . " " Yes , sir . " We went in through the kitchen . Lilac was making watermelon pickles and singing about a sycamine tree and the River Jordan . I got a drink of water at the sink and gave Colonel Primrose one . We went through the pantry into the hall . It seems odd to me now that I had no intuition about the other side of the living room door . It hardly seems possible . There was no preparation , no fore-  | shadowing , nothing to let us know , in any way , of what was there waiting quietly for us . I pushed the door open , as I do a thousand times a day , and walked in . . . and stopped , utterly and horribly aghast . On the sofa in front of the fireplace was a woman I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , and her face was sallow and drawn and unlovely . My hand dropped slowly to my side and my head swirled . Colonel Primrose steadied me quickly with an arm around my shoulders . We stood there , silent , stupefied , for one terrible instant . " Who is it ? " Colonel Primrose said . " It 's Maggie Potter ! " I whispered . " Good God ! " he said . Maggie Potter was dead . Even from there I could see the crushed and blackened , blood-and-hair-matted spot on the base of her skull where she had been murderously struck . I caught myself with a terrible effort . " But she ca n't walk ! " I said . " She has n't been out of the house for seven years ! " Colonel Primrose shook his head . " She was out Saturday night , " he said quietly . " And she 's been trying to tell us about it ever since . " " Over the phone ? " I whispered . He nodded , and looked at me steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Latham , " he said . " It belongs to a murderer . "  | 15 COLONEL PRIMROSE STEPPED gUICKLY ACROSS THE room and touched the painted doorstop lightly with the tip of his brown and white shoes . I kept my gaze riveted to it , trying not to see the lumpy protruding feet in their house-worn black strap slippers , the bony legs in streaked gunmetal stockings , that ghastly head . It was all so unbearably , hideously grotesque . The gaunt sallow figure in the mousy old-fashioned clothes that had n't been in the sun for seven years  --  and on the floor in its usual place the white-painted iron basket full of gay red and blue and yellow and white iron posies . . . splotched and splattered with blood . I stared at it , trying desperately to keep from being sick . It was Colonel Primrose who saved me . He shook my arm , and I came to sharply , out of the dark swirling fog . " Mrs. Latham ! Get Buck , send him in here ; phone Parran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor ! Is there anyone else in town  --  any other doctor ? " I shook my head mechanically . " Get him then . Poor devil ! But hurry  --  do n't just stand there ! " I went back through the door into the hall and called Julius .  | ' Wha 's the matter with you , Mis ' Grace ? " he exclaimed . " Nothing , Julius . Just tell Sergeant Buck to come quickly , and you stay in the kitchen , " I said . I let the door swing to and took down the telephone . For an instant I almost heard the tickety-tick , tickety-tock , tickety-tick , tickety-tock , but it must have been in my own head , because what I really heard was Elsie Carter 's voice saying , " Creamed chicken and peas in patty shells is always nice , and the men enjoy it . " A thousand church suppers rolled over my head . I gripped myself firmly to keep from screaming . " Elsie , " I said . " This is Grace Latham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to get Dr. Potter , immediately . " There was an instant 's startled silence , then Elsie 's avid voice . " Is somebody sick , Grace ? " " No , " I said . " Please , darling . " " I 'll call you later , Mary. ? If there 's anything I can do , Grace . . . " " Thanks . " I hung up the phone and cranked to signal the operator . " Mr. Parran , please . " " Yes , Mrs. Latham  --  he 's just gone to his office , " the operator said , with the friendly helpfulness of the , village exchange . Which was also the reason that I just told Mr. Parran , when I 'd got him , that there had been an accident and Colonel Primrose wanted him immediately .  | Then I tried to get Dr. Potter . He was out . I could hear the phone ring again and again . " Mrs. Potter must be upstairs , Mrs. Latham , " the operator said . She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep on ringing . " " Do n't bother , Mabel , " I said . " But if you hear where he is , tell him to come to my house as quick as ever he can . " I hung up , knowing she would find him before I could . Then I took down the phone again and listened to see if I 'd missed the tickety-tick , tickety-tock , or if it really had not been there . But it was n't . Only Elsie , saying , " Are you through , Grace ? I just saw Dr. Potter leaving the Goulds ' ? he 's gone in to see Annie Kellogg now , she cut her knee on an oyster shell . Shall I tell him you want him ? " " Please  --  and tell him it 's urgent , " I said . I knew she 'd break her neck to do it , and anyway she would n't let me have the wire in peace again . I went back to the living room . Colonel Primrose and Sergeant Buck were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of artillery than a human being , or so I 'd imagine , having only the faintest notion of what artillery is . All I mean is that he seemed ready to go into instant action when his chief gave the word . He said , " It 's all in the cards , sir , but who 'd have guessed it . " " I should have guessed something , anyway , " Colonel Primrose said shortly . " When Potter left here . " He looked around at me.  | " Mr. Parran 's coming , " I reported . " Mrs. Carter said she just saw Dr. Potter leaving the Goulds ' . He 's at the Kelloggs ' now . She 's getting him . " If I had dropped a minor bomb shell , or even a major one , into the middle of my living room , I do n't think Colonel Primrose would have jerked about so quickly . " Just left the Goulds ' ! " he repeated . I did n't even then see what to them was the appalling significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  even if I 'd not been very well acquainted with Adam Potter for many years  --  that a doctor would kill his wife that way with so many other easier ways at hand . I forgot entirely Elsie Carter 's theory that he 'd been killing her by degrees for seven long years . It was n't till later even that I remembered the Saturday morning in Church Street in front of Mr. Toplady 's store . " No telling what they 'll do when they 're jealous , " Sergeant Buck said . It occurred to me suddenly and incongruously that one of his gifts I 'd not yet noticed was the gift of sententious remark . " I wish to God I 'd used my head , " Colonel Primrose said bitterly . Sergeant Buck shook his , with the utmost conviction . " It would n't have done no good if you had , sir , " he said . He drew his wide hard mouth down at the corners , shaking his head back and forth like one of those loose-headed toy policemen children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  Sergeant Buck about a foot behind , and towering at least a foot above  | and projecting a good deal to each side of the stocky gray-haired man in the tan poplin suit  --  should have seemed so utterly incongruous just then . They looked much more as if they should be inspecting the beer at the canteen than viewing the ghastly figure of Maggie Potter , sprawled feet out and dreadfully motionless on the sofa in front of them . " Neat at that , sir , " Sergeant Buck said . I could see that it was . I knew that room so well ? and except for Maggie Potter and the bloodspattered iron pot of painted flowers , there was nothing out of place that I could see , and nothing that was n't always there . No convenient bits of upholsterer 's twine or ends of cigarettes with orange lipstick on them . Colonel Primrose nodded slowly . " That 's the confounded part of it , " he said . " Somebody walked in , and walked out again . A hundred to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove his theory the Thorp children and their nurse straggled across the garden not twenty feet from the porch , and young Andy came to the screen door , banged once or twice and called , " Juyus , Juyus ! " I started out to head him off , but his nurse called and he ran along after her . " You see . Anyone else could do the same anci come on in , " Colonel Primrose said . s He bent down to examine the doorstop . " However , we may be a bit forrarder . There 's no doubt that Mrs. Potter knew something , and was on  | her way here to tell it , after trying to say it on the phone and being afraid to . And I suppose there 's no doubt it was something that happened Saturday night . " He stared down at the doorstop , then cocked his head around and peered up at me . " I take it Andy Thorp would n't recognize Mrs. Potter , in the dark ? " I shook my head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has n't seen her for . . . oh , I suppose seven years , or more . She used to be around a lot . She played bridge every afternoon with the older women at the club . Andy knew her casually . I do n't think he 'd recognize her . You 're thinking she was the woman Sandra was with at the garage ? " He nodded . " Probably . " " Of course it was dark there too . " " Not very , Mrs. Latham , " he said . " That light over the side door of the garage is pretty bright . " " Andy said she was n't in the light . " " I know . " " And above all , " I said , " how on earth did she get there ? " Colonel Primrose shook his head . " Your guess is as good as mine . However  --  she even got here . " He looked down at her and shook his head again . " Not a very amiable sort , was she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew what he meant . The querulous face of a childless and selfish woman , with nothing to occupy her mind or her heart but herself and her ills , petty and resentful , envious  | of other people and suspicious of them . For years her husband had quit even dropping in at the club bar for a highball at night . He 'd only begun again the last few years  --  after Sandra came , as Elsie Carter was to point out significantly . We heard a car in the drive at the back of the house . Colonel Primrose moved back a step or so into the corner where he could watch the door without being seen . I should have connected that up with Dr. Potter , but I did n't . Anyway , it was n't Dr. Potter , it was Mr. Parran , the State 's Attorney . He pushed the door open and came briskly and inquiringly into the room , and stopped dead in his tracks , staring blankly in utter horror . " Good God ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square granite figure of Sergeant Buck , and his eyes moved on to the Colonel . " It was Maggie trying to phone ? " he said . Colonel Primrose nodded . " She was the other party on the line . " " And it was her quarreling with Mrs. Gould . " " Probably . " Mr. Parran 's head moved back and forth . He was still staring down at Maggie Potter there on the sofa , his face a little white . " And when they told me young Mrs. Gould was carryin ' on with old Potter , I laughed . The old ? " Sergeant Buck cleared his throat violently , and jerked his head towards me . Mr. Parran gulped his words back with an effort . " Beg your pardon , ma'am , " he muttered , very  | red in the face . Which showed one reason for his not being invited to mixed parties on the Estate . I never heard Jim or Andy or Rodman Bishop swallow anything in my life , in the line of words  --  or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rather underestimated Mr. Parran . " We 've sent for him , " Colonel Primrose said . " He ought to be here any minute . He was at the Goulds ' , apparently , when it happened . " Mr. Parran 's lean jaw tightened . Colonel Primrose turned to the Sergeant . " Go over to the Goulds ' and see if he was there . Mrs. Latham , would you mind asking Julius to step in here ? " When I went out into the hall Julius peered in from the pantry saucer-eyed and putty-faced , sensing easily that something had happened . " No one 's going to hurt you , " I said . He stuck his head out of his starched white coat collar like a sand turtle stretching his neck . " ' Deed an ' Ah know that , Mis ' Grace. ? Was that there lady Mis ' Potter ? " I nodded . " ' Deed an ' Ah thought Ah knew her . She used to come here , didn ' she ? " I nodded again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Primrose asked . " She come about a quarter of ' leven , while Ah was sweepin ' the back walk . Booths 's taxi stopped , an ' she got out . She told him not to wait , an ' she wanted to  | know if you was home , Mis ' Grace . Ah said no , an ' she said is the man here that 's a detective . Ah said you was both on the place , an ' would she wait , an ' she said yes . She kep ' lookin ' around like she was scared somebody 'd see her . " " Did anybody see her ? " " Not that Ah know of , suh . " " Did anybody pass in a car ? " Julius craned his neck around slowly . " There was cars passin ' , " he said . " Course , Ah didn ' notice who was in ' em . " " Try to think , Julius , " I said . " Did n't you notice anybody you know ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie Bates drives his father 's grocery truck . " Ah didn ' see nobody else , ' cept , o ' course , ' Dr. Potter . " We stared at him standing there , ashy-pale and shaking . And my head kept whirling . Was it conceive able that Colonel Primrose really thought Adam Potter had killed his wife , here , in this living room ? Because to me it was not conceivable , it was utterly fantastic and impossible . But , I kept thinking desperately , the idea that any of us  --  that someone from my own little group there  --  could have done such a thing was just as impossible . " An ' o ' course there was the regular people . . . nobody that ai n't always flyin ' up an ' down like the devil was after ' em . "  | Mr. Parran looked at Colonel Primrose in patient disgust . " Well , just who were they , Julius ? " Colonel Primrose said . " ' Deed , Colonel , an ' Ah don ' recall jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend to . " They might as well have stopped there , because the fact that Julius had other matters to attend to is final . In the fifteen years he 's been with me it has definitely explained everything , from burnt biscuit to frozen radiators . " You do n't recall anyone except Dr. Potter ? " " No , suh . Ah only recalls him ' cause Ah thought to mahself that there lady looks powerful like Mis ' Potter , but if he don ' know her , an ' if she cai n't walk , like they say , then Ah mus ' be mistaken . So Ah ast her who she was , an ' she says it did n't make no difference , she 'd wait . So she jus ' walked in an ' set herself down in a chair . " " You just left her there ? " Julius craned his neck out and wet his lips . He looked at me . " Ah didn ' feel exac'ly corn f o'table , " he said . " She didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see exactly what he meant . Maggie was perfectly sane , of course . " She is rather odd-looking , " I said . Colonel Primrose nodded . " Did n't Lilac know her ? " " Ah don ' think Lilac even seen her , " Julius said .  | " She was talkin ' to Hawkins , an ' she was n't payin ' no attention to the outside . " " What about Dr. Potter ? Did he speak to you when he went by ? " Julius shook his head . " He waved his hand , suh , like he always does . Ah guess he didn ' see her ' cause she was facin ' the house . " Colonel Primrose looked at me . " All right , Julius , " he said . He nodded to Sergeant Buck , who departed for the Goulds ' . When he went on errands he set out on a sort of double-quick , and you half expected to see a line of khaki-clad men materialize out of the empty air and file along  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels and ears , like the florists ' emblem . Colonel Primrose and Mr. Parran set to work . If the Sergeant 's line of men had n't appeared , the State 's Attorney 's had . I retired to the dining room . I could hear Colonel Primrose 's terse clipped instructions , the men moving about , the clicking of the camera , Mr. Parran 's nasal Maryland drawl . I felt curiously helpless and at loose ends , not knowing at all what to do . It 's an odd sensation , having the corpse of somebody you know quite well but have no emotion about appear suddenly on your living room sofa . But I suppose any corpse would be much the same . I opened the screen , brushed out a wasp and closed it again . " I 'm going over to the Bishops ' . Will you come along ? " I turned . Colonel Primrose had come back from  | the living room and was standing there regarding me with an eye cocked in a manner definitely and disturbingly speculative . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought . But it was impossible to tell what he was thinking , actually . " Are you all right ' ? " he said . " Oh , yes . " I was all right , after that first terrible shock . There was no point in being anything else . We went out through the kitchen , leaving Julius and Lilac pretty ashen and saucer-eyed . " You ain ' goin ' away , is you , Mis ' Grace ' ? " Lilac said desperately . " Just over to the Bishops ' . Mr. Parran 's here . " " Ah knows he 's here . " Julius said , very pointedly . " If he bothers you , phone me , " I said . " Anyway , Sergeant Buck will be back in a minute . " Julius looked very unhappy . " I wish , " I said as we went out , " there was some way of going at police work without first terrorizing all the servants . " " Hawkins does n't seem particularly terrorized . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , he 's no doubt delighted that another Jezebel has bit the dust . " Colonel Primrose looked at me , startled . " Mrs. Potter ' ? " " 0 Lord , no . Sandra . Mrs. Potter is Julius and Lilac 's problem . He can enjoy that at a distance . And furthermore  --  while I 'm complaining about the law ?  | why do you go off and leave that man in charge ? Julius is probably perfectly correct in suspecting that the minute we get out of the house Mr. Parran 'll arrest him and Lilac . Just to be doing something satisfying in a big way . " Colonel Primrose shook his head . " No point sitting around in the barn after the horse has left , " he said . " You have to take a bridle and go after him . " " Is he over at the Bishops ' ? " His face sobered abruptly . " I would n't be sure . He 's not awfully far away . " We went along . " I 'm sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare say , " he said . " It wo n't be long now . " " What do you mean ? " He cocked his head down and looked up at me with his black sparkling eyes . " I mean that our murderer is getting panicky , Mrs. Latham. " 16 WE WENT ON ACROSS THE GARDEN . " Is n't that a bit on the locking-the-barn-door side , Colonel ? " I asked . " Oh , definitely , " he admitted . " Well , anybody but a complete ass would have seen , knowing what I  | knew  --  or what I 'd guessed  --  about Mrs. Potter , that she was in danger . " " You really think it was she at the garage ? " " I ca n't figure it as any of the rest of you , Mrs. Latham , someway . " He held up a straggling trailer of trumpet vine for me to go under through the wicket between my place and the Bishops ' . " Who , for example ? Lucy Lee ? " He smiled soberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frankly , it 's really your Rosemary that interests me now . It does n't seem credible , does it ? ? Look at her now . " We were crossing the lawn up to the great screened and pillared veranda of The Magnolias , hid- , den from the people there for the moment by the two gigantic shiny-leaved trees that helped give the place its name . " You would n't think , to look at her , that she 's practically tying a noose  --  they hang people in a shed in the penitentiary yard , here in the Free State of Maryland  --  round the neck of the man she was and is popularly supposed to be pretty mad about . . . or her own neck ? " I stared at him open-mouthed . " You do n't still think ? " " My dear young woman , " he said quietly , " Mr. Parran is the State 's Attorney  --  not I. " We went along across the grass . " You know , Mrs. Latham  --  you have a charming  | but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly what he or she appears to be . Which means  --  all these people being your friends ? just what you want them to be . Now I , and still more Mr. Parran  --  having no illusions or preconceptions about these people , or about character in general ? can see clearly that  --  just to take one point  --  the mainspring of human conduct , even in nice humans , is n't always love . " He shook his head . " I have n't time to go into it . We 've got to find out what these people up on the porch have been doing with themselves this morning . " We came out from behind the magnolia trees . George Barrol came to meet us . I remember wondering fleetingly , as he came , why with his share of his aunt 's money he still acted as the household secretary  --  or general functotum , as Sergeant Buck called him . The Sergeant called himself that also , so the word had n't any derisive significance . " They tell me you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dear me , it was lucky I did n't go home with you . They might have got me too ! " George giggled in his nervous way , but it was perfectly obvious that he meant every word of it . That 's one of the nice things about George ; he 's frank . " It happened they did n't get me , " I said . " And it was long after I left here , so you 'd have got home safe . " " If Grace keeps such odd company , she 'll have to expect to get shot at , " Rosemary said . She came down from the porch , almost breath-  | takingly lovely , with her warm golden skin and dull gold hair and serious wide-set gray eyes above a simple high-throated earth-brown cotton frock . I glanced back and saw that Colonel Primrose thought about her as I did ; his interest had quickened perceptibly . Behind her , not very far away , giving the impression that he was not going to be far away for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to some decision to keep an eye on her , and why . Since Colonel Primrose had said she was n't in any danger I had been wondering . Since the night before I had wondered still more . For granted no one would want to hurt Rosemary , who could there be who felt strongly enough about me to shoot me . . . and at the same time had n't hesitated at the brutal murder of a ? perfectly harmless hypochondriac ? As Paul Dikranov greeted us in a friendly way I wondered a little , too , if George 's constant presence did n't annoy him . Rodman Bishop seemed to keep out of the way diligently , but so far I could n't remember having seen Dikranov and Rosemary together once without George . Except that unfortunate period Saturday night , and that was hardly George 's fault . The matter was settled conclusively before long , however , and in George 's inimitable way . " Is your father here , Miss Bishop ? " Colonel Primrose asked . Rosemary nodded . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library with Nathan Kaufman . " " I 'll tell him you want him , shall I ? " George said helpfully . His face fell , and then brightened in-  | stantly . " It 'll be all right if I go , now that Grace and the Colonel have come . " Then George turned brick-red , and well he might , for the look Rosemary gave him would have charred a hide only slightly less tough . " Oh , dear ! " he said . Dikranov 's face darkened . George departed uneasily . Rosemary smiled with remarkable self-possession . " Let 's go up on the porch , shall we ' ? Dad 'll be out in a minute . " " I 'd like to see him now , if you do n't mind , " Colonel Primrose said . Rosemary glanced at Paul Dikranov . " He 's engaged at the moment , " she said reluctantly . At just that moment a querulous , slightly pompous voice came out of the hall . " Well , bring him in , bring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the facts ! " The owner of the voice came out onto the porch ? a short small slightly paunchy man with thick black hair going white at the temples , bloodshot eyes that looked as if they had never had an illusion to lose , and a red choleric face . As Rosemary said later , he had the consistency of a persimmon , ripe and just ready to burst . Mr. Nathan Kaufman looked as if he drank too much , and I dare say he did . He certainly drank a lot . " Let him come in here , " he was saying . " Nobody 's going to lynch him . " I assumed , unraveling this , that the first " him "  | was Colonel Primrose . The second , surprisingly enough , was Jim Gould . " This is Colonel Primrose , Mr. Kaufman , " Rosemary said . Mr. Kaufman made some sound not in ordinary usage , and they shook hands . Rodman Bishop came out , still dressed in the ancient shrunk seersucker suit , towering over everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his gaze happened to rest on his daughter . Then a proud satisfied smile lighted his leathery piratical old face . . . though now , when he looked at her as he came out of the cool hall , his eyes were worried too . It seemed almost as if he were avoiding meeting her , and when he sat down and she came over and sat beside him on the arm of his chair , he gripped her hand and patted it clumsily , his jaw working savagely . It was Jim Gould that Colonel Primrose looked at . Something had obviously been going on inside Jim . His eyes were narrowed a bit and his jaw and lips tight . He stood there tall and erect , the sort of person who would knock you down and throw you overboard if necessary , but who certainly  --  to my mind ? would n't hit a sick old woman over the head if he 'd wanted to kill her . " Well , we 're all friends here , " Kaufman said , darting a quick look about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heh , heh ! ? Or are we ? " George giggled  --  or started to until he caught Rodman Bishop 's beetling glance and the giggle died into a cough . " Of course ! " Rosemary said . She included every-  | body in a cool definitely wicked half-smile . I shook my head uneasily . We were n't , of course . Far from it . " Now then , Colonel , " Mr. Kaufman went on briskly . " We 're on the side of law and order , and if my client  --  though so far I 'm damned if I can make out just who my client is ? " " It 's all of us , is n't it , Colonel Primrose ? " Rosemary asked . Colonel Primrose smiled politely . Why he sat there without so much as mentioning the ghastly business that was going on over at my house , I could n't make out . It seemed to me that he was deliberately wasting the most valuable time . " Perhaps it would n't do any harm , Mr. Kaufman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what the police know about this case , so far . " Mr. Kaufman flipped a piece of paper out of his pocket and unscrewed his pen . " Now we 're getting somewhere , " he said . " Mr. Parran knows , " Colonel Primrose said deliberately , " that Sandra Gould was upset and definitely excited when she went to the club Saturday evening . That 's what , in his mind , gives credence to the suicide note Mrs. Gould found on her dressing table . " " You any idea about that note , other than it is a suicide note ? " Mr. Kaufman asked sharply . " So far . . . no , " said Colonel Primrose . I thought he was a little annoyed . Kaufman grunted . " Here 's another point , Colonel . The lady did n't die by that blow on the back of the head . I 've seen  | your medical reports . Now , even if you could establish who struck her . . . " His finger pointed arrestingly at the Colonel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Even if my client  --  whoever the devil he isshould confess to striking her , that 's not murder , Colonel . " Colonel Primrose shook his head suavely . " Oh , no , no . Not as such . " I looked at him in horror . " Maggie Potter , Maggie Potter ! " I wanted to scream out . But he was saying nothing about it . He was , as Lilac says , as smooth as owl 's grease . George Barrol was staring , almost fascinated , at Jim . Indeed , I think everybody was , except Rodman Bishop and myself . " I have n't confessed anything of the sort , " Jim said angrily . Mr. Kaufman waved his hands in the air helplessly . " Oh , my God ! " he said . " Of course you have n't . Of course you have n't . You keep still . " He looked expectantly at Colonel Primrose . " After the incident of the capsized boat , " Colonel Primrose went on slowly , " she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . She was apparently waiting for her husband . " He looked at Jim , who 'd sat down and was staring down at the floor between his feet . " He did n't come . He went home with Mrs. Latham , and sat there till ten minutes of one , when he  | left . Well , it so happens that the period between then ? or , to go back a little , from twelve-thirty , say  --  and one-thirty is the period that we 've got to find out about . So far we know this : " I . Sandra Gould quarreled with a certain woman after midnight . " 2 . Between that time  --  after twelve , when Andy Thorp says he saw her last  --  and one o'clock , we have n't much idea . " 3 . At one o'clock , on Hawkins 's testimony , there 's not much doubt she was put unconscious in Thorp 's car with the motor running . " 4 . Hawkins says someone closed the door of the garage just after one o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve Columbus time , not Eastern Standard . " 5 . Of course whoever did it waited until it was time to announce the hour , turned the radio on , turned it off and left . That 's the person we want . " He paused a moment . " Mr. Andy Thorp , looking back towards the garage when Sandra Gould had left him to go back there , saw her talking with a woman , whom he did n't recognize . There 's no question that this woman was also there later , and saw all that went on that led to Sandra 's murder . " There was a strange silence on the porch . I think all of us must have looked guilty . All except Paul Dikranov , who looked interested but intensely unconcerned . If it had n't been for the scene at the club , I  | should have thought he did n't even know whom we were talking about . " Now then , " Colonel Primrose said . " We know that between eleven-thirty , when some of you left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latham found Sandra Gould 's body , a good many of you  --  namely , Mrs. Gould , Mr. Dikranov , Mr. Gould , Miss Bishop , the woman whom Sandra quarreled with , and both Mr. and Mrs. Thorp  --  were out of your houses within easy calling distance of the garage . And we know this also : that for some reason there 's been a strong disinclination on the part of all these people , or virtually all , to tell the truth . In fact , most of them , excepting Mr. Dikranov probably , have deliberately lied . Mr. Gould and Miss Rosemary are the two most conspicuous examples of what I 'm saying . " Nathan Kaufman grunted . " If you 've got an eyewitness , I think you ought to bring her forward without delay and pettifogging , " he said angrily . " I should be glad to , " Colonel Primrose said quietly . He looked round at each face in the group . " Unfortunately , she has been killed . " There was no sound on the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An hour ago . " Murdered . The word went like a shadow compounded of sound and moving lips around the stunned circle . Then a dreadful thing happened . Jim Gould staggered to his feet , his face as gray as death . Rodman  | Bishop 's big hand tightened on his daughter 's , checking her sudden impulse to rise . George Barrol said , " Is n't it awful ! " and looked from one to the other of us and back at Jim . I do n't suppose he meant to be heartless ; everything disturbs him equally  --  a mislaid pack of cigarettes , death , a slump in sugar . Colonel Primrose spoke quickly , looking steadily at Jim . " Not your mother , Mr. Gould , " he said quietly . The color surged back into Jim 's face as he realized , I suppose , what an awful thing he had done . He steadied himself against the back of his chair a moment , then sat down and took out a cigarette without a word . I suppose we all stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closed his mouth , flushing a little . It was obvious to everybody that he was going to point out what everybody must have realized , that Jim thought it was Alice Gould who 'd had the scene with Sandra at the garage Saturday night before she was killed . Rodman Bishop glared at him furiously . Jim said nothing at all . He had never had a ready line of snappy comebacks even in his best moments , and there 's no doubt anyway that keeping one 's mouth shut , whether it 's judicious or merely because you ca n't think of anything to say , has its points . The effect of what he had done was stunning enough . Only Paul Dikranov seemed sufficiently detached to keep to the point . " Who was it , Colonel Primrose ? " he asked easily . Colonel Primrose looked from face to face again .  | " Mrs. Potter , " he said . " Who ? " Rosemary cried . " Maggie Potter , " I said . " In my living room . " Rodman Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's preposterous , " he said , glaring at me . " The woman 's bedridden ! She has n't been out of her house for seven years ! " " Not since Chapin ? " George Barrol caught himself again at a swift warning glance from Rosemary . Rodman Bishop 's face darkened . He has never been the same since Chapin Bishop was found dead in the inlet below my place . It had made Rosemary too much the center of his life , in some way . I remember then , even at such a moment , thinking that it would have been so much better if he 'd married Alice Gould . " There 's no doubt Mrs. Potter had heard some of the rumors that have been fairly rife this summer , " Colonel Primrose went on gravely . " You all know what I mean  --  that her husband was interested in Sandra Gould . " Jim 's eyes stayed on the floor . He flushed a dull hot red . Nathan Kaufman , I could see , was watching him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , he had fixed on Rosemary . I suppose he would conceal all that when it came to the trial , but it was plain that at the moment he had quite obviously a strong suspicion in his mind . He glanced up , caught my eye , stared at me coldly a moment and turned away . After all , a husand in love with a girl like Rosemary , saddled with a  | wife who carried on with country doctors who had invalid wives  --  it was n't a pretty picture . Moreover ? even leaving out the fact that Jim was in love with Rosemary  --  it was a picture that a jury could easily understand . You could almost hear Jim 's life story being unfolded in court . " Jealousy is a powerful tonic , " Nathan Kaufman said professionally . Colonel Primrose nodded . " The woods are full of it , " George Barrol said flippantly . Colonel Primrose looked soberly at him for an instant . " You see , " he said quietly , " in spite of that suicide note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel his eyes on me for a bare instant . " ? there is no possible doubt , after what has happened to Mrs. Potter , that Sandra Gould was murdered . The immediate point concerns Mrs. Potter . I must find out where every person here  --  except Mrs. Latham , who was with me , and Mr. Kaufman  --  was from approximately quarter of eleven , when Mrs. Potter arrived in a taxi from the village , until a quarter past eleven , when Mrs. Latham and I found her dead in Mrs. Latham 's living room . " His voice was moving quietly against a background of utter silence . When it stopped there was nothing there . Even George had no word to say . Colonel Primrose looked around with a smile . " Good God , Colonel , " Nathan Kaufman said  | suddenly . " People ca n't just offhand say where they were at any hour of the day . " " An hour ago ? " said Colonel Primrose , still more quietly . Kaufman shook his head . " Not even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven . You were here then ? " He looked at Rodman Bishop . Mr. Bishop beetled his heavy brows at George Barrol , as if poor George was responsible , somehow , for the whole situation . I suppose that 's the penalty for being a secretarial doormat and a relative at the same time . Not that Rodman Bishop was n't awfully decent to George always , and very fond of him , but he did demand more constant service than anyone would have stood for who was less dependent . Socially dependent , not financially , because George has a very superior income . Just why he did stand for it no one could ever figure out , except that he had no other family and liked the life that Rosemary and her father led . Being with them was convenient , in a way , too , for it allowed him to go everywhere and at the same time protected him from designing mothers . No one else would ever think of him as marriageable  --  being as he is the old-fashioned semihardy variety of perennial bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flustered and blows his nose quickly . He did so now . " George and I were down in the cellar , " Rodman said emphatically . " Bottling the blackberry wine my  | son and I made when we were here before . It 's been in an old sherry keg . " " Did n't know bottle could Barrol wine , " Mr. Kaufman said , and laughed " Heh , heh , heh , heh " until we all thought he would n't stop at all . " And you , Miss Bishop ? " Colonel Primrose asked gently . Rodman Bishop looked at that instant about like a man sentenced to death . " I 'm very much afraid I ca n't tell you without consulting Mr. Kaufman privately , " Rosemary Bishop said . Her cool gray eyes met Colonel Primrose 's steadily . " Because it just happens that I was at Grace 's house from about half past ten until after Mrs. Potter came . In fact , I left after she came . " 17 WE STARED AT ROSEMARY-OR MOST OF US DID-IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of her mouth . " You see , " she said calmly , " it 's rather awful , being in love with a man whose wife 's just been murdered , so that if you speak to him even it looks like collusion . " I caught my breath sharply . I suppose for a mo-  | ment we all thought she 'd lost her mind completely . Only Colonel Primrose looked at her with perfect calm . Jim Gould stared at her , half rising for an instant from his seat , his face suddenly white , then dark red as the color rushed to his cheeks . Then he smiled suddenly , still staring at her . It was the first time he had smiled , I imagine , for some time . For just an instant he looked like the old Jim of the pre-Sandra days . But not for more than that . The silence was more than awkward . George Barrol tittered , as he would , for all the world like the village postmistress , and Nathan Kaufman raised one eyebrow with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was perfectly unmoved . Rodman Bishop was mopping his forehead . " And I had to see him , " Rosemary went on . " So I asked him to meet me at Grace 's . I knew she would n't mind . " Colonel Primrose nodded politely . " And did he come ? " Rosemary nodded . " Yes . He came . " She smiled across at Jim . " Not very willingly . He 's got old-fashioned notions about propriety . He does n't want people to talk . " " I do n't want them to talk about you , " Jim said simply . " He did n't stay very long . " " How long ? " Colonel Primrose asked . " Just long enough to tell me not to be silly . " " My God , " said Nathan Kaufman . He stopped  | abruptly and looked at Rodman Bishop . Colonel Primrose smiled a little . He turned abruptly to George . " And you , Barrol ? " George jumped . " Me ? Oh , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . I mean bottling it . " He blushed and glanced anxiously at Rodman Bishop . " I see , " Colonel Primrose said . He got up . I felt a little silly following him , but he seemed to expect it . We 'd got as far as the hedge when I looked back . Jim Gould was coming out . He did n't follow us . He went around to the road and out that way . He was whistling . We crossed the tennis court and the lawn to the porch just as Adam Potter 's car drove in the back gate . Sergeant Buck was on the porch . He came to meet us . " All there except the husband , " he said , in a loud whisper . " This Potter had been there but he 'd left . " Sergeant Buck glanced around over his shoulder at the man getting out of the car . " They said he was feeling the heat . I went to the club . He 'd had two whiskies neat which he never done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known to take a drink during hours . " He drew off a little and stood at an informal attention as Dr. Potter came up . He looked definitely haggard . " Elsie Carter said you wanted me , " he said , taking off his new panama and wiping his forehead . He  | looked from me to Colonel Primrose inquiringly . " It sure is a scorcher . " Sergeant Buck really need n't have gone to the club bar . The man 's breath was appallingly eloquent . " I wanted you , doctor , " Colonel Primrose said . Even if he had not known it , one glance at Sergeant Buck 's granite physiognomy should have been warning enough  --  or no doubt one glance at my face should have been  --  that something unusual was in store for him . " Inside , if you please . " Colonel Primrose led the way . I knew he was watching Adam Potter like a hawk , seeing every hesitating nervous twitch in his face and hands . If I 'd dared I would have cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . And I could n't help thinking that he knew it , even though that was impossible . He went along with them . I stayed behind , watching their painful progress to the porch steps and through the screen door that Sergeant Buck held open . He 'd have to see her in two or three more steps , through the French windows , lying there ! I turned away . I could n't bear to have it all happening in my house . Then there was a shout and confused steps and a hysterical babble , and when I turned around Dr. Potter was trying to pull away , with Sergeant Buck holding him , and Mr. Parran and two of his men on the porch . Then abruptly there was no more confusion , only Adam Potter slumped down there in a porch chair , his head in his hands , Mr. Parran standing over him .  | I went up to the porch . Adam Potter 's face was ghastly . " I did n't do it , I swear to God I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook like a leaf . " You passed here and saw her . You came back and murdered her . " " I did n't . I swear to God I did n't . " " You struck her with the doorstop . " " No , no ! " " When did you kill her ? " " I did n't , I did n't ! I tell you I did n't ! " Mr. Parran bent his thin face down towards him . " Before you had a drink , Potter , or after ? " I glanced angrily at Colonel Primrose . The man was in no shape for this . " Listen , Dr. Potter , " he said gently . " We know you went by in your car while she was out in back talking to Julius . " Dr. Potter raised his head . He nodded dumbly . " I thought I was crazy , " he muttered . " I thought I was crazy . " Parran looked significantly at Colonel Primrose , who shook his head a little . " You knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it could n't have been , she could n't walk ! She has n't gone out for years ! I thought I was having hallucinations . " " You realized she 'd been out before ? " Dr. Potter stared at the State 's Attorney . " No , no ! "  | " That she 'd been spying on you , Saturday night ? When you killed Sandra Gould ? " Dr. Potter shook his head dumbly . " Did n't you kill Sandra Gould ? " He shook his head back and forth . " All right , " Colonel Primrose said . " All right . Take your time . " Dr. Potter seemed like a man coming out of a stupor . He passed his hand across his wet forehead and moistened his lips . " No , no , " he said . " I tell you , I saw her , but I did n't believe it was her . I thought I was ill . I . . . I have n't been sleeping nights . " Mr. Parran leaned forward again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam Potter looked at him more quietly with a little of his normal self showing in his face . He even smiled a little . " No , " he said . " My customers have been having babies . " " Where were you Saturday night , Dr. Potter ? " Colonel Primrose said . " After the boat episode at the club ? When your wife was undoubtedly out of the house ? " Dr. Potter stared at him for an instant . A light dawned slowly in his haggard face . " So that 's it , " he said , half to himself . He looked directly at Colonel Primrose . " I got a call at the clubhouse just after the orchestra came , Saturday night  --  some people up at Nag 's Head . Their first baby , and they called me in hours before they needed me . I phoned Maggie from  | the club , then I tried to get her from Nag 's Head about one , to tell her I probably would n't be in till morning . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't leave . When I got back , around three-thirty , she said the phone had n't rung . I put it down to the fact that she must have been asleep and did n't hear it . " " You said no more about it ? " " No , no . I . . . anything else was impossible , I tell you ! " Dr. Potter shuddered , motioning towards the living room . " But why that  --  for Maggie ? I do n't understand . . . " " She was out having an eye on you , Potter , " the State 's Attorney drawled . " She thought you were keeping a late date with Sandra Gould . She was seen quarreling with Sandra at the garage , just about the time the murder took place . Were , you there too ? " Adam Potter 's face , lean and sallow and hot , flushed a sudden angry red . He controlled himself with a painful effort , and shook his head . " I do n't understand it at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ca n't understand it . I 've seen a lot of Sandra Gould professionally and around the Colony . Maggie never acted as if she 'd . . . heard any gossip . God knows there 's always enough of it around , about anything . Maggie only complained because nobody ever told her any . " " You never noticed anything unusual about her manner , lately ? " He shook his head wearily . " I suppose I 'd quit noticing anything . I see so  | much sickness , real and imagined . I get used to it , I guess . Maggie was n't sick , she 'd just gone under . Neurotic , nothing to do , good way to get sympathy ? dramatizing herself . Oh , I guess she 'd have been different if I 'd been a successful practitioner in Baltimore ? instead of a country hack . " He gave me a tired smile . " I guess that 's why Sandra Gould appealed to me . Just a healthy animal , lively and gay . No history of her ills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disillusioned hand over his damp forehead , took a deep breath and got to his feet . " That 's all I can tell you about it , Colonel Primrose. ? Do you want me to . . . look at her ? " They went inside . After a while Colonel Primrose came out , with the Sergeant and Mr. Parran . He sat down and shook his head soberly . " It 's an odd thing , " he said . " He saw her , standing out there talking to Julius when he went by , but he knew she was n't there , could n't be . So he analyzed himself and decided he was getting pathological . I imagine Mrs. Gould probably was on his mind  --  more than he 'd admit to us . Well , my next move is the clubhouse . I leave this end to you , Parran . Will you come with me , Mrs. Latham ? " I wanted so much to get away from there that I would have gone to China with him . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . Sergeant Buck , standing at a sort of sentry post by the door , cleared his throat abruptly , and said ,  | quite out of an empty sky , " There 's no fool like an old fool . " We all looked at him , planted there , a solid mountain of disapproval ; and I 'm sure Colonel Primrose reddened a little . " I was referring back to Dr. Potter , " Sergeant Buck added stiffly . " Oh , " Colonel Primrose said . He gave me a sideways grin , and I felt definitely like a fool myself . " Well , in that case let 's go along , Mrs. Latham. " 18 WE DID N'T STOP AT THE CLUBHOUSE . WE WENT down the stone steps to the dock . It was a gorgeous sunny day . A few men who had n't had to get back to town for business were there in old slacks and sweat shirts or in bathing trunks , puttering about their boats or getting blistered in the sun . They would glance up as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and nod to the Colonel , and then , as we passed , I could hear the uneasy silence settle down , feel it behind me . I knew they were looking and wondering , as well they might . " I 'm afraid I 'm ruining your reputation , Mrs. Latham , " Colonel Primrose said as we came to Andy 's boat with the broken mast tied to the dock . " Nobody will ever trust me with a secret again , certainly , " I said .  | He had passed that and was down on one knee , looking into the shallow boat rocking there gently on the little waves . " They brought them in here ? " " Farther down , " I said . " Both Jim and Andy dived in . Somebody else must have got the boat . " " Sandra was a good swimmer ? " " She was a marvelous swimmer . Her parents were undoubtedly amphibian . " " And George Barrol ? " " George 's parents dwelt on a mountaintop , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " Dreadful experience for him , " he said . " That woman had a powerful attraction , to get him out. ? It 's odd , though , is n't it ? " I looked at him , puzzled . " I mean , odd that he held her up , till Jim got there ? " " That 's his story , " I said . " She was struck by the jib and knocked out . He hung on to her till his strength gave out . She came to  --  it could n't have taken very long , either for her to come to or for George 's strength to give out  --  and held him up . She had him by the collar when Jim got out there . " Colonel Primrose nodded . " It 's reasonable , " he said . " She was certainly entirely recovered from the crack on the head when she came up to the clubhouse . " He pulled the jib out from under a pile of white sail and looked carefully at it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Raining hard anyway . "  | He got painfully to his feet and brushed off his knee . " She was so perfectly herself , " he went on , " that that 's why I could n't think she 'd been hit very hard with this thing . " " Did you see them when they came up ' ? " I asked . I do n't know why I 'd just assumed he had n't . " Oh , yes . There was a great to-do about getting them dry , and borrowing a blazer from somebody 's locker to put on Sandra , and so on . She was quite the heroine of the occasion . I take it , of course , she 'd be delighted to be the center of attention . George looked like a drowned rat . She was exactly herself , just as if she 'd been out for a plunge . " He stood there a moment , thinking . " You and Jim Gould did n't go up with them ' ? " " No . Jim was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think he really believes yet that she was in any danger  --  just scaring the wits out of George for the fun of it . So she 'd manage to get the spotlight away from Rosemary too , of course . They 'd been out there five minutes , you see , before they capsized . I think Jim still thinks she did it on purpose ? it was one of her favorite tricks . She 'd love it , and the rougher the better . Poor George ! It must be a pretty sickening feeling if you ca n't swim . " Colonel Primrose nodded absently . " It must be that , " he said . We went back up the steps and across the lawn , parched brown in spots with the summer heat , to the broad cool veranda of the old mansion . A few children  | were playing there ; hardly anybody comes out , as a rule , until afternoon . Alec , the colored houseboy , was polishing the brass knocker on the big front door . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lounge having early cocktails , talking about Sandra , I suppose , because they stopped abruptly when we looked in . I do n't know what else they could be expected to be talking about . " Is there a maid in the ladies ' powder room ? " Colonel Primrose asked . " Not ordinarily . Clara 's around all the time . She was there , Saturday night , to take care of people 's wraps , if that 's what you mean . " He nodded . " See if she 's there now , will you ? " I crossed the lounge to the door in the corner and looked in . Clara was there with a dust mop in one hand and a fly swatter in the other , a sun-tan silk stocking pulled toboggan-fashion over her kinky old head . She peered at me through her gold-rimmed spectacles . " Mo'nin ' , Mis ' Grace . How 's those boys ? " " Fine , Clara . Look here  --  Colonel Primrose wants to ask you some questions . " Her old lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tellin ' that man nothin ' , " she said . " Can I bring him in ? " " Ah don ' know ? " We did n't need to argue . He was already in . I saw that in the scared look in her eyes as the door opened behind me . " I want to ask you about last Saturday night , " he said , after I 'd formally introduced him . Clara has a  | strong sense of the proprieties , and having an Army gentleman in the ladies ' dressing room obviously was a gross infringement of them . " Ah don ' know nothin " bout Sa'day night , " Clara said . " First Ah heard ' bout Mis ' Gould 's carryin's-on was when Miss Rosemary tol ' me ' bout it . " " Oh ? " Colonel Primrose said . " When was that ? " " When they was out in the bay . " " Miss Rosemary came in here ? " " She come in lookin ' lak a ghost , an ' Ah says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nothin ' , Clara . ' Then Ah heard a lot of shriekin ' an ' yellin ' . Ah didn ' know whether Ah could go out or whether Ah best stay with her . She says , Go on , Clara , it 's a good show , go an ' watch it . ' " Clara wagged her old head , and Colonel Primrose nodded his , with apparently a good deal of interest . " She did ? " he said . " What did you do ? " " Ah didn ' lak her looks , an ' Ah tol ' her so , an ' she jus ' laughed . " " What did you think was ? " It was n't necessary for him to finish his question . Like so many of these old colored folk who ca n't read or write , Clara is as bright as a whip . " Ah couldn ' say ' zactly , Colonel Primrose . She was settin ' by the fireplace , jus ' starin ' at the grate , jus ' studyin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah 'm O.K. ' So Ah went , but they was all acomin ' up the hill . Ah come back an ' Ah says , Thank God , they 's safe . ' Miss Rosemary she got up , throwed her cigarette in the fireplace , an ' says , Well , that 's that . ' Ah declare  | Ah was s'prised at Miss Rosemary . ' Deed Ah wasain ' nobody sweeter round here . " Colonel Primrose nodded . " Did anybody else come in ? " " Nobody but Mis ' Alice . She come in an ' didn ' say nothin ' , she jus ' walks over to Miss Rosemary an ' kisses her on the forehaid an ' goes out again , an ' Miss Rosemary she didn ' say nothin ' either . After a while Miss Rosemary goes over to the lookin ' glass , powders her nose an ' goes out herself . ' Deed Ah ain ' never seen people act lak that in all mah days . " " Then Miss Sandra came in later ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colored people around the place have been there , most of them , for a long time . We knew some of them when we were children . They called Mrs. Gould Mis ' Alice , ' but Sandra was always Mis ' Gould . ' It was curiously effective , of course , in emphasizing the fact that she really did n't belong . " Mis ' Gould ? Yas , suh . She come in . She never looked lak she even been scared . She come in dancin ' on her toes , singin ' a foreign song . An ' she never said nothin ' either , she jus ' went over to the lookin ' glass , grinnin ' an ' makin ' pretty faces at herself . Then she come over to the writin ' table . " The old woman pointed to the desk against the wall under the window . I listened to her with a sort of measured interest . It 's often occurred to me later that it was strange I did n't realize the tremendous importance of what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did  | either  --  not just at the moment , while we were both standing there in the powder room . But , as I saw in just a moment , he had far more excuse for not realizing it than I had . " She sat down an ' wrote . " " She wrote ? " Colonel Primrose asked . " Yas , suh . Look lak she couldn ' make up her mm " bout what she want to write , ' cause she kep ' writin ' a little an ' then pullin ' out a fresh piece of paper an ' writin ' some more . " " What did she do with the old ones ? " " When she got all through she picked ' em all up an ' took ' em over to the fireplace , an ' she set a match to ' em , " Clara said . " An ' then out she traipses , never sayin ' a word an ' looking almighty pleased with herself . " Colonel Primrose smiled a little . He looked over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good show , " he said . He took an envelope out of his pocket and opened it . I watched him with increasing interest . He took out the folded creased piece of paper I 'd seen on the table in my living room the night before . next to Sandra 's suicide note and the blue petals . " Could this be the piece of paper ? " Clara looked at it and nodded . " That there 's one paper  --  Ah cain ' say it 's the same piece , ' cause they 's paper all through the club lak it , but it might be , an ' she never took no envelope . " Colonel Primrose handed the paper to me . " That 's her writing , is n't it , Mrs. Latham ? "  | I could only suppose he intended me to read it . I did . It said : I think I must talk to you . I have a proposition . I will forget what I know if you will do a very little easy thing for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can after I go home . Be sure . That was all . No signature , no salutation ; no names to show who had written it or for whom it had been written . I handed it back to Colonel Primrose . " It 's her writing , " I said . " You could compare it with the other note . " He looked at me oddly for just a fleeting instant . My heart chilled a little in spite of all I could do . " I 've done that , Mrs. Latham , " he said . He put the letter back in his pocket . When we were outside I asked him about it , but he shook his head . " You know , " he said , " I ca n't make out Sandra Gould 's literary remains . In fact , this whole business gets harder and harder . " He spoke with a sort of resigned humorous petulance . " You do n't believe those two notes are hers ? " I inquired sweetly . " Oh , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt they are hers . But why should she write the suicide note at all ? And why write this thing at all ? And why write all the notes and start off on another , as the maid there says ? And why burn all the ones she 'd done ? " He looked at me with a puzzled frown .  | " It does n't make sense , Mrs. Latham . " " Well , " I said , " Sandra was always scribbling notes . Have you found out who that one was written to ? " He nodded . " This is strictly in the lodge . It was found  --  I prefer not to say how or by whom  --  in Dikranov 's pocket . " " Oh . " I had the feeling , which turned out to be perfectly stupid , that this was beginning to make things clearer to me . " He says she did n't give it to him and he never saw it before I showed it to him . As a matter of fact , I saw her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dummy at the bridge table . I saw her go up to him in the hall before she went out . Andy Thorp had come up and was looking for her . She did n't have time to speak to him , but she certainly had time to thrust that note into his hand  --  or his jacket pocket . " " Did he meet her ? " I asked . " And did he hit her over the head with a monkey wrench ? " he said . " I do n't know . I presume he did meet her . " He grinned suddenly . " All I know about the wrench is that it has your fingerprints on it , Mrs. Latham . " " I picked it up off the floor ? " I began patiently , and a little annoyed too . He smiled again . " I know . The point is that Jim Gould says he left it on the kitchen porch when he came from town . He admits buying it at Toplady's. "  | I could remember so clearly that Saturday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Barrol coming across the street . " You see , Mrs. Latham , I know everybody here would perjure himself to hell and back again to save the Goulds . But just think about Jim Gould a minute . What a case the State 's Attorney 's got against him ! He 's not himself , to begin with , he 's been drinking heavily  --  more than he ever had in all his life . He and Sandra are quarreling constantly . All the servants say that . He 's fed up to the teeth with her . I saw that long before I knew any of the Rosemary business . She 'd ruined his career , ruined his life . She was flirting with every stray male she met  --  even poor old Dr. Potter . " He smiled a little as I shook my head . " I do n't say Potter was having an affair with her . Well , she was ruining Jim 's sister 's life too . Thorp had obviously lost his head over her . He was acting ? still is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosemary comes back quite suddenly . He does n't know anything about it . Nobody tells him . He sees her cold . The shock sends a mint julep crashing out of his hand onto the floor  --  in public . Then Sandra puts on a scene that makes him ridiculous and cheap , in front of all his friends . He goes home with you , sore and hurt and desperately unhappy , I 'd imagine  --  and ready to throw in the sponge . Then he goes home , leaving your place at ten minutes to one . He meets her . Maybe he met Rosemary first , which would n't help anything certainly . Let 's say he met Sandra with Dikranov . He goes to the house . She follows him . You can imagine  | the state he 's in . He hits her over the head with the wrench and goes on inside  --  or goes along to meet Rosemary , whichever way it happened . It does n't make much difference . " " And how did she get into Andy 's car in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing I had him there . He shook his head . " That 's so easy , Mrs. Latham , " he said , rather reproachfully . " You have n't understood this . She has scratches all over her legs , her shins are skinned , her arms are bruised . " I stared at him in astonishment and horror . He met my gaze steadily . " There 's no remotest doubt , Mrs. Latham , " he said soberly , " that somebody carried , or dragged , Sandra Gould to the car . She was hit over the head with that wrench , and put into the car with the engine running . " We were walking back to my place from the clubhouse , along the patch overlooking the bay . I tried not to look at him . It all seemed so devilishly futile to try to hold out against this slow inexorable closing in and weeding out , drawing the net tighter and tighter before he would , one moment , open it and find somebody wriggling helplessly in the toils of it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A man , " he went on deliberately , " could have got her into the car , you 'd think , without all those bruises and marks . Unless  --  just for instance , Mrs.  | Latham  --  it was a man coolly and craftily trying to make out that it was done by a woman . " He shook his head . " Complicates things , does n't it ? " " It still could have been . . . Andy , for instance , then . " " Andy obviously has ideas on this subject , " he said . He smiled a little . " The fact that he buried Lucy Lee 's slippers in the bank shows that . Those slippers are interesting . The soles show a frantic search , or chase , or perhaps a vigil , in pretty damp grass . There 's car grease on them that somebody 's tried to clean off with benzine . They 've had whisky on them . In fact , they show pretty conclusively that they 've been in a garage , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick ominous feeling in the pit of my stomach for him to go on to the bunch of blue flowers , but he seemed to have forgotten them . " We know , " he went on deliberately , " that Lucy Lee left her mother and went home at ten-thirty , Saturday night . She came back later . The implications of what she did are obvious . She would n't have been out if her husband had n't been out . He knew Sandra was somewhere with his car  --  or so he says . Oh , well . . . the question is , Where was he ? And where was Lucy Lee ? And where was Mrs. Gould senior ? And where were Rosemary and Jim , who were meeting at one o'clock ? And why , in so small a space , did n't some of them see some of the others ' ? Of course , the answer to that , Mrs. Latham , is that they did . They must have . " I could think of only one thing to say .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes . Mr. Dikranov . He 's an interesting fellow . I doubt if he 'd want the Bishops to know just how extremely interesting he is . " " Sandra knew him , of course . " He nodded . " I 'm afraid she did . But I did n't know how to prove it  --  or , what 's more interesting , what difference it makes . " " Then , " I said , " you do n't really think Jim killed Sandra ? " He looked at me steadily . " If Jim Gould struck Sandra in great anger , with that monkey wrench , " he said slowly , " and left her , he did n't kill her . Do n't forget it was carbon monoxide that killed her . " " How ghastly , " I could n't help but say . " On the other hand , if someone else struck Sandra with intent to kill , and someone else still , thinking Jim had done it , let 's say , and that she was already dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that becomes a horse of a different color , does n't it ? " " Does it ? " I asked stupidly . " Well , legally perhaps not . But actually , with a jury trial , I should think so . If you and Mrs. Gould had been trying to cover up Jim ? " I gasped in horror . " Me ! " I said . " Oh , dear ! " He looked at me with a sort of sardonic amuse ment . " Let 's skip it then . I do n't want to distress you .  | But you have n't told me yet why anyone wanted to shoot you . " " Lots of people ca n't stand the way I comb my hair , " I said . It was a feeble attempt to reduce all this to a palpable absurdity . He shook his head . " That 's where you 're making a big mistake . People do n't attempt to murder other people for such good reasons as that . No , it 's never that simple . Motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter and the attempt on you . They 're obvious . Someone was trying to cover up . You 're both in the way . Whether you know why , and are prejuring yourself to save somebody , I would n't know . You 're a fool if you are . Mrs. Potter knew and was on the point of telling  --  and look what happened to her . " It was n't a pleasant idea . I did n't , furthermore , know how to convince him that I really had not seen Sandra killed . Which apparently he seemed to believe . " As for Sandra , that 's a different matter , " he went on thoughtfully . " I 'd say the chief motives for murder generally are greed , fear , love  --  or hate , jealousy or revenge . Those are all pretty fundamental psychological concepts . Mrs. Potter 's death was due to fear . That can be a complex business , you know . A cornered rat fights because of fear . I 'd say offhand it 's a damned sight more powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others  --  than jealousy , for example . " This was a little hard for me to follow  | " Then what have you been saying about these people ? " I demanded . " Surely if Rosemary , or Lucy Lee either , had murdered Sandra , that would have been the motive . Jim 's , or his mother 's  --  that would be hate , I suppose . But what about the others ? " " The motive that was behind the monkey wrench was n't necessarily the one that was behind the carbon monoxide , " he said . I thought about that a few moments . " That was fear , I suppose , " I said . " But it would n't be fear of Sandra so much as fear for someone else . " " I said fear was a pretty complex business , " Colonel Primrose remarked . " It 's one of those things that have long roots  --  and long arms . It does n't have to be anything that happened today , or yesterday . " " I see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note in Paul Dikranov 's pocket . 19 SUSPECT COLONEL PRIMROSE WAS AS SURPRISED AS I was to see Jim Gould and Sergeant Buck sitting on the front steps of my house so deep in conversation that they did n't even see us coming until we were almost up to them . When they did Buck jumped to his feet , giving the Colonel a sharp probing glance  --  unless I was mistaken  --  no doubt to see whether I 'd pro-  | posed to him . Then he came to an abrupt attention . " Mr. Gould 's got an idea , sir , " he said stiffly . " Really ? " said Colonel Primrose . " What is it ? " " It 's about the foreigner , sir . " " Yes ? " Colonel Primrose gave me a glance . " Yes , sir . It 's his idea that the foreigner knew the missus in Georgia . " He looked over at Jim out of one eye . Jim grinned . There was something decidedly grim , just the same , about his lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little against the sun , on the Colonel . " It sounds cockeyed , Colonel Primrose , I admit , " he said easily , shifting his long sinewy frame from one leg to the other . " I did n't pry into my wife 's affairs . But I guess anybody 'd have been blind if he did n't see she knew him when he first came into the clubhouse . " " I noticed she did , " Colonel Primrose said . " You did ? Well , then , I guess I 'm not telling you anything . " " That depends , of course . " " She called him up when we were at dinner and talked to him . She was pretty sore when she came back to the table . " " You did n't hear what she said ? " Colonel Primrose asked bluntly . " I heard it , all right , but I do n't speak the language . " Colonel Primrose nodded . " Georgian , of course .  | ? You did n't happen to see him , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim shook his head . " No . " " Whom did you see ? " " Nobody but Santa Claus , " Jim said cheerfully . " Did you see Santa Claus this noon too ? When Mrs. Potter was killed ? " The smile left Jim 's face . " No . I did n't see anybody . Except Miss Bishop . I saw her , here . I went directly home by the side door . I did n't know Mrs. Potter was in the house . " Colonel Primrose nodded politely . " And Saturday night  --  where did you meet Miss Bishop , at one o'clock ? " Jim hesitated . Then he nodded down towards the group of white chairs by the tree . " Down there . I was going for a walk before I went home . We walked down to the lane and back up through their garden . I cut straight across here and home . " " When would that be ? " " Two-fifteen , perhaps , I do n't know . " " You 're sure you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of an instant that Jim hesitated was imperceptible unless you knew him very well , or so I thought . " Quite sure . " " Just what was your mother doing , Gould ? " Colonel Primrose asked  --  suavely . Jim flushed a little . " I did n't see my mother ,  | Colonel Primrose , " he said evenly . The two of them looked directly at each other for a long time . I could n't have said whether it was challenge or merely appraisal . " That 's straight , Colonel , " Jim added steadily . Colonel Primrose nodded again . Jim took a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket . His brown hands were perfectly steady as he held his lighter to his cigarette and snapped it shut . " I did n't come over for a cross-examination , anyway , " he said curtly . " I just came over to tell you I do n't think much of the method of hounding women and children , and tell you I 'm in on this myself from now on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully . He hesitated an instant , looking questioningly at Jim . " Have you . . learned something ? " Jim hesitated also , a barely perceptible fraction of a moment . He shook his head grimly . " Well , " Colonel Primrose remarked , " you 'll find it a little difficult to take much of a part in this if you 've just made up your mind about things . And a little dangerous . " " You can leave that to me , Colonel . " We watched his long figure move swiftly across the lawn towards the Bishops ' . I looked at Colonel Primrose . He was staring after him thoughtfully . He looked at me , shaking his head a little . " That young man 's headed for trouble , " he said . " He 's found out something , or thinks he has , that 's changed the setup for him . What was it , Buck ? " The ' iron-faced Sergeant shook his head .  | " He 's had a heart-to-heart talk with his brotherin-law , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Jim 's disappearing form with some approval . " He 's a good boy , sir , " he added . I brightened up considerably at that , for some reason , but I learned later that that was a mistake . It seemed that in all the businesses of this sort that the two of them had been in , the people Sergeant Buck took a fancy to invariably turned out to be monsters of villainy . At least , so Colonel Primrose maintained . I learned later , also , that Sergeant Buck was a man of considerable means , having invested his army pay and army poker winnings in houses on the Coast near naval stations , and actually , what with his retired pay and his rents , doing rather better than his colonel with his retired pay and his nonproductive stocks . There was never any confusion about their relationship , however . The Colonel was still the Colonel and the Sergeant still the Sergeant  --  though he did often seem a pretty severe manager . It was apparent now that whatever Jim had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite definitely sold himself to Sergeant Buck . Personally I suspected it was because the Colonel had left Buck and taken me . Also , of course , here was Jim obviously a fine young fellow done in by a woman , and a foreign woman at that . I left the two of them a few minutes after Jim had gone and went around the house to get my car . I had n't been to the village all day , and the family larder was definitely low . I got the car and set out for  | Church Street with utterly no idea of what an important development in the business of Sandra Gould and Maggie Potter I was about to run into , or how ? just as in Mrs. Potter 's case  --  a hitherto quite trivial figure in the whole affair was to take on new proportions . It was , I suppose , nothing short of Fate that when I walked into the tea store Elsie Carter should be there , pressing the cantaloupes and turning the berry boxes upside down . She abandoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where I was . " My dear Grace , this must be simply terrible for you , you poor child ! " She fixed me with a bright predatory eye . " I 'm bearing up wonderfully , Elsie , " I said . " Oh but my dear ! What could you expect ' ? I told poor Maggie just last week that I did n't see how she stood it . " I stared at her a horrified instant . " You did ? " I said , and no doubt very bitterly . " Then you can thank yourself for Maggie Potter 's death . " Elsie turned a livid green . " And what 's more , " I went on furiously , " if you could bring yourself to stop all this nonsense about Rosemary and Jim , we 'd all be better off . " I do n't really know why I said that , except that I was dreadfully angry all of a sudden at her carrying her wretched gossip to poor Maggie Potter . Certainly I had n't the faintest notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from green to a dead-white . Her sharp beady eyes fairly burned holes into me . " You 're not the one to talk , Grace Latham ! " She almost spat the words at me . " Do n't think I have n't got eyes in my head . What 's Rodman Bishop doing around your house all the time ? " I gaped stupidly at her . She 'd got started and under way , and when Elsie once gets that far nobody has ever been known to stop her . " And what 's more , if Rosemary Bishop comes back here , and has n't the decency to leave Jim alone , you ca n't blame Sandra for fighting for her happiness ? and you ca n't expect me to perjure myself when Colonel Primrose asks me about it ! Heaven knows I 'm merely doing my duty as I see it ! " " Oh dear ! " I thought . I could have known that very astute little man with the sparkling black eyes had no doubt been doing lots of things he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodman Bishop was quite right . The trouble with the world is that too many people are barging about doing their duty as they see it . George Barrol was n't the only one . " I did n't know Rosemary and Sandra had taken to fighting , or at any rate not in the public streets , " I said , as casually as I could manage . " Then the crowd 's wrong in thinking Colonel Primrose takes you into his confidence , " Elsie snapped spitefully . " He came to me yesterday afternoon . Obviously realizing that the whole lot of you could n't  | be relied on to tell the truth. ? Even if you knew it , " she added with sharp malice . I do n't know why I felt I had to defend my position as confidante of the Colonel  --  especially when what she was saying about our unreliability was only too true . But there 's something about Elsie 's predatory nose and thin lips and prying eyes that would make a cat defend a mouse . " Colonel Primrose has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said stiffly  --  and truthfully . I realized also that it was more truthful than I 'd thought . And actually it was really more truthful than I realized even then . Just then somebody reached past her and started to take the largest and crispest head of iceberg lettuce . Elsie turned and grasped it firmly out of her hand . I fled , feeling just as if I 'd eaten a large cold pancake . What must Colonel Primrose have heard from Elsie Carter  --  or rather , what could n't he have heard from her ? I dreaded to think of it , but I could n't keep the series of crazy notions Elsie had had for years from rushing like wild horses through my head . Rodman Bishop and Alice Gould had been " carrying on . " Dr. Potter was slowly doing poor Maggie to death . Little Andy Thorp was deaf and dumb , because he did n't talk till late . Sandra 's baby had been born Chinese , or Malay , or green , or yellow , or something pretty ghastly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew but the hospital people . The manager of the club had sold the original paneling to the Metropolitan one winter and replaced it with beaverboard and pocketed  | the money . Rosemary 's dull gold hair was peroxide , my auburn hair was henna . Sandra was really from Hoboken , New Jersey ; she was really an escaped Georgian aristocrat , misunderstood and nagged to death by Alice Gould . Chapin Bishop 's head had been forcibly held in the pool until he 'd drowned . The Catholics were building a tunnel to the White House , President Roosevelt was a Jew . In fact , I could n't think of any notion that Elsie Carter had n't had . I shuddered to think of the tale she must have told Colonel Primrose . Especially if , as she 'd virtually said , she 'd actually seen Rosemary and Sandra quarreling . . . I opened the door of my car and waited for the boy to put my groceries on the back seat . " Hello , Grace , " somebody said . " How 's the charnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming down Mr. Toplady 's steps , carrying a can of kerosene with a potato stuck on the spout . " It 's just dandy , " I said . Then I thought of something . " When did you leave the clubhouse the other night , by the way , Bill ? " " I would n't know , Grace . " He grinned . " My friends can probably tell you . " " Would you happen to remember when the Carters left ? " Bill Chetwynd wrinkled his forehead and squinted his eyes , trying to think , which is rather hard for him .  | " Yeah , now , lessee . You mean the lady that 's a cross between an elephant and a hawk , married to the little guy that looks like the stuff they used to give us in the nursery instead of tea . " " That 's the people , " I said patiently . " Lord , Grace , you do n't think she did Sandra in ? " " Shut up , " I said quickly . Elsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips compressed , not missing anything that was going on , from Bill and me to the Reverend Arrowsmith 's daughter in shorts smoking a cigarette with some boy at the popcorn stand . " Hello , Mrs. Carter ! " Bill said . " Lovely day , is n't it ? Too hot , though . " He grinned at me as Elsie went on . " Now , lessee . I can tell you , if it 's important . What I mean is , I 'm not going to all the trouble to think about the Carters unless it 's damn important . I 'd rather think about anteaters , or a nice cool drink of vitriol . " " Please , Bill , do n't be an idiot , " I pleaded . " I really want to know . " " O.K. Then I was in the bar having a drink . " " I know , darling . It 's the Carters  --  you know , the Carters . " " Sure . I was in the bar . Ferney Carter was in the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " ' Struth . Ferney Carter was there having a lemon coke . It was  --  lessee  --  it was just when they dragged  | the foreign gal and Georgie out of the water . I said ? " " No , Bill . The Carters ! " " I 'm getting to ' em . Elsie came to the door and said , Ferney dear , we ought to be going home , it 's late . ' Need I say more ? Next thing I knew there was a gap , and then Andy Thorp was filling it by saying a double whisky neat . " " Oh , " I said . " Then the Carters left before Andy and Sandra . " " Not so fast , girl . Not so fast . When I went upstairs , Ferney dear was sitting in the hall , hat on his knees . Dame Elsie was gassing with some old girl about whether the men would n't prefer creamed chicken and peas at the auxiliary picnic to peas and creamed chicken . " " Bill , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really ! " " But that 's a fact , Grace . I know , because I 'd had just enough to make my heart bleed for poor old Ferney . I said , Elsie , ca n't Ferney go have another coke , just one more ? ' She said , Bill , you 're a man , which would you rather have , creamed chicken and peas ? ' and I said Yes ' and tottered off . I waited to dance with Rose , but she 'd gone too . Then I went and fetched Ferney a lemon coke , but I had to water the rubber plant with it . He 'd gone . " " You would n't know what time that was ? " " It was before one , " Bill said earnestly . " Because I do n't remember anything after one . " " Well , that 's a help , " I said . " I wanted to know , because Elsie 's going to be an eyewitness to Rosemary slogging Sandra over the head with the monkey  | wrench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wondered whether she could possibly have been anywhere in the district . " Bill shook his head . " Could n't tell you , " he said cheerfully . " I can tell you this  --  I 'd like to slog her . " " Would n't we all . " I answered rather absently , because it was a sort of academic point anyway . Chiefly , however , because I was just then remembering the crack she 'd taken at me about Rodman Bishop , and trying to figure out what she 'd meant by it . I should probably have thought about it seriously enough to see its importance if I had n't had to go on to a Red Cross Board Meeting , and after that out to Mrs. Rowe 's to get two country hams she 'd been saving for me . As it was I dismissed it  --  much too lightly . Even Elsie Carter has to be right once in a while . 20 IT WAS AFTER FIVE WHEN I GOT HOME . NO ONE WAS around , and the Bishops had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got back . " Where are the Colonel and Sergeant Buck , Julius ? " I asked . " ' Deed , Mis ' Grace , an ' Ah couldn ' say , " Julius said serenely . " A boy come clear out with a telegram fo ' the Colonel , ' stead of phonin ' it , an ' they got in  | the cah an ' drove off . ' Deed an ' Ah don ' know which way they went . " It did n't take very long for me to find out where they 'd got to . I saw Colonel Primrose the minute I passed the magnolia trees and came towards the porch . He was there , very much at his ease , and oddly enough the Goulds were there too , all of them except Andy . If it had n't been for the haunted look in Lucy Lee 's eyes , and the constant cigarettes she smoked , and George 's uneasy titter , I should never have guessed from the group on the porch that the heavy dreadful somber cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pall premiere classe . Jim especially was more jubilantly himself than I 'd seen him for years . The sun , filtering through the leaves , made a moving arabesque of light and shade on Rosemary 's gold hair and warm peach-tan skin , and played on her yellow sun-backed frock and bare brown arms and legs . She looked extraordinarily lovely and detached too  --  only her long gray eyes were warm and alive and intensely present . Dikranov watched her , I thought , with an almost wistful quality of worship in his dark face . Rodman Bishop watched her too , more quietly , less obviously worried about her than he 'd been in the morning . Now and then he and Alice Gould exchanged a half-humorous , half-despairing glance , as if they 'd both given up completely . Nathan Kaufman sat on the side lines , as it were , giving in some way the impression that he was holding a rather vague watching brief tightly by the scruff of the neck .  | " Where 's Andy ? " I said cheerfully , before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me an amused little half-smile . " Sulking in his tent , " Jim said . George Barrol as usual created the necessary diversion . " What will you drink , Grace ? " he said hastily . I nodded at the mint julep he was holding up , and turned to Colonel Primrose . " I just met Elsie Carter in town , " I said , firmly ignoring the instant flag of warning that he ran up behind his eyes . " I gather she 's given you the lowdown on the whole local situation . " He managed a smile , but it was not greatly amused . " I found her very helpful , Mrs. Latham , " he said coolly . " I 'll bet you did , " Jim Gould remarked . " Did you hear the one about Parran ? He sent the bootlegger to the Cut for twenty years because he held a mortgage on the fellow 's farm , and then he foreclosed on it . " " Or the one about Dr. Potter throwing a party at the club and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit ? " George put in . Colonel Primrose shook his head . " No , " he said . " I did n't hear them . " He looked quietly at me for an instant , as if wondering for just a fraction of a moment about something . " No , " he repeated . " But I did hear the one about Miss Bishop and Sandra Gould meeting at the Goulds ' gate Saturday night . " There was a tense sharp instant when everybody  | on that porch might have been in a state of suspended animation . Except Colonel Primrose . He was looking at Rosemary with calm deliberation , his eyes narrowed ever so slightly , catching the almost imperceptible pallor that hardened her lips a moment before it relaxed again . " It seems rather a public place for a scene , " he said . " In fact , I 'm not sure I 'd have believed her if I had n't already found this there by the gate . " We sat there like eight graven images , watching him stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring out his leather folder . Nobody moved while he opened it with maddening slowness and took out a piece of crumpled white tissue paper . He opened that . We stared at the two little blue velvet petals lying there on the tissue in his hand . He looked around from face to face , his eyes sparkling and terribly piercing . " I lost the bunch of flowers , " Rosemary said coolly . " At the clubhouse , I think . " Colonel Primrose shook his head . " That wo n't do , Miss Bishop . I found that too , you see . This is another piece of it . " I tried not to look at Alice Gould and I knew Colonel Primrose knew it . " You see , " he went on slowly , " there ca n't be any doubt that Sandra Gould had a primitive streak in her . " Rosemary flushed , her gray eyes almost black , her breath coming a little quicker in spite of herself . The flush receded from her forehead and throat and concentrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suggesting , Colonel Primrose , " she said coolly , " that after she flew at me and ripped the flowers off my dress , I reverted to primitive type too ? " I looked at Jim Gould . He was shaking with anger , fists clenched , jaw clamped . " You shut up , Rosemary , " he said savagely . " Let me handle this . " Colonel Primrose looked mildly surprised . " But I understood you were n't anywhere around , Gould , " he said . " I understood you walked down to the lane from Mrs. Latham 's front porch . " " Then forget it , " Jim said curtly . " I met Miss Bishop at the gate just in time to keep my wife from making a bloody fool of herself . " " I see , " Colonel Primrose said . He looked questioningly and deliberately from one to the other of them . Nathan Kaufman jumped to his feet suddenly . " Now then , now then ! " he said . " That 'll be enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand down on the table . Jim took two steps across the porch . " Sit down ! " he said . He planted his hand on Kaufman 's chest and pushed him firmly into a low chair . " Do n't forget he 's trying to save your neck , Gould , " Paul Dikranov said quietly , under Nathan Kaufman 's irate splutterings . He blew a nonchalant column of gray smoke through his full lips . Jim looked down at the little lawyer for an instant , and turned to Dikranov . " Thanks ! " he said .  | " When I need somebody to save my neck I 'll call him in myself . And you 'd better begin looking out for your own neck a little . And while I 'm on your subject , you 're not marrying Rosemary , do you get that ' ? " Rosemary got quickly to her feet . " Jim  --  stop it ! " " I told you to shut up . And I 'm telling the whole bunch of you Rosemary 's going to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked anxiously at Colonel Primrose . He was n't paying the slightest attention to Jim . He was watching somebody else , intently , his bright old eyes steady and unwavering . I could n't make out just who it was . It was not Dikranov ; he was standing easily against the white column of the porch , a smile in his eyes . As Jim spoke he bowed . " I congratulate you , sir , " he said suavely . " As a matter of fact , I 'd thought of suggesting it myself . " I could not see George , but I heard his nervous laugh . Then Rodman Bishop got up abruptly . " Sit down , Jim , " he said gruffly . " You 're making it damned embarrassing for Rosemary . " " Quite the contrary , dad , " Rosemary said quickly . " That 's because you 're a shameless hussy , " Rodman Bishop said . The tone of his voice showed how much he meant it . A quick grin lighted his savage old face for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this is just about all Colonel Primrose needs ? " There was a sudden sound from Lucy Lee . It was half sobbing . " I wish Elsie Carter ? " Her mother leaned over towards her , but it was  | Colonel Primrose who interrupted actually and stopped her from going on . " I 'm very grateful to Mrs. Carter , really , " he said calmly . " She gave me several extremely useful bits of gossip , Mrs. Thorp . Three that I 'm especially grateful for . For instance : where was it that you said you were this morning , Mr. Barrol , between quarter to eleven and quarter past ? " George looked most startled . " I was ? " He remembered suddenly and blinked at Rodman Bishop . " Oh , " he said quickly . " I did n't get the time for a minute . I was down in the cellar bottling the blackberry wine . " I suppose if Rodman Bishop could have killed George just then without messing up the front porch , he 'd gladly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan Kaufman . " And you , Dikranov  --  where were you ? " " At eleven o'clock also ? " " Yes . " " I was in my room , packing my things , " Paul Dikranov said imperturbably . " I have got urgent business in New York . I am sorry I can not stay at this charming place longer . But business , you know . . . " George tittered . " Unfinished business , " he said aside to Alice Gould , sitting by him on the swinging couch . Rosemary and Jim looked at each other . Rose
