Long , skinny necks and scrawny chests have long been noted as physical characteristics of epileptics . Many epileptics also have small hearts and underdeveloped blood vessels . But until Drs . Temple Sedgwick Fay and Michael Scott of Philadelphia 's Temple University began to study these " grotesque deviations " no physician had ever thought of correlating epileptic convulsions with general physical development . Last week , at the Chicago meeting of the American Psychiatric Association , Drs . Fay and Scott reported a brilliant contribution to the baffling problem of epilepsy . <P> Several years ago , they had a hunch that the immature hearts and blood vessels of epileptics did not supply enough oxygen to their brains . Hence the convulsions . This theory fitted in with the general fact that many epileptics do not have any brain abnormalities which might be considered responsible for the seizures . To test their hunch , the doctors placed 14 epileptic children under the care of a coach , who helped them develop " athlete 's heart " through a strenuous program of rowing , running , basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on the traditional low-water diet , to dehydrate their brains and allow a greater volume of blood within their skulls . Within two months , all but one of the patients were completely free from attacks . <P> One child of nine , while engaged in his " daily task of rowing a large boat one quarter of a mile , " dislocated his right hip , was forced to remain in a cast for six weeks . His epileptic seizures returned . But deep breathing and arm exercises helped him while he was bedridden , and when he recovered , he went back to his training with no further attacks . <P> Another nine-year-old boy became " athletically inclined . " When he reached high school , he became captain of the football and basketball teams . After almost seven years without attacks , he was taken out on a high-school party to celebrate a successful football season , and broke his training by gorging himself on pop , ice cream , and hot dogs . Within five days , in spite of his well-developed physique , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended his attacks , and he has had none since .
