Two major pedestals for any general U. S. prosperity are a substantial income for U. S. farmers and a substantial tide of new housing construction . At present , as everybody knows , the pocketbooks of U. S. farmers are bulging after seven lean years , but a housing boom long anticipated has yet to materialize . There are obvious reasons why , as in three previous housing booms ( 1871-73 , 1905-06 , 1923-28 ) , residential building does not start until rents rise proportionately above construction costs . In previous housing cycles costs always rose earlier than rents but the boom waited until rents rose sharply enough to catch up or until costs fell back . Building costs in 1937 are high and the militant policy of Labor will tend to keep them up . Rents meanwhile are considerably lower .

But apartment rates stood at about 65% of 1926 , far lower than single-family homes at 97% . According to the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , rents in the two years ending last June were up 3.3% in Kansas City , 2.4% in Mobile , 8.7% in Seattle , 10.4% in Indianapolis , 2.5% in Philadelphia , 11.7% in Cleveland , 15.5% in Portland , Ore. , 6.9% in Atlanta , 9.6% in Chicago . Asked to compute the rise last week , renting agencies in most of these cities estimated higher figures . In New York , those who took leases six weeks or more ago , paid about 10% more than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found they could renew at last year 's price because of the deflationary sentiment brought on by the stock market 's tumble . <P> * Other " Moving Days " : Atlanta , Sept. 1 ; Seattle , Saturday before Labor Day ; St. Louis , no preferred day , but September is best month ; Philadelphia , last Monday in September .
