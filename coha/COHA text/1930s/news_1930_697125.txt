txt The immediate reason for the Soviet Government 's putting the brakes on the collectivization campaign , and incidentally on the anti-religious crusade , is peasant resistance . The Kremlin 's intervention against the " excessive zeal " of its young men came , according to our Moscow correspondent , in the nick of time . Other sources report peasant violence approaching the dimensions of partisan warfare and threatening to assume , with Spring , the character of a general uprising . Apprehensions concerning a planting boycott in the Spring have also figured . But there is no doubt that beyond such immediate pressure the soberer heads among the Soviet economists have found danger in the excessive development of collective farms . More land was being collectivized than could be operated efficiently . But still more important , not enough private farms would remain to pay the cost of operating the collectivized farms . How the Russian peasant is paying for the Soviet experiment is shown by BRUCE C. HOPPER in the course of a study of Soviet finance in Foreign Affairs . Russia 's economic life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost entirely agriculture , and the " socialized sector , " which means the industries , commerce and finance , where private enterprise is now a minute percentage . Budget data from the Commissariat of Finance for the year 1927-28 show that the private sector supplied 72 per cent of the revenue and received 5 per cent of the expenditure . The socialized sector provided 28 per cent of the revenue and received 95 per cent of the expenditure . For the year 1928-29 it is estimated that the private sector will contribute 62.4 per cent and receive 2.8 per cent  --  pensions and aid to migrating peasants  --  and the socialized sector will contribute 37.6 per cent of the income and receive 97.2 per cent of the expenditure . In concrete sums the socialized sector was to receive 4,200 million rubles more than it contributed , the private sector 4,100 million rubles less than it contributed . No secrecy attaches to this policy of making the peasant pay for the upbuilding of Soviet industry , or , as Mr. HOPPER calls it , the process of pumping capital from private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TROTSKY insisted must be speeded up and which STALIN has beet applying . The Soviet contention is that there is no injustice in making agriculture bear the temporary burden of building up industry . Ultimately the peasant will profit by more commodities at lower prices and by an Industrial outlet for the superfluous village population . Nevertheless , it is obvious that until success is clearly demonstrated a sufficiently large private sector must be left to supply the ' money for experiments . in the socialized sector . Nominally the Soviet industries show a profit , but that is simply because the Government 's monopoly enables it to add a margin of profit to whatever the cost of production may happen to . be . By non-Soviet tests and world prices the Soviet factories would be operating at a loss . The same possibilities exist for the new collectivized farms . Until they have shown they can produce grain at a real profit , it is elementary prudence to preserve enough indiVidual fanners to finance the new collectivized farms .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
