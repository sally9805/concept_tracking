A new spectacle which has lately drawn midwestern crowds is the roller-skating derby , a cross between a dance marathon and a six-day bike race . The troupe travels from city to city , then skates in an arena a distance equal to the intercity journey . The skaters compete in mixed pairs , get cups for speed and endurance . Last week one such roller-skating troupe set off from St. Louis in a chartered bus to put on their show in Cincinnati . <P> The bus was barging at 40 m.p.h. down a hill on the main highway through Salem . Ill. when a front tire blew out . Swerving onto the soft shoulder , the bus careened with tremendous force into the abutment of an overpass . With a reverberation heard for a mile , the gas tanks exploded , spread flames which were soon shooting 40 ft. high . The wreckage rolled over , lay on its side across the road . The engine , torn completely off , fell 200 ft. away . The driver and another man shot through the windshield , badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the windows . But 18 screaming , fighting men and women burned to death inside . <P> Next day two of those who got out died . One was Ted Mullen , the master of ceremonies . Just before he died he mumbled through blistered lips : " Do you think I 'll ever be able to skate ? " The doctor assured him that he would . " Funny . ' ' Ted Mullen whispered . " I never was able to before . "
