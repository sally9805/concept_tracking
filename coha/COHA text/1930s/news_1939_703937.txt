txt If dissenting Supreme Court Justices could not deliver their oral comments from the bench they probably would explode . That was the impression made very strongly last Monday as a series of sharp disagreements found verbal expression . Justices of the High Court are cut off from the normal methods of venting their indignation . They can not give interviews . They have to guard their utterances in private life . They may make comments to their wives but in some instances , like that of Mr. Justice , they are bachelors . The dissenting minority can always write formal opinions for scholars to read years afterward . But what fun is there in that ? The pleasure of dissent is to vent one 's feelings while somebody is listening Last Monday , being very human , the Justices took full advantage of this avenue of protest . It should be explained that these verbal utterances are not officially recorded , though a reporter may catch a phrase or two . Within this comparative freedom the Justices occasionally let themselves go . Mr. Justice Black delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw his heart into it . You could see it was doing him good . Mr. Justice Frankfurter described the Count 's utility rate-making formula based on Smyth vs . Ames ( as contrasted with the " prudent investment " theory which he favors ) as " legal mumbo-jumbo . " There was no such phrase in his formal opinion . Both he and Mr. Justice Reed , speaking for the majority , referred to the " classical doctrine " of Smyth vs . Ames but there was nothing about the classical doctrine in their formal opinion . Observers guessed that they were listening to the echo of a behind-the-scenes debate . Has His Say Last Monday , Mr. Justice in another case went further in extemporizing his opposition than any other Justice has gone in a long , long time . The Court had upheld the Labor Board ( whose batting average is now 14 cases won out of a total of 18 , with two cases divided and only two lost ) and thereby broadly extended federal regulation over interstate commerce . Mr. Justice charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious impairment of the very foundation of our federated system , " but in his oral remarks he went much further . He told the courtroom that under the new ruling Congress might have power to regulate marriage , because interstate commerce would be affected by the number of babies born ! Taking one thing with another , the Court is certainly a livelier place with its new membership . Its composition has been changing with the rapidity of the map of Europe . With the brief exception of a few days early in February when Mr. Justice Frankfurter joined just before Mr. Justice Brandeis retired , the Court has not had a full membership for over a year and for awhile only seven members regularly attended . Now it is back to full strength , with Mr. Justice Douglas looking very young and very self-conscious beside the patriarchal elders as he took the oath last Monday . The Court now presents a symmetrical pattern with two Roosevelt appointees on either wing ? Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Black on the left , and Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center  --  Messrs . Justices Stone , , Chief Justice Hughes , Mr. Justice Butler and Mr. Justice Roberts . Those of greatest seniority traditionally sit nearest to the Chief Justice . The average age of the four Roosevelt appointees is 50 ; that of the five veterans , 71 ; a gap of a whole generation . If the " Roosevelt Group " in any given case is able to attract one of the central five , it can write its own interpretation of constitutional law . Fortunately , Supreme Court Justices do not line up by such artificial classifications . Worth Cocking an Eye At This reconstituted Court is well worth studying . The Liberal side is definitely dominant . Only as recently as three years ago the so-called ConservativeA ruled . There were then Mr. Justice Van Devanter and Mr. Justice Sutherland , as well as Mr. Justice Butler and Mr. Justice , with the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Roberts holding the balance of power and casting it generally with the so-called Conservatives . One after another New Deal laws were overthrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court reorganization fight . What effect these had no one can ever say . But at any rate , the Hughes-Roberts move from the Conservative to the Liberal side constituted one of the landinarks in American judicial history . The succeeding 1936-37 term ended without a single adverse decision on any major New Deal case . This process of quietly re-directing the course of former decisions had its latest illustration last Monday . In 1936 the AAA and the program of planned agriculture were rejected , 6 to 3 , over a strong dissent by Mr. Justice Stone . On Monday , this decision was virtually reversed , in Mulford vs . Smith , which vastly extends the scope of federal regulation . This time Mr. Justice Stone found himself in the majority . He was joined by his former opponents , Chief Justice Hughes and Mr. Justice Roberts , and by three Roosevelt appointees . Only Messrs . Justices Butler and were left to uphold the old Conservative doctrine , and pointedly emphasized the change that had occurred . Richard L. Strout       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
