txt  | Neocotone Colors Ciba Co. last year put the first representative of a new series of dyestuffs on the market particularly suitable for printing on vegetable fibers under the denomination of Neocotone colors . These colors are water soluble and are fixed by a short steaming process followed by treatment in a dilute caustic soda bath . They may he employed in direct prints along with Vat colors . The first member of the series is Neocotone Scarlet G , which is suitable for application to all forms of cotton and rayon . The prints are of good fastness to light , washing . chlorine , perspiration and rubbing . I. Direct Prints on Rayon and Staple Fiber 80 gins .

Sulphuric , formic , or acetic acid may be used in place of hydrochloric acid , but experience has shown that the latter gives the brightest shades . An addition of 3 gms. soda ash per liter to the soaping liquor is advisable . Rayon should be treated with malt extract prior to soaping in order to ensure a soft handle . II .

Its different affinity , however , to ordinary cotton dyestuffs permits creation of many different effects . Generally , the same precautions in printing acetate should be followed as in dyeing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , partial local saponification with alkaline printing pastes offers better opportunities than in dyeing , especially when the patterns are not too large . Thus , for instance , the printing of vat colors in alkaline printing pastes is possible without affecting the luster of the acetate . Water-soluble colors for acetate are dissolved in water and printed directly with a thickener upon the acetate fabrics . Fixing of these may he facilitated by incorporating solution salt into the printing paste . In ageing acetate , dry steam should he applied in order to avoid delustering of the fabrics . For direct printing on acetate the dispersed dyestuffs can be used l ; esides the water-soluble dyestuffs for acetate , also vat colors , and basic colors with Celloxane or Tannin . The trouble commonly experienced with speckiness can he overcome by pasting the dry dyestuff powder with an equal amount of Dispersine T prior to adding the soap or gum solution . This renders the use of other lubricants or dispersing agents in the print paste unnecessary . Following we print the recipes for water-soluble and dispersed dyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I. A'ater-soluble dyes uh as Cellits and Cellit-Fast , etc. , Dyestuffs , etc. ) 15- 30 parts destuff are dissolved together with 30- 50 parts accto-acetic ester or Butanol in 225-220 parts hot water Stir the whole into 700-700 parts gum solution ( 1:1 ) 1000 parts ( by weight ) II .

" I. G. 958 . ) Geigy Co. recommends the following printing formula for its Setacyl Direct Colors : ? % Color Print , dry , age 6 minutes 6% Irgosol Wash 100-110 ? F. Rinse , dry 42% Water 50% Textile Gum The following dyestuffs are suitable : Setacyl Direct Yellow RN ; 3G ; 5G Setacyl Direct Scarlet 2GN ; RN Setacyl Direct Rubine B Setacyl Direct Violet R conc . ; B conc . Setacyl Direct Blue RS ; BS Setacyl Direct Printing Black As mentioned above , basic colors are either fixed by tannin or by celloxan . Tannin dulls the shade somewhat . but the prints possess good fastness to washing . Penetration of the dyestuff is aided and improved by incorporation of such agents which have a dissolving action upon the dyestuff and a swelling action upon the fiber . Such products are acetin , diacetone-alcohol , ethylen-glycol and other solvents . Vat colors are printed according to the potash-rongalite process . After printing , the goods are developed , e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaped at about 175 ? F. When printing with Indigosols ( or Algosols ) , the goods should be steamed for about 10 to 20 minutes after printing , in order to get good prints , which do not bleed in soaping . Developing should be carried out longer and at somewhat higher temperature , as is usually applied in case of cotton fabrics . Developing is done after drying for about 3-5 minutes at about 175 ? F. in a solution of sulphuric acid with some urea . Discharging of Acetate Dyeings For discharge work the water-soluble as well as the dispersed colors for acetate are suitable . The developed dyestuffs are also used for discharge printing , especially for navy and black grounds . White  | discharges upon navy and black have given great trouble and even today there are only a few firms really successful with them . Numerous dischargeable acetate colors are available , such as the Celliton Discharge line of General Dyestuff Corporation and corresponding lines of other manufacturers . But bright Blues and Greens are missing . The following general formula is recommended : 100-250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glyecine A 450-400 British Gum Thickening 1:1 5 Formaldehyde 40% 150 Titanium Dioxide 1:1 After printing , age for 5 minutes with not too moist steam and rinse thoroughly . Geigy Co. recommends the following colors as dischargeable to a satisfactory white : figure Sandoz Chemical Works has recently produced a special brand of hydrosulphite for discharge printing acetate dyes , known as Arostit ZET . The following dyes of their range are stated to give pure white discharges with this product : figure For colored-discharge effects on acetate fabrics , such basic dyestuffs are suitable which are not affected by the discharging agent ( hydrosulfites , etc . ) . Difficulty often arises in obtaining colored-discharge effects . While actually only a short steaming is sufficient to effect the discharge of the ground colors , it is usually necessary after printing on the discharge paste to steam for a comparatively long time , in order to fix the discharge colors . During this long steaming , there is a tendency for the discharging agent to diffuse beyond the pattern and so create a " halo . " According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this difficulty may be corrected as described in E. P. 369,572 : " In general the discharging agents used are either of an oxidizing or reduc-  | ing character . Therefore , after printing the discharge paste and steaming for a short period to allow its action to be completed , the fabric is then over-printed with a solution of a substance able to counteract the discharging agent . Thus , if the discharge paste contains a reducing agent , then the over-printing would be effected with an oxidizing substance and vice versa . This fabric may then be steamed for the further period suitable for fixing the colors , but no diffusion or formation of a halo then occurs . The following is an example of the method used when a reducing discharge agent is employed : " Cellulose acetate fabric is first dyed navy blue by means of **43;1392;TOOLONG which is applied in the usual manner to the fabric , and then diazotized and coupled with 2:3 oxynaphthoic acid . The fabric is then printed with the following discharge paste : figure " Afterwards it is steamed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a 1% solution of sodium perborate , again dried , and further steamed for 30 to 40 minutes , being then washed and dried . In this manner a clear orange pattern on a navy blue ground is obtained . " When an oxidizing discharge process is employed , the following is an example of the method used . Acetate rayon fabric is first dyed with 1% of Malachite Green , then dried , and printed with the following discharge paste : figure The fabric is then dried and aged for five to eight minutes in a continuous Mather &; Platt Ager , being then padded with a 2% solution of sodium bisulphite , dried , and further steamed for 45 minutes . " In the first example the sodium perborate counteracts the stannous chloride , and in the second the sodium bisulphite similarly counteracts the sodium chlorate and ferricyanide . " Printing of Mixed Fabrics Containing Acetate The selection of dyestuffs for mixed fabrics depends upon the component fibers of the cloth . Generally speaking , the same classes of dyestuffs are employed as for dyeing mixed fabrics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rayons ) can be printed with various effects . It may be that either one of the two fibers should be colored , or both fibers should be the same shade , or that the two fibers are supposed to he printed two different shades . In the latter case , the colors for the two fibers can be combined in the printing paste . It is necessary , however , to make a careful selection of colors which stain the other fiber the least , in order to achieve clear prints . For the same reason it is advisable to rinse , or  | better yet , soap the goods after steaming , in order to remove the excess dyestuffs , that is , dyestuff not fixed upon the fabric . Mixed fabrics composed of acetate and silk ( also with rayon as third component ) should be scoured in a soap solution with some ammonia before p inting . It is always important to select dyestuffs for each group which stain the other fibers the least . Fabrics containing acetate and wool should he bleached with hydrogen peroxide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accomplished with the chlorate discharge . Azo and anthraquinone dyestuffs can not be discharged by this method . Various effects can he accomplished in discharging mixed fabrics , if they have been dyed with dyestuff combinations of which some colors are dischargeable and some are not . A great number of variations are possible with such mixed fabrics of which we can only give a hint within the scope of this book . Printing with Resins ? Lacquer Printing Textile printing ? as compared to modern high-speed paper printing is a relatively slow process . It is only about 1 /10th as fast . Also textile printing has not achieved the degree of perfection of paper printing , observing advertisements and illustrations in today 's magazines . The elaborate shading , beautiful color effects and fidelity of reproduction show the tremendous advance of this art in recent years . The fundamental factors underlying rotogravure paper printing and textile printing are the same ? namely . a surface , an engraved cylinder and a printing or coloring medium . Papers can be coarse and porous or hard and glazed . Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like the latter . Cylinders for paper printing have a shallow engraving , while those for fabric generally are rather deep . The real difference , however , in the coloring is medium . In textile printing , this is the " printing paste . " ? Dyestuffs are thickened with water soluble gums or starches which form what is known as a pseudo-plastic medium , which requires a deep engraving . Hence they are not suitable for printing fine shadings . In paper printing , the coloring medium is the " printing ink " an organic solvent solution , of resinous materials in which pigments have been dispersed . These possess a physical state whose characteristics make possible the printing of fine engraving at high speeds .  | The idea of printing fabric with a medium possessing these desirable printing characteristics was that of the Research Laboratories of Interchemical Co. , for the applications of color to all types of surfaces is a basic interest with this company . The problem of applying color to a fabric so that it resists the abuse of repeated launderings was not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an accomplished fact today . This process is known by the name " Aridye . " A number of technical developments contributed to the successful achievement of this undertaking . ( ) ne of these is the amazing developments in the field of synthetic resins . During the past year , the vehicle division of the Interchemical Laboratories analyzed and classified over a hundred new synthetic resins . It is now possil , le to obtain resins which will so adhere to the cellulose fiber as to be virtually a part of that fiber . In fact , resins can be selected which are more resistant than the fibers themselves . Another important contribution was the development of permanent pigments . The color used in the fabrication of paper printing inks , although for the most part very light fast , do not possess resistance to alkali , soaping , perspiration , deodorants , etc . The development of extremely fast pigments for special finishes has proceeded steadily in recent years and those which stand the most severe tests are used in textile formulations . Many of the pigments used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been developed for special needs . The stimulus of this new application will result , no doubt , in many new fast and brilliant colors . Some of those recently developed have fastness greatly exceeding the well-known fast dyes . A third vital contribution is the science of dispersion . The involved physics of dispersing insoluble color into the resins so that each minute particle of color is surrounded by resin calls for most careful control . Each color is a problem in itself and must have its own set of physical and chemical conditions . A score of trained physicists are continually studying this problem of dispersion . The formulation called Aridye , in use today for the printing of fabric has the qualities of the finest paper printing inks , plus the extreme fastness required for the printing , of textiles . The nature of the medium is such that it wets metals readily ; hence the engraving is instantly furnished including the finest pins . Then , too , since it sets the fiber with equal ease , it transfers to the fabric  | at the instant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . These factors make for sound , even printing at high speeds , with the least wear and tear on the machine as well as reduced power consumption . Being a positive , visible print , defects can be seen readily by the printer , thus reducing the percentage of seconds . The colorist , of course , receives a very tangible benefit in that the finished shade is apparent in the brief interval it takes to dry a patch on the can . A good approximation of shade is obtained by a finger spot , and since it takes but a few minutes to pull a patch and dry it , necessary changes are quickly made . Thus a great amount of machine time can he saved a ( lay . This printing medium possesses an important quality which makes possible the production of a mark almost identical with the engraving . The color on contacting the fiber has little or no side-flush , consequently , a very sharp mark results . In printing from mill and dye engravings and from photographic engravings this is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aridye is very simple and positive ? namely , sufficient heat and time to remove the solvents thoroughly . If ultimate fastness to washing is desirable immediately , the fabric should be heated to 300 ? for two to three minutes . This fastness , however , is obtained in a relatively short time interval when heat processes incident to the normal finishing operations remove the solvent . Most plants use an enclosed tenter operating at 250-300 ? F. , which is sufficient to give the necessary curing . Since this brief after-treatment has no bearing upon the shade , the troubles which result from improper aging ' , soaping , etc. , in conventional dyestuffs are not present with Aridye . A good range of Aridye colors is available for printing shirts , shorts , etc. , but for printing of dress goods it is found economical to print deep wines , navy , and bright reds with salt colors . The brilliance of the Aridye yellows , greens and blues makes an excellent complement to the salt colors and a very considerable amount of color is being used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as on Naphthol prepare grounds . As the field of permanent pigments is broadened , the use of this formulation in dress goods printing will increase .  | Spray Printing This process is widely used in the application of coatings and **224354;1437; the angle of the beam of reflected light is 2 ( D. The distance between the mirror and screen is about five yards , producing an enlargement of about 1,600 times . This is sufficient for determining any objectionable deviation in size of yarns or filaments . Variations of thickness are recorded under equal tension of the yarn at all times as the yarn changes its diameter slightly under stress . A steady motion of the yarn , passing the feeler device is necessary . For achieving the equal tension , the following arrangement has been made . A synchronous motor is used which automatically gives the necessary constant speed per time unit . The 1725 RPM are cut down by a precision worm gear drive , to a speed of 1 RPM . To avoid transporting any vibrations which could still be left in the running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm and the positive drive . The yarn coming from this friction drive is wound upon a special spool , which is pressed by springs against the cork roller so that any yarn wound upon the spool will be rewound at the same speed with which it leaves the cork roller . Thus , the yarn is automatically rewound without slacking . A. photograph of the complete assembly is shown . This instrument is not only of importance for measuring variations in the diameter of the yarn but also for determining quickly and simply the denierage of various types of yarns . The instrument can be used with visual inspection , with . photographic or photo-electric recording . The latter makes it possible to completely eliminate the human element , as timing and observation are clone entirely automatic . The above Evenness Tester , therefore , makes possible objective and civantitative recording of yarn uniformly .  |p585  A new Photo-electric recording system has teen constructed by the writer . The beam of light , instead of falling upon a projection screen , falls upon a photo-electric cell . If the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplified in a vacuum tube amplifier and finally operates an electro-magnetic relay . Thus , if the beam of light falls upon the cell , the relay closes an electric contact of an electric stop watch . Accordingly , as long as the beam of light plays upon the cell , the clock runs and it stops when the cell is in darkness . In this manner the total time of exposure of the cell during a given time interval can be determined . Inasmuch as the cell is movable upon a calibrated standard , the time of cell exposure at different heights of the post can be read directly . These data give immediately the spread of distribution and the variation around the average mean in quantitative figures . Frequency diagrams obtained in this manner tell precisely whether the yarn diameters vary according to the theoretical probability curve , or whether deviations exist that arc indicative of an excessive number of thin spots within the yarn , knots or other factors that interfere with evenness . Instead of using the photo-electric recorder , a record can also be made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn of 100-denier , 40-filament , the denierage may vary , say , from 96.6 to 104.2 . If we have 104.2 denier yarn . it will give 42,840 yds. per pound , while 96.6 denier will give 46,200 yds. , a maximum variation of 3,360 yds. for every pound of yarn purchased . Presence of thick places decreases yardage per pound . It is , therefore , to the interest of the manufacturer to buy a rayon yarn that will not show an excessive percentage of such thick places . An evenness tester permits the evaluation of such yardage and shows directly to the consumer whether or not he has received his money 's worth in yardage . The textile manufacturer may get 100,000 yds. of cloth from one yarn , and 105,000 yds. of cloth from another yarn of more even characteristics . This difference of 5,000 yds. of cloth may make the difference between the red side and the black side of the ledger . By this one form of testing alone , a nationally known mill producing substantial amounts of rayon goods was able to increase its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150,000 yds. per week . A saving of 7,500 yds. per week was then made possible . This , on a full time yearly basis , is a saving of 390,000 yds . At 22T cents a yard , this totals $87,600 saving . Evenness testing may be used not only for the purpose of testisc
