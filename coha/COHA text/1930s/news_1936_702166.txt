txt Foreign exchange quotations yesterday Indicated the possibility that unless the French government succeeds in establishing confidence both in its political future and in its treatment of capital , the Blum government 's attempts to revive business may be hindered by the same refusal of French capital to go to work which characterized every effort toward business recovery in the . past . Repatriation of French funds from London was halted yesterday . In Its place appeared a small French demand for sterling . This was reflected locally in firmer sterling and a lower franc . In addition , uncertainty has brought a complete check upon the forward movement on the Paris Bourse . It had a heavy session again yesterday with the closing quotations showing wide declines . The Paris correspondent of The Wall Street Journal pointed out that French bank and industrial shares in many cases are now lower than prior to the French elections in the Spring , notwithstanding the devaluation which has come in the meantime . The situation has not been aided by the new tension in the international political arena which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , Italy and Portugal to the Spanish insurgents , and the counter charge that Soviet Russia has furnished arms and munitions to the Spanish government forces . Move May Be Purely Precautionary Foreign exchange circles in New York indicated that the reversal of the trend in movement of French capital could not yet be taken as permanent and for the moment must be regarded as a precautionary move because of possibility of unfavorable developments over the week end . If continued , however , the tendency may dampen efforts to revive trade which have followed currency realignment . Considerable uncertainty has been caused by new decrees of the French government in attempting to check speculative profits on the Paris l3ourse . These have been sufficiently vague as to leave the Bourse in doubt as to the actual intentions of the government , particularly because of the government 's insistence upon names and addresses of Bourse traders who might have been in a position to make devaluation profits through security operations . Unless uncertainty on the part of capital is overcome , prospects are not good for a loosening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also through the latter the ability of the government to balance its budget by means of increased revenues . The situation is further complicated by Thursday 's drive against the forces of Col. de la Rocque which threatens to bring out into the open again the struggle betwen the Right and Left forces in France . London and New " Cork Markets The new clouds which have appeared in the French position , however , have had relatively little direct effect on the New York and London security markets . Profit taking continues in London and prices are drifting slowly downward but yesterday there was no precipitate drop in quotations such as marked the session on the Paris Bourse . Financial Times industrial averages declined but 0.2 point to 139.0 and the rails 01 to 72.3 . In New York , the market persisted slowly upward in heavy trading . The Dow-Jones industrial averages pushed again into new high ground at 17519 , up 0.26 , while the rails were up 0.28 to 59 03 . Turnover was 2,240,000 shares compared with 2,230,000 on Thursday . Coincident with these market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries Czechoslovakia lost no time in announcing a fixed level for the currency at a devaluation of Italy announced the price of gold would be 21.381 lire per gram of fine gold , in line with the devaluation of the belga . Dutch government is con- templating introduction of export duties on Dutch Indian products , which would prevent possibility of flooding of foreign markets and reduction of certain import duties to prevent prices from rising . Sterling 's Advance Other factors are operating in the exchange market which vie with movement of French balances in long-range importance . Chief of these is the belie. / that the higher sterling , which yesterday closed at $4.90 9/16 for a net gain of ** cent , is partially caused by official buying et sterling . This lends support to the statement made recently in The Wall Street Journal that the American and British Controls have no fixed level in mind for sterling but are experimenting to find a level best adapted for the needs of the two countries . Some local opinion now believes that the pound will be pegged shortly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4 S6 and $5 . This buying of sterling is being met with heavy British business purchases of sterling . which is being done on an arbitrage basis . In other words , English business houses are selling sterling in the spot market and buying it back in the forward market to take advantage of the spread between the two rates . The consequent demand for forward sterling has narrowed the discount to i. cent for 90 days from 1 3-16 cent at the beginning of the month . Operations , obviously control , in Swiss francs had the market puzzled yesterday . Despite the halt in French repatriation , there is a heavy demand for spot Swiss and even the forward rates are quoted flat as compared with the spot . Nevertheless there has been heavy selling of Swiss francs in this market for delivery Monday , October 19 , at lust about 2 points under whatever the spot rate may be at the moment . The persistence with which October 19 Swiss francs are offered heavily has led some to believe that official operations are being conducted preparatory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made over that week end Others , however , b6lieve it is due to technical problems involved in maintaining stability in the market for Swiss francs without upsetting the Swiss money markets .
