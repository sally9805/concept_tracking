WILLIAM MORRIS AS I KNEW HIM- George Bernard Shaw-Dodd , Mead ( $1.50 ) . <P> One of the few great British writers whose reputation has not bloomed abroad as well as at home is William Morris , Pre-Raphaelite , craftsman , for whom the Morris chair was named , child prodigy ( he read the Waverly novels at the age of 4 ) , interior decorator , architect , wealthy Socialist , amazingly prolific poet and creator of stained glass windows . Morris was the leading figure among British Socialists when George Bernard Shaw , 22 years younger , first met him . Shaw , author of five unpublished novels , principally known as a speaker in seething , rapidly-shifting London radical circles , was editing a small magazine at that time . To fill its pages he reached into the treasury of his unpublished fiction , one sample of which so entertained Morris that he asked to meet the author . The result was a friendship that lasted as long as Morris lived . Last week Shaw offered U. S. readers his pleasant reminiscences of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreword to a monumental , expensive ( $20.75 ) biography of Morris written by his daughter . <P> The book is primarily of interest to Shaw 's admirers , since it takes for granted a great deal of information about Morris which few U. S. readers are likely to possess . Reveling in the factional fights , manifestoes , grandiose plans and pitiful performances that then distinguished English Socialism , Shaw was more at horns among them than Morris , who was a radical from a strong sense of moral duty and an even stronger revulsion from the ugliness of industrialism . Morris was a " very great literary artist " but his tremendous vocabulary was often no help in describing uncongenial modern things . Shaw would suggest the right word , whereupon Morris would gasp with relief . Morris was infuriated with hecklers at debates , while Shaw courted them , so that Shaw would be put forward to demolish foolish questioners while Morris would retreat to the background , pulling his mustache and growling , " Damfool ! Damfool ! " Such assistance made Shaw feel as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has bought a newspaper and found his pockets empty . " Spending much time in Morris ' home , where the only social drawbacks were Shaw 's vegetarianism and Mrs. Morris ' aloof silences , Shaw soon fell in love with Morris ' beautiful daughter , May . The equally beautiful , stately and cool Mrs. <P> Morris , whose portrait was painted by most of the Pre-Raphaelites , addressed one remark to Shaw . Annoyed by his vegetarianism , she once served him a rich pudding , told him triumphantly after he had eaten two helpings with relish : " It will do you good ; there 's suet in it . " Thereafter she never said a word to him .
