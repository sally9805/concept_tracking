( See front cover ) <P> One chilly morning last week President Roosevelt got off a special Atlantic Coast Line train at Jacksonville . Behind him was the work and worry of Washington ; ahead of him , fun with friends off Florida . For a stag party he had brought along only Gus Gennerich , his bodyguard , three secret service men and his Secretary Marvin Mclntyre . At the station were his son James and Jacksonville 's Mayor Alsop . Buttoning his overcoat against the breeze the President got into an automobile with Florida 's plump Governor Sholtz and drove five miles to the docks on the St. Johns River . There lay Vincent Astor 's white and orange Nourmahal . At the foot of the gangplank Owner Astor met him , grasped his hand and exclaimed : " It 's a great thing to have you aboard again , Mr. President . " <P> For the benefit of photographers the ceremony was repeated . Then the President went up the gangplank , putting Governor , Mayor , secretary , photographers , newsmen behind . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipper Captain Gustav Klang , the Nourmahal nosed carefully down the 18-mile reach of river toward the open sea . Behind her like a vigilant watchdog for the fortnight 's cruise glided the U. S. destroyer Ellis . <P> For Mr. Roosevelt that cruise among friends on a fine yacht was to be as thoroughgoing a vacation as any modern U. S. President has dared to take with Congress in session . Not one political adviser accompanied him . For company he had his fishing cronies , practically the same group who went with him on the same vessel into the Gulf Stream a month before his inaugural last year . Nearest among them to a politician was Manhattan 's Frederic Kernochan whom Mayor Walker continued in office as Special Sessions Justice . He has always frequented polite society as few Tammanyites are privileged to do . When in 1932 he sent a check for $50 to Tammany 's campaign chest , Tammany returned it to him as " too cheap . " Last year he ran for election to the Court of General Sessions on Mayor LaGuardia 's Fusion ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's fishing friends was a distant cousin . Kermit Roosevelt , son of T. R. , friend and partner of Vincent Astor in the shipping business . The rest were , with two exceptions , socialites : William Rhinelander Stewart , Mr. Astor 's best friend ; Lyle Hull who last spring was Mr. Stewart 's bicycling companion in Bermuda ; George St. George , young , round-faced , rosy-cheeked , English-bred member of Tuxedo 's horsy set . Mrs. George St. George was the onetime Katharine Price Collier , stepsister of the President 's cousin Warren Delano Robbins , U. S. Minister to Canada . The two exceptions to the socialite group were Dr. Leslie W. Heiter of Mobile , Ala. , friend of <P> Vincent Astor. present in a professional as well as a social capacity , and Captain Herman Gray , famed master of Gulf Stream fishing , who used to pilot President Hoover to good fishing grounds and who remarked : " Fish do n't bite any faster for a President than they do for a plumber .
