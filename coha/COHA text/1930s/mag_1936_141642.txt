" I was greatly surprised to hear a student spokesman say that the student regards it as his duty ... to inspect professors and instructors thoroughly and bring to an end certain of their activities . . . . <P> " The Fhrer has given the problem of the German professors into my hands and I have not the intention of placing it in the hands of any student . . . . The professor is not to be disturbed in his work by at present unnecessary slogans in publications and discussion . I will tend to that . . . . " <P> " Any student , " purred lanky , smiling Dean Virginia Crocheron Gildersleeve to some 1,000 girls at the opening assembly of Manhattan 's Barnard College last week , " who feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have some-will please do it off the Barnard campus . We would rather not ask anyone to leave the college , for it is much more amusing to keep you all here . "
