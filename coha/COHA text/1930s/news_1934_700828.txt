txt Mayor LaGuardia submitted his 1335 executive budget yesterday to the Board of Estimate , showing a total of $550,961,960.06 , a reduction of $85,822 under the 1934 budget total of $551,047,782.06 . In a caustic budget message to the board the Mayor criticized previous administrations for failing to provide budget funds for absolute necessities . He said this practice had produced budgets that were not budgets at all , and detailed the deficiencies which his administration had been forced to make up . Revenues expected next year , he said , would amount to $551,416 , - 853.92 , or more than enough to meet the city 's expenditures . Under the new budget-making procedure in force this year , the budget goes through four stages before emerging as the final budget . The Board of Estimate first receives the Mayor 's executive budget by Oct. 2 . Between Oct. 5 and Oct. 10 the board makes the tentative budget . Between Oct. 10 and 20 the document is known as the budget as proposed for adoption . It becomes the final budget between Oct. 20 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Board of Aldermen , who may reduce but not increase any items . $9,258,723 Saved in Jobs . The new budget eliminates 3,877 positions in various departments at a saving of $9,258,723.51 . Savings of $78,221 were made by reducing the compensation for eighty-two other positions now vacant . Another item of $549,491.30 was picked up by eliminating through retirement and otherwise 237 positions now filled . Unassigned balances in various departments were canceled , giving a saving of $116,225.93 . Reducing the rates paid for 1,366 positions on a per diem basis accounted for a saving of $690,337. and reductions in time allowances for other jobs brought in $356 , - 010.96 . Salary decreases in 4,477 positions accounted for $1,836,328 . In various instances compensation had to be increased and additional labor had to he employed , which reduced the net saving to a total of $8,046,770 . Immediately after submitting the budget , the Mayor called a special meeting of the Board of Estimate for Friday , whin further paring of the budget will be attempted in executive session . Before the end of the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give interested parties opportunity to suggest further cuts . Before receiving the budget the board convened as the upper branch of the Municipal Assembly and suspended Local Law 15 of 1933 , which directed the submission of a capital ; outlay budget covering large public improvements . The Mayor explained that a capital outlay budget this year was unnecessary , since all these projects were now embraced in the PWA program . $6,000,000 Notes Authorized . Still sitting as a branch of the Municipal Assembly , the board authorized Controller Joseph D. to issue $6,000,000 of certificates of indebtedness to meet relief needs for the next six weeks . The certificates are payable on March 25 , 1935 , and carry an interest rate of per cent . All revenues from the city 's tax on gross business , payable on March 15 , are segregated to meet these notes . The authorization followed a meeting between the Mayor , the Controller and the steering committee of the city 's banks , headed by Winthrop W. Aldrich , chairman of the Chase National Bank . In a twentyminute session the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The $6,000,000 is to be used solely for home and work relief . Through inadvertence the Board of Aldermen could not concur in the authorization because it was not convened as the lower branch of the Assembly . That ac- tion will be taken today . The city expects to receive the funds Friday or Saturday . Mayor LaGuardia in his budget message said he expected to reduce a $23,950,000 item covering tax delinquency reserves to not more than $11,000,000 . He said that would lighten the taxpayers ' burden by $12,950,000 next year . Asked if he had assurances from the bankers that the reduction would be made , he said : " I have reasonable grounds for believing that $11,000,000 is a sufficient reserve , and I shall so represent to the Legislature and ask for a modification of the legislation . I think that 's the way to do it . " The reserve item must be included under the city 's four-year agreement with its bankers . The Mayor said he felt the reduction might prudently and safely be made because of the marked improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ordinary high average of collections . Gives Revenue Figures . In his estimate of revenue for the coming year the Mayor said $270,000,000 would be placed upon real estate for other than debtservice purposes ; that $179,416 , - 853.92 was the debt-service total , and that the general fund revenues would amount to $102,000,000 . The latter figure was based on the assumption that the public utility tax would continue for another year . Controller , who recently estimated the total of general fund revenues at $91,000.000 , explained that his original estimate did not include the utility tax . He said the tax would account for the difference between the $91,000,000 and the $102,000,000 . Other members of the administration questioned his figures , pointing out that the utility tax was expected at best to yield about $7,500,000 . Should that figure stand , the general fund revenues would amount only to $98,500,000 , or $3,500,000 less than the estimated total . That amount of difference would suffice to throw the budget out of balance by $3,046,207 . The Mayor said the largest single item of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controller explained that this increase was traceable to the increase in the city 's short-term debt . By extinguishing this debt in the next budget he said the city would save money in the end . Longterm indebtedness , he explained , would continue through numerous budgets . Criticizes Artificial Cuts . Through various manipulations , the Mayor charged that the 1933 and 1934 budgets were " artificially reduced " by $65,839,794 . Even at that , he said the budget was $30 , - 000,000 out of balance when his administration took office . " In their desperate efforts to achieve a ' paper balance , ' " he said , " our predecessors forced the 1934 budget total down by ruthlessly slashing or eliminating entirely many ' other than personal serviced items , ' which every one knew had to be met in one way or another in 1934 . The Budget Director states that a conservative estimate of these amounts is $6,000,000 . " The Hospitals Department showed a deficiency of $1,300,000 in appropriations for food , fuel , medical and surgical supplies . Payments to charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workmen 's Compensation Act show a deficiency of $600,000 and water supply land taxes show a deficiency of $300,000 . Many smaller deficiencies totaling close to $3,000,000 are scattered through the departments . In all the budget director started on the 1935 budget handicapped to the extent of $11,000,000 in shortages which had to be absorbed before additional needs could be dealt with . " Indicative of these needs , the Mayor said , was the fact that the total of departmental requests had amounted to $587,707,625.29 , or $36 , - 659,843.23 above the total of the 1934 budget . He said the estimates had been reduced by $36,745,665.23 , with all previous omissions provided for . Declaring that $1,400,000 has been provided for replacement of equipment in various departments , the Mayor said : " The present equipment of the Sanitation Department is nothing short of disgraceful . We hope in the next few years to replace it completely . It will eventually restilt in a saving to the taxpayers . " The same is true of the Fire Department . Can there be anything more stupid , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment of this important department up to date , efficient and safe ? " Our hospital ambulances , I may say , are nothing short of disgraceful . The ambulances we are replacing in this budget are about fourteen years old . " Sees Many Services Neglected . Because the budget has been so closely held down , the Mayor said , it did not provide for many services which he believed should be given to the people of the city . He added that the budget continued some departments he would like to abolish , but which he had no power to touch . Further reduction of the budget will be attempted as it goes through its next three stages . But there was a general feeling in City Hall , started by the Mayor himself , that the budget was pretty well down to bedrock now , and that further cuts would almost certainly impair the services of the city . Angered by the criticisms of the budget by the Citizens Budget Commission and other groups , the Mayor said yesterday : " No organization , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Assessors or the budget director in this administration as they would like to do and as they have done in the past . " " Are n't those organizations interested in the same thing you want ? a lower tax rate ? " an interviewer asked . " But I have to run the city , " the Mayor replied . " They have only one or two buildings . " The Real Estate Board said last Monday that the reduction in assessed valuations of property for ' tax purposes next year was meager and unsatisfactory to property owners .
