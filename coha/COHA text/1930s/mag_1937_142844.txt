During the 52 years George Bannerman Dealey has worked for and run the Dallas News ( a.m. ) and Journal ( p.m .. ) , those newspapers have taken more than one unpopular but righteous stand . They were against the Ku Klux Klan during its heyday in Texas in the early 19205 . They bucked demagogic Governor " Jim " Ferguson . They refused to take oil promotion advertising during the Burkburnett , Ranger , Eastland and East Texas booms . Last week , seven days after the Legislature outlawed all forms of race-track betting in Texas , Publisher Dealey , now 77 , again placed his papers in the position of doing the virtuous thing at the risk of losing readers . Announced he : " The Dallas News and the Dallas Journal , believing that anti-racing legislation expresses the will of the people of the State , have discontinued publication of racing charts , selections and results of horse racing . Space heretofore devoted to turf activities will be used to present news of greater reader interest . The decision to discontinue horse-racing news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This declaration of policy also applies to dog racing . " <P> Other two Dallas dailies are the Times-Herald and Dispatch , both afternoon papers . The Times-Herald , whose 71,000 circulation runs 21,000 ahead of the Journal , lost no time proclaiming itself the only paper in town carrying complete turf news . The Dispatch ( 5,000 behind the Journal ) , which has been soft-pedaling racing news lately , did not change policy . Of the letters and telegrams received by the News and Journal , it was reported that 15-to-1 approved their position . In any event , Dallas merchants , who naturally are opposed to seeing potential customers spend their money with bookmakers or at the track , were happy as could be . <P> An amiable old paternalist who was immensely pleased when his editorial workers recently informed him that they wanted him and not the Newspaper Guild to be their sole bargaining agent , Publisher Dealey has his plant plastered with pictures of the Alamo 's Davy Crockett , with that hero 's motto : BE SURE YOU 'RE RIGHT . THEN GO AHEAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
