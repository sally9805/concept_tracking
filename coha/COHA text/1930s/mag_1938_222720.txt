Blonde , brassy the Hon. Unity Valkyrie Freeman-Mitford , ardent admirer of Fhrer Adolf Hitler , and 23-year-old daughter of England 's pro-German insurance tycoon Lord Redesdale , has a failing for flaunting her swastika pin where it causes trouble . Two months ago she boldly barged into a Hyde Park meeting for supporters of Leftist Spain wearing her badge , had to be rescued by London bobbies . Last week she incensed the Czechs by strolling the streets of Prague , swastika in her lapel . Display of the Nazi badge is forbidden . Anxious Prague police asked the British Legation to induce Unity to keep her badge out of sight " for her own safety . " <P> Next morning , motoring to Germany with William F. Rueff , U. S. art student resident in Munich , a young British journalist and a Sudeten German deputy in the Czech Parliament , Unity 's car was brought to a halt by military police in a military area . <P> " A policeman , rather insolent , opened my boxes and dropped things on the road . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hitler from my arm , broke the back of the picture , then took us to the police station where officials from Prague examined me and my belongings . I was furious when they seized Hitler 's portrait . Apparently they suspected me of propaganda work . A woman detective stripped me and even took off my stockings , " was the Hon. Unity 's story afterwards . <P> Czech police confiscated her three cameras , films , and a book of German poetry , and five hours later allowed the earful to continue on to Germany . <P> Long a friend of Adolf Hitler , troublesome Unity recently announced she would become a naturalized German citizen . She was hoarse-voiced cheering the Fhrer 's entry to Vienna . She and her blonde , pro-German elder sister , the former Mrs. Bryan W. Guinness , few months ago were toasted by Field Marshal Goring as " with Frau Goring the most perfect Aryan women I have ever seen . "
