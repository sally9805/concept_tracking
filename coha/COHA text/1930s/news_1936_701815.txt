txt The likelihood that Bruno Richard Hauptmann will finally go to the electric chair at 8 o'clock tonight , the hour now set for the execution , was greatly increased last midnight when the Mercer County grand jury adjourned after voting to discontinue its investigation and failing to return an indictment against Paul H. Wendel on a murder charge in the Lindbergh kidnapping case . Wendel is the disbarred Trenton lawyer who recently confessed and then repudiated his confession of the kidnapping of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. , for which Hauptmann was convicted by a jury in Flemington a year ago . Colonel Mark 0 . Kimberling , principal keeper in charge of the New Jersey State prison , where Hauptmann is confined in the death house , said that the execution would be carried out as scheduled tonight unless there was some unforeseen happening . New Reprieve Rumored In circles close to Governor Harold G. Hoffman , despite his refusal to make any comment , it was re . ported that there may be another reprieve . The Governor is said to feel that the Wendel case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand jury leaves the case in the same position it was in last Tuesday when the grand jury began its investigation , with Hauptmann scheduled to go to the chair before the end of the day . It was learned that aides of the Governor suggested to Colonel Kimberling that he should seek legal advice before making another move , and he announced that he would do this . The colonel understands that his discretionary power would permit him to postpone the execution until either midnight tomorrow or midnight Sunday , but he is not sure which , as he does not know which is legally the end of the week . When Attorney General David T. Wilentz was informed that Colonel Kimberling had announced he might consult him today as to the effect of the new situation on Hauptmann 's execution , he said : " Why does n't he ask the Governor ? " Pressed further , the Attorney General refused to comment on the law in the matter and promised to be at his office early in the morning . He then left for his home in Perth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that Wendel still is in jail charged with murder , and that it may be difficult for Colonel Kimberling to make up his mind to execute Hauptmann so long as that condition exists . They pointed out that the failure of the grand jury to vote a no-bill left the case in a complicated situation that might take time to clear up . When William S. Conklin , press secretary to Governor Hoffman , was informed of the grand jury 's action he said : " The action of the grand jury is purely negative and I will not bother the Governor for comment on it . " The announcement of Prosecutor Erwin E. Marshall of Mercer County on the decision of the grand jury was made after the body had been in session since 9 o'clock yesterday morning , with an hour 's recess during the evening . " The only thing to tell , " said Mr. Marshall , " is that the grand jury discontinued the Wendel investigation and will not convene again until Tuesday . " He was asked if the Wendel in- vestigation was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not tell , " he said . " They may of course take up anything they wish , but it Is a regularly scheduled meeting . " Asked if the inquiry had been dropped by assent or by vote , Mr. Marshall said : " By vote . " He declined to tell how the vote stood , but the best information available at the county court house was that it was 18 to 5 against an indictment of Wendel . Richard Stockton 3d , the Assistant Attorney General whom AttorneyGeneral Wilentz delegated to take care of the Wendel case before the grand jury , declared that in his opinion the discontinuance of the investigation served to dismiss the murder charge against Wendel . " The charge against Wendel is based on a commitment which in turn is founded on an alleged confession , " Mr. Stockton said . " The grand jury by voting a discontinuance and summonsing no further witnesses serves to dismiss that commitment . Of course Wendel will remain in jail on other embezzlement charges . " Prosecutor Marshall said that the discontinuance of the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for next Tuesday , indicated that the grand jury intended to drop the matter . " As it stands , " he said , " there is still a charge of murder against Wendel in addition to the other charges already filed . The grand jury 's action did not serve to dismiss the complaint of murder inasmuch as it did not vote a nobill . " John H. Kafes , attorney for ' Wendel , said that he would not go to court to seek the dismissal of the murder charge on - whichl Wendel is held in jail until he is officially informed that the grand jury has voted a no-bill . During its long session the grand jury questioned Wendel for four hours . He was taken to the grand jury room from a cell in the county jail , where he was locked up the ' first of the week . Attorney General Wilentz appeared before the grand jury for two hours and Governor Hoffman for an hour and a half . Both refused to discuss their testimony . Conferences held by Attorney General Wilentz , other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents during the day indicated that official action may be taken against the person or persons who persuaded Wendel to make his now repudiated confession in what the prosecution regards as a deliberate effort to obstruct justice and stop the Hauptmann execution . Federal agents are cooperating with the New Jersey authorities by making a search in New York and Brooklyn for the four men who Wendel declares kidnapped him in front of a Manhattan hotel , drove him in an automobile to Brooklyn , tortured him there until he agreed to make a " confession " and then brought him across the New Jersey line and turned him over to County Detective Ellis H : Parker of Burlington County , who has been active in Governor Hoffman 's investigation . The grand jury 's decision came within an hour after it had completed its long questioning of Wendel , in which he is understood to have again repudiated his " confession , " at a little after 11 o'clock tonight . Allyne M. Freeman , foreman of the grand jury , a Republican and . a friend of Governbr Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendel 's story after asking Prosecutor Marshall , a Democrat , to leave the jury room , hinted that the dropping of the investigation did not finally close the door to grand jury action , but did not explain his meaning . It was Mr. Freeman who at 8 o'clock Tuesday night telephoned to Colonel Kimberling at the State prison and made the request , which the colonel granted , that the execution of Hauptmann be postponed at least forty-eight hours I until the grand jury closed its investigation of the Wendel story . Hauptmann was asleep when the news of the grand jury 's action reached the prison . He was to be notified after he awakens this morning . Colonel Kimberling will visit him in the death house after breakfast and will tell him to prepare himself for the end . Before noon he will be moved back to Cell 8 , nearest the door of the execution chamber , from Cell 9 , which he has occupied since Feb. 16 , 1935 , except for about eight hours on Tuesday . According to prison regulations , IMrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed - to visit him on the day fixed for the execution . She paid her farewell visit to him yesterday afternoon . Attorney General Wilentz told reporters as he left the County Court House after appearing before the grand jury that even if Wendel 's " confession " were true it would not constitute grounds for a murder indictment by the Mercer County grand jury . He made plain his belief that the Wendel story afforded no warrant for postponing the execution . The Governor appeared before the grand jury In response to a request after he had refused to accept a subpoena issued at the request of Mr. Freeman . Telling the county detective who attempted to serve the subpoena to " take it right back , " the Governor said he would , be glad to accept an " invitation " to testify . This was then extended to him by Mr. Freeman over the I telephone and the Governor promptly went to the jury room . Mr. Wilentz 's appearance was made in response to an " invitation . " Other witnesses heard included Dr. Carroll T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Males ; Howard J. Miller , superintendent of industry in charge of the grounds at the institution , and Paul Nether and Ernest Burrell , watchmen there . It was at this institution , Wendel says and Dr. Jones admits , that he was held for a month in " voluntary captivity , " with a guard supplied by Detective Parker , who has played a leading part in the Governor 's investigation . Two New York handwriting experts who testified for the State at the Flemington trial that Hauptmann wrote all the fourteen ransom notes , including the one found in the nursery of the Lindbergh home the night of the kidnapping , testified before the grand jury last night . They were Albert D. Osborn and Eldridge Stein . While they were testifying , Captain R. A. Snook , in charge of the identification bureau , New Jersey State police , was in the jury room . He has charge of the fourteen ransom notes and other evidence in the Lindbergh case , and it was assumed that the handwriting experts were comparing Wendel 's handwriting with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Charles H. Mitchell , Mercer County physician , who performed the autopsy on the Lindbergh baby after the body was round four miles from its home and who testified for the prosecution at Flemington , has been summoned to appear before the grand jury with the records of the autopsy . Dr. Mitchell is Republican County Chairman in Mercer County . During the day Mr. Freeman made public a statement , which he also handed to each member of the grand jury on a mimeographed Sheet . In it he said : " As long as I remain foreman no vote will ever be taken in any case when there still remains testimony . " He denied that there was any political motive behind his activities1 in the case . " My sole interest in the case , " he insisted , " and the sole interest , of the grand jury is to get the truth . No other consideration has motivated or will motivate our actions in this case . Forty-eight hours dif- I ference in the time of Hauptmann 's death will make no difference if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Freeman said that he had notified Dr. Mitchell , as Republican county chairman , that he was not a candidate for the Assembly nomination in the forthcoming Republican primary . He said that he hoped this withdrawal from the race would convince the public that he was not playing politics with the case . Detective Parker and his secretary , Mrs. Anna Bading , spent yesterday at the court house , apparently waiting to be called by the grand jury . Attorney General Wilentz received a report from Edward C. Dougherty , District Supervisor of the Federal alcohol tax unit in Philadelphia , that Wendel had been connected with a malt concern near Scranton , Pa. , from early in March , 1932 , until November of that year . Mr. Wilentz said that this and other information shows that Wendel could not have been where he said he was at the times mentioned in his " confession . " Wendel 's confession said that he left the original ransom note in the Lindbergh nursery .               @ @ @ @ @ @
