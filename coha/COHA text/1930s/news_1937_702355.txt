txt Hoping to pacify Michael J. Boyle , czar of the Electrical Workers ' union , the city council finance committee will meet with him today in an effort to avert a repetition of the strike which plunged the city into darkness last Friday night . The aldermen , it is understood , will try to work out a plan to meet Boyle 's demand that the city restore thirtynine days ' pay deducted annually from his union men 's wages in an economy program . This amounts to $192,000 a year , but the aldermen say if , this is restored they feel they must as a matter of justice raise the $2,800,000 necessary to restore the pay cuts of all city employds . Plan for Raising Cash . Averse to increasing taxes , the finance committee members intend to tell Boyle they will ask state legislation to raise the cash with broader licensing of restaurants and warehouses , and perhaps a city tobacco tax . Gov . Horner , who was in Chicago last night , said : " I have n't been informed of details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Chicago is my home and I am always ready to give it any necessary power consistent with economy and good government . I take it the city officials know what is just and proper and if the city needs more licensing power , I am for it . If a cigaret tax is needed , ' I am for filet . " New Strike Speculative . In case today 's negotiations fail , it was a matter of speculation just when the city would be imperiled with another tieup like that of last Friday night . In that strike the electricians darkened the ? city street ' lights sand disrupted trafic , by raising 37 bridges for nearly three hours . In view of the summary action taken at that time by Boyle , who is business agent of Local No. 132 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , and Sam Guy , business agent of Local No. 9 , it was thought possible a strike might be called tonight . However , Ald. Jacob M. Arvey 24th , head of the finance committee , disclosed yesterday that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow night because al least  --  that much time would be needed to evolve a , plan .. He said city officials ' . understood the union leaders had agreed to this request . Boyle expressed a different opine ion , however . He said he did not understand any definite time had been set for the expiration of the truce . Boyle sent a letter to Arvey confirming arrangements for today 's negotiations in which he expressed regret that it was " necessary " for his men to walk out Friday . He said the union members were unanimous that such a demonstration " had to occur sooner or later if they expected to have their status changed and given the proper consideration . " City officials have made no statement about taking action against the strikers , but it was hinted that disciplinary measures  --  in the form of charges before the civil service commission  --  might be used as a lever in the bargaining with Boyle . More Trouble Looms . Officials of other unions said yesterday that more trouble with building trades workers looms for the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . Wage increases for union men in private industry are forecast , and city employees in the various unions will demand equal raises , the union officials said .
