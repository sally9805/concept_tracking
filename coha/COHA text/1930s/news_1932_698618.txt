txt Improvements of Boston Harbor ship channels and anchorage areas arc amply justified by port facilities , natural advantages and commercial importance of Boston as a port , Mr. Frank S. Davis , manager of the Maritime Association of the Boston ( ) flamer of Commerce , told members of the House Rivers and Har -- bors Committee today at the hearing on the bill calling for expenditures of $4,800,000 as recommended by the War Department . Large transatlantic liners terminating at New York are making Boston a port of call , in increasing mmbers , said Mr. Davis , and the present channel with a depth of 35 feet at mean low water is inadequate for some of these vessels . In 1930 , a total of 98 large New York liners called at Boston on eastbound trips to Europe and 62 on westward trips , continued Mr. Davis . They handled about 30,000 overseas passengers in and out of Boston , he said . The draft of some of these vessels exceeded 33 feet and at low tide the present channel depth is inadequate . The proposed 40-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston regardless of the tides . During the past year , executives of the North German Lloyd , the French Line and others have personally investigated the facilities of the Port of Boston with a , view to the expansion of their services , in order to shorten the time of overseas voyages of their ships by taking advantage of Boston 's shorter ocean distances , said Mr. Davis . " I am in a position to state , " said Mr. Davis , " as the result of personal contact , that the transfer of some of their big steamers to Boston has been seriously considered . There have even been statements from authentic sources that the Bremen and Europa might be sent to Boston . A depth of 40 feet for the inner harbor channel and to the piers is absolutely necessary for the safe handling of steamers of this size . " Mr. Davis told how the expenditures of the Federal Government on improvements of Boston Harbor from the establishment of the Government to the end of the fiscal year June 30 , 1930 , totaled $13,749 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these purposes from 1859 to 1930 , or nearly $10,000 , - 000 more than the Federal Government had spent in all time . Government appropriations for improvements of Boston Harbor have been profitable investments , said Mr. Davis . Duties collected on Imports at Boston by the Federal Government since 1842 total 81,582 , - 115,000 whereas the Government has spent only about 813,500,000 on Boston Harbor , he said . Vessel tonnage tax collections alone at Boston for 10 years ending in 1931 amount to $1,502.713.90 , or more than 10 per eent of the Government 's total expenditures on the port . Pleading for approval of the War Department 's recommendation , Mr. Davis said that there were three outstanding facts worthy of consideration by the committee . They are : That owing to natural advantages , We Government has been called upon to expend a relatively small mount on Boston Harbor , as coin- pared with expenditures at the othez north Atlantic ports ; that the money returned to the Government in the form of duties and tonnage tax collections is relatively greater from Boston than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance cost of Boston Harbor channels is much less than that of any of the other ports In the north Atlantic range .
