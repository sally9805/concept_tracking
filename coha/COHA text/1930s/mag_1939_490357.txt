IT is hard to say how much of the Bund 's fury against Dorothy Thompson was political and how much was the irritation of any group of solemn men confronted with a lady laughing in a superior and exasperating manner for reasons that are mysterious to them . Their feelings were probably not unlike the indignation and bewilderment of a Shriner who finds that his wife is amused by his singular hat , and to that extent the engagement at the Garden came down to a war of sex rather than ideology . Regardless of why Miss Thompson 's laughter annoyed the Nazis , however , there can be no question that it had a healthy effect , and we would like to hear more such public merriment around the town . Merriment may not he precisely the word  --  after the meeting Miss Thompson said that her performance was not entirely spontaneous ; the irony of Fascism invoking the Golden Rule seemed to her at least as sh ?

We thought that there were several other occasions for this kind of wry and incredulous laughter during the same week . The D.A.R . has reached a point where it seems to be going out too diligently for its comic effects , but nevertheless there was a neat if rather elementary irony in its decision to bar Miss Marian Anderson , a distinguished Negro singer , from Constitution Hall , which , of course , takes its name from a document guaranteeing Miss Anderson freedom from racial discrimination . There was humor , too , in Governor Moore 's appointment of Frank Hague , Jr. , as a judge in the Court of Errors and Appeals , thus making the son an instrument of the law in a state where the father , by his own appointment , is the law . " It will make his dad happy , " said Governor Moore . It makes us happy , too , in a peculiar sort of way . 1 , Ve were also pleased to learn that ex-District Attorney Dodge had loved Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is nice to think of the love , brooding and maternal though ungrammatical , which the public prosecutor bore for one of the merry boys in the back room . It is nice , too , to think of the four detectives who were so conscientious in guarding the public safety that they did n't hesitate to attack a small , elderly man who was lost in the subway . We even laughed a little at Mr. Lewis Mumford 's hook called " Men Must Act , " in which he argued that the first step to he taken in the preservation of democracy is logically the abolition of free speech , and , in much the same spirit , we laughed when we read that Great Britain and France were anxious to give official recognition to one military dictatorship in order to frustrate two other military dictatorships . All these things called for laughter , and from various portents we read in the sky many more will before the spring comes in . We live in merry times , Dorothy . Take care of your larynx .

The Scouts have greatly improved on the clumsy old method of rubbing sticks together  --  the new catalogue of equipment lists a Speed Firemaking Set , " all parts constructed so as to give every possible speed in action .

ALMOST every day , ploughing 1 1 through the morning paper , we find five or six featured stories that are based on nothing more important than the remarks of unemployed Republicans who claim that President Roosevelt is plotting a dictatorship . All these men say almost precisely the same things , and they all say them for at least a column . We are open-minded politically . We agree temperately with people who say that Mr. Roosevelt is a rather pushing sort of man , just as we agreed with the President when he said that Mr. Landon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read in our paper is based sheerly on boredom . The New York press in its interminable war on the administration has , we think , reached a level of dullness equalled by nothing since the Dionne Quintuplets , and we would n't be surprised if the proprietors were defeating their own ends . The editor of the Tribune , persistently dolling up the opinions of professional soreheads to look like news , is n't performing any special service to the Republican Party ; he is just alienating a lot of people like us who buy newspapers in the hope of finding out what 's going on . ACCORDING to the Department of Mental Hygiene , the ladies in New York State used to be a lot crazier than the men . In 1920 there were 1,750 more female lunatics than males , 21,265 to 19,515 . Their lead , however , dropped steadily after that until in 1927 it was only 264 , and in 1928 the men pushed ahead by the thin margin of 23 . Today they lead by a safe 2,625 and they 're expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to conclude from these statistics except that the change coincided roughly with the economic collapse , and it may he that ladies ca n't stand prosperous times , while men fold up in a depression . It 's not a very satisfactory theory and the whole thing is more or less academic anyway , because if the percentage of insane in the entire population keeps mounting at the rate it has maintained since 1920 , we 've figured out , everybody will be crazy by 16150 . Nature takes care of these little problems if you just give her time . Protector TiA7E 'VE heard from a young lady who came up from the South to make her fortune in New York and had a strange little adventure . The sub-ways naturally confused her , and she soon concluded that the only sensible plan would be to ask her way at every turn . One night last week , after dining at Kew Gardens with some new friends , she set out on the Queens line for home , which is in Central Park West . As the train approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man sitting next to her and asked if she should change there for an uptown train . " Better go on down to Forty-second and get an express if you 're going to Columbus Circle , " he said . " How did you know I wanted to go to Columbus Circle ? " she asked . " Because , " the fellow said patiently , " last week I told you how to get there from Sheridan Square , " Soop Up ! THE bad news among Scots is that - I-  the curling season has only a couple of weeks to go . After the middle of March they will have to put away their curling stones and brooms and get what consolation they can from golf until Thanksgiving . Nobody is sorrier when the ice breaks up than Mr. JamesWhyte , a hale old gentleman of seventy-six who is captain of the only curling team made up solely of New Yorkers . Properly speaking , he 's not captain of his team ; he 's the skip of his rink , which represents the Caledonian Curling Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East . The Caledonian Club holds weekly practice in season on three indoor rinks at the St. Andrew 's Golf Club , near Hastings-on-Hudson . There is as yet no indoor rink in the city , though there is serious talk of converting the old Court-Flouse Club on East Sixty-fifth Street to this use . We called on Mr. Whyte at the offices of Thomas Snell , Inc. , an interior-decorating firm of which he is president , and he told us something about the history of the game . The story of curling goes back three hundred years in Scotland and over a hundred here . Most of the Scottish immigrants who formed rinks over here were stonecutters . They could n't ply their trade in cold weather , for fear of cracking the stone , so they used to while away the time curling on the lakes in Central Park . Then , learning the American way , they took to heating their workshops and cutting stone all year round , and the game lapsed until it was taken up by the leisure classes , one of the pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls itself simply The Country Club . Most curling today is done indoors on artificial ice , and Mr. Whyte thinks that 's the way it will he front now on . We mentioned that the leader of a team is the skip . His teammates , three in number , are called lead , second , and third , according to the order in which they play . The skip directs the other three and plays last . The game is played on a double-ended rink with the goals , called tees , at which the players aim , a hundred and thirty-eight feet apart The tees are simply spots marked on the ice . Each man has two curling stones , circular slabs of polished rock which must weigh between thirty-six and forty-four pounds . The object of the game is to slide your stones as near as possible to the tees or to knock your opponents ' stones away . The score is figured according to the way the stones lie at the end of the game : one point for each stone that is nearer the tee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital part of curling . Each man has one . In the first place a broom is used to determine which side gets the advantage of playing last , the skips going hand-over-hand , the way boys do with a baseball bat . Also , the skip holds his broom on the : spot he wants his player to aim at . If the player casts his stone too lightly , the skip calls ' to the two unemployed teammates , " Soup , slaves ! Soop it M ! " Thereupon they sweep hard in the path of the slowly travelling stone , the skip meanwhile crying , " Soop up ! Dinna weary ! " This is supposed to give the stone greater distance . Another common command is " Stack brooms , " at which everybody stops and takes a drink . East Meets West ONE of those meaningless little inci- dents took place the other day at the Fifth Avenue branch of the Guaranty Trust Company when a Japanese gentleman tried to cash a check , " I 'm sorry , I ca n't cash this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you . " With Oriental cairn the Japanese took back his check , stepped close to the cage , and muttered , " I do n't know you , either . " He then bowed , presumably to his watching ancestors , and left . Finley 's Progress WAVING long heard con- . L flicting statistics on the prodigious walking activities of Dr. John H. Finley , editor-emeritus of the Times , we visited him the other morning to get an authoritative report on his career as a pedestrian , which we submit herewith . Dr. Finley , who still keeps his office at the Times , got his start on the Illinois prairies , where he was born seventy-five years ago . The first sizable walk he recalls took place on a hot June day when he was in his teens . He ploughed the fields till noon , then walked eight miles to town to take a solid-geumetry exam , and walked home . He got 82 in the exam , and later went to Knox College His longest stretch in a day was seventy-two miles , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this in 19 ( 19 , when , as president of City College , he was invited to the inauguration of a new president at Dartmouth . He started at midnight and made Dartmouth at 1 0:30 the next night . He was so dusty on arrival that one of the Dartmouth trustees whom he knew perfectly well cut him dead . It was shortly after Dr. Finley came to City College , in 1903 , that he started making his famous annual walks around Manhattan , a distance of thirty-two miles . He kept this up , sticking as close as is reasonably possible to the rivers , until a year or two ago . On the occasions of his annual walks he 'd set off at 3 P.M. and get home at midnight , tired but happy . Dr. Finley has a pedometer , and he once kept track of himself for seven years , during which period he covered 21 , COIi miles , or nearly the distance around the earth . He likes to think he actually did walk around the earth in those years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my imagination , " he told us . By this he means he walked a distance equivalent to the breadth of the country , pretending to himself he was following a definite transcontinental route . He has also taken imaginary walks all over France , Switzerland , and Greece while really going between here and Princeton . He gets out Baedekers before embarking on these excursions , and has gone so far as to conjure up French inns on the Albany Post Road . Since Dr. Finley really has walked a great deal abroad also , when he talks about his tours you ca n't always tell whether they 're actual or imaginary . He walked the length and breadth of Palestine , and thinks he 's the only man to do it . Bandits infested the country at the time , but they thought he was mad and therefore holy , and did n't molest him . That was during the war , when he was head of the Red Cross in Palestine . We noticed a short cane on Dr. Finley 's desk and he explained he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from swelling . After thirty or forty miles of walking , your hands begin to swell from hanging down . Finley shifts the stick from one hand to the other , holding it up like a baton . It was given him by some City College students and has the names of places he 's walked to cut on it  --  Rome , Jerusalem , Jericho , Beersheba , Albany , Paris , Tyre , Nazareth , and others . The best time Dr. Finley ever made was between Lausanne and Geneva one summer : forty miles in eight hours . " It was an ideal track , slightly undulating , " he says . He has a supply of bronze and silver medals which he gives to anyone turning in a report that he has walked one thousand miles in a year , including one twenty six-mile day . He 's given away over a thousand of these , taking applicants ' reports on faith . The report must include a description of the places visited , and the hest-written accounts get the silver medals . Dr. Finley showed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biancamano , to the effect that he had walked a hundred miles on the deck of this ship during a 1926 crossing . The other witnesses to this document were Mary Pick-ford , Douglas Fairbanks , Mrs. Oliver Harriman , and Sam Lewisohn , who had watched Dr. Finley from their steamer chairs . Dr. Finley thinks he may have walked a hundred thousand miles during his life but doubts whether this is a record . Some mature floorwalker may have done better , he feels . Mystery PAUL VINCENT CARROLL 'S new play , " The White Steed , " has drawn many people to the Broadhurst Theatre , among them a woman who asked her companion , after the final curtain , why he supposed the play had been put on . He said what did she mean , why had it been put on . " Just why was it put on ? " she said impatiently . " It 's not against Communism , and it 's not against Fascism , so why did they put it on ? " Prints WHEN George Weinberg , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a criminal lawyer named George E. Mtdry complained to Governor Lehman that there must have been something fishy about Weinberg 's death because no fingerprints had been found on the gun that killed him , Dewey came back with the statement , amazing to us , that no fingerprints had been found on a gun used in a killing around here for the past twenty years . We find , after leisurely investigation , that there are a few exceptions . There have been five cases of legible fingerprints being found on weapons in that time . In four instances they were unnecessary in getting convictions . In the fifth , which happened during the Dewey regime , they constituted the prosecution 's whole case but were secured as the result of a fluke . In September , 19.37 , three bandits held up a gold-refining shop on Fulton Street and shot down Patrolman John Wilson in the course of their getaway . The policeman was still firing his revolver as he fell , and one of the bandits leaned over to take it from him , spilling a pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax solidified and preserved his prints on the revolver butt . The police identified the criminal , Salvatore Gati , entirely by his prints in their files , which tallied in nineteen characteristics with the ones found on the gun . Six definite characteristics ( such as loops , whorls , and the like ) are all that Bertillon folk consider necessary for definite identification , so you can see how good the prints were . Gati has the distinction of being the first of Samuel Leibowitz 's clients to go to the chair . A fingerprint expert showed us how unlikely it is that a man picking up a gun and firing it would leave prints . In holding a gun , only the second and third fingers rest firmly on the butt , which is usually corrugated ; the little finger and thumb hardly touch , the forefinger only where the first joint meets the trigger  --  and there 's Weinberg , dead as mutton , leaving no fingerprints . Fingerprints on cartridges hardly ever survive the explosion of the shell . The police faithfully examine every weapon picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're never optimistic . Ballistics , the science of identifying the gun that has discharged a certain bullet , is quite another story and one which we do not intend to go into right now . Ballistics is about the only branch of microscopy in which the cops have much faith , the general belief being that a good stool-pigeon is worth ten microscopes . Not to mention a length of rubber hose . The cops did not much like the news about the scarcity of fingerprints getting out as a result of the Weinberg case , feeling that it may encourage crooks to carry weapons . One official did admit , however , that the Department is lucky to get eight hundred good prints a year out of the several thousand cases in which they look for them . Fingerprints used to turn up by the thousands . The New York experts wo n't be quoted as to how they go about getting prints , but you can find the dope in any standard book on the subject . It 's not impossible to take prints from the surfaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butts through the use of iodine fumes , silver nitrate , or ultra-violet rays . Zigeuner MHE elegant Mr. Harry Bull has ac -- 1. quired a Hungarian couple , butler and cook . He gave a party several weeks ago and , for the entertainment , engaged a Hawaiian orchestra . When the musicians arrived , the butler admitted them and announced to Mr. Bull , " The gipsies are here , sir . " Low Comedian THAT chimpanzee who recently ran amok in a Fifth Avenue pet shop was undoubtedly considered by many people as a vindication of Lew Lehr , who has long held that monkeys is the cwaziest people . Mr. Lehr is in great demand these days as an entertainer at dinners and other functions and appears on a weekly radio program , but his leading medium is , of course , the newsreels , in which he has put on a one-man display of lunacy for seven years . We sought out Mr. Lehr the other night at the Fox Movietone Studios , having learned on a previous visit to the place that this was his headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his biweekly Newsettes , which probably cause more belly laughs than anything . else on the screen except Mussolini . Mr. Lehr was deserting monkeys briefly for Tony Galento , who had been photographed in Miami training on beer . Lehr was arguing about the sound track with an engineer . " You 've spotted the hiccup four feet too soon , " said the engineer . Lehr disagreed . Then he stepped up to a mike while the film was being run off on a little screen and read from his script , which said in part , " He is der only fighter what gets in shape on beer . ( Grunt . ) Her udders do n't want to get in dot shape ! " The hiccup , when he came to it , was spotted perfectly . That kind of talk is a combination of Lehr and Pennsylvania Dutch . He uses ten other dialects in his repertoire , including Cockney English , Mayfair English , and Retired Colonel English , but Pennsylvania Dutch is the one that really gets his audience of 57,000,000 . The figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12,000,000 radio fans . His listeners ' favorites are such familiar Lehr phrases as " Look who 's shpoking ! " and " Sometimes your eyes ca n't believe your pupils ! " " Dribble-puss " is another . He thought that up originally for walruses and it found so much favor that lie has since applied it to many other things , including babies . When he says " It 's glitzery . Look nut you do n't schlitz ! " to some skidding polar bear , anyone who does n't laugh is an old dribble-puss . Some of his more ardent devotees are moved to hysteria by the mere sight of his face . " I have carefully built myself up into the character of a complete imbecile , " he told us cheerfully . Imbecility is only a side line , if a spectacular one , for Lew . Voicing shorts does n't keep him half so busy as editing short subjects for Fox Movietonetravelogues , science and fashion shots , and the like . He 's had that job since 1932 , in which year he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come in from Berlin dealing with the training of streetcar conductors there . To Lehr , it seemed dull and he livened it up with a little Pennsylvania Dutch chatter . It went over big and he has been doing a hundred and four descriptions a year since , mostly of monkeys . Lew is forty-four and was born in Philadelphia . As a boy he showed some promise for comedy and cartooning , and at seventeen he went into vaudeville , playing , prophetically , the rile of Simple Simon in a " Mother Goose " skit . He stayed in vaudeville for almost twenty years , for a while teaming with his wife in an act called " Lew Lehr and Nancy Belle . " They now live with a sixteenyear-old daughter in Rego Park , near Forest Hills . During his acting career he sang , danced , and drew occasional cartoons , but he never said a word in dialogue except when telling stories offstage . His commentaries require a good deal of careful preparation , he told us ; each remark has to he timed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when low comedy falls flat , it stinks , " he said . We think that someday he ought to have himself filmed repeating an act he did at Philadelphia church socials before he was fifteen . He used to hang upside down on a trapeze , sing a comic ballad , and simultaneously draw a cartoon on is blackboard . It would probably lay them in the aisles in a theatre filled with monkeys . Train of Thought SCHOOLS may be getting more progressive , but the children continue to go their own way . There is , for instance , the little girl whose kindergarten class was told last week about milk  --  how it came from nice calm cows , how it was bottled and delivered fresh every morning , to make little boys and girls big and strong . " And now , " the teacher said at the end of her talk , " do any of you want to ask a question ? " " Yes , " the little girl said . " Where does the morning paper come from ? "
