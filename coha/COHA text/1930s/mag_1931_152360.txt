" OIL OIL OIL " was the title of a full-page advertisement in many newspapers last week . It was paid for and written by Henry Latham Doherty , master of Cities Service Corp . Oilman Doherty was loudly crying an old cry of his : the need of Federal control of oil production . Said he : " I have no fight with our Federal officials . . . for I doubt if they would have gotten any place in a fight with a great line of Oil Barons , but the situation has now gotten so bad that many of these Oil Barons are themselves frightened , and , I believe , now is the time to strike . " Immediate reason for the Doherty blast was a conference of independent oilmen , called by the Governors of eleven oil States . But at this meeting , in Washington , Government-control was not an issue . Loudest and longest were speeches urging an oil tariff . <P> Kettleman . Oilman Doherty believes in the unit form of operating an oilpool . Part of his last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oilfield is no more competition than is a run on a bank . . . . In fact , the operators are trying to get not only their own oil but everybody else 's .

Growing out of a flush pool ( newly opened ) in California , Richfield spread service stations far and wide , was a leader in the mad race for gallonage . No territory was considered too competitive for invasion , and early in 1929 Richfield entered New York-New England . Although smaller producers were bought , Richfield could not keep up with its sales and had to buy petroleum on contract from other companies .
