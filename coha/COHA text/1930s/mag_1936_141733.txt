Bermuda <P> In Bermuda the population consists of 18,000 Negroes and 12,000 whites , but suffrage is dependent on sex and property held . Because of this the voters of Bermuda number 1,387 whites , 963 Negroes ( all males ) . Thus the white majority in any election is safe , but the basis on which this is accomplished may not last forever . The House of Assembly of Bermuda last week put through a budget providing ample funds for the Government to propagandize Bermuda in favor of birth control , supply the necessary apparatus cheap to poor Negroes ; further , to launch a determined fight on venereal disease by setting up free clinics . Only 20 of the 360 Bermuda Islands are inhabited . On a total area of 12,360 acres of which only 1,400 are under cultivation , live whites and blacks in a density of 1,520 persons per square mile , ideal objects for the application of birth control .
