If a new process devised by John Woods Beckman , Oakland , Calif. , industrial chemist , proves commercially practicable , people will have tiny " bugs " to thank for their soap , salad oil , synthetic hot dogs , * margarin , shortening and such commercial products as Mazola , Wesson Oil , Snowdrift , Crisco , Nuco Butter . <P> Vegetable oils occurring in cottonseed , linseed , copra , peanuts , are held in microscopic cells . About these cells there is a hard crust , largely cellulose , which must be cracked to release the oil . Of the three commercial methods , which produce some seven million tons of oil per year , the most used is the pressure method . <P> The seeds or nuts are shredded to a meal , crushed with giant hydraulic presses which exert 300 atmospheres . The cell walls are ruptured , out trickles the oil . But this is expensive . <P> Researcher Beckman studied the cells , concluded that there must be some bacteria which would eat the cellulose walls , release the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delbrueckia , which was apparently hungry enough to accomplish this for him . <P> Into a vacuum vat he introduced his bacteria , shredded copra , powdered limestone , water . After keeping the temperature at 50 C. for six days he uncapped the vat , found oil floating on the top of the mixture . <P> Advantages pointed out for the new method , over the pressure method devised by the ancient Chinese : no great expense for initial plant installation , no expert labor required , low maintenance cost . The resulting oil is purer than that recovered by other methods , and the residue in the vats makes an almost predigested cattle food , superior to the " cake " derived by other methods . <P> * Dr. David Wesson of the Wesson Oil &; Snowdrift Co. , inventor of Wesson ( cottonseed ) Oil , is working on a hot dog which will be made from the " cake ' ' residue left after the oil has been pressed from cottonseed ( TIME , March 3 ) .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
