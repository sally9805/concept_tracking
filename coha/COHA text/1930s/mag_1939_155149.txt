Radio News , neither pulp , puff-sheet nor good red herring , is one of the Ziff-Davis group of magazines for mail-order scientists ( Popular Aviation , Popular Photography , etc . ) . Managing Editor of Radio News is Karl Kopetzky , who prides himself on having learned journalism from Walter Winchell . During the early war days , Editor Kopetzky listened to Murrow in London , Grandin in Paris , Jordan in Berlin , etc. , was struck with the costly time devoted by U. S. broadcasters to innocent prattle about London weather , etc . With the unfailing suspicion of a Winchell-bred newshawk , he dispatched an undercover man to get the inside story . <P> The November issue of Radio News tells more than all . According to Editor Kopetzky 's undercover man , Anonymous , much of the circumspect chatter from abroad has a double , secret , coded meaning , decipherable only by experts in the broadcasters ' listening posts . <P> Thus , writes Anonymous , the statement that the moon in Paris " sheds its glorious light here as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planned for the morrow . " Other Anonymous decodings : <P> " Postal cards and letters from the children indicate that they are not only enjoying their country stay , but are healthy and well " ( The latest air raid of the British was eminently successful , and all returned without the loss of a plane ) . <P> " Many of the actors are using their old costumes , such as we saw before the World War " ( Colonial troops are being placed in the lines ) . <P> " In Berlin tonight , nothing has disturbed the placid beer halls " ( Enemy air raiders have been over the city ) . <P> More piqued than panicked by Radio News 's doubletalk , U. S. broadcasters last week agreed that the less said about it the better . For the record , CBS 's busy News Chief Paul White commented : " So preposterous that it scarcely merits the dignity of an objection . "
