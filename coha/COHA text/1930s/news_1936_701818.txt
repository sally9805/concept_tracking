txt Dave Purser , 55 year old lumberjack , crossed the windswept Columbia river on a log today to make good a boast which had drawn jibes from his friends . Dave and his partner , Matt O'Connor , 60 , stepped on a timber 71 feet long and 14 inches in diameter and propelled it with pike poles across nearly a half mile of water while spectators cheered . It never had been done before , - woodsmen said . At the finish Dave waved to the crowd and jumped off the log , intending to alight on a raft . He missed and fell into the river .

This here 's the  --  start . "                  @ @ @
