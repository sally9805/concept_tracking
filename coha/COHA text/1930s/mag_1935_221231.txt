Dead Hog &; Roast Pork <P> Sirs : <P> . . . I am particularly annoyed by the manner you burlesque or satirize Roosevelt 's speech TIME , Oct. 7 , apparently with the purpose of trying to make him appear slightly ridiculous . . . . You can make a person stand in a favorable light or unfavorable yet remain strictly within the truth . <P> I may say " I ate dead hog for dinner , " or I can say " I ate roast pork . " In both cases I would be correct . The President could get " scattered cheers , " or he could get applause . Both are correct . But " scattered cheers " shows your bias in the matter . In another place , you use the words " My frien-n-nds , " as though to deride the President 's speech , when " My friends , " would do just as well , and carry no sense of a jeer . You will say no such effect is intended , but I am the judge of the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may as well understand that I am for Roosevelt , and I stick all the tighter to him when I discover that the Press is coloring the news against him , apparently for their own purposes . . . . <P> SYLVANUS K. POST <P> West Palm Beach , Fla . <P> . . . <P> Sirs : <P> On p. 14 of your Sept. 30 issue , you have the expression , " his attitude toward that piece of paper . " Your article shows you are speaking of the Constitution of the U. S. <P> There have appeared in some recent issues of your publication things that make us suspect you of leaning toward the Communist 's side in government . . . . I believe you pretend to independence and declare yourself on no side . But every once in a while there breaks out in some of your articles things that show rather too clearly that , either in heart or through control , you lean toward the New Deal side . . . . <P> We do not flatter ourselves that what we write you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. D. COOPER <P> The Wadsworth News <P> Wadsworth , Ohio <P> . . . <P> Sirs : <P> Anyone acquainted with the history of the Tom Mooney case , will recognize your article in the Sept. 30 issue as grossly unfair and biased . Every sentence in it was adroitly written to convey an impression erroneous to the truth . . . . If this continues I shall certainly not renew my subscription to TIME , as I am interested in the facts , and not a flippant sophomorish interpretation of them for the benefit of prejudiced readers . <P> Back to the Tom Mooney article : <P> 1 ) . . . were convicted of bombing the local Preparedness Day parade in 1916 with a loss of ten lives . <P> Prejudicial inference : A true statement , but worded to convey prejudice against Mooney , playing upon the sentiment of Preparedness Day and loss of lives . <P> 2 ) . . . so often has the militant U. S. Labor movement thrust his case into court . <P> The thrusting of his case into court was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of labor itself . <P> 3 ) . . . today Tom Mooney has come to think of himself as an important public personage in his own right . <P> Tom Mooney is an important personage in his own right , since he has become the symbol of notorious injustice . . . . <P> 4 ) . . . as always , cocked and primed to talk about his " martyrdom . "
