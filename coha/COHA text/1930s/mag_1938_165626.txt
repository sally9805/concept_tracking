The U. S. Government has no broadcasting station of its own . When U. S. officials want to broadcast their departmental achievements , they have to go to the Washington studios of the major networks . If the Government should announce that it was about to set up its own radio station , political razors might begin flying through the air . But last week , when the Government opened its first broadcasting studio in Washington , all was quiet along the Potomac . For the studio is not a station . Its programs must be wired to Washington 's commercial stations , broadcast through regular commercial channels . <P> Housed in the new Interior Building 's seventh-floor penthouse , the studio is planned for the launching of new ideas in Government broadcasting . The idea man is Shannon Allen , acting radio section director of the Interior Department 's Division of Information . A onetime NBC production man , he has the job of coordinating broadcasting activities of all Interior Department bureaus , furnishing radioactive bureau heads with the professional touch . For the dry statistical reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute dramatic treatment , has issued script samples to educate officials . Sample sample for a disquisition on reclamation , modern style : <P> Westerner : Shades of Buffalo Bill , mister ! You should 've seen these deserts four years ago . White and dry like a steer 's skeleton . <P> Visitor : And now ? <P> Westerner : Use your eyes , mister . Look around you . These blighted miles of hot sand have been made fit places to live in . Think of it ! One day worth nothin ' ' cept to go crazy thirstin ' and watchin ' vinegarroons crawlin ' by the cacti , and today worth one billion dollars in taxable property ! That 's progress for ye , mister , that 's progress !
