At 10 a.m. , Oct. 7 , 1929 , the Miami-Biltmore Hotel in Miami was sold at auction . One Alfred J. Richey , Manhattan real estate dealer , wished to attend the sale . He contracted to pay $650 for airplane transport from Roosevelt Field , L.I . to Miami . The plane landed at Jacksonville and Alfred J. Richey reached Miami by train five hours late . He thereupon stopped payment on a $500 check which he had given Roosevelt Flying Corp . <P> Roosevelt Field , Inc. sued him . He filed a countersuit for the $900,000 which he claimed to have lost by not reaching the sale promptly . In his suit , he charged that the plane had been forced down at Jacksonville owing to a defective compass , an inexperienced pilot , and that , even without these handicaps , it would have been incapable of flying to Miami in 14 hours . Roosevelt Field , Inc. last week asked the court for permission to change the name of the defendant in Passenger Richey 's suit to Roosevelt Flying Corp . which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been released from all liability in connection with the trip ; and that " aviation , being in its infancy , is subject to various delays , including adverse weather , and subject to many acts of God which can not be controlled . " The court reserved decision .
