Every morning when the late great Marshal Ferdinand Foch reached his fusty little office in the top of the Invalides , he would lean his umbrella in the corner , adjust his spectacles , tap the barometer on his office wall , then call as he sat down at his desk " Et maintenant , ou est mon Weygand ? " Loyal , capable General Max Weygand , member of the superior War Council , was always there . Despite the fact that he had been Chief Assistant , almost a second son to Marshal Foch since the outbreak of the war , General Weygand never dreamed of sitting down in the marshal 's presence , never called him by his first name . Marshal Foch was appreciative : <P> " When I am no longer here , " said he on his deathbed , " If a military peril menaces France , call on Weygand and you can be tranquil . " <P> Without waiting for emergency , President Doumergue called on Weygand last week , appointed him Chief of the French Army General Staff , actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict disciplinarian , frank militarist , was popular with all but Liberals and Socialists . Wrote the Socialist Le Peuple : <P> " His appointment is a provocation to the working class of the Republic . He is the standard bearer of all the hopes of the reactionaries and the clericals . Put in power by the Right , by the Fascisti and by the Jesuits* he will as Chief of Staff do the work of the Right . " <P> Even the Socialists had no criticism of General Weygand 's ability . Irked at sneering suggestions that he was a mere " Yes Man " to the Marshal , in 1920 he begged and obtained a chance to go to Poland , direct Poland 's defense against Soviet invasion . On his arrival Russian troops were only 12 mi. from Warsaw . Five months later the last defeated Soviet troops were in full retreat . In Paris , proud as a father , Marshal Foch gleefully applauded his success . <P> *Marshal Foch 's brother , Father Germain Foch , is a Jesuit priest , the Marshal himself was Jesuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
