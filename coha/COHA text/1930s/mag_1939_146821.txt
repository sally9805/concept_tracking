Prevention , not cure , is still the watchword of most cancer researchers . No cure has been found , but practically all types of cancer , if detected in time , can be checked . Proud of its prevention progress was the Third International Cancer Congress , which met last week in Atlantic City , discussed a number of remarkable suggestions for nipping young cancer growths in the bud . <P> Bow Ties . One cold winter day 14 years ago , while young Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer was pondering cancer problems in Basle , Switzerland , he noticed a cup of steaming hot coffee and one of tea resting side by side on a window sill . The steam from both cups condensed on the window pane , but the crystals of the frost patterns were very different . Dr. Pfeiffer had a hunch that the blood of cancer victims and the blood of healthy persons might perhaps form crystals as different as those of coffee and tea . After trying some 23 substances , he hit on copper chloride as blood 's best crystallizing agent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miley of Philadelphia 's Hahnemann Medical College , described their new test for the presence of early cancer . <P> A drop of blood is taken from the finger tip of a cancer suspect . The blood is dissolved in a small amount of lukewarm sterile water , mixed with copper chloride and spread on a glass microscope slide to crystallize . Healthy blood forms a green crystal pattern which , under a microscope , looks like a delicate , fan-shaped palm leaf . But in cancerous blood some unknown chemical forms a pattern of scattered , double-wing bow ties . In 1,000 trials on known cancer victims , said Drs . Pfeiffer and Miley , the copper test was 80% accurate . <P> Greatest value of the test is that it can detect the presence of cancer cells long before any growth appears on the body . <P> " Bold Step . " Ten years ago , 59-year-old Dr. John Ralston Davidson , former associate professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg , set up a small laboratory in his cellar , to continue his experiments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cancer was related to vitamin deficiency . According to standard laboratory methods , he produced cancers in young mice by coating them with tar for several weeks . The offspring of these mice were fed a diet rich in vitamins A , B , C , D and E. One day , Dr. Davidson found to his surprise that they were no longer susceptible to cancer when tarred . From the tissues of " newly dropped young " of these resistant mice , Dr. Davidson made a boiled filtrate . Injections of this filtrate , plus a high vitamin diet , produced strong cancer resistance in ordinary mice who had been tarred.
