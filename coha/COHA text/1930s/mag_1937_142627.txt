High sign that scientists as a group are now more interested in life than in atoms occurred at the annual convention of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington last week . The plurality of reports dealt with biology . And the one which attracted most attention was Amherst 's Embryologist Otto Schotte 's tale of growing heads on the tails of tadpoles . <P> The tail of a decaudated tadpole regenerates . In such fast growing tissue , Dr. Schotte implanted eye cups from hatching frog eggs . The embryonic eyes induced the tail tissue to develop an eye . That eye induced growth of an upper head , which in turn induced growth of a mouth and lower head . The heads on the tails of Schotte tadpoles were not perfect . Nonetheless they demonstrated the capacity of embryonic cells to control their own development , and hinted at a future method of seeding injuries in human beings .
