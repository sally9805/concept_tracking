In Washington 's Naval Hospital , death from heart disease came suddenly last week to Herman Oliphant , 54 , grey-locked , hollow-eyed general counsel of the Treasury Department . It left the Treasury bereft of the most earnest economic experimenter remaining there since the withdrawal of the late Professor George F. ( " Rubber Dollar " ) Warren . Herman Oliphant , a law scholar before he was a financier and a liberal before he was a lawyer , was the prime advocate of the Undistributed Profits Tax , written into the tax law of 1936 . All but the bare principle of that tax , which Franklin Roosevelt loved for its neat theory , * was killed by the last Congress in the 1938 tax bill , which brought a blast from Franklin Roosevelt and became law without his signature . <P> The passing of Oliphant coincided with other equally important changes in the Treasury . Taxation for revenue is now Franklin Roosevelt 's urgent need and last week the Senate confirmed the nomination of the man who will have to plan it , a newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wesley Hanes , 46 , is a well-dressed , fun-loving North Carolina squire . The Haneses of Winston-Salem , N. C. are many and substantial . John Wesley is one who , after Yale ( 1915 ) , made really good in Wall Street as a leading partner of C. D. Barney &; Co . He cashed in on marketing Winston-Salem 's R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . ( Camel ) stock . Relatively , he survived the 1929 crash better than most Wall Streeters . He kept in touch with North Carolina politics and his old friend Democrat Max Gardner ( Governor 1929-33 ) . <P> Just a year ago John Hanes bobbed up as " Wall Street 's man " on the Securities &; Exchange Commission . The Senate confirmed him last week as Under Secretary of the Treasury , the job given him last fall by Secretary Morgenthau . With Mr. Morgenthau resting in Florida , John Hanes became , after less than a year of Government service , the Treasury 's acting head . Mr. Morgenthau was well content , for as two men of property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other well . They agree , for instance , that if the Budget is not balanced some day soon , the country will surely go to hell . <P> Under Secretary Hanes 's search for revenue is leading him to consider taxing State and local salaries and securities ( now tax-exempt ) . Here he will collide with a host of State and municipal officials , who are unwilling to play Franklin Roosevelt 's proposed game of tit-for-tat wherein States would levy income taxes against the salaries of Federal employes . John Hanes 's understanding of the scarcity and paucity of new tax avenues , and of the woes of taxpayers-for whom he often personally holds court-makes him a darling of the Garner-Harrison economy bloc in the new Congress , a group which had no love for Mr. Oliphant . He should be able to wheedle more revenue-raising taxes from them than any social experimenter . <P> <P> * The theory : to increase the velocity of business by forcing corporate profits into circulation .                @ @ @ @ @
