REV LUTE , N 011LVIER PLAT= YR.ONllf LQ ELUCLUEOHN W HEN the hot-tempered gentlemen in Pancho Villa sombreros , who , a few years ago , would miss a meal to fire a six-gun in the name of the Mexican revolution , give way to the new set of " revolutionaries " , : who marched recently through the capital in gym suits and smart athletic costumes , our neighbor south of the Rio Grande is changing . When ? Communist like the painter , Diego Rivera , remarks , moreover , that Mexico 's is now " a bourgeois revolution with the language of Marx instead of Robespierre , " " the Russia of the New World " is turning to new forms . Behind the Marxist language of Rivera , the screen of semiofficial propaganda , and a constant stream of partisan statements , a picture of a nation developing capitalism on an intensely nationalist scale is disclosed . The drive south of the United States now is to create a new group of small capitalists on farms , to raise industrial wages , and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coincident growth of capitalism and nationalism is linked with increasing state control of industry , agriculture and distribution , as well as one-man rule , there arises a conjecture as to whether Mexico . like some other lands , is not finding that extremes meet , that it is not a far march from a totalitarian left to a totalitarian right . An administration bill has been so modified in the Mexican Congress that those government-dominated labor organizations which still have courage enough to peep say it would lay the groundwork for " ( *spore Lions " ? presume bly of the Italian brand  --  and German Nazi propaganda in the press has started an absurd anti-Semitic movement . The corporative bill probably will be changed again . The anti-Jewish drive is almost certain to subside for lack ' of human material to attack . But both provide an interesting sidelight on Mexico 's fast-moving social changes . One  --  Man Country WHILE the economic life of individuals is being VV directly affeeted by the state , there remains a large measure of social and individual freedom ; so Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today it certainly comes closer to this system than to Communism . Perhaps the best way to find out how matters have reached their present pass in this border country , whose happenings always must be of vital concern to the United States , is to scrutinize forty-two-yearold President Lazaro Cardenas , his actions , and the reaction to them  --  a reaction probably unexpected by both the president and his advisers . For Mexico remains a one-man country . In looking into these matters , it may be possible to get a fair impression of how the Roosevelt " good neighbor " policy has operated in this , its show window . The key to President Cardenas is the fact that ho is mostly Tarascan Indian , and proud of it . Other Mexican strong men have been , to a greater or lesser extent , of Indian extraction , but the young and vigorous Cardenas is perhaps the only Mexican executive who has not adopted a white-Mexican viewpoint on taking office . Fond of power , but with none of the desire for personal monetary gain that usually characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000,000 Indians and the mestizos , who , together , make up something like 85 per cent of Mexico 's total population . Mexico 's great problem is to help the Indians and persons of mixed blood take a dignified place , socially and economically , in the nation 's life . They have been cuffed about and subjected for centuries . Now they are coming into their own as a preponderant force . The president 's task today is to make good on the twenty-seven-year-old promises to these people , many of which have not been kept . Portrait of a President OARDEN.AS is heavy-set , with high cheek bones and a protruding upper lip  --  a reverse Bourbon lip it is called here  --  topped by a close-clipped , but heavy , black mustache . Mexican girls consider him handsome . His expression is immobile , his eyes piercing , and he moves with authority , although with the slightly self-conscious air of an ing6nue in her first role . The president has the Indian propensity for keeping his thoughts to himself . He speaks little . Interviewers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to get monosyllabic answers . He is not afraid of the interviewer , but prefers to act rather than speak , to accomplish rather than to worry about theories of action . His public speeches are notably poor in a country where politicians find histrionics as natural as walking . Ile talks in a guttural , monotonous tone . When Cardenas gets among the Indians , however , he becomes a different person . He understands them and they him . His hold over this class of the Mexican population is probably the greatest any Mexican leader has enjoyed in many decades . The strong man hates so-called society life like poison and feels restricted and unhappy in Mexico City , where he has refused to live in aristocratic Chapultepec Palace , built by Emperor Maximilian and always heretofore the dwelling of Mexican presidents . He spends most of his time traveling about the country . The representative of one foreign power , an accomplished rider , spent several days in a hospital after returning from a week 's cross-country horseback trip with the president . Cardenas does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special train , ship , automobile , mule or horse  --  as long as it gets him out among the people with whom he feels at home . One week he is in Southeastern Yucatan. the next in Northern Chihuahua . Ile seldom takes an airplane. although he has been known to fly . The man is widely credited with lacking nerves . Once , in 1923 , while serving then-President Alvaro Obregan in a military campaign . Cardenas was captured . Only his army popularity and some fast string-pulling by Obregan kept , him from being killed . Cardenas was not impressed by his danger . When his advisers become upset today , the presideel seeks calmly for a way out of difficulties . Ile realizes that he is molding a large , rich , underpopulated country , and apparently feels that the way out always exists . As a general , Cardenas showed rixisonable military ability in several revolutions . Asa politician , he was governor of his home state of Miehoacein , where he won more than a local reputation as a school builder and developer of NI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . the official bureaucracy , he learned the inside operation of the national political machine . As Secretary of War , he came into intimate contact with the plutocratic generals who long have swayed Mexico 's destinies . Nevertheless , at the time Dictator Plutarco Elias Caller , Whom lie subsequently exiled from the mum try , backed Cardenas for the presidency , the man now in charge of Mexico 's destinies was not considered outstanding . He was intended to be allot lier Calif 's stooge . That is where Cardenas ' stubbornness and determination to help the underdog became evident . When the then wealthy and slipping Canes ordered him to slow the quickened pace of the reform program , Cardenas quietly chucked his mentor out . The tendency , at first , in Mexico was to regard Cardenas as a somewhat stupid president . Now it is to give him credit for interior political acumen of an extraordinary sort . On economic matters , he leaves i affairs to his aides . He has never been out of Mexico , and his idea of so-called Socialism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand . Mexico 's New Course TIP ONE gets the portrait of a good-willed man , 1 anxious to raise the living standards of his country and eliminate abuses , a man who knows traditional polities , but is only casually acquainted with economic systems and finance , it is easier to understand why , for the past three years , Mexico has followed a new course . On taking office , Cardenas faced an unequaled opportunity for dividing land among farm workers and for effecting other reforms he regarded us necessary . The Mexican revolution had long since passed through its phase of violent dictatorship , which was terminated in 1911 , after it year of effort . The small ruling conservative class had been broken , making interior opposition to the regime difficult . The Church 's property had been taken away , and , according to the president , " any Church power for interfering in temporal affairs broken . " A six-year EVENING POST Cardenas ' program for carrying out agrarian reform  --  he now terms it " a purely Mexican plan " ? was far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former farm laborer . The president knew that he was , dealing with a people who had come to need direction . He to , that an Indian or mestizo , used to working with his fellows for another man , would do badly if left to himself . Taking great pride in the Indian past of Mexico as he did , the president also realized the value of some program that would recall that glorious era and invoke an equally stirring hope for the future . The scheme he evolved was a development , far beyond its probable original scope , of the Aztec ejidal system , whose essential characteristic was the community working of farms . It is carried out in the following way today : A landed estate is nationalized by the government , the original owner supposedly retaining 330 acres of ground . The farm workers continue to Live in groups , as on the former hacienda . They work the farm together under government supervision , receiving a daily monetary advance equal to their previous pay as laborers . They receive , theoretically , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its conception , the plan establishes the profit motive as a primary one for inducing the Indians to work . It gives the new farmer expert technical advice , and opens up financial F ..... ry 4,1Q3,5 resources for his development of the land that would not otherwise exist . In practice , it requires the heaviest capital outlays any Mexican government ever has been called upon to make and forces the government , as well , into direct control of production and marketing . The new " independent " farmer goes into debt to government land banks . If the first crop is good , he will emerge ; if bad , he must go farther into debt to the government the next year . All over Mexico , in the vast central La Laguna cotton region , in the tortured hills of Southwestern Oaxaca , where people sleep on the ground because there are no beds , in the fertile western Yaqui Valley , and amidst the Mayan ruins and hemp farms of highly developed Yucatan , the program goes forward . Through August 1 , 1937 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of 21,314,640 acres and placed 569,083 families upon them . Daily the Official Gazette carries a list of ten to fifteen further estates divided . Cardenas asserted recently that the revolution " is only one third completed " ; he intends to split up all remaining large estates before his term of office ends , in 1940 . Mexican agriculture today is still largely independent of this government movement . Visitors who get off the beaten track in many parts of Mexico min still find villages that get their drinking water an hour away , and where it is not known that a cow 's milk is drinkable . But by 1940 , the government should dominate , almost entirely , the nation 's agrarian system . Let us visit the collective farms of the La Laguna district to see how the new and rapidly extending government program operates . This year Mexico City has thrown up to 60,000 , - 000 pesos into this one cotton territory ; an enormous sum for a country whose total regular budget is less than 350,000.000 pesos . We find immediately that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , the chief difference thus far between the old system and the new is that he has a larger measure of freedom . He can elect his own work boss and organize into unions , But beyond that he has merely exchanged bosses . He gets the same wages as before , and , for the present , he is working for the government , rather than the landowner . Over the work boss , and , except . for supervision in the fields , the man really in charge of the undertaking is the government land-bank agent . Each week he checks up on index cards showing how much work each person on the community farm has done , how much money has been advanced to him for various reasons , and other data . If the work is drugging , or if the elected work boss is favoring one group over another , the government agent takes corrective measures . He gives the orders as to what crops should be planted and when harvesting should take place . To put it briefly , the government . is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in the lives of most of the people upon them . It has brought back from the United States those expensive new harvesting machines that are to be seen in La Laguna ; it has supplied the " 20,000 mules laboring in the fields ; it has purchased tons of seeds for planting , and even imported beans and corn from other parts of Mexico for the 30,000 people in the district . Agriculture M the Balance Ask one of these men which piece of land is his , and he looks blank or mumbles an unintelligible answer . Query him as to whether he has yet received any profits . " No , but I hope to next year , or the year of ter , " is his reply . " Two hundred workers on one farm up at the other end of La Laguna got . some money from the government , but that was from a wheat crop seized from the British , together with their land . Personally , I do n't like the fact that the old landowner 's foreman is our government agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the La Laguna territory , only one good crop normally can be expected in five years . The land is semidesert , and cotton is raised the same way that it is along the Nile , The straggling river winding through the 800,000-acre district rises each spring . Once in four or five years it floods all the lowlands , fertilizing the farms with silt . Then there is a bumper crop , usually big enough to pay the losses of bad years . The year 1037 was poor . Most of the families in La Laguna went into debt to the government . They will have to go further into debt while the crops are being grown in 1038 . Will they succeed in pulling out , or will they become peons of the government ? Much of Mexico is quasi-arid . In many states big landowners have financed their workers in bad years . Can the government , whose budget is smaller than that of the school system in New York City , stand the expense on a nationwide scale ? Does the whole program stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer these questions , the government is building darns all over the nation  --  seventeen are under construction and ten more completed . One is being built , under the direction of an American engineer , to assure La Laguna water every year . Dam construction , however , also is a heavy expense for a government with a relatively small income . In the meantime , agricultural production is falling off in the nation as a whole . The administration attributes this , with some reason , to unfavorable weather conditions , not to a breakdown of its system . It is , at least temporarily , necessary to import some primary foods . Now , the aims of the agrarian program obviously are laudable . It may be that even its speed , perhaps creating some danger of collapse , can be condoned . Cardenas is not sure his successor will be as well-intentioned as he . It is worth while to note that Mexico has some 110,000,000 acres of national lands that have not been carefully surveyed to ascertain their value , whereas only about 22,000,000 acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration . The Land Grab Nevertheless , it may be that our State Department was wise in adopting the attitude that the land program should be encouraged and no immediate payment demanded for United States citizens ' lands seized . In this connection , Washington accepts the Mexican view that American landowners acquired their Mexican holdings on a shoestring and made big profits for years . Whatever the truth , there is some sense in believing that a settlement of Mexico 's involved land problem , however arrived at , might lay a sounder basework for Mexican society and hence a better foundation for permanent good will between the two nations peering at each other across a long frontier . On the other hand , Washington could have slowed somewhat the agrarian program , or held it in safer bounds , by protecting United States landowners who have had vast holdings in Mexico . The extent and value of these holdings has never been computed accurately , but a not-to-be-ignored portion of the American investment of about $1,000,000,000 in Mexico is in land . If Washington thought it advisable to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in the Bucareli agreements of the Obregdn period and the Mexican Constitution of 1917 itself . However , though the point is debatable , it does not tollow necesssrily that the New Dealers have taken as absurd a position as might be believed in permitting the division of American lands . Recently , Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles declared in a speech that the United States would insist upon payments for lands taken . This may mark a change in policy , but the question is whether immediate payment will be required . Mexico always has agreed upon payment in principle . Whore Washington appears to have fallen down completely , however , particularly from the viewpoint of being a " good neighbor " to Mexico , has been in countenancing , and even encouraging , an intensified campaign against foreign industry . For many extreme steps that President Cardenas took in this direction were followed by general laudatory speeches by Ambassador Josephus Daniels . The Wilson Secretary of the Navy has been as popular in Mexico as any of his predecessors . His friendly speeches might have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of common-sense advice . They were not , however ; probably because of diplomatic policy set at home . Such remarks as the following , delivered before United States students in Mexico on February 6 , 1937 , and widely published in the Mexican press , were taken as reflecting an encouraging United States attitude toward the **26;1374;TOOLONG campaign . " Today , " said Ambassador Daniels , " the condition of the mass of Mexicans is better than at any time in the history of the country , though its leaders recognize that there are many bridges to cross before the desired standards of living and social justice are reached . " Earlier , in an address before the Guanajuato State Legislature , on October 19 , 1935 , Ambassador Daniels linked the programs of the New Deal and the Cardenas regime , remarking , " I pledge my faith , and I feel sure , that my country under the New Deal , which discovers and exalts the forgotten man , and Mexico with her social reforms , and all other countries traveling on the same high road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice for all mankind . " Now , in Mexico , the situation is not at all the same as in the United States . Less than S per cent of Mexican workers are engaged in industry . A revolution in Mexico means just one thing  --  a land revolution . An overwhelming part of Mexican industry is in the hands of foreigners , who have huge capital investments . What there is of local industry , except for very small undertakings , is largely controlled by a few politicians , like ex-President Abelardo Rodriguez , and a group of wealthy men . Mexican labor unions , as will be shown later , are government-dominated . Mexico has been attempting an expensive agricultural program on an orthodox capitalist basis . The government . had to have the tax income from foreign companies and the credit they could advance if the farm program was to stand a real chance of success . Thus , purely as a matter of revolutionary tactics , it would appear foolhardy , to use the mildest word available , to kill the goose that lays the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put another way , Mexico has a refunded foreign debt of $275,000,000 on which it has paid no service for several years ; under the best of conditions , therefore , it is difficult for the country to get credit abroad . The foreign mining industry pays 13 per cent of total federal revenues ; the foreign petroleum industry , according to official figures , 6 per cent of total federal and state outlays ; the foreign telephone , electric-light and service industries another large gob . To attack these industries now and endanger the land program would appear a step in the direction of cutting off one 's nose to spite one 's face . It has been explained that even the best friends of President Cardenas do not regard him as an economist . Ho had inherited a program calling for Mexicanization of industry during his term , and , being a literal man , he proceeded to carry it out . As a practical politician , he kept a weather eye out for a hint of what Washington , which was playing its part in supporting him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . United States diplomats applauded in a way that in some countries might have been considered " direct intervention in affairs . " The president went ahead . The anti-foreign-industries campaign has taken three forms . Frequent government-approved labor strikes and the upsetting of contracts made through collective bargaining and with official endorsement have destroyed a sound basis for foreign industry and whittled it down . The government has entered directly into the sugar business , as well as the petroleum industry and other enterprises , through its own organisms . The 1936 Expropriation Law has been employed to nationalize railroads , and , through its use , a constant threat to foreign industries that do not accept the proposition of being squeezed has been created . Toward a Totalitarian State From Mexico 's viewpoint , exclusively , the campaign has led to increasing state control of industry , as well as agriculture , which , with one-man rule , buttressed by at least . 6,000,000 illiterates , has created a tendency toward a totalitarian state . It has cut off foreign credit and placed the key land program in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a degree of danger of general economic collapse and consequent political unrest . Without . lifting a finger , we have let our next-door neighbor set fire to his house . To what end ? Looking at it first from the viewpoint of labor , the right of Mexican workers to organize , strike and bargain collectively is laid down in law and recognized . Virtually every industrial concern operating in Mexico has its unions , and , except in the case of one telephone company , they are not company unions . The organization issue did not come into the picture at all . What has come in , and very strongly , is politics . The government wanted labor support when the struggle with General Calles began , and it was not so confident then , as now , of tho army . So Cardenas , under Vicente Lombardo Toledano , credited with being a sincere Marxist , formed a labor organization to supplant the Calles unions . It is the Confederation of Mexican Workers , familiarly known as the CTM . Partially to keep happy this organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given an official okay . Mexican wages , compared to those of the United States and many other countries , have been very low . With rising world raw-material prices and U. S. silver buying , however , both the largest foreign industries in Mexico , mining and petroleum , were willing to raise wages considerably to avoid paralyzation . So were other principal foreign industries . But collective contracts , most of them recent , were broken to permit new strikes . It is certain that wages would not have been increased so much if these strikes had not occurred . Neither would the labor unions have enjoyed an opportunity to become more independent of the government . Hero is where several factors came into play , however , that showed that the government intends to , and probably will , keep the unions subjugated , and that the way salary increases were brought about robbed them of their effects . It must be borne in mind that whatever advantages were obtained by the very small labor percentage of the population endangered the advantages for the great masses . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of hand , Cardenas brought back to Mexico Calles ' labor chieftain , Luis Morones , and gave him a free hand . By creating a breach between radical and conservative labor , similar to that between the C. I. 0 . and the A. F. of L. in the United States , the president indicated the government 's intention to keep the labor movement split and dependent . In part as a result of the government 's failure to get full taxes because of strikes , or of credits because of its anti-foreign attitude , it had to raise import duties an average of 26 per cent , with an added surtax of 3 per cent , collectible by Mexican consuls abroad before the shipment of merchandise . Therefore , though industrial wages have been raised an average of about 25 per cent , living costs have increased some 40 per cent . This has hit the industrial workers hardest , since they live on a higher scale than the farm popula t ion . Further , the series of strikes against foreign companies has tended to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foreign companies have paid double , sometimes triple , the wages in local industry . Union victories against foreign companies have widened this gap . Whereas the foreign petroleum companies paid , with housing and perquisites , an average of more than seven pesos a day , workers for local companies were lucky to get above two . If one talks to Mexican taxi drivers and Mexican company employees , one finds a considerable resentment among them . R Boomerang Campaign If , as appears likely , the government aimed to keep within Mexico a larger share of the returns of companies exporting minerals and oil , accounting together for some 90 per cent of Mexican exports , then the sound step , it appears , would have been to seek an upward revision of taxes . But in this connection it must be remembered that from an investor 's viewpoint , Mexico has been a bad risk . Because Mexico has started from behind scratch and has been closer than other nations to a world power like the United States , a contract here has meant merely a lull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diaz left Mexico , United States investments were estimated at $2,000 , - 000,000 . Today they are about $1,000 , - 000,000 . American-owned oil production has fallen to 12,000,000 barrels annually , a pittance . Thus foreign companies claim they are afraid to accept government promises . They do not want to expand . Instead , on a limited basis of operations , they take big risks to make big profits . That Mexico at this point can not eject foreign industrial capital successfully was indicated when the government recently made a deal with the British-controlled Mexican Eagle Oil Company . To the British interests , feeling the financial pressure resulting from the anti-foreign campaign , the government gave the rights to the rest of the east-coast Poza Rica oil fields . In return , the government is to receive 35 per cent royalties on some properties , not less than 15 per cent on any . The Mexicans themselves seem to have found that the anti-foreignindustry campaign at this time is a boomerang . There is the humorous angle that in seeking to Mexicanize industry , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order not to lose royalties , it can logically be expected to stand against labor in this field . Increasing British-Mexican trade is likely to result as an effect of this deal . The Mexicans already have placed Germany in second place in their trade through using discounted marks extensively . This raises the question of whether the anti-foreign campaign has not become purely anti-American . The Washington - attitude Whatever it is , the campaign has hurt Mexico more than it has injured anyone else . Foreign business is pertinacious . Mexico is put under severe economic strain when it can least stand it . It must he stressed that Washington , perhaps as much as Cardenas , is guilty in this matter . The State Department could have halted this drive when it began . In order to understand what Washington could have done in this respect , and did not do , it is necessary to note the change in Mexico and its relations with the rest of Latin America during the past decade . Mexicans universally are proud of the undoubted progress they have made . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , long the most backward of the big nations in this hemisphere , has passed through its long series of violent outbursts and coups d'Glat . The hope is a hundred per cent that there be no retrogression . A new feeling of dignity has appeared , and Mexico has dropped much of the chip-on-the-shoulder attitude that formerlycharac teri zed her relations with other countries . She has turned inward . In every Latin-American country , except , perhaps , Panama , she has dropped her attempts to incite other nations to social upheaval . At Buenos Aires . Mexico , which had long opposed United States influence in Latin America , was happy to join the United States in taking leadership in peace moves . Though Ambassador Daniels ' speeches have given an unfortunate impression on specific points , his talks and attitude have sold the Mexican people , if not those in official circles , the idea that the United States has dropped the " big stick . " There is no longer a predisposition toward resentment at the ideas advanced from across the border , so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Dwight Morrow termed " equality of sovereignty . " It was not until Cardenas was thoroughly committed to the anti-foreign campaign in the fall of 1937 that Washington gave a mild warning  --  a warning that , since it was not backed up , had little effect at this stage of proceedings . The warning was given after the Bank of Mexico reserves had dropped like a plummet from 62.2 per cent on August . first to 46.28 per cent on November thirtieth . These figures told only half the story of financial troubles . Moreover , the fact that United States petroleum companies with an investment of $175,000,000 in Mexico , threatened to restrict operations further influenced even these half-hearted efforts . It is only within the realm of the official bureaucracy , among those in 74 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 5 , r938 ministries and key , but secondary , positions , that a leek of reciprocation toward the friendly attitude to the north is evident . It may be that our State Department interprets the bureaucratic as the national viewpoint . It may be because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " big stick " that . Washington refused to say anything after its first few words . Mexico , incidentally , is furnished with United States furniture . American-type roads , department stores , methods of business , even cabarets are seen everywhere . As the British deal indicates , Mexico still needs foreign capital , and the United States , as represented by 500 , - 000 investors , has $1,000,000,000 in Mexico . Yet the State Department takes the attitude that the United States has no responsibilities either to Mexico or to its own nationals . It is easy to see how the State Department could have ended the anti-foreign campaign so injurious to Mexico itself . The trade figures show that while the State Department has been patting itself on the bark for making Mexico a leading Latin-American customer , the balance of trade actually has been unfavorable to the United States . Mexico bought $83,000,000 worth of American goods in the first nine months of 19.37 and sold the United States only $48,500,000 worth . But in the same period , according to U. S. customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexican silver , at a reported five cents above the world market price , in addition to $28,500,000 worth of Mexican gold . Adding in gold and silver purchases , Mexican exports to the United States in the first nine months of 1037 were $99,000,000 . In other words , the trade balance was adverse , from Washington 's viewpoint , by about $10,000,000 , exclusive of tourist spending &; Though American mining firms got a good part of the metal profits , it is also true that the Mexican Government received a large share of its income as a result of United States metal purchases . We have been friends , rather than mere neighbors , in this matter . One  --  Way Good.Neighboriiness The American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico estimates that the host of United States tourists pouring into Mexico in 1930 left $35,000,000 in the country  --  money that helped Mexican shopkeepers , government income through commercial taxes , and the balance of trade . American tourists were permitted to take home $100 worth of merchandise free of duty , and most of them did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mexican would-be revolutionaries were given to understand that Roosevelt was solidly behind Cardenas . Probably without his knowledge , friends of Gen. Saturnino Cedillo , who resigned as Cardenas ' Secretary of Agriculture , went about Mexico City talking about " Washington 's not permitting revolt in Mexico . " Until recently , when new congressional laws made impossible the hiring of aliens in the United States for relief jobs , Mexican newspapers claimed there were 1,000,000 Mexicans on United States relief rolls . Be that as it may , the number was sizable . Just what reciprocation did the United States get from these evidences of extreme good neighborliness ? The answer lies largely in the hands of the Mexican bureaucrats , who have large Specifically , the reaction was : Despite Secretary Hull 's anti-tradebarrier campaign , Mexico raised its general tariffs au average of 26 per cent in January . 1037 , partially " to protect local industries . " Later in the year , when the campaign against foreign industry was making its effects felt , Mexico added a surtax of 3 per cent . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it buys , both these moves affected chiefly the Americans . Mexico for Mexicans Mexican tourists , visiting the United States in relatively small numbers , are not allowed to bring back one cent 's worth of merchandise duty free . The government wants its revenues and wishes to protect local textile and other industries . Despite the number of Mexicans who have been on relief rolls in the States , the number of Americans permitted to do business in Mexico is being rigidly controlled and the number is reduced each year . Mexico , on top of all this , has been nationalizing the lands of United States citizens and plunging ahead with the attack on American capital . As far as the informed portion of the Mexican public is concerned , it not only appears that Santa . Claus is being good to Mexico but that his beard can be pulled with impunity . When Mexican Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Ramfin Beteta appeared before a gathering of State Department and United States consular officials in the American Embassy late in October , the unhealthy impression was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senor Beteta gave a severe lecture on the duties of foreign consuls in Mexico . He mid that " Mexico is for Mexicans , " and informed the American consuls that it was no longer their duty to protect the property of nationals , but rather to do what they could to increase trade . He said that Mexican purchasing power was being increased by the social program , ignoring U. S. metal buying , and that this was for the best . The Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs forgot to mention that , due to generous Mexican use of the aski-mark system , Germany had moved into second trade position with Mexico and is endangering United States trade . He did not say what effect the British petroleum deal might have in increasing British-Mexican trade . He did not raise the question of whether trade , to a marked extent , does not follow investments . He might have noted that with the Argentine , where British investments are biggest , Britain has her largest Latin-American commerce . Instead , as representative of the bureaucracy , Senor Beteta calmly told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mexico seemed to rub it in during some of the rather abortive attempts at horse-trading that ensued . When Mexican Finance Minister Eduardo Suarez came to Washington late in December , it appeared that the State Department attempted to make a deal : A slowdown of the Mexican nationalization of industry in return for continued above-the-market silver buying by the United States . Washington could have offered the arguments that the antiforeign-industry campaign was endangering the Mexican land program with direct prospective benefits for 92 per cent of the Mexican people ; that there was danger of a peso inflation affecting all Mexicans if the campaign nn.11.41 , nori ? that tharnnaf nnrhnnf the Cardenas program could not be continued if the United States were to cut eft ' metal purchases , or even remove the $100 merchandise exemption for American tourists returning home . Were such arguments used ? Apparently not with any traditional horse-trading effect . Sefior Suarez won Secretary Morgenthau 's agreement to maintain the silver-buying policy throughout January . Subsequently , the two secretaries jointly announced that the United States would keep the dollar-peso rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardenas nationalized the American-owned Ague Caliente race-track properties , valued at $6,000,000 , and followed up by declaring that United States oil companies would be forced to pay royalties on all their properties , thus upsetting the so-called MorrowCalles agreement guaranteeing oil-company rights in Mexico . The controlled Mexican press , judging by the way it raged at the failure of the United States to fix the silver-buying policy for longer than a month , clearly tipped the Mexican Government conviction that Washington 's stand had been weak . It is bard to see how Washington 's attitude can do anything other than accelerate the Mexican Government 's attacks on American businesses and landowners in Mexico . In view of Washington 's failure , American oil companies , with an investment of 5175,000,000 , are wondering whether they eventually will be forced to accept any terms the Mexican Government may choose to give them in order to protoct their investment . It must be remembered that very few people know much about the inside working of Mexico today . Probably there is as little actual Communism in Mexico today as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that any development , no matter what , can be glibly explained by official spokesmen as a move against Communism and toward traditional Mexicanism . American professional liberals are convinced that , since Mexico 's movement is nationalist , it must be holy . So , if the newspapers report some morning that there is trouble again in Mexico , economic or political , Washington will say it has kept hands off , and refuse to take responsibility .
