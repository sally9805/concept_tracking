AMONG those blessings of adversity that we are , slowly , discovering these calamitous days is that an unpleasant truth does not hurt as badly as one politely ignored or denied . At long last we are turning from the ideal of " normalcy , " " ninety days to Prosperity , " from the theory that our economic muddle is " largely psychological , " and from the many other varieties of anodyne with which as a people Americans have been fond of doping themselves . We are accustoming ourselves to look unpleasant facts in the face without squinting . Dr. Julius Klein 's radio patter leaves us cold ; the latest billion-dollar panacea from Washington does not even flutter the stock market ; platform bunk is merely cause for mirth in the silly season ? and when not sufficiently hilarious , the broadcasting companies kindly turn it off . In time we may even come to realize that we are not the richest , luckiest , happiest , most generous people that ever lived on this earth ; that all our financiers are not Wizards ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Supermen ; our petty politicians , Astute Statesmen . We Americans are somehow mortal like the rest of the world , and a little searching of the heart will do us good . We are deflating more than commodity and security prices : we are deflating some of our national conceits . No longer will one be considered a tiresome pessimist or a " red " if he happens to blurt out an obvious if unpalatable truth that his neighbors are trying to forget . The habit of closing our senses to the ordures on our path , of singing ourselves to sleep with headline lullabies , may be unsafe . What we have needed the past ten years is a Voltaire , a Swift , not a Coue nor a Pollyanna . A little cleansing acid on the greasy windshield of public consciousness will clear the vision . This habit of seeing only silver linings in the clouds is deeply rooted in the American temperament . We are proud of it . Upon the principle of self-delusion we have created the only religion that appeals vitally to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is neither scientific nor Christian , and its many imitators , designed to teach their votaries how to cheat their intelligence , are immensely popular . As a people we like to fool ourselves . This tendency has made our literature feeble , our politics infantile , and our daily life monotonous . A prolonged period of adversity when distressing truths could not be evaded by the most robust was needed to make us adult . One of the more irritating forms of criticism that , as a young novelist , I used to hear from dear friends who wished me well was that I should write about " nice " people like themselves ( people one would like " to receive into the home " as it was sometimes put ) ,  |p598  and treat only " pleasant " subjects , the list of unpleasant subjects being then longer than at present . How the pages of Balzac , of Dostoievsky , of Thackeray would shrink under such a test ! Even Shakespeare might become insipid . When somewhat later I was writing of the roaring background of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose deliberately to depict the squalor of Cottage Grove Avenue ( then one of the world 's dreariest thoroughfares ) and the miles of shambling dingy flat buildings on the scrawny wastes of prairie " subdivisions " rather than the elegancies of the Gold Coast and the neo-classic beauty of the Art Institute of Chicago as seen in the vision of the " Chicago Plan " at Commercial Club banquets . A similar instinct to deny the unpleasant condemned Barbusse 's powerful picture of men at war , which the soldiers at the front were eagerly reading , glad that at last some of the horrors they had to endure had found their way into print instead of sweetly romantic tales of heroism and the distortions of war correspondents . When I praised Le Feu in a review as the one authentic presentation of war then published , I was solemnly warned by a member of our Military Intelligence Bureau that Barbusse was considered " defeatist " and , therefore , seditious by the high command . Reading his book might make American mothers and fathers uncomfortable about the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were safer literature ! So it was with Russia when that great country refused to fight any longer in a war that was in no sense hers . The facts were unpalatable and , therefore , must be denied as long as possible . The foremost American newspapers chronicled every few days the immediate collapse of the new regime ? as they still do at longer intervals ? which has somehow survived to a quite respectable age as governments go these years . Some day Americans may regret that they allowed themselves to be deceived about what has been happening to that huge slice of the world 's population , and wish that they had accepted the facts pragmatically instead of denying them " idealistically . " The same mental attitude has asserted itself from the start of the recent unpleasantness in business and finance . Millions were without work and starving long before our government , the press , or the public would admit the facts and recognize the situation . Washington , of course , set the lullaby to words and tried heroically to Coue the nation back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with optimistic prophecies . Great industrialists marshaled their billions to double an already swollen capacity of production . The people were exhorted to buy , buy , buy more goods . Meanwhile great financial institutions were tottering or crumbled into dust , savings and " investments in American equities " were disappearing into air like soap bubbles ? but why speak about it ? These were but necessary incidents of " readjustment , " from which , phoenixlike , we should emerge ere long richer and merrier than ever in this world of rugged individualism . The role of the strong was to sit silent and listen to the dripdrip of their fortunes ebbing away like blood from an open artery , grimly resolved to " carry on " ( in the melodramatic lingo of the war ) or hold on while our world was taking a flop and shriveling into nothing . " Do n't talk about such unpleasant things ! " my charming hostess exclaims reprovingly when someone carelessly mentions the impending disasters to be read between the lines of carefully censored despatches from  |p599  Asia or Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! You may be wrong . . . . I know everything will come out right some day , some fine day ! " It is amazing how many good women of native intelligence are convinced that human society as they have become accustomed to think of it will endure forever , a divinely conceived instrument . No historical instances of former recessions of civilization can swerve their faith in the continuance of the world they were born into . " All that was somehow different . " They know that the familiar sun will shine upon them tomorrow morning or at the latest the day after , ? same sun , same world , same self as always hitherto . This is what is popularly known as having " faith " and greatly praised . Every true woman is both a capitalist and an optimist from birth . This may be from biologic necessity or from an invincible ignorance , but I bow before it whatever its cause and am convinced that as long as American women are what they are there is no need to worry about communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes : they understand fascism and have a weakness for Mussolinis . They ( like Mussolini ) know how God made this world and why : he made it for them , with its ups and downs ( but chiefly ups ) , with motor cars and country places and rich husbands for the lucky ones ; cosy apartments and movies for the less lucky ; decent homes and plenty of dull work for the great uninteresting mass of humanity ; and charity for the poor whom we have always with us . . . Life without end , Amen ! So being duly warned I take another drink and tactfully ask my neighbor how her garden is thriving during this dry season , and whether she has reduced the cook 's wages ten or twenty per cent ? II Something not unlike this ostrich act the political High Hats of Europe have been doing ever since the War was officially declared off , on the whole disastrously for the peace and comfort of the world . Anything to avoid admitting publicly what they knew to be the truth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting inevitably in more or less meaningless formulas prepared by the " experts , " who are skilled in " agreeing in principle " while scuttling all the essential facts . Ever since an American president announced to a shocked world that the lamentable treaty embodied his Fourteen Points , statesmen the world over have been playing harder than ever the great game of bluff ? up to this very hour when , after vainly trying to decide how more armament can be made to appear disarmament , the Geneva conference has adjourned for six months in the hope that another year will be more opportune for the telling of unpleasant truths . If at any time during the past twelve hectic years those in high command politically ? who should know all the tragic facts ? had said in public what they have all been saying to one another confidentially over luncheon , tea , and dinner tables , we should be nearer that healthy understanding of what ails the world , which must precede any real amelioration of conditions . Instead of delusive generalities ( stalling with Dawes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the back of their minds ; they might have said something like this : " Men and women of this troubled world , it is useless to pretend any longer ? and too dangerous . The old formulas wo n't work . Germany ca n't be made to pay the entire cost of the international spree or any considerable part of it . We ca n't go armed to the  |p600  teeth and prate of our longings for peace . We ca n't get rich again by simply refusing to buy one another 's goods . We ca n't sit forever on the lid of potential revolution while our peoples grow hungrier and more desperate each year . One awful mistake was made at Versailles and a thousand since . We propose now to tear up that cursed treaty and begin over , sincerely . And from now on we propose to tell the world what we know as fast as we know it . " What would happen ? Would the French invade Germany again to gather their rainbow gold ? Would the people of these United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect our loans ? Never ! Just nothing at all would happen , except that everybody everywhere would sigh and say , " Well , we knew it was all make-believe . Now let us forget it and go to work . " The hush-hushers and the bitter-enders alike would be stilled forever , once what every informed person has realized for years was out in the open , told in screaming headlines until it no longer hurt . There are other , more personal , unpleasant truths nearer home that we might well let escape into the open . First , that whether we like it or not we are not and never can be sufficient unto ourselves . It may be humiliating to American pride to admit that we need the goods ? and the good will ? of other peoples even as they need ours . The air of aloof superiority which we have assumed toward the rest of humanity since the conclusion of the War we shall have to exchange for something nearer humility as each day piles up proofs that the rest of the world can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without them . Next we must recognize without rancor that Europe will pay us practically nothing of what remains of their debts to us on the war account , because it is desirable neither for them nor for us to have these debts paid . No matter who owes whom or what or however sanctified by right , this debt-and-reparation account ( practically one in fact if not ill political theory ) was all a nightmare of revengeful , fearful , cowardly statesmen and metaphysical financiers , with their endless bargains and rats ' - nests of paper obligations . Wars are fought in present time , and the attempt to foist the burdens for their payment upon succeeding generations is both futile and dangerous . Next , we ca n't hope to trade , which is the one thing we most care to do , unless we are willing to swap . Even a child can perceive that ! Again , not all of us , one hundred and twenty millions of us , can expect to live entirely at the expense of the government ? which is only a figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to truckle to " veterans , " thus raising a praetorian guard to bully weaklings in Congress : it might easily become a more serious menace to democracy than all the reds that ever peopled the imaginations of heretic hunting congressional committees ! Again , we ca n't for long make even paper profits out of selling worthless securities to people more foolish than we are ourselves . Still more wholesome if unpalatable truths : Americans are fast losing that reputation for common business honesty which they once shared with the Chinese . We have lied so much to ourselves that we are becoming hazy about certain basic moral axioms . Our corporations , of course the largest and best in the world , with their million-dollar executives and fat bonuses , have been extravagantly and , in many instances , dishonestly managed for the profit of directors and other speculators rather than for their stockholders . Our investment bankers are sometimes  |p601  criminally stupid ( the reader can supply the proper specification from his personal experience ) and sometimes mere rascals , too rarely " trustworthy " ( an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of us who are timid now prefer the mattress or the safety deposit box to the bank or investment banker . A government campaign with customary ballyhoo urging these timid souls not to hoard as " unpatriotic " would be more effective if the authorities had taken a little pains to enforce common honesty in our banks . " Whispering campaigns against the integrity of our financial institutions engineered by communists " is the latest farcical explanation of runs upon banks . All the talk by all the communists between Washington and Moscow could not affect the solidity of any American bank if the bankers themselves had not given ample cause for distrust of their methods and their principles . One need not resort to the hackneyed bogies of communism and socialism ? or even fascism ? to explain the unrest of this troubled day . It is indeed marvelous that with the accumulating evidences of bungling , dishonesty , and insincerity written large before the eyes of all , incidents that can not be concealed ( and how many others covered up but dimly suspected ? ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with the lords and masters of his destiny ! Our leading citizens and members of the government need not look so far as Russia for the cause were they to awake one morning to a lively and disastrous revolution . They need merely recall the record of their management of society for the past ten years . If the irresponsible rule of laissez-faire , so agreeable to its beneficiaries , has come to an end , as many shrewd observers fear , those who have benefited most largely from its license have themselves to thank for the ensuing chaos . Even to-day , at the end of the eleventh hour , they might by striving disinterestedly to put their house in order instead of trusting to blind chance and " the working of economic law , " preserve for a while their special privileges and possibly regain some of their prestige . But they must show a different comprehension of the situation that has overtaken them from that of their great advocate in Washington : they must realize how narrow the margin of their safety has become and mend their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humanity is long-suffering . A poor system can be worked indefinitely if it inspires confidence , security ; that is , if the majority trusts the minority which runs it . Few ' , human beings like violent changes and the risks of chaos . But with water in a boiler over a hot fire there comes a point beyond which it is unsafe to sit on the safety valve . Human society obeys natural laws as well as chemical elements . III Finally , how about ourselves , each one of us , little Everyman and Everywoman ? We too have believed that we could live handsomely without much hard work , could become rich overnight Aladdinlike , get by with dishonest shoddy substitutes for thinking . We could n't . It never can be done for long . Are we quite ready to deflate ourselves , to admit that all of us along with our richer neighbors have been on a prolonged , delirious , and vulgar spree , during which we have talked a lot of drunken nonsense and committed more follies than we now like to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about individual fulfillment , individual freedom , " the right to live our own lives , " lives which were fast becoming mean/ ingless . We were so deafened by the roar of what was going on around us that we never looked within to see if all was well there . The Litany is a fine piece of human psychology as well as of literature . It is time to repeat once more its great refrain : " Have mercy upon us , miserable sinners ! " How different from our attitude was that of the old Greeks in the presence of disaster ! The evil that befalls man , the Greeks felt , must be caused by some offense against the gods , some neglect or unwitting wrong committed , which must be discovered and set right , ample amends having been made , repentance and due sacrifice , before the deadly plague or other calamity would vanish . Purification was essential self-purification and social purification . Compare such a direct method with our pretentious " reconstruction " measures ( feeding more poison in the shape of " credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with passages from the Congressional record , denouncing and excoriating somebody else , or with either the Republican or the Democratic platform , promising the impossible ! In ultimate analysis every economic phenomenon is a manifestation of human conduct ; and economic problems can not be resolved until the human factors underlying them are properly adjusted , disagreeable as the process may be . Our depression may be " mainly psychological " ? hysterical ? if you like . Most things that affect human beings individually or in mass are " psychological . " We are so made . But this fact does not imply that all we have to do to become comfortable and happy is to change our psychology from depression to boom . We must first correct the wrong thinking that caused both boom and depression , which is not easy . Hard times are but one unpleasant symptom of internal maladjustments . No doubt man is what he thinks and ? more important ? becomes what he thinks . So the sooner we put off the Pollyanna habit of mind and cease hunting panaceas , searching our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner shall we be prepared for the new ? and let us hope ? saner world . So I say let us talk only about unpleasant things until we understand them and their cause , which is ourselves . Let us examine one by one all the bugaboos and the hollow pretenses and the ugly facts in due order . Let us eat and sleep with misfortune until we have lost all fear of it ! By so doing , for one thing , we shall discount our own personal losses . For any situation calmly faced and accepted becomes automatically less intolerable . I am filled with admiration for the many families in my acquaintance that are already quietly accepting a cut of fifty or more per cent in their incomes , which means in modern terms a drastic transfer of class . They have forgotten their illusions about what they never really possessed . Therefore , they are already far on the way to the future with little encumbering baggage . Indeed the courage and the good humor , the decency and the generosity displayed by all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savagely into their private ambitions suggests that humanity may not be so inextricably tied to the profit motive as we have been led to believe ; that more modest returns for individual efforts would be cheerfully accepted provided there were greater equality and sense of security , of the ground being solid beneath . The majority of reasonable human beings neither expect nor desire to ascend once more into cuckoocloudland as our politicians so fondly promise . Gamblers and other deluded optimists may endeavor to stage a premature " recovery " in the security  |p603  markets , buying back at rising prices what they frantically threw away a few months before . But a too swift return to prosperity ( of the 1929 variety ) would be in fact a disaster even were it likely to happen . Instead of a program of " reflation , " what we need is to consolidate the gains we have made in the bitter school of adversity so that we may prepare the way for a society in which there is neither boom nor depression . Let us grip this unpleasant and unstable present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed from it all its venom , knowing that the unpleasantness comes mostly from our own inharmonious egos . Our secret hopes and fears and prejudices and lusts and weaknesses are hurt by an open recognition of the truth . Not life itself , which remains enjoyable and adventurous .  |p604
