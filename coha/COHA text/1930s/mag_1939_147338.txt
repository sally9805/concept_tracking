Twenty-two years ago , while the U. S. was trying to win World War I , the Du Ponts set a young engineer , Francis Breese Davis Jr. , to building the world 's No. 1 guncotton plant at Hopewell , Va . Eleven years ago the Du Ponts acquired control of the sick U. S. Rubber Co. , the following year put dependable Organizer Davis in to explode a case of profit-making dynamite under it . Davis quickly found out where to plant the charge . Mass production methods had not been perfected in the $900,000,000 rubber industry . As he said afterwards , " U. S. was making tires like they made the pyramids " - by hand . <P> The rubber industry in 1939 is no longer in the age of Cheops . It is quite ready to mass-produce upwards of 65,000,000 tires a year , if and when full production comes back . Its complaint is that while it is set up to serve an expanding economy , the public is now buying at the rate of about 50,000,000 tires a year . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at little enough profit to the hard-bargaining auto companies , and 17,188,000 tires at a better markup to the public . Last week its big producers were able to report quite satisfactory profits. * <P> Measure of the technological progress of U. S. rubber engineering is the difference between a 1926 ( 4.40 by 21 ) tire and a 1938 ( 6.00 by 16 ) tire : model 1926 sold for $24 , ran an average of about 14,000 miles , costing the average U. S. car owner 1.69 mills a mile ; model 1938 sold for $19 , ran an average of almost 27,000 miles , cost the average U. S. car owner only .73 mills a mile . The auto industry has not stood still , but it has not any better record . <P> U. S. Rubber , in 1938 's first half , reported sales of $67,829,786 , a loss of $239,213 . This year , its sales were up 30% and its profits were $4,465,397 . Only $5,208,728 is needed to cover a full year 's dividend ( $8 ) on the company 's 651,091 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $109 , yielding 7.3% to income-minded buyers who counted on holding it on the possibility that Mr. Davis will offer them a trade-in for U. S. Rubber 's common . The common last week sold at $43 , up 466% from 1935 's low , versus a 42% gain on the Dow-Jones Industrial average . <P> Not only technological house cleaning has put U. S. Rubber in the black at this low rate of operations . Engineer Davis has swung a sharp hatchet cutting Rubber 's debt from $101,572,400 to $42,144,000 , its yearly interest bill from almost $6,000,000 to well under $2,000,000 . Last May he got three insurance companies who own its debt to accept an interest cut from 4% to 3 ? % just as though he were hiring the money at the market . <P> About $21,000,000 of U. S. Rubber 's $168,103,594 of assets is invested in East Indian rubber plantations , which assures the company of 20% of its raw material ( so long as the Japanese do not grab or blockade the East Indies ) , partial protection against inventory losses if rubber slumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
