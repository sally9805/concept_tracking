On behalf of the committee ' n charge Mahatma GANDHI announces a firm resolve to begin the non-violence campaign . The Government has repeatedly warned that every legal means will be used to crush civil disobedience if started . The moves on the Nationalist side are complicated and may well con. tinue so as time runs on toward an event in itself of no exceptional dramatic na. ture , which must yet count . This is next year 's decennial census , by which on ( may gauge the progress registered 1 : ) , the Indian people under another decade of British rule . The author of the annual official report on India submitted to Parliament complains in the latest volume , " India in 1927-28 , " . of the extreme poverty of statistical data about general economic conditions . He finds himself in the position of trying to make bricks without straw . Has the standard of living been going up , as the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically assert ? One must go back , for a statistical answer , to a few meager computations made as long ago as 1922 with regard to national income in a few scattered regions . For 40 million-odd persons in the Madras Presidency the calculation showed an annual per capita income of 100 rupees , about $43 at the rate of exchange that year . A family of five would thus have a weekly income of about $4 . The same rate was indicated in Bombay and the Punjab . Yet this minute wage represented a change for the better during the ten years ending 1922 . Wages had doubled , while prices went up slightly more than 50 per cent . Workers in the cotton mills in 1922 showed a range of family income from $15 to $30 per month , dock workers earned from $13 to $20 per month .

In 1872 there were 5,300 miles of railroad in India , and in 1928 nearly 40,000 miles .

In 1921 , out of 319,000,000 persons only 33,000,000 lived in communities of more than 5,000 inhabitants . From other sources we learn that out of every 1,000 males over the age of 5 there were 112 literates in 1901 , 122 in 1911 , 139 in 1921 . During the same period the number of literate females per 1,000 had risen from 8 to 21 . It will be of interest to see next year what the growth has been in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
