TRIBUTE FOR HARRIETTE-Angela Thirkell-Random House ( $2.50 ) . <P> In the early years of the 19th Century , when England was ruled by the fat and foolish Prince of Wales , when Beau Brummell set the fashions , when Byron was revelling in the popular success of Childe Harold , a sprightly young lady named Harriette Dubochet , who had run away from home to become a prostitute , was at the height of her career . Very small with brown hair and large eyes , the daughter of a well-to-do stocking-mender , her life as a courtesan was not sufficiently distinguished to win her a place in history . She exercised no political influence , such as her contemporary Emma Hart , Lady Hamilton , enjoyed through her hold on Lord Nelson . She never even inspired deep affection in her lovers . But as Harriette Wilson she traveled with the big names of a bad age , and her observation thereof has clinched for her the dubious honor of being the most articulate British prostitute . <P> Late in life Harriette wrote her Memoirs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in long and lurid detail , she thoughtfully gave each the opportunity to be omitted from the volumes , or to be described in a very good light , in return for a cash payment . Harriette , even when her professional career was in full flower , had wanted to be a writer . But the highbrow novels and plays she turned out were affected , pompous , unreadable . When she slapped out the 250,000 words of her Memoirs for a despicable purpose , writing about the life she knew best in language that was appropriate to it , she revealed a genuine literary ability , a keen sense of character , a sharp eye for the stupidities of the gentlemen who had been her friends and customers . <P> When Harriette left her father she ran off with young Lord Craven to Brighton . A dull , contented young man , Craven was interested only in his experiments with cocoa trees and with his military instructions , constantly expounded both to amuse his young mistress . " It was , in fact , " she recalled later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craven , although she often thought of it . " How , indeed , could I do otherwise , when the Honorable Frederick Lamb was my constant visitor , and talked to me of nothing else ? " The Honorable Frederick was Craven 's closest friend . " I firmly believe , " Harriette wrote , " that Frederick Lamb sincerely loved me , and deeply regretted that he had no fortune to invite me to share with him . "
