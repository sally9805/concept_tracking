At Manila last week a skeptical people looked independence in the face as their Commonwealth 's new unicameral National Assembly met for the first time . The visible features of their new liberty in-eluded : 1 ) a school system almost broken down by lack of funds ; 2 ) a sickly economic situation due to get worse as Philippine markets are lost behind the rising U. S. tariff wall ; 3 ) the necessity to provide for self-defense , by universal military service , a trained reserve of 400,000 men ; 4 ) a virtually empty treasury . Lest the National Assembly 's opening be saddened , its political lord and master , President Manuel Quezon , spoke of these matters in relatively euphemistic terms , although he had to ask for lower income tax exemptions , higher surtaxes , school taxes , taxes on corporate profits , inheritances , luxuries , amusements , mines , transportation , land . <P> Grave anxiety in the Philippine Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was a matter Don Manuel did not mention . Nine days prior , from Jolo in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamalul Kiram II , Sultan of Sulu and North Borneo , Judge of Agama , lineal descendant of the Prophet , had ascended to enjoy the limitless quantities of gold , jewels , silks , dates , rice , spitted lamb and beautiful women which await the Faithful in the Mohammedan Paradise . The Sultan , who for some years was the only sovereign reigning under the U. S. flag , lived on the tribute of his 500,000 Moro subjects , plus his pension from the Philippine Government , plus his land rent from British North Borneo Co . With this wealth the Sultan kept a primitive court where he enjoyed the favors of scores of wives in his youth , several in his old age , although he begot no offspring . Three nieces , however , he adopted as his daughters . No sooner had he died than one of them , Princess Dayang Dayang , * began to quarrel with Hadji Butu , the late Sultan 's grand vizier , over who was to succeed Kiram II .

Meantime , datus ( princes ) of the Sulu islands had been advised by Grand Vizier Hadji Butu , ablest and best educated of the Moro patriarchs , to enthrone Datu Rajamuda , only surviving brother of the late Sultan . <P> On the same day that the National Assembly met in Manila the datus assembled at Jolo , determined to make Rajamuda Sultan . Again the wilful Princess got the best of Hadji Butu . She informed the visiting princes that according to tradition a Sultan of Sulu could not be chosen except by unanimous vote . Therefore they must wait until every datu from the farthest Moro island had arrived . The followers of Rajamuda called her by the names of she-animals . They declared she planned to make herself Sultana or-almost as unforgivable an insult to a warrior race-get the job for her husband , Datu Umbra , or her father-in-law . Datu Amil-bangsa .
