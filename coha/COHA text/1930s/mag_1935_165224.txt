When jumping-jackish little Mayor LaGuardia popped a scheme to put New York City into the power business last month , there were three loud repercussions . President Roosevelt invested a local rate wrangle with national significance by egging the Mayor on with promises of PWA cash . Consolidated Gas Co. promptly halved its dividend to $1 . And Chairman Floyd Leslie Carlisle of Consolidated evidenced a pronounced change of heart toward the city and its citizens . <P> A cut in the Consolidated dividend was merely an act of prudence , for the great company 's tax bill for 1935 in New York City promised to amount to 22 of each dollar of revenue as against 18 last year , 11 in 1929 . But Mr. Carlisle 's new attitude was something that could never have been predicted . It was another major victory for what has now become a prime New Deal utility **30;13025;TOOLONG . <P> Offering to postpone action for higher rates designed to offset soaring taxes , Mr. Carlisle proposed that the electrical subsidiaries of Consolidated Gas adopt the so-called Washington Plan for progressive rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> If for no other reason than the fact that for a decade it has not once aroused the wrath of congressmen it serves , Potomac Electric Power Co. deserves the handsome compliment lately paid it by the New York State Power Authority . That body called it " an outstanding case of successful private operation of a public utility . " Before it subscribed to the Washington Plan in 1924 , Potomac Electric was a constant thorn in the side of Congressional utility baiters , who very nearly succeeded in passing a bill to dam the Potomac River above Washington and sell public power to public servants . They even gained the support of the Washington Chamber of Commerce and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover . <P> After the Senate passed the measure without a dissenting vote and sent it to the House , Potomac Electric suddenly came to terms with the District of Columbia 's public utilities commission . All rate and valuation litigation which had clogged the courts for years was dismissed and a consent decree was entered embodying the Washington Plan . Under that plan the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company was entitled to a return of 7% ; any profits above that figure were to be divided 50-50 between the company and Washingtonians in the form of rate reductions . <P> This simple formula for peace on the Potomac was devised by no long-headed powerman but an Army engineer serving as assistant to the District of Columbia 's Engineering Commissioner . Head of his class ( 1911 ) at West Point , Major William E. R. Covell based his plan on somewhat similar experiments in sliding-scale returns made as far back as 1876 by Britain 's London Gas Light &; Coke Co . <P> Before Major Covell 's idea was adopted the maximum domestic rate in Washington was 10 per k. w. h . Reduced every year since , the maximum rate is now 3.9-lowest in any U. S. city of 100,000 population or more . Potomac Electric 's return has averaged 10%.
