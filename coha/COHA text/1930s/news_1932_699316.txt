txt Democratic House leaders took up today a proposal that new taxation be avoided by the lame-duck session , except for the proposed tax on beer , and coupled with the proposal one that sweeping powers be granted to the incoming President to eliminate and combine government departments and commissions . News that the combination proposal was being considered became known at the same time that Republican leaders indicated President Hoover would recommend some sort of general sales tax as well as the $700,000.000 economies already projected . The Democratic plan envisaged a grant of such blanket powers to President-elect Roosevelt that he would be able , with revenue from beer and the economies to be effected by reorganization , to balance the budget in the fiscal year 1934 . Governor Roosevelt is understood to have intimated to House leaders on his recent visit here that such a course would meet his wishes in the matter of taxation , and the present discussions are a result of that inti-1 mation . Republican members , on the other hand , are skeptical of the possibility of making great savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' benefits and interest on the public debt , both obligations directly traceable to the war , Federal expenditures are principally made in relief of the States , such as road funds , agricultural development and kindred activities . Even should the Federal Government discontinue these functions , they would have to be assumed by the States , it was explained . so that the tax burden on the individual citizen might be shifted , but not lessened . Among those who felt that additional taxation would have to be voted at this session opinion on the possibility of passing a manufacturers ' . sales tax was divided . Representative Collier of Mississippi , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , expressed his opposition to such a tax , as did Representative Rankin of Mississippi and Representative La Gua.dia. of New York . Sales-tax advocates , including Representative Vinson of Kentucky , a member of the Ways and Means Committee ; Representative Rainey of Illinois , Democratic floor leader , and Representative Hawley of Oregon . regarded it as the only possible new source of revenue , if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt of the President 's budget message most members of the House prefer to hope that additional taxes will be unnecessary . Senate Republican leaders , en the other hand , especially those directly charged with revenue matters , are viewing with great concern the budget situation . With a deficit at the end of November in excess of $750,000,000 and a possible deficit for the fiscal year of $1,500,000,000 , they are of the opinion that new taxation by this session will be imperative , and some of them are understood to have been told by the President that he will recommend a sales tax as the easiest and most equitable way out . Reports that he will propose a sales tax have not indicated whether it would be a manufacturers ' excise tax or a consumers ' tax . Smoot for Consumers ' Tax . In this connection it was recalled that in the last session Mr. Hoover suggested a manufacturers ' sales tax of 21/4 per cent , but this was rejected by the House , following strenuous opposition from manufacturers and organized labor . It was estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new revenue , but , due to the subsequent decline in business revenues , the general belief is that the rate would have to be raised to 21/2 per cent to raise that much money . The dominant opinion among Republican leaders is that a consumers ' sales tax of 1 per cent would be most acceptable and would meet the present emergency better than a manufacturers ' sales tax . This view is held by Senator Smoot , chairman of the Finance Committee , and Representative Snell of New York , Republican House leader . Senator Watson , on the other hand , advocated a manufacturers ' excise . He said economies would reach $700 , - 000,000 . Democratic House members who have studied the current Treasury Department comparative analysis of receipts and expenditures , which includes the close of business on Nov. 30 , pointed out that the excess of expenditures over receipts for the first five months of the present fiscal year amounted to $751,311,422 . At this rate the twelve months ending June 30 , 1933 , would produce a deficit of $1,800,000,000 , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues from the income tax , of which instalments will be payable on March 15 and June 15 of next year , they estimated the year 's probable deficit at $1,500,000,000 . In striving to avoid extra taxation at this session , they rely on the understanding that the President 's budget message will contain reductions of appropriations amounting to $700,000,000 . Another $300,000,000 , it is thought , can be saved from actual budget inclusion by adopting Governor Roosevelt 's suggestion of financing public works by separate bond issues , to be repaid out of a special sinking fund on an amortization basis . Of the remaining $500,000,000 of anticipated gap between the black and red figures , a certain amount is expected to be provided by beer taxes . Estimates on the yield of this tax vary widely . An average of the estimates would place the yield at $100 , - 000,000 during the fiscal year 1934 . Yields from existing " nuisance " taxes , which have been disappointing so far , are expected by some members to improve with more experience in administration . Some members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further $100 , - 000,000 .

He said he was not inclined to disturb any of the existing taxes unless they could be clearly proved disadvantageous to economic recovery and re-employment . " I fail to see how we can raise any of the existing taxes , " Mr. Hawley said . " The most promising source of new revenue which I see is a manufacturers ' sales tax . " Mr. Vinson and Representative Ragon of Alabama predicted an increase of the stock transfer tax from its present level of 4 cents a share to one-fourth of 1 per cent would be again adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Means subcommittee which brought about the adoption of this measure by the House at its last session . Estimated on figures supplied by the New York Stock Exchange , a tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent should yield $88,000,000 , according to committee findings last Spring . Charges that the Treasury Department is administering the " nuisance " taxes and the income tax in such a way as to make the adoption of a sales tax inevitable were made today by Representative La Guardia . He maintatned that the Treasury Department rulings have been intended to make these taxes distasteful to the public in order to bring Congress into line with its own policy . The budget message which President Hoover has completed , it was said today in Congressional circles , includes the most far-reaching reductions and proposes many eliminations of unnecessary 4ureaus and commissions .
