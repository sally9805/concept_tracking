In the 1890s reporter Ralph Delahaye Paine , famed young Yale rowing man breaking into journalism on the Philadelphia Press , was inspired to perpetrate a monumental hoax . With rich detail he told readers about one Pierre Grantaire who made a good living by raising and selling spiders for the spurious cobwebbing of wine bottles . After visiting the " spider farm " on Lancaster Pike outside Philadelphia , Reporter Paine said that 4,000 spiders of the species Nephila plumipes ( who spun the " finest webs " ) were busy working for M. Grantaire , that he shipped them to customers in " little paper boxes , so many dozen in each crate . " that the Queen spider was named " Sara Bernhardt , " that her consort , fearsome " Emile Zola , " was a specimen of the famed " bird-hunting spiders of Surinam . " When M. Grantaire tapped on one of her filaments , Reporter Paine 's straight-faced account continued , " Sara " ran up his finger for a fly , after which " the startling pet tripped back indoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reporter Paine was further tickled when letters from hopeful investors asking M. Grantaire 's address began to flood the Press office . Soon Mr. Paine grew accustomed to seeing his fabulous tale reprinted in unsophisticated journals under the heading " Scientific Notes " or " Nuggets of Fact . " Back from the Spanish-American War and the Boxer Uprising , working on the New York Herald , Spiderman Paine had the fabrication brought to his attention again in 1902 when a plagiarist tried to sell it to him for publication in the Herald . Soon thereafter , Reporter Paine gave up newspaper work for fiction and became a successful author of novels , historical studies and stories for boys . <P> Though Mr. Paine forgot about it . the spider story continued to turn up here &; there . Last year , the monthly Mechanics &; Handicraft featured the story in its July number under the title " Webs for Sale . " This time Pierre Grantaire was back in his native France , operating from a " little village in the department of the Loire . " <P> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in highly respectable surroundings , when readers of the June Atlantic Monthly spied the yarn as the leading article in the " Contributors ' Club " department . The anonymous Atlantic contributor , borrowing many a phrase from the 40-year-old original , credited the spider farm to " my grandfather . " Like all effective hoaxes , the spider story survived its creator . Ralph D. Paine died in 1925 . His son and namesake is Business Editor of TIME .
