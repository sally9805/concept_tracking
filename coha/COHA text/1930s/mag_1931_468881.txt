THERE has come over me a psychological change familiar to me for many years . I shall not want to take a drink again for weeks , maybe months , possibly years . This happens to me every little while , when I have been drinking . I do not consciously say , " Now I am going to stop drinking . " I have never said in my fife , " Now I will go on the water wagon . " Instead , the water wagon has come to me , rolled up , as it were , in front of the door . The driver : has touched his hat and said , " We have come for you , madam . Your taste for liquor has gone . " This swearing off which comes with such definiteness , apparently so outside myself , is due to a resolution made up in my unconscious mind . It is due to a thousand disgusts , to the defeats which come from having had , too often , more drinks than I should . It is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really worked ; when drink of the night before has slowed up all my processes so that , though I have sat in my office all day and gone through all the motions of a busy woman , I have been only apparently there . I am a moderate drinker . Were I a man I should be considered a model : I drink less than those about me . I do not drink every day and all the time . I have but once in my life had a pickme-up in the morning . It never occurs to me to drink alone . There have been times when I did not even keep drink in the house . I drink very muchless than most of the younger women I know nowadays . Moreover , I am for the most part a timid if persistent drinker . I am seldom gay and relaxed , for I watch myself too much to see what the next drink is going to do to me , unless I am among trusted friends , seasoned drinkers like myself . I am jealous of my dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windmill or relax the usual inhibitions which hedge about a woman of my generation . Why , then , those moral revolts of the water wagon ? Why does my unconscious self pop up and take me by the shoulder and insist on absolute sobriety ? To drink not habitually , to drink only with friends at a party , to keep a watch and ward over your conduct ? that is temperance for you , you would say . This is the outward story , the story I mostly tell myself , the story I tell my friends . The real story is something else , and in telling it I am persuaded that I am telling the story of the average moderate drinker . The story of the moderate drinker is briefly this : there are almost no moderate drinkers . Not in this country , not now , not any more . Moreover , the so-called moderate drinker is not consistently moderate . At any moment he may drink to drunkenness . There have been the truly temperate , those who drank a glass or two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . My father was such a one . Nightly he drank his glass of beer . If we were abroad and sat listening to music in Germany or watching a crowd from a French cafe he drank two glasses . The point is that my father did n't drink for the effect that liquor would have upon him . He used drink as a food . He had paid none of the prices which there are to pay for the pleasure drink brings with it . For drinking has to do with feeling different . If you do nut drink for a kick , a punch , sensation you do not really drink . In rather a pusillanimous and mid-Victorian way I often drink as much as I can without appearing too tight . I drink for change , liberation , let-down , and forgetfulness ? as well as for talk and companionship . Let me trace the last few days which preceded the water wagon 's backing up to my door . On a certain evening I did not want to drink . But I was in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took two drinks , and a delicious relaxation flowed over me ; a let-down from the fatigue of the clay , a softening of harsh contours , a mellowing of life but , more than anything , a harmonizing of existence . With my two drinks I reached an admirable stage of equilibrium . My fatigue was melted , the jangle of New York 's roar was stilled . Here was the moment for stopping . But does the moderate drinker often stop there in these days ? I indeed have seldom seen him do so . I went on to dinner where there were cocktails , two rounds , served in cocktail glasses instead of beakers , as young people often serve cocktails ; and a thimbleful of good cognac with the coffee . A sober party . So far so good , but after dinner I went on to another party to which , I may add , I should not have gone except for my first two drinks . I went to this third party precisely because my drinks had " died on me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves , my first lovely adjustment tolife , well knowing , of course , that this would not happen . The party was in the home of young friends of whom I am very fond . It was a large party . There was no cohesion to the various groups . It was a party with too many men and not enough women . In my early and soberer moments it seemed to me I had never seen in one room so many worthy and dull young men all at once . Now see what alchemy has drink . I arrived at eleven . At three I was still there , still drinking , and we had managed , thanks to the common denominator of drink , to have a very pleasant , even gay evening . We had , these dull young men and myself , laughed extensively . No one was tight . No one was unseemly . No one was anywhere near the verge of that increasingly frequent phenomenon known as " passing out " which has happened sometime or other to most " moderate drinkers " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , passed a tolerable evening . We had found points of contact and something to say to one another when , had we been cold sober , we should no doubt have been as mute as eggs . Something at once kind and a little exciting had been evolved from unlikely elements . H How much of a price did we pay next day for a not very good party ? How many kinds of hangovers are there ? How much do you have to drink to get " jitters , " and how many days in the year does the moderate drinker bump along on one cylinder ? I know my hostess called me up to say she had the jitters and herhushand an awful hangover . I know that a number of the worthy , dull young men had been doing a hard shot of speakeasy drinking before they came . I know that I awoke with that stuffy feeling which late smoking and repeated highballs give me . I went to the office feeling agreeable , smooth , and totally unfit for work . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a nut to crack , something that would take hours of concentrated work . I knew , too , that I was going to be completely unable to do it ; that my abused mind would reject nut-cracking of any kind ; that it was weak as a rag , limp as a bit of seaweed swinging in the tide . My well-groomed appearance was a camouflage , my competent air a lie . Within me was a person unable to function ; for what I wanted to do was to relax , to stretch , and especially to talk with friends . But plunging my mind into work was an impossibility . I went through my mail , called my stenographer , asked for my papers , and then sat turning them over and over , striving to get my mind to take hold . In vain , it slid away with that peculiar slipping , side-stepping motion of the reluctant brain . After sitting in contemplation , presenting all the outward signs of a busy woman , slowly , reluctantly , I forced my drugged brain to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were lifting an unbearable burden . A weariness as vast and the fatigue of alcohol are very closely akin . I have experienced more hangovers caused by sleepless nights spent over sick beds than by sleepless nights spent in drinking . As I had done so often before , I sat cursing myself for a fool . Why had I drunk so much ? Why had I spoiled my work ? What , now that it was over , had I got out of it ? Why ? ? the innumerable questions of the hangover . I felt better for a while after lunch , but after three o'clock the real hangover shut down on me . The cure , of course , would be another drink , as the cure for fatigue is a drink . But I never drinkin the middle of a working day . I seldom let myself take a cocktail before dinner for the express purpose of a pickme-up . My Puritan conscience prefers to let me suffer from incompetence and fatigue , but especially to suffer from a feeling of unreality , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though I were only a front with nothing behind it . As I sat there I wondered how many people were making believe they were working but really feeling wretched and inadequate , beset by the miserable feeling of unreality and insecurity . have known days in the country when , if I were able to lie on the beach in the warm sun , my hangover would be delicious and relaxing , but when to write a letter would be agony , and to drive a car , torment . Immediately after I have been drinking I am a very sure driver . I seem to become more instinctive and to drive by muscular memory as do those who learn young . But how painful is driving the next day ! How offensive is activity of any sort ! Anything , indeed , involving decision or judgment becomes impossible , anything involving anything but ? talk . I see men I know , moderate drinkers , who are purple as plums . No one has ever said of them , Tom or Dick or Harry is headed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to stop . They drink as I do , only oftener and more at a time . Do they really fool themselves into thinking drink does n't hurt them ? Do they , like myself , sit at their desks going through the motions of working ? Or do they say as I so often have , " I never drink enough to hurt my next day 's work " ? What constitutes hurting my next day 's work ? Force of character , that peculiar quality which constitutes authority , goes first , choice next . Put me in a store and ask me to choose a hat after one of my modest sprees , and I am helpless . Stilt less can I decide on a course of conduct . All letters involving choice or decision must wait , as must any prolonged act of thought , concentration , or invention . What remains is a sham . On the other hand , I can talk . I am never more persuasive . I can sell an idea . I have had days after drinking when I seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where no ideas were , they now flow through . For let us give the devil his due ? there are times when drink stirs me up , rouses my spirit from its fog , opens the door on thought , throws a window up on a far horizon . It happens , but it happens seldom . What has happened , however , over and again is that an evening 's moderate drinking has slowed my tempo , made me uncertain , lost me my impetus , and made it necessary to begin again , cranking myself up to that painful point of effort which a new piece of work requires . All effort is bad at such times , but especially creative effort or physical effort . Driving a car , I repeat , is an agony . The swift , automatic response between eye and brain , how frightful it becomes ; the need for sudden and precise action , the constant vigilance of judgment . Pain at last grips me in its paralysis , cold shivers of nervousness run up my spine , whereas , could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five o'clock would have passed in a dim , relaxed pleasure . Now if this happens when I have been drinking " moderately , " what happens when I have been still more moderate ? When I have no such definite hesitations and inertias ? No such pathological fatigues ? Then I suppose ? no , I do not suppose , I know ? that still my work is crippled . I work . I get through the day , but I am lame and halt . At the end of the day exhaustion has conquered me , and gratefully I drink the cocktail I must have if I am to contemplate going out in theevening . Although only mildly , alcoholic fatigue has lessened my ability to do and to be and to live . We have lately evolved a new measure for the unscathed drinker , the moderate . It is the ability to be down at one 's work next day with a bright eye . A theory has crept even into our household fiction that drink does not harm one if one can appear fresh in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man contemplates his wife giving breakfast to her little ones . How crisp she looks , how shining , " no matter how late she has been up or how much she has drunk . " My belief is that few and far between are the people who next day do not feel their drinking , over whom alcoholic fatigue does not come like a dim fog ; who keep intact those higher assets of humanity , creation , judgment , decision ; whose nerves at some time in the day are not racked with the need of a drink . The moderate drinker 's thesis is that he does not show his drink in any untoward social action , that he feels his drink in only a little pleasant relaxation , and that next day he suffers no ill effects . ( Of course many who consider themselves moderate drinkers get frankly tight from time to time and frankly admit it . ) My contention is that there is nothing about which people are more deceived than how they act when they drink ; and that there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking . I know , for I have done all these things . In a lifetime of drinking I have known perhaps two or three persons whose personalities did not change after a given number of drinks . Take it all in all , men can drink more than women , but there exists the occasional woman who can drink all the men under the table , who at the end of a drinking bout remains well preserved , bright of eye , witty , unquarrelsome . She is rare , and even she sometimes falls from grace . Drink causes strange psychological changes which the drinker does not remember . A friend of mine whom I will call Roberta came to dinner with me . My husband had heard of her but had not met her . I invited another old friend to meet her . She is a woman of education , beauty , and an extraordinary smartness of appearance . She arrived as immaculate , as fresh as I had ever seen her . I had seen Roberta drink everyone under the table and preserve what seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illusion she was straying ? Suddenly Roberta remarked , " Do you know Elizabeth is going to marry old Henry ? " Henry is a relative of Roberta 's , a very dull cousin The men had never heard of Henry . " Yes , " said Roberta , " old Henry 's going to be married at last ? to Elizabeth . " In two moments more she said , " Did I tell you what I just heard ? Old Henry 's going to marry Elizabeth . " Throughout that dreary meal my old friend continued to sing the changes on that one dull piece of information . Henry and Elizabeth were going to get married . She was insulated within her alcoholic aquarium . She showed no other effects of having drunk . You could not have " told it on her " but for her dull parrotlike reiteration . Yet how many people do this to a greater or less degree and are unconscious of it ? men and women who think they are not tight because their legs are not wobbling or their tongues stuttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day is euphemistically known as " a number of drinks " that you are not sober , that queer changes are taking place within you . I have another acquaintance who when she is drunk becomes quarrelsome and a nuisance . She is a finelooking , strong woman , usually charming to meet . Her censor does not allow a sign of drunkenness to appear ; her eyes and speech are clear , but she becomes overbearing , arrogant , and finally sullen . I have another friend who grows suspicious of everybody ; a conviction of the loneliness of the human spirit envelops her , an engulfing W eltschmerz . She knows her children do not care for her and want only her money . None of these three women shows any of the ordinary symptoms of drunkenness . Only after a long time have I been able to relate the lamentable changes which take place in them to drink . I know that lamentable changes take place also in me of which 1 am unconscious : that , without being " plastered , " I become repetitious and tiresome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I do . It is these minor changes ? the strange obliqueness of the semi-drunken vision ? which it would he interesting to know more about . The quarrels which occur between friends but especially between husband and wife when no one admits to being tight . For it is interesting to observe that , while people will sometimes admit to having been uproariously tight , they still lie to themselves perpetually about the lesser stages ? the psychological variations from the normal of the moderate drinker who protests , even when you can see he is already a victim of high blood-pressure , that moderate drinking does not hurt anyone . Let inc go back to the events which brought the water wagon up to my door . One evening I met a friend , just returned from Europe , whom I had not seen for a long time . We had an hour before we were both due home for dinner . It was late for tea and we were in a district where speakeasies abound and tea rooms are practically nonexistent . Neither of us felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had been drinking companions , and soon we took a second and a third drink . We asked each other if we had time for a fourth . By that time we decided to telephone our homes . We ordered a light dinner and drank all the evening together . It was a splendid evening , for one of the interesting things about drinking among women is the increasing pleasure which they have in drinking together . You may find them in twos and threes and in crowds , in town and in country houses , having a fine time drinking , getting free of inhibitions , getting to know one another . This is not something unknown before to-day . It is only more usual among more kinds of women . In my early drinking days I knew a number of women who enjoyed drinking together . With women drinking as generally as they do to-day , they drink together much more often , as men do . What I have done for a generation , more or less as an exception , has now become not unusual in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , take one or two drinks , and begin to discuss all sorts of questions . They become confidential about their troubles . They talk with freedom about their husbands and sweethearts . From time to time one will exclaim , " How late is it ? I was expected home ! " and go to the telephone with excuses which might be plausible were they not so old . My evening 's drinking with my friend , unexpected and delightful , left fatigue behind it . Soon came other evenings when there were only two courses . One was complete sobriety ( for one can always mutter something about one 's doctor and one 's liver , and be let off drinking ) ; the other was to drink . I continued drinking , facing a varying but cumulative fatigue , until within me a revolt took place , and the water wagon arrived to claim me . This battle fought out in my unconscious mind was the result of who knows how many defeats . Days had been given up on account of that peculiarly senseless drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate spiritual equilibrium , to be paid for next day by functioning in the void . I have on such occasions found myself lying to myself , declaring that I had no hangover because I had no headache , declaring how much good a little drink did me when I knew that my feeling of smooth emptiness would be succeeded by shrieking nerves at about five in the afternoon . This apparently sudden arrival of the water wagon was the result of weeks of conflict . For I have known weeks when life was a struggle between work and drink . How was I to carry on a social life and not drink enough to hurt my work ? I should be too tired for social life without drink . A great many people are in New York . Yet my social life is part of my business life . From my present standpoint I review my days of drinking . It took me years to know what drinking really meant . For drink was never a forbidden thing for me , and I must have inherited a good head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need drink . It was only after life had pressed down on me , after I had married and suddenly had to as.surne the responsibility of the support of brothers and sisters , that I first discovered that a cocktail could brace me up and kill fatigue . Still later I found out how the harsh outline of life could be softened , how dull people found their tongues and shy people came out of their shells . There was a time before prohibition when I drank much more steadily than I have done since then . It was a time for me of fatigue and doubt , when there had been a great deal of illness in the family , and drinking was my only release . It was during that period that the water wagon made its first . peremptory appearance . I repeat , it took years to establish a habit of rushing for a drink as an anodyne in the face of misfortune . If I have drunk mostly for amusement , I have also often " drowned my sorrows " as definitely as any Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grief , responsibility beyond my strength , were my real teachers , though I had learned my first lessons in the softer school of conviviality . There is a legend arising that no one drank anything except wholesomely and sanely before prohibition and that no one ever drank more than one cocktail . I drank more before prohibition than I have since ; though , what with bad liquor , the effects have been more disastrous since . Another legend is that the British can drink without ill effects , that their tolerance for alcohol is greater than ours . Why , then , the numberless pick-me-ups for sale at bars and chemists ' in England ? There , as here , people suffer through days for a moment 's lessening of the burden of responsibility . There , as here , people lie about the harm it has done them . One thing I feel sure of : that greater numbers and more classes of people are drinking to-day in this country than they did before prohibition . Especially among women has drinking increased . Wherever there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /V And here we approach the great social experiment of this country . It concerns ladies who drink . The theory , of course , has always been that ladies do n't drink , or if they drink they never get tight . It is exactly the opposite in my experience . Of course there arethousands of ladies who still drink not at all ; but in my acquaintance it has been precisely the ladies who do drink , precisely the women who from time to time get lit . Most of us can recall the elaborate subterfuges of our men friends before the War to conceal the fact that they were slightly addled . How carefully , and I may state vainly , gentlemen would try by the excessive dignity of their demeanor to deny the fact they had been " indulging . " It was concealed from the children that father had a hangover . " Your father is not well to-day " was the phrase for it . I knew a family which was sunk in penury because the father , a brilliant man , became an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never admitting it , never allowing father to face the fact that they had nothing but the house in which they lived and the money which the women made . Father 's " attacks " finally carried him off . In those days ladies who drank naturally denied as long as they could ? both in speech and in manner ? the fact that they were drunk . Never from their lips fell the words , " How lit I was last night . " Their attitude , like that of the men , has now been reversed . Comparatively few people , men or women , now refuse to admit that they are tight . There is no longer any point in denying it . A young friend of mine said to me , " This drinking like a lady , trying to pretend you are n't tight when you are , is all the bunk ! I used to use up all my energy trying to act as if I had n't had a drink . Then I realised we drank for the sense of change , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place and have a good time . " Indeed she doffs ? for she is a slopper . She likes to lollop round and sprawl and laugh louder and louder . Her face disintegrates , as certain faces do ? for there are people whose faces , when they are drunk , fall apart in the most terrifying way . Yet this disintegration of a personality , this regression to childhood patterns , this uncertain speech and wobbling walk are signs of the demand of a man or woman burdened with responsibility to let go , to shirk being grown up . I belonged always to a set of people to whom drinking was a matter of course . At the parties and lunches to which I went as a young girl there was always plenty to drink . But throughout the country , and particularly in the Middle West , before prohibition there were whole societies made up of nondrinkers . Now there are not so many . From a nation of class drinkers we have become a nation of mass drinkers . And , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the men ? not only ladies , but great numbers of middle-class women . Until our immediate era in America the heroes have wassailed alone . The great drinking bouts of all times were for men only . We hear nothing of three-bottle ladies in the eighteenth century , nor in all literature is there depicted one hard-drinking group of women . One never has seen Celia " passing out . " The wassailing , the carousing , the saloon , the public house belonged by right of tradition to the sterner sex . There were only a few groups in which the women stayed by when the men were intent on a little serious drinking . Only a few forerunners , radicals , said it was fun to drink with a woman they liked . To-day bi-sexual drinking is the rule . Men and women of all classes habitually drink together . Only among the working class does the good old tradition linger that it is the husband 's much grudged privilege to go out and get tight while the wife waits at home in tears or with rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange things to society . It has broken down a number of barriers . In nine parties out of ten I go to everyone is decorous enough . A few people get a little loud . On the other hand there are certain charming but reserved women whom drink improves , who develop unexpected wit and spontaneity after a few drinks . I know some whose mouths lollop and who throw themselves with embarrassing abandon on the gentlemen next to them , but on the other hand I know others who are released from a burden of unbearable convention by a few drinks . I have a friend who contends that the fact that great numbers of women are drinking and , therefore , finding themselves liable to human frailty is bringing a realistic attitude toward woman back to the earth . He contends that the relation between the sexes was falsified by the notion that women were by nature nobler , purer , better than men ; that what is needed on this earth is not neurotic , recording angels , but poised and healthy animals . Gentility , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is still the curse of the twentieth . Anything that will put an end to woman 's gentility is worth any price . Well , my friend 's argument is already being put to the test , for prudish gentility , first cousin to prurience , is being chucked overboard fast enough . A new social order has come in with women drinking . I know women who complain that they drink to relieve what they somewhat euphemistically term their " sex inhibitions . " I have certainly witnessed ladies who became frankly and embarrassingly loose ? and others who became sluttish . I have heard tales of Babylonian orgies here and in London , where everyone changed partners in a disconcertingly public way . Maybe my friend is right , and we need the return of the Saturnalia . Maybe we can not pay too high a price for the death of gentility . But if this is true , we shall have to organize society differently , for the modern home seems singularly ill adapted for what is at present going on in it . If you grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there are few if any moderate drinkers who have not got tight on occasion , and my second , that women get tight in all degrees from charming abandon to sloppy lecherousness , you have to come to some conclusion about what happens to children 's minds when they see their elders a little tight . For in American homes , where there is no privacy , where young people and older people are jumbled up together , the children naturally see their parents and their parents ' friends drinking . They see guests who have passed out . They wake up to hear a group of moderate drinkers coming home to have a sandwich and what is known as a few drinks . How many times have I heard stories of a mildly wild party being interrupted by the children waking up and going to find out what all the row was about . What happens to children who witness the people they look up to and respect becoming a little foolish with drink ? That is not an altogether pleasant thing to contemplate . What generally happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests in a variety of ways . A friend of mine told me indignantly , " When Gladys said , in the tone of voice of the Elsie books , ' Mother , I wish you would n't drink cocktails , ' I said , ' Gladys , I will trouble you to mind your own business and not to criticize what you do not understand . " She was right , for if a lit parent is an unprofitable sight , a sanctimonious infant is still less profitable . But of course what happens is that the children soon stop being embarrassingly censorious . Soon they , too , grasp a glass in their handswith determination . There is one thing certain in all this : there is not a child who can bear the thought of his mother being even the most infinitesimal shade altered by drink , the slightest iota lit . And that is what happens to the vast majority of women if they drink at all . What to do ? that I do n't know . It 's a question so new that society has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking twenty-five years ago , but there were at that time very few growing children who had seen their fathers lit , and practically none who had seen their mothers lit . So in a generation we have changed . The critic on the hearth used to be the average woman , who raised a splendid and awe-inspiring scene if her husband ever on any occasion , even once a year , got tight . The critic is now the youngster ? who looks on his elders ' antics with pained disapproval . I am glad I do not have to answer these questions myself . And I am glad to be released ? for some time at least ? from the nagging problem of when to drink and how much . And how fraying this problem is ! ? this drinking a little too much , hurting one 's work , stopping drinking , being in good company and going on drinking . I know men and women , all moderate drinkers , who fret themselves away with the checks and balances of their drinking . I am glad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problems . I have enjoyed drinking . I enjoy the unexpected friends one makes . I enjoy the release from fatigue , the sudden lifting of responsibility , the rest that a change of rhythm brings . But the price , for me anyway , is too high . This I know : My soberest years have been my happiest . Have I been happy because I was sober ? Or sober because I was happy ? I can not tell you . It is among the psychological questions not yet answered .
