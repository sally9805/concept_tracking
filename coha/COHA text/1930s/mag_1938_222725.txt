The dreams of a great unified , Arab Near Eastern State-so carefully fostered by Great Britain 's warrior-statesmen in 1914-18-were wrecked in the subsequent peace treaties by European " divide- &-rule"; policies . Men like Lawrence of Arabia believed , led the Arabs to believe , that with the defeat of Turkey and the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire one great homogeneous Arab nation of essentially the same race , same religion , same culture , would stretch from the southern borders of the Anatolian plateau to the fantastically shaped rocks of Aden . <P> Colonel Lawrence 's promises were largely forgotten in post-War " realistic " diplomacy and the half-legendary hero-philosopher of the desert revolt retired to write , refused all honors and titles offered by " perfidious Albion , " died in a motorcycle accident three years ago . Instead of one Arab nation , so far there have emerged from the old Ottoman confines five major states : Saudi Arabia , the Yemen , Trans-Jordan , Palestine , Iraq . Lebanon and Syria are soon to come to independent statehood . Of these , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can really call its soul its own . <P> The Sanjak ( province ) of Alexandretta*is in the transition stage . It became technically autonomous last year when it was eased from the control of French mandated Syria . This week , the Sanjak 's 220,000 inhabitants will go to the polls , in an election conducted by the League of Nations , to vote themselves a legislature . The predominant nationality of the legislature will profoundly influence the Sanjak 's destiny . That this destiny was important to its neighbors as well as . the Sanjak , was plain last week . Turkish soldiers were reported concentrating on the northern border and French Foreign Legionnaires enforced martial law in Alexandretta and Antioch . Riots had broken out between tarbooshed , orthodox Moslem Arabs and European-hatted , free-thinking Turks . <P> Nestling in a mountainous region along the Turkish border on the eastern Mediterranean , the 1,500-square-mile district , is a true Levantine melting pot . The Sanjak contains substantial numbers of Turks , Alaouites , Arabs , Armenians , Kurds , Greeks and Circassians . Only two and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Damascus ( see map ) , the Sanjak has one irresistible attraction for Great and Small Powers alike : the landlocked Gulf of Alexandretta , even in its undeveloped state one of the safest , best ports of the Levantine coast . <P> As long as a great European power like France ruled over Syria , President-Dictator Kamal Atatikk ( " Father of the Turks " ) bothered little over his Sanjak children . Two years ago , however , France agreed to relinquish her mandate in 1939 , decided to split Syria into two parts ( Syria and Lebanon ) , left the Sanjak to be governed from Damascus by Syrian " Arabs . For the Father of the Turks , the spectacle of a petty Arab nation , formerly a subject people , ruling over their oldtime Turkish masters was too much . He protested to France and the League . Twice he moved his troops to the border to " protect " his Sanjak children , once he held a military powwow on a border-bound train . Only his cautious prime minister , deaf , stubborn Ismet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
