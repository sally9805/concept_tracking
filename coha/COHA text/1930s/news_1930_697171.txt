" Mr : Berry had sent work to the lead of the Probation Bureau that he had accepted the check and had deposited it to the city 's account in a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I am enclosing my check for $1,077.60 , which I understand from the newspapers is the amount of money my sister received from the city of New York . If this is not the full amount please advise me and I will forward the balance due . " Cooley 's Letter to Judge Collins . Mr. Cooley 's enclosure of his previous letter to Judge Collins , dated last Saturday , reads : Saturday , April 12 , 1930 . Dear Judge Collins : I am complying with your suggestion that I submit a statement in explanation of the article which appeared in The World this morning . In March , 1929 , my sister , Mrs. Marguerite F. Lawler , came to the city of New York accompanied by her 3-year-old child and her mother . She stated to me that she had resigned her position as a teacher in the Buffalo public schools , that she did not intend to resume teaching and that she had determined to live in New York permanently . Prior to this time she had written me repeatedly expressing her dissatisfaction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sister gave up their home , rented their house , placed their furniture in storage and when they came to New York spent a considerable period of time seeking a permanent residence . When they had been here a short time a vacancy occurred in my department as chief clerk , and as I knew Mrs. Lawler 's education and experience qualified her to fill this position and to pass the civil service examination , I recommended her to the judges for appointment . She received a temporary appointment pending the holding of a competitive civil service examination , which she intended to take . A few weeks after her appointment she began to show serious nervous symptoms which made necessary frequent absences from work . These became so bad later that I became convinced that she could not satisfactorily perform her work . I asked her to resign repeatedly , but she refused , saying that she no longer had a position in Buffalo and that she was ill . Finally , after the promulgation of the civil service list on Oct. 27 , 1929 , she was dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysteria had reduced her to an abject nervous condition , she went on sick leave and asked Deputy Chief Probation Officer Coughlin to sign the payroll and forward her pay checks to her in care of her mother . Thereafter , acting upon express authorization , Deputy Chief Probation Officer Coughlin signed the payroll during the period that Mrs. Lawler was absent and forwarded her checks to her in care of her mother at 42 East Eleventh Street , New York City . Says Sister Endorsed Checks . The canceled pay checks of Mrs. Lawler are in the possession of the Controller of the city of New York and bear the authentic endorsement of my sister . It is clear to me now that I should have recommended to the judges the termination of my sister 's employment before October , but my failure to do so was be-cause 1 . She was ill in mind and body . 2 . She had , I thought , resigned her teaching position in Buffalo . 3 . She had herself and baby to support . 4 . I expected the civil service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many temporary as well as permanent employes of the city repeatedly are given sick leaves and are carried on the payroll under similar circumstances . I feel that my sister would never have remained on the payroll of the Buffalo schools while on that of the city of New York had she not been laboring- under serious mental illness . Surely , otherwise , she would not have deceived me as to her status in  --  the Buffalo schools . I have learned only today in the newspapers that she had drawn pay in Buffalo at the time she was on the payroll in my office . This knowledge , of course , comes to me as a profound shock and I hasten to return to the city of New York the entire amount which she drew as an employe of my department , since she is not in a position to do it herself . In order that this may be done without delay I have borrowed the sum of $1,077.66 , which I shall on Monday deposit with the Controller of the city of New York . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Sessions my deep regret that this incident should have occurred , " and I trust that they will not suffer any further- embarrassment in regard to this unfortunate situation . As to the money my sister received , the city of New York will suffer no loss . That I should be the innocent victim of my sister 's error of judgment is to me a matter of the most grave concern . Corporation Counsel 's Opinion . In the corporation counsel 's opinion to the Controller regarding the advisability of accepting Mr. Cooley 's personal check in repayment to the city for the money Mrs. Lawler had drawn from the Controller 's office , Air . Hilly , among other things , says : " It appears that during the period eral Sessions . Payrolls , however , were duly certified upon which payments had been made by the city . " Referring to the delivery of the $1,077 check to the Controller by the probation head , Mr. Hilly speaks of it " as a return of funds presumably wrongfully collected by his sister , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay this check and his tender of the check , I see no reason why same should not be accepted by you as reimbursement for moneys paid to Mrs. Lawler for the period of time which , admittedly , she either rendered no service or was under disability by reason of her employment in the school system of Buffalo to accept comnensation from the city of New York . " In view of the entire circumstances on this matter , however , all of the facts should be submitted to the District Attorney for whatever investigation he deems should be made into the circumstances of Mrs. Lawler 's employment and the acceptance of the check will in not manner preclude such action being taken . " Mr. Cooley when seen at the probation bureau said : " All that I can say about this unfortunate occurrence was said in my statement sent to Judge Collins last Saturday . Every fact in my possession is at the disposal of the court or any other official who may investigate the matter . " Lays Case to Dismissed Couple . Mr. Cooley then said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman as former employes of his bureau were behind the charges connected with his sister 's employment as chief clerk . " These former employes were Belle Fein , former bookkeeper in the bureau , and Abe Klein , a probation officer , who are now married , " Mr. Cooley went on . " They were dismissed by the nine judges of General Sessions by a unanimous vote on charges made by me . Miss Fein was dismissed on March 6 last and Klein on March 18 . " Miss Fein was accused of obtaining money from the city under false oaths , with withholding money from beneficiaries at the burea and making false reports to the State Probation Commission . She was charged with having submitted thirty-three false claims for ' supper money ' as expenses while at work . It was found on examination of the itemized list of such expenses that she demanded reimbursement for money for suppers on days when she was not at work , such as election day . or on Saturday half-holidays , when the office was closed , or on days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual office hours or a lttle before , or was ill . " Klein was charged by me with extorting gratuities from the family of a probationer , of intimidating the probationer for the purpose of obtaining gratuities , of obtaining his appointment through the State Civil Service Commission by a false and fraudulent oath and of insubordination as a probation officer . " At the time the charges against the couple were heard by the General Sessions judges they , in their answer , told of the employment of my sister as temporary chief clerk . At that time I was of the belief that my sister had resigned as a teacher in Buffalo when she came down to the city and obtained the position of chief clerk last Spring . I made a statement to the judges to this effect , but it was not until the statement in relation to my sister came to the surface last Saturday that I learned that Mrs. Lawler had not resigned . " Mr. Cooley was asked concerning a report that John F. Curry of Tammany Hall has been antagonistic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently had turned down a suggestion that he be placed at the head of one of the State departments . " That is just nonsense , " Mr. Cooley replied . " I do n't believe either Mr. Curry or Governor Roosevelt ever heard of such a suggestion , HieIns Plan Reinstatement Suit . Commissioner of Accounts James A. Higgins denied that he was investigating the case . Mr. Higgins explained that he began an investigation about two months ago into the accounts of the former Miss Fein . He said his investigation had hardly begun when the chairman of the General Sessions judges ' committee telephoned to him to discontinue it because the matter was in charge of the judges . Mrs. Klein said yesterday that Mr. Cooley had caused her dismissal by unfair means . She offered to resign last December as soon as an audit . of her books had been made , she said , but Mr. Cooley refused to have the audit . Mrs. Klein declared that she filed twenty-four specifications in her charges with the judges ' committee and they were never heard . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney and they announced their intention of beginning court action to recover their positions . They live at 2.200 Eighty-fifth Street , Brooklyn . Klein said Mrs. Eileen S. Coughlin , deputy chief probation officer , had committed forgery in signing Mrs. Lawler 's pay checks without a power of attorney after the first two months of her employment . He also said Mrs. Lawler did not come to New York before April 19 last year , but was put to work by Mr. Cooley as of April 5 . BUFFALO , N. Y. , April 14 ( Ml. ? Mrs. Marguerite F. Lawler , teacher , who is alleged to have drawn pay from a New York City municipal department and from the Buffalo Board of Education at the same time , mailed her resignation today to Dr. Ernest C.
