HEAVY . . . DOWN A STORY BY WALTER D. EDMONDS J OUNCY little Hogan was darning the toe of his sock . He was sitting tailorwise on his bunk behind the central stove , his right foot propped against his left knee , his flat mouth pursed , his galluses loose beside him to give him ease . At every stitch his hands trembled with the entrance of the needle . They were extraordinarily calloused hands ; the palms worked as stiffly as rhinoceros hide ; and for such a little man they were wonderfully broad . Drilling hands , O'Mory had said as soon as he laid eyes on them ; and when they came to Lockport three years ago , back in twenty-two , he had taken Hogan to hold his drill . The long barrack set up by the contractor to house his Irish gang was lighted by seven lanterns . Along the forty-foot walls were double rows of bunks . Two long tables ran the length of the center , with a stove at each end and the great stove in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , with their bellies full of new wood . This year October was early with its frost ; and the room was hot and full of the odor of men 's sweated woolen . The gang , except for two groups at each end of the northern table playing sledge and black jack , sprawled desultorily upon their bunks . Eseck Brown had closed his tavern : the Washington House barred Irishers . A few were gathered close to Hogan to watch his machinations with the needle . It was an interesting process . He darned with the sock on his foot . " Reach me down the old Hissian , Peter , " he said at last . A lanky boy in a deerskin shirt reached up for the wooden flask , unhooked it from its nail , and gave it to the little man . Hogan had broken the wool thread and stuck his needle in a plank . He took the Hessian flask in both hands and sucked a mouthful of corn whiskey . " Hang her up again , Peter , will you ? " Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The darn was in yellow wool upon a gray foundation . Sighing , he stretched out his leg and lay back on the bunk . " I wish I was home again , " said the young lad Peter . Hogan raised himself on one elbow . His froggy blue eyes examined the boy . " Did ye ever come by such good money annywhere in Ireland ? " " No . " " Did ye ever find better whiskey ? " " Just as good , " said Peter , surlily . " Did ye ever find more now ? " Hogan pointed a thick finger . " Did ye ever have whiskey come with ye 're pay , and over and above it , too ? " " No . " A one-eyed man with grizzled hair , who had watched the whole darning of HEAVY . . DOWN the sock without a word , spat into the sandbox and said , " Is it the priest ye hone for ? " The boy said seriously , " Well , there ai n't anny , is there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us out a father from Onondaga whin we set out for here . " " Three years ago . " " Well , what would you say to the father was he here ? " asked the one-eyed man with dull sarcasm . " Nothing , " admitted Peter , gloomily . " That 's what 's bothering the boy ! " exclaimed Hogan . " He misses the girrels . Oh Peter ! Ye 're right enough . There ai n't even army temptation in these woods . But until we finished the labor ye did n't have army time to think . Are you going back whome ? " " I have n't anny money , " said Peter . " What have ye done with all ye 're pay ? " He made a swift reckoning . " With yer sivin hundherd dollars ? " " It come in whiskey , " said the boy . " Part of it in money , but it all come to the same thing . " " And ye talk of having no tempta-tions ! " " Water is no temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whiskey comes to the same thing . " " The thrubble with you is ye 're too comfortable . " " That 's a fact , " said the one-eyed laborer . " If he was unhappy about it , he could feel real comfortable . " " What are we waiting here for ? " cried a man down the room . He wore a small pointed hat on the top of his head and a dirty bandage on his left foot ; between the two his body had no covering , and his skin glistened darkly in the heat of the stove . " Put on ye 're pants , McCarthy , " said Hogan . " Ye 're no decent sight . " " What am I going to do next ? " demanded the man . " What do you want to do ? " " I do n't know . " " Maybe I 'll go out to Ohio , " said another man . " They 're digging a ditch out there , they say . " " That 's an uncivilized country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They 're digging another canal by the Delaware . " " They 've seen us dig , " said Hogan , " so they flatther ye and come over ye , and call ye ' me boy ' or ' me lad . ' But digging ai n't the nat'ral state for anny one of us . Me , I 'm going to wait till O'Mory gets whome . " " Where 's O'Mory , annyway ? " asked a new voice . " At a wedding ? " " Yes , " said Hogan , " at young Collins 's wedding . The young carpenther who built the lock-gates . " " And was she the one O'Mory went around with in the spring ? " asked Peter . " Her that had red hair ? " " I believe so , " said Hogan . " I thought he had his own hone for her . " " He did so , " said Hogan . " Then I do n't understand . " " Him and Collins was friendly , " said Hogan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What is ? " asked a skeptical voice . " That 's what I said , " said Hogan , unruffled . " What is ? " " To be sure , " said the skeptical voice . Hogan asked for his Hessian . The boy handed it down . Hogan sucked noisily . " Just wait till O'Mory comes back . He 'll decide for ye what to do . " " How will he know ? " " He knows the counthry , " said Hogan , and he pointed overhead . O'Mory 's bunk was above his own , and on a nail over it hung a singular thing . It was a fireman 's helmet , scarlet , with a gold badge on which was printed " Phoenix , No. 22 . " They all admired it and envied O'Mory its possession . He had been a fireman in New York City . Sundays he took out the hat and polished its immense high crown and exaggerated brim until they glistened . Then he went out and inspected the week 's work of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangs . If the Irish margin was wide he came back and got drunk . If the footage excavated by another crew came close to theirs he drank sparingly and was surly for the rest of the day . Often and often they had seen him in his red helmet , striding down the new earth of the towpath , while jouncy little Hogan trotted to keep up , and his grin white through his black beard ; and they had started work on Monday with redoubled speed , for he kept them conscious of their reputation . He always worked at the head of the gang , drilling and setting the key blasts . In the hot summer sun , with the leakage of the swamp slimy about their knees , they could look up to see his white bare shoulders arch and straighten , arch and relax to jouncy Hogan 's chant , " Wa-a-ay Up ! Heav-vy . . Down ! " and hear the clap of the twelve-pound sledge on the drill . Among themselves they knew him for the strongest man on the Big Ditch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever pushed them had been the black gang . One contractor had gathered a hundred negroes , to work the line of marsh above Clyde . They had failed there  --  only the hog-trotters were immune from typhus and ague  --  but they had done tremendous feats by all accounts at Irondequoit ; and here at Lockport they had been pushing towards the Irish nearly as fast as the Irish had pushed towards them . Their foreman was Jefferson Johnson , the biggest nigger in the United States , and a week ago he had threatened to pay a visit to the Irish when the work was done . The one-eyed man remembered that . " I wonder will Jay-jay pay us a call . " " He had n't better do that , " said Hogan . " No . " " We 've been laid off three days , " said another . " What are we waiting for ? " " The cilibration , maybe . So Lockport can take off three hundred hats to Clinton . " Silence fell upon the room . Through it they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooks washed up . Hogan got up and went to the door . When he opened it a cold draft swept in . They all could see him against the night sky . The stars were white , and the old moon silver with frost . The shed stood on the lip of the ridge just west of the locks , and the new timbers of the balance beams shone white as bone . In the cleft of the rock they saw the dipper low down . " To catch the wather if it comes , " said a man . " When is it coming ? " asked Peter . " Anny day , " said Hogan over his shoulder and stepped through the door . As the little man breathed the cold air and stared across the miles and miles of wilderness , broken only by the line of the canal , it came upon him that that was what they were waiting for . They wanted to see the completion of their work , they wanted to see the water from Lake Erie filling the lock-wells . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lay to the southwest , a body of water endless as a sea , where real ships sailed . Behind him he heard the boy Peter ask , " What do they want this canal for annyway ? " It was the first time they had ever asked such a question . He had never asked it even of himself . It had been enough for him to shovel , to feel the HEAVY . blister of the hot drill in his palms , to beat the work of the other gangs . The door swung to , and he went out to the bridge head over the upper lock . From there he could see the canal bed behind him in the deep-cloven rock , a monumental work , four miles in length , thirty-six feet deep . The cranes they had made from spruce trees had been taken away . There was just the day , the black gleaming stone , the trickle of leakage from the marsh , the straight wall of the towpath . He turned his back and leaning on the rail looked over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . Water came to the lock gates . One boat was tied up , the boat that had brought in their last provisions . On the height to right and left clustered the sheds and barracks . Beyond them the houses of the mushroom-town . There were yellow lights there . There was a light in the house of the resident engineer . He was still making out his accounts . He did not know what the real work felt like ; there was no ache in his hands . Hogan 's palms tingled . He would be able to feel the buck of the drill to his last day . He leaned over the rail and spat from his quid . A man was coming along the towpath . He walked very slowly . Hogan watched the figure idly . It came along the towpath to the foot of the lock and paused before it mounted slowly , almost painfully . Now if it was Jay-jay and his black crew , that would be something different . There would be a chance of shindy , and out here there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been a chancy meeting , between the gangs , but the townies had brought out rifles on them . Hogan waited until the stranger had come up to the bridge , and then he said , " Good evening . " The stranger breathed hard . He took off his hat to wipe his forehead , and Hogan saw that he was an old man with white hair almost to his shoulders . " Good evening , " said the stranger . He carried a satchel on his back , and by the look of it it was heavy . " Put down ye 're bag , " suggested Hogan. " it looks a heavy load . " " It 's not as heavy as it should be . " " What have ye got ? " " Articles of God , " said the old man . " What is them ? " " Messages , for all men . " " Oh , are ye a peddler ? " " Yes , " said the old man , " I 'm a peddler . " The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Hogan , mister . " " Mine is Smith . " He extended a hand that felt like cloth to Hogan 's leather palm , " I want to trade but I do n't want money . " " What do ye do then ? " asked Hogan . " I want to talk about God . " " Are you a missionary , a minister ? " Hogan asked incredulously . " No . I 'm a man who has seen the error of his ways . I want others to see theirs . " Hogan felt kindly for him . " Ye 've come a long ways , mister . I would n't go in now on the bhoys . " " Who works on this section ? " " I 'm one . We 're called the Devil 's Angels . " " The bog-trotters ! I beg your pardon , the Irishmen ? " " The same . " " They 're Catholics ? " " As much as tinny other thing ye care to name . " " Christians . It is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who has seen the error of his ways . " " Well , these are a damned bad bunch of bhoys . But mister , " Hogan urged him kindly , " do n't be bothering them . They 're kind of restless . " " I 've been restless too , " said the old man . " Which is their shed ? " Hogan sighed . " If ye 're set on going , I 'll come along , mister . " " I should be obliged . Wait . I should like to make you a present . These are pamphlets , tracts . I have some very interesting ones , and before I go in I should like to make you an especial present , for you have been kind . " " Thank you , " said Hogan . " I 'd take one , only I ca n't read . " " It makes no difference , " said the old man . " They are comforting things to have . Now here is one on the evils of drink : ' The Ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True Motherhood . ' I have here one copy of a very substantial tract called , The Life , Earthly Damnation , and Ultimate Salvation , of Elizabeth Shepherd . ' It is a remarkable story , attested , with a fine lesson , and has instructive pictures . " " Pictures ? " asked Hogan . " Yes . " " I 'll take it then , and thank ye kindly , mister . " The old gentleman passed it to him , refilled his bag . " Do ye know them by the touch then ? " asked Hogan . " Yes , " said the old man , smiling . " Reading is a gift for sure , " Hogan said seriously . The old man snapped the bag . " Let me carry it , " said Hogan . He swung it to his shoulder . It made no mean load ; it must have borne down heavily on so old a man . He paused for a moment , The whole world was still . Then along the Deep Cut he heard the scrape of boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of men . " Bedevil , it 's Jay-jay ! " He felt the old man 's hand on his arm . " Excuse me , mister . It 's Jay-jay . " " Who is he ? " " He 's foreman . of the blacks , the niggermen . He said he would come calling . He 's been disputing for three years with us . They claim they do the better work . When they got through they said they was going to prove it . " He started hurrying for the barrack . " Listen , mister . This ai n't a time to missionate . It 's no place at all for a gentleman like you . " " Is n't it ? " said the old man mildly . " I should think I had come just in time . " " Well , " muttered Hogan , " then I 'll look out for ye annyway . " He hurried him through the door . The Irishers lay around the room as he had left them . " Bhoys ! " They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces brightened . " Give me me pants , " cried McCarthy . A man laughed . " Viihat 'll we do to them ? " " I wisht O'Mory was wbome , " said Hogan , anxiously . " But annyway set around nat'ral and easy . Just look like ye 'd expected them in for a pot of tay . " He had forgotten the old gentleman . Now he felt a touch on his shoulder and turning , saw him standing with bare head . He bad fine features , a soft white mustache , and his deep-set eyes were wandering from face to face . " Bhoys , " said Hogan , " this is Mister Smith . He 's come in to talk to ye about the error of his ways and give ye books . " He held up his present , and the boy Peter laid hold of it . " It 's got picters , " he cried . " Now leave it be , Peter , " said Hogan . " I 'll just put it by till Jay-jay 's gone so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away under his blankets , while the boy watched gloomily . Round the room the men disposed themselves easily . Conversation broke out on the weather , on women . The old missionary was forgotten . A couple in the corner by the door to the kitchen started a song . Hogan caught the old gentleman 's arm and swung him behind the central stove , as the door opened . " Good evening , Mister Jay-jay , " he said , his flat mouth grinning . " Step into me poor house and set down out of the cold . Is it very cold to-night ? " Through the door came the biggest negro the missioner had ever seen . He was not very tall but he was built with tremendous weight . His barrel chest showed through his thin shirt as plainly as if it were naked . It arched from his collar bone to his high thick stomach . His arms were smooth , showing the muscle by their shape . His legs were thin and flat , and for all his weight , he moved lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow whites , his kinked hair , his tight-set ears , and his broad flattened nostrils had an almost aboriginal caste . His neck bulged outward from the base of his ears . With his shining black skin and the flexing of his nostrils , he appeared among the Irishcrs like a black-blooded stallion . But when he returned Hogan 's greeting , his voice was gentle and husky . " Good evening , Mister Hogan , sir . Is Mister O'Mory here ? " " He is not , " said Hogan . " But come inside . " " I 've brought along some of my boys , Mister Hogan , if it is n't a bother to you . " " Have them in , Jay-jay . " Twenty of his biggest men trooped through the door . They were black as Jay-jay , and they brought with them an outlandish tropic odor . Hogan indicated the tables and benches . " Set down , " he invited them , and he wondered what he should do till O'Mory came . " I do n't want to bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to talk to O'Mory . I 've been promising that . " Hogan had an inspiration . He got up and took off his hat . " Jay-jay , when you came in we were just going to listen to Mister Smith tell us a few words about the error of his ways . " He made a gesture to the old man and sat down again . The negroes ' eyes rolled round at the old man . They seemed completely at a loss  --  except for the giant Johnson . He was amazed to see such a man in such a place , but he recognized the quality . He gravely inclined his head , motioned his men to the benches , and sat down himself on O'Mory 's box at the table-end . The old man looked over the room for a moment ; for a moment his eyes were helpless . His nostrils fluttered to the smell of sweat and corn whiskey , and his face went white . Then his eyes brightened . He took up his bag and put it before him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Lord has not gifted me with eloquence . It is enough that he has shown me the error of my ways in time for me to do some work for him . I shall not pregi.h . But perhaps we may have a little talk . " His fingers riffled the pages of one of the pamphlets . " I am an old man , and I am alone in the world . I will tell you a story . . . " He told his story simply and quickly ? it appeared that he had traded negroes , owned a line of vessels . He had been very wealthy ; it had never occurred to him to consider as human the people he bought for colored glass and cheap steel . His wife was a saintly woman , full of prayer , but he had spent little time with her at home . His had been a life of pleasure as the people of his community knew how to live . He had had two children . Over them alone he and his wife agreed . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to passion . His even voice sketched the careers of the children . Through his words the Irishers caught glimpses of a type of life beyond their understanding . The giant Jay-jay alone appreciated the things he heard . He sat with head slightly bowed , slightly turned from the speaker ; but from time to time his eyes rolled round for a sidewise glance . When the man described the betrothal party of his daughter , i isti ng the clothes , the coaches , the food , the wine , Jay-jay nodded to himself . The old man talked well . He called nothing vanity . He merely detailed the facts ; what he considered their meaning to be any man could read in the lines beside his fine lips . He stood straight and pale , letting go the copy of the " Debauchees ' Accounting . " He was looking doom in the eye , but his own eye carried a spark still . First the boy had been lost at sea in one of his own ships . His daughter 's husband had turned out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tender bride  --  somewhere to the west . Disgraced when he had had to leave , she had chosen to stand by him . Not all the speaker 's money could trace them , when after the final blow his pride had melted . The final blow was his wife 's death from an incurable disease . " I was alone that night in my study , gentlemen , when a man knocked on the door . He came in and prayed with me . I do not know who he was or what his face was , but I saw with his help the error of my ways and I was converted . I spend my money now in helping those who need it and in giving tracts to those who in this world can help themselves . " He paused . His face was finely drawn in the lantern light , and his hair seemed even more white . " I speak to you only from a place beside you . You are new in this country , many of you , and you have a future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to error . I do not ask confessions . " They dropped their eyes . His calm was breaking down , and they knew that he felt it slipping from his hands . " I will only ask that sometimes you will think of my story , and beware of the vanities of life , of profane words and idle drinking , and the commerce with evil women . " His breath caught , and he continued painfully , " Poor things , they are no worse than I. " " Stop yer sniffling , Peter , " whispered Hogan . He wiped his own nose with embarrassment . He had seen many a man beaten but he had never seen a man who felt himself debased . " Life is not a test of the better man , " said the old man softly , " but of the better Christian . " He took up in his hand a small thick book bound in brown leather . It fell open at his touch and he began to read , slowly , haltingly : " Hear me , 0 God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ; Hast thou not built a throne of Grace , To hear when sinners cry . " He dropped the hook and , taking up the pamphlets , walked slowly round the barrack , giving each man one , while his voice continued the psalm from memory . " M , y days are wasted like the smoke , Dissolving in the air ; My strength is dry , my heart is broke , And sinking in despair . " Jouncy little Hogan put the hard palms of his hands together and poked Peter with the darned toe of his sock . The boy 's finely cut face , so pagan , so dark , was bright with tragedy . The one-eyed man 's eye was staring beyond the window . " My soul is like a wilderness , Where beasts , of midnight , howl ; There the sad raven finds her place , And there the screaming owl . " He had not preached to them but he had shared his life with them . It was not like the priest at confession . Hogan fingered the callouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that it was a strong soul , shaken perhaps , perhaps broken , but full of simple courage . The voice was even again . " My locks like wither 'd leaves appear , And life 's declining light Grows faint as evening shadows are Which vanish in the night . " Hogan looked up . Jay-jay was sitting solemnly , staring eyeballs pointed to the little paper in his hamlike hands ; and a kind of monstrous politeness sat on him . And then Hogan 's heart patted the inside of his chest . Leaning against the closed door , was O'Mory in his Sunday suit , his boots muddy from his long walk , his bright eyes dry , his mouth closed soberly in his black beard . He was listening for the end of the psalm , but his attention was fastened on the giant Jay-jay ; and Hogan could tell by the way his hands took hold of the inside of his pants ' pockets that his friend had been drunk and had brought the devil back with him . The old man 's voice went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cries And by myster'ous ways , Redeems the pris'ner doorn 'd to die And fills his tongue with praise . " He was facing O'Mory , handing him a book . The black Irishman took his right hand from his pocket and grasped the pamphlet . " Thank ye , sir , " he said in his deep voice , " and thank ye for talkie ' to the bhoys . " Hogan 's eyes jumped to Jay-jay . Deliberately the negro turned on the box , his feet scuffing the floor lightly . But before he could speak , the old man reclaimed their attention . He had taken up his empty satchel and put it on his shoulder . " Gentlemen , " he said , " you have listened courteously to me . I am grateful . I hope you will think of the things I have said so poorly and come to some understanding of the truth in them . Good-night . " For the first time , O'Mory 's attention was turned fully on the speaker . As he came towards the door , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye going to spend the night , sir ? " " It is not late , " said the old man . " I thought I might get on to the next camp . " " You 've had a long walk . Ye 'd better spend the night . " The old man 's smile was charming . " I should say you were full-up in here . " " Me and Hogan can double up , " said O'Mory , " and if it 's crowded , whin he gets to sleep I 'll just stick him underneath the bed . " Some of the Irishers chuckled . Hogan grinned . There was going to be something doing in a while . " No . But thank you . PH be getting on . " He went resolutely out of the door . Suddenly Jay-jay was on his feet . " Robert , " he said in his soft voice . A willowy negro with a crinkle of beard along his chin glanced up from the table . " Robert , you go along with this gentleman and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black boys polite . " " Yes , Jay-jay , but . . . " " Go along , " said Jay-jay quietly . After one more look at the broad face , Robert nodded and went out quickly . O'Mory closed the door behind him . " Well , Jay-jay , I 'm glad you 've come around , I am . I 've heard ye think highly of yerself , " he said coming forward , " and I do n't wondher at it . No I do n't . " Jay-jay swung round to face the table again and placed his great hands together upon it . He seemed to be thinking deeply . " Take yer time , " said O'Mory with mock kindness . " Anny man 's entitled to his good thoughts . " He looked round . " Now the old gent 's gone along , ye might bring out some whiskey . I 've had a far walk , and it is n't often we 've had visitors . " Hogan took down his Hessian and refilled it at a barrel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of thick glasses . O'Mory poured out liberal doses . " Here 's spit in yer eye , Jay-jay , " he offered for a toast . " I believe it 's a custom of yer country . " Hogan started . It was an ugly thing to say , and O'Mory seldom said things maliciously . Something was eating the man . It was the wedding , of course ; O'Mory had been bottled up the two whole days and he wanted to rouse the negro . Then Hogan saw what O'Mory had seen all along , that Jay-jay was not in the mood for a shindy . He was still heavily regarding his hands . " Well , " said O'Mory , " if nobody else will drink , bedevil , I will , annyway . I 've just come back from putting a boy in bed with his girrel and I find ye all glooming like crows come home to a clean roost . " He held down his beard with his left hand and brought his glass sidewise tohis lips , tilted his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm dhry , " he said , and turned his back on the negroes . " Hogan , " he said , " I heard in Newport that they expected the wather to come through to-day or to-morrow . " " No , " said Hogan . " I did . " " Then it might come through tonight . Peter , just run out and take a look to see . " Peter was lying on his bunk with Hogan 's book , looking at the pictures . " Devil take him ! Put down that book , will ye ! " Peter got up reluctantly and went outside . When he was gone , O'Mory said , " They waited I guess till the darkeys was finished before they could let the wather in . The poor bhoys . They never could stand the wet . " The Irishers roared and stamped . Some of the negroes looked up hotly , turning from the Irishmen to their leader . When they saw him a kind of dismay lay on their loose mouths . Jay-jay continued to sit silently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chin . In the light , against the black skin , they looked white . " It 's truth I 'm telling , " crowed Hogan , pointing at the drops . O'Mory snorted . " They had n't the strength to stand it , the poor bhoys . I 'm not blaming them . " Jay-jay at last looked up . " O'Mory , " he said , " when I come over I brought the best twenty boys I had to lick your best . I 'm going to lick you . But I ai n't goin ' to let these boys fight . I see now it ai n't right after hearing that old gentleman elo-quenting . " O'Mory 's savage grin grew almost friendly . " Me boy , it 's time . I need the exercise . " His eye took in the massive " Maybe I 'll get it . " torso . " Maybe you will , " said the negro calmly . His gaze lost its introspective moodiness . He examined the Irishman with an animal objectiveness . In his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built leanly . His long arms were muscled hard as whips ; under the skin on his forearms the cords moved like strings as he stretched his hand out to grasp Hogan 's Hessian with his fingers . " Here 's a glass to ye , Jay-jay . You and yer men was n't much at the marshes , but perhaps you can fight . " The negro brushed the glass aside . " I 'll drink when I 'm done with you , O'Mory . " His voice , still soft , was close-bitten . But there was a greater liveliness in his .0 eye . " Well , " said O'Mory , " dhrink never hurt a man to my knowing . But I would n't go so far as trespass on yer religious scrhuples , Jay-jay . It seems a shame , though , the bhoys ca n't have a limbering on your lads . " " There ai n't no need , " said " We 're the two best men canal . " " Well , " said O'Mory , " I 'm inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could docther one of your eyes . " Hogan grinned . " There ai n't anny sense in closing Jay-jay 's eyes the way it 's colored . " O'Mory downed his drink . " Idle fighting is good for the liver , Jay-jay , but bad for the sowl . So we 'd better have something to fight about . All the world knows the niggers went undher on the Montezuma Marsh . " " How about the bank at Ronde-quoit ? " asked a negro angrily . " All the people say that 's the biggest work there is . " " They ai n't seen the Deep Cut , " said O'Mory . " And we finished ahead of you , me bhoy . " " We had farther to dig . " " But ye never come into that hard Iime . " Jay-jay stood up . He remembered the words of the old man . He repeated them : " Life ai n't no test of the best man but of the best Christian . " O'Mory slapped his thighs . " I 'll fight ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He opened his hand , drew back , and struck the negro a resounding slap on his right cheek . The sound echoed behind the stove and the negro 's head snapped back . His neck stiffened . He got up slowly and said , " Do it again . " He had turned his face . " Anything to oblige , " said O'Mory , and he struck again . The negro took the blow without a sign , but the crack sounded like a blacksnake whip on hide . The door opened , and the boy Peter came in . " I could n't tell was the wather deeper . It 's too dark . " He stopped . Nobody had heard him . And as he stopped , the negro knocked O'Mory down . There was a roar from the men that made a wind to shake the lantern flames . Tongues of smoke leaped out . O'Mory jumped to his feet . " Get me them tables out of the way , " he cried . " Hogan , hold me shirt . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table legs upon the puncheon floor . But the Irishers were watching Jay-jay with a new light in their faces . No one had ever knocked O'Mory down . The negro had drawn back a pace before his men . His great closed fists swung by his sides in little jerks . His feet were flat on the ground , his knees slightly sprung , but his back was straight , and his barrel chest heaved with a quick easy breathing and his nostrils went in and out like the flutter of a stallion 's . O'Mory 's shirt was off and his chest shone a lively white through the black mane upon it . The structure of the man showed beneath the skin . His breathing eased again . When the room was cleared he said , " Whichever one of us two beats the other , leave the black bhoys be . " He turned to Jay-jay . " Come on , me bhoy . " He sprang . His arms cracked in . The two blows were like lightning . They struck like bolts , a flat hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belly . The negro met them like a rock , and then he was in motion . So quickly , so lightly did he move that he seemed scarcely to change his place . His feet did not step high and lightly like the Irishman 's , but they moved , instead , flat and close to the floor , with a faint shuffling sound , putting him here and there with the ugly swiftness of a bear . His round smooth black arms were like the pistons of a steamboat 's engine . And when his fists struck , they thundered on the Irishman 's chest . And when they came away , the others saw that they had left their color on the skin , as if the white could breed to black ? octoroon , quadroon , mulatto , black . O'Mory 's body whipped before the blows and his teeth showed in his beard . He seemed far quicker than the negro , with his lithe strides , the grace of his arms , and the snakelike lashes of his fists . Hogan streamed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't let him grasp ye ! " " Watch his feet , " cried the one-eyed man . " Look out he does n't grasp yer lip ! " " Mind yer eyes , O'Mory . " A roar of voices swelled . The Irishers were all upon their bunks . The negroes were lining the wall by the doors . They were silent . Their dusky faces made a thread of intensity against the yellow of the planks . Suddenly as the two men came together , one jabbered in an outlandish tongue . " 0 God ! " shrieked Hogan . " Stand off from him ! " Each had his chin on the other 's right shoulder , and out of sight between them their hands interlocked like antlers . There was not a breath of movement . Suddenly the Irishman 's left hand shot round the black man 's waist , slipped down behind his thigh , his foot slid forward . He strained heavily , his muscles cracking . The negro lifted ; the flat feet shuffled in air ; and then slowly they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The negro had broken the hold ; but he spun as he came free and went against the table . With a roar O'Mory was on him and bent him back upon the board . The Irishman 's knee pressed into the negro 's crotch , keeping his legs vertical , while with both hands reached under the black man 's armpits he caught his chin and forced the neck back . The eyes in the black face swelled . The yellow whites became bloodshot . A strange moaning broke from the negroes and jouncy little Hogan began to jibber with delight . " O'Mory , O'Mory , O'Mory , ye darlin ' ! " And then the negro 's hands drew back , and his foot lifted . The blow seemed futile from that angle but it found the Irishman 's chin . The black hand was lost in the black beard , the head snapped back , and the white hands broke from the black chin like limp straps . At the instant , the negro 's foot found room and kicked the Irishman away . O'Mory reeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy line of faces . He heard a shout of warning . He heard a high-pitched kind of moan . " He 's butting ! " He heard the pad of feet . It seemed to be behind him . He tried to whirl , but the black head caught him on the thigh and he spun away and fell . As he fell he heard the crash the negro made . He had been hurt , be knew he had been hurt , but he could not feel it . But it was a hurt that gave something into his hands . He was n't lonely any more . The wedding was out of his mind now and he was a man , and he found that he loved Jay-jay , loved him as a precious object for his hands to destroy . A grin broke his lips apart . His hands found the planks and he was on his feet . As the negro faced him , O'Mory knew that he also was hurt , and he put back his head and laughed with pure joy , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door when the hullabaloo broke loose , with the clerk and the cooks , and axemen , and rodsrnan , understood why someone had called this gang the Devil 's Angels . For the rest of them had caught O'Mory 's laughter and laughed with him , and the long room heaved with roaring . But the negro had become a travesty of the human thing . The purpose of the human brain was behind him now , but the face was bestial . They came together . " Stand off from him ! " But as though they had agreed to it , they abandoned themselves to their fists . O'Mory saw the black face before him , the one thing in the world , and his love for it filled his heart with the desire to feel it breaking under his hands . They traded great blows . They had no notion of defense . They broke each other as they would have broken stone , with the instinct of three long years in the Deep Cut to compel their arms and shoulders . O'Mory felt the pain growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like arrows in his chest and the roots fingering his vitals . But his brain sang as he saw that the negro 's blood was red . He swung without moving his feet , again and again and again , until his arms had acquired a rhythm . And through the room which had once more grown silent , he heard the voice of Hogan catching it for him , giving his hands truth . " Wa-a-ay - Up ! . . . Heavy . . . Down ! Wa-a-ay Up ! . . . Heavy . . Down ! " Over and over . And the sting in his forearms was like the taste of the sledge . But he was hammering rock that would not break . He knew that it would never break and his heart sang with laughter and he was glad . All at once he , saw in Jay-jay 's face a change coming slowly , as if his understanding had been lighted from the same fire . And all at once the broken lips of both men grinned covertly at each other . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as at a word , they held back their arms , stepped together , and shook hands . Jouncy little Hogan laughed . He came leaping down on his bowlegs with his old Hessian high over his head . He baptized them both with stinging whiskey and gave them the drum to drink from , first the negro , then the Irishman . As the two men drank , there was silence . And in the silence all men heard a different sound . It came from the open door , from the frosted night , from the spot where the great dipper was suspended over the cleft in the mountain ridge . It was the sound of water , It was the sound of a small trickle of water finding its way down the tumble bay beside the double flight of locks . But for a moment the Irishmen and the negroes did not understand what it could he . It was not until the young engineer who had given their labor form cried suddenly , " It 's the water coming through ! " that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet pounding down to the bridge head , they heard the broken note in his voice , they saw the rodsman and the axemen and the cooks running after him , but they stood still , with a queer wonder in their eyes . Some smiled , some simply stood with open mouths . O'Mory put his arm across Jay-jay 's shoulders and grinned at jouncy little Hogan . He knew . It meant the end of their long initiation , The engineer wanted to see it because of the shape it would have , the form for the picture he had seen in his mind 's eye . The rodsman and the axemen , because it meant the end of their stay in this piece of wilderness , the cooks because it meant that they would not have to wash the plates of Irishmen and negroes . To the contractors it would mean profit or loss . To the farmers in Ohio it would mean a decent price for wheat . To the merchants in the east it would mean cheap transportation . Even in New York City it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face lengthened . But to himself and to these wild Irishers , who had chopped at stumps , who had shovelled where half of each shovelful ran back at their toes , who had wheeled barrows , who had had the sun on their backs , the frost in their feet , the cold wet against their bellies , the ague and fever in their lungs , who had had stumps to pull , and piles to drive in quicksand , limestone to blast , and rock to devil which no force but their own could loosen , this water meant the sweat they had dropped in labor , it meant the blood of life in their veins , it meant the end of the job . He looked round on them . They were staring at him hopelessly . Even jouncy little Hogan was staring at him like a miserable lost dog . He said to them , " It 's finished , bhoys . " The one-eyed man asked over his quid hoarsely , " What 'll we do now , O'Mory ? " And he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight lines of boats were starting up to eastwards . They 'll he wanting crews . They 'll hire ye on . " He laughed . " What more do ye want ? Ye 've built the thing . It 's whome to ye . Me , I 've had me offer already . I 'm a captin as I stand . Hogan , will ye be a crewman ? Ye 're short . Ye wo n't have to duck for bridges . " Hogan 's flat mouth opened , stretched , and grinned . " Have a pull at me old Hissian , O'Mory , Captin , Sir . " O'Mory felt a stiffness in the shoulders under his arm . He felt sorry for the black men now . They were sons of toil . It was the tradition in their blood . " Niver mind , Jay-jay , " he said . " You can lick any man but me . Let 's go on out and see the thing . " They walked down to the Deep Cut , and they saw that the canal was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the water had made small impression till the lock gates dammed it . Then it had risen quickly . It made a black , straight track along the towpath wall , stretching back into the still blackness of the stone . But even in that blackness it held reflections of the stars . The moon was dipping . At their feet it swam upon the water . And all at once , in the white pool , the men saw a long black shape . " What 's that ? " " It 's a fish ! " cried Hogan . " It 's too big a fish to be one . " HEAVY . .. DOWN 113 " I saw it , I 'm telling you . I saw the tail of it , and the fins of it , and the mouth of it , and the round eye as great as a whale . " The rodsman bent over . He was a man from Buffalo . As he looked the long shape swam across the light again . " It 's a muskallonge , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here . They 're handsome fish and grow to forty pounds . " " No ? " " Is n't he telling you ? " " How big is this one would ye say , Mister Roberts ? " The engineer , who had drawn off to be by himself , came back . He too knew the fish . " It 's a muskallonge all right . I 'd call it over thirty-five pounds . " " Close to forty , " the rodsman agreed . " Think of that ! " " And him coming all the way from the lake , all by himself alone . " " What do ye suppose he 's afther now ? " The fish had approached the tumble bay . They could just make him out , estimating the water , and finning backward from it . " I 'll tell you , " cried Roberts . " I 'll work him through the locks , if he wants to go . O'Mory , you get over on that other gate . Take that lever and pull up , that opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side of the western flight . The water sluiced through with a loud , thirsty swish , tumbled over the upper sill . In a moment the new plank of the floor had lost its gleam . The level began to rise in the inner chamber of the well . The men watched it silently . For the time they had forgotten the fish . They saw the water fingering the walls , they saw the stars borne upon the surface . A pool was made to float a boat , higher , higher , until it rose above the sill , to the level in the Deep Cut . The engineer leaned on the balance beam of the nearest gate , and O'lliory with Jay-jay to help him opened the other . They swung silently through the water and the moon floated in between , and under the moon went the fish . The men cheered . The gates were closed . " He knows a thing or two , " cried Hogan , delightedly peering over . Moving slowly the men followed the water down , and through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very end he slid out on the Rochester level . He hung for a moment at the bottom of the tumble bay , over which the waste water was already gaining considerable volume . Then he wheeled with a smooth eddy and disappeared . The silent men watched him go . O'Mory heard a man crying softly behind him . He turned . It was the boy , Peter . He understood . To this boy all the things of beauty in the world were tragic . He laid his hand upon the boy 's shoulder . " I 'll be needing another hand on me boat besides Hogan . Will ye sign on , Peter , lad ? " The boy nodded , and the growing roar of the water on the tumble bay mastered all other sounds .
