" Names make news . " Last week the following names made the following news . <P> A letter , from Thomas Jefferson to William Fleming written in October 1763 when Jefferson was 20 ( one of a collection to be sold in Manhattan in the American Art-Anderson galleries ) was found to read : " I do not like the ups and downs of a country life ; today you are rollicking with a fine girl and tomorrow you are moping by yourself . ... I have thought of the cleverest plan of life . . . . You exchange your land for Edgehill , or I mine for Fairfields ; you marry Sally Prior . I marry Rebecca Burwell , join , and get a polo chair and a pair of keen horses , practice the law in the same courts , and drive about to all the dances in the country together . " <P> Mark O. Prentiss , criminologist , prime organizer of the National Crime Commission , returned from lunching with Charles Henry Tuttle , New York Republican Nominee for Governor , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue apartment . Noiselessly he snatched a Turkish sword-cane from the wall , forced Charles Faye at the point of it into a seat , made him talk about himself , made him demonstrate how , with strips of vellum and a piece of tin , he had jimmied the apartment lock . When his arm grew tired Mr. Prentiss changed the Turkish sword-cane for an Italian billy . Faye said he was indigent , it was his first " job , " pleaded for mercy . After two hours Mr. Prentiss , well satisfied with his " experiment , " turned Faye over to police who made him confess to 16 midtown burglaries . Said Prentiss : " It was the most interesting experience I have ever had . He told me he was a painter , but when I examined his hands I knew that was n't true . Of course , I never had any idea of letting him go . I 've had too much experience for that . " <P> Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise , zealous worker for the Jewish Palestine Homeland , No. 1 U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Half Moon Hotel , Coney Island , N. Y. , whence he had gone , for seclusion and rest . His attending physician announced that Rabbi Wise was " withdrawing indefinitely " from all duties , would probably not attend the Palestine conference at London on Nov. 6 ( see p. 20 ) . <P> Nikolai Sokoloff , conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra , whom Evangelist William Ashley ( " Billy " ) Sunday called " a dirty foreigner , " because of his promise to give $100 to the anti-Prohibition work of the Crusaders ( TIME , Oct. 27 ) , doubled his subscription , fired back at Sunday before a Crusader luncheon at Cleveland : " I have lived here 30 years as a citizen of the United States . . . . Whatever career I have had has been here . ... I have yet to see the inside of a jail . Yet this gentleman Evangelist Sunday says that ... all of foreign blood are ' foreigners and dirty crooks ' . ... I am disgusted to think that a church would permit such a clown-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clown like this man , who destroys all the beautiful quality that religion should have , to occupy its platform . " <P> Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis was given a testimonial dinner by Philadelphians . Senator George Wharton Pepper called him " the ideal American . ' ' Said Publisher Curtis : " I never expected to have anything of this sort happen to me. "
