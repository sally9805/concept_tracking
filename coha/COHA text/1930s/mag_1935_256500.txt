THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION 1917-1921 , Vols . I and II - William Henry Chamberlin-Macmillan ( $10 ) . <P> Sixteen years ago a U. S. newspaperman , John Reed , wrote the first eyewitness account in English of Russia 's Bolshevik revolution , in Ten Days that Shook the World . Brief , brisk , emphatically pro-Bolshevik , Reed 's account won Lenin 's approval , earned its author burial space in Moscow 's place of honor in the Red Square , has served as a valuable source book for historians ever since . Last week another U. S. newspaperman , William Henry Chamberlin , for ten years Russian correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor , offered the first definitive history of the turbulent period , including the Ten Days , from the fall of the Romanov Dynasty in March 1917 , to the introduction of the New Economic Policy in March 1921 . Neither brief nor pro-Bolshevik , Author Chamberlin 's two-volume The Russian Revolution will probably not win its creator burial in the Kremlin , is nevertheless the clearest and most detailed account of " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. readers . Written in a methodical narrative style , with patient concentration on day-to-day , almost hour-to-hour shifts in the forces favoring or opposing the revolution , The Russian Revolution 1917-1921 is faithful to its author 's desire " to place the establishment of the facts in the foreground and to offer only as much personal interpretation as seemed quite indispensable . " <P> In Russia 's geographic position Author Chamberlin finds the first reasons for the inflexibility of the Tsarist government and the desperation of the revolutionary upheaval . Poised between Europe and Asia , serving for centuries as a barrier between European civilization and Asiatic barbarism , Russia drew her ideas of Western progress and enlightenment from Europe , her form of government from the East . The dilemma of Peter the Great , who tried to evoke initiative by force , who " desired that the slave , remaining a slave , should act consciously and freely , " remained to haunt the later Tsars , who dared not concede an inch of freedom lest their subjects demand a mile . <P> As far back as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and abroad , but demands for reform were met with more systematic repression , until by 1917 the Tsar could scarcely find support outside the ranks of the nobility . The livest sections of Author Chamberlin 's history are to be found in his descriptions of the collapse of the Romanov autocracy , " one of the most leaderless , spontaneous , anonymous revolutions of all time , " and of the hourly dissolution of the monarchy that suddenly fell apart like a gigantic One-Hoss Shay . Again &; again Author Chamberlin introduces incidents and documents to prove how little the ruling class understood what was happening , and to suggest the excitement and good nature of the revolution . Only after the overthrow of Kerensky 's Provisional Government and the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks does the narrative darken , become more ominous . Then casualty lists , accounts of atrocities replace the accounts of the first enthusiastic confusion . Maintaining an unflinching detachment , Author Chamberlin holds no person or party responsible , betrays indignation only when writing of the Red and White Terror and the execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
