Chamber music is caviar to musical gourmets . Caviar from the very finest of sturgeons is the chamber music produced by the famed Budapest String Quartet , world 's top-ranking string ensemble . To gobble up this treat last fortnight Manhattan 's hungriest musical highbrows gathered in Town Hall to hear the first concert of the New Friends of Music 's annual chamber-music series . <P> For the occasion the Budapesters had with them two guest soloists : athletic William Primrose , world 's No. 1 viola player and chief violist of Arturo Toscanini 's NBC Orchestra ; a small , plump , snub-nosed young woman who booped mightily through the brass coils of a big French horn . When she had finished the horn part of Mozart 's Quintet in E Flat Major , with dignity she dumped the saliva from her horn , rose and went home to practice for this week 's concert .

Says she : " After three days I would n't have given it up for worlds . I felt comfortable on it . " By now she sounds comfortable on it , but it took some doing . She practiced from morning to night-in the garage whither her distracted family banished her . Three years later she got a scholarship from Manhattan 's Philharmonic-Symphony Society . One year after that famed Conductor Otto Klemperer heard her play , and hired her to solo with the newly formed Pittsburgh Symphony . <P> Today , 22-year-old , dark-haired Ellen Stone lives with her horn in a little bare-floored room off Manhattan 's musical 57th Street . For amusement she goes to the movies , reads " great sociological novels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when her boy friends ( mostly fellow horn players ) ask her out for an evening of horn duets and trios . Her hero : sober , 180-lb. , 52-year-old Bruno Jaenicke , world 's champion horn player , who beeps and purls in John Barbirolli 's New York Philharmonic-Symphony.
