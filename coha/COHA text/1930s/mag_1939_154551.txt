Starting on a transcontinental tour in a shiny big Cadillac , San Francisco 's wonderboy editor , cocky , carrot-topped Paul Clifford ( " Pink " ) Smith of the Chronicle , last week paused to explain why he had refused to run for mayor . With characteristic candor he delivered himself as follows : <P> " The main reason I 'm not running is simply because I 've only had a four-year crack at this Chronicle job from topside , and being a fathead I think I need a couple of more years anyhow . The dope is I 'm sort of a squirt , a very egotistical one-so egotistical that I think I 'm smart enough to know I have n't done the job with a newspaper yet . Maybe I 'll wait and run for President . <P> " Whatever has happened in the past four years has been flashy . I blundered my way into a labor dispute and got it settled . I was called a Communist for six weeks and a Nazi for two minutes . I 've done no solid job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side there 's a job to be done-San Francisco needs a kick in the tail . But I hope to do that with the newspaper . " <P> Forty thousand of his fellow citizens thought Wonderboy Smith could boot old Mayor Angelo Rossi out of his job , and signed a petition asking him to try . A good many others thought he would be easy to beat . Smart Paul Smith had a private poll taken and convinced himself he had a chance . Three hundred and fifty-six people who work for the Chronicle signed another petition begging him to stay on . So the 30-year-old , pint-size , freckle-faced boss of Mark Twain 's and Bret Harte 's paper decided to stick to his job . One of the funny things about Pinky Smith is that he is dazzled by being a newspaperman . <P> Saga . A self-styled " little squirt anxious to be a tough guy , " Paul Smith skipped through high school in Pescadero , Calif. , at 14 set out to rub against the world . He jumped a harvest train , spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight trains east to Ontario for gold , found none , jumped another freight back , worked in British Columbia logging camps ( where friendly lumberjacks organized a bodyguard to protect him from those who resented his slickness ) , prospected in the Mojave Desert ( where all he got was sunstroke ) , shoveled coal in Utah and Pennsylvania , bummed . Once , arriving in Eugene , Ore . with 5 , he talked local businessmen into backing a sporting goods store , gave golf lessons to drum up trade . He played in the low 120s . In 1928 he landed a job in a San Francisco bond house ; by 1930 he was Anglo California National Bank 's resident manager in New York . He was 22 then . <P> Paul Smith wanted to get into newspaper work , so he went back to San Francisco and began writing a financial column for the Chronicle . Then , deciding he needed more education , he borrowed $500 and went to Europe . In January 1933 the financial editor of the Chronicle died and Wonderboy Smith got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert Hoover tried to hire him away in 1935 , he was made executive editor .
