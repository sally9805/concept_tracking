When rich , wanderlusty His Highness the Maharaja of Tripura , Sir Bir Bikram Kishore Deb decided to see the world , he instructed Thos . Cook &; Son 's sniffy " Princes ' Department " to assign him its No. 1 courier , big , beefy , 60-year-old Frederick Norbert Wagner . Last June the Maharaja , his entourage of eight , and 58 pieces of luggage arrived in Marseille , France . There , on his toes as usual , Courier Wagner firmly took command . <P> Last week Courier Wagner herded his dusky charges into Washington 's swank Mayflower Hotel . Few days later His Highness paid President Roosevelt a visit , his companions went rubbernecking about the Capital . But nobody checked in or out without notifying Courier Wagner . Between times he lolled in his suite , happily bibbing a double martini cradled in shaved ice . <P> For Frederick Norbert Wagner this was no novel assignment . Maharajas are his dish . Man and boy he had circled the globe 17 times with them , never flubbed a ticklish problem ( even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen and cooks , or the late Gaekwar of Baroda handed him keys for 468 pieces of luggage , weighing 17 tons ) . <P> Son of a Swiss chemist , Frederick Norbert Wagner contracted travelers ' itch " while my shirtwaist and trousers were still one piece . " At 17 he shipped to the U. S. After clerking for a shipping line , he landed a job in Cook 's London office . The World War found him skittering about as a British Intelligencer , an experience which brought him many a fruitful contact ( " I know all the little back doors " ) . <P> Meantime , the Cooks , who dearly loved royalty , had organized their Princes ' Department , agreed that backdoor-wise Wagner was the man to handle footloose Maharajas . His duties : booking hotel suites , dispensing funds ( Maharajas rarely carry a cent in their pantaloons ) , shooing away swindlers , for whom he has a keen nose . <P> Particularly proud of his medical knowledge is Courier Wagner , who has safaried with many a big game expedition through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three clients , however , were fanged by poisonous snakes . Courier Wagner brought them around by sucking their wounds , dusting them with permanganate crystals and pickling the victims in Scotch &; sodas ( usually a bad idea ) . <P> Courier Wagner 's longest tour of duty was 9 months on Copper Tycoon Daniel Cowan Jackling 's yacht . His most capricious clients are Englishmen . One hired him for a trip to the world 's coldest spot . He picked Yakutsk , Siberia . From a U. S. millionaire with a Napoleonic complex came his goofiest assignment : a tour of every Napoleonic landmark in Europe . They started in Corsica , wound up six months later on Elba . <P> Less whimsical , but equally sticktuitive are his present clients , who will keep him busy till November . Courier Wagner will then be free to join his wife in London , whence they will repair to Switzerland on their annual winter holiday . <P> One fine day he aims to write his memoirs .
