Appointed last week to the newly created post of unifier of the Communist Party 's Press Section and the Soviet Union 's Propaganda &; Agitation Department was Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov , 42 . Comrade Zhdanov , noted for his purging zeal , during the past year has been one of Boss Stalin 's two top assistants in the Communist Party 's secretariat . <P> The Soviet Union has put increasing emphasis on provoking a proletarian revolution in other , preferably neighboring , countries . " Internationalism is inseparable from patriotism ! " last week screamed Komsomolskaya Pravda , newsorgan of the Young Communist League . " The extermination of the capitalist environment is possible only as a result of a victorious proletarian revolution in at least several countries . " <P> But before another 24 hours had passed , five of the principal executives of the Young Communist League had been ousted . Next day Komsomolskaya Pravda , under changed editorial direction , was explaining that the League 's former leaders had been indifferent toward the welfare of good Young Communists but had protected " inveterate drunkards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally corrupt . " The net of this seemed to be that the exuberant Youth paper had taken a little too enthusiastically the Dictator 's plump for World Revolution two weeks before . With Unifier Zhdanov on the job , the Party press and the Government propaganda agency will get a better idea of what each other is up to .
