RUBY AND CAMELIA A STORY BY BILL ADAMS FIRST heard of them from our small daughter Dumpling , who met Camelia on the day school opened in the little town of Almond Vale to the neigh ? borhood of which we had lately moved ; our new home a short distance outside the city limits . " What does Camelia 's father do ? " my wife asked Dumpling . " She has n't got one . She 's only got a mother , " replied Dumpling . " What does her mother do , dear ? " inquired my wife . " Just takes care of Camelia , " Dumpling replied and added , " She 's not really her mother . She 's her big sister , Camelia just calls her ' mother ' . " " That 's rather sweet , " said my wife . And it did seem a bit touching . We had n't seen Ruby or Camelia , but could picture them . An elder sister ( Dumpling said , " She 's about thirty or something " ) caring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . We saw them when we went to church next Sunday . Camelia , a pale child of fourteen , looked undernourished . Ruby , a plump flaccid-looking woman in her early thirties , with a downtrodden air and mournful eyes , looked like a meek fish . During the service we found that they were not all alone in the world . While the minister offered a prayer for Bradford Charnwood , her brother in a tax-supported free sanatorium a hundred and seventy miles away in the mountains , Ruby mopped her eyes and sobbed . We felt more than ever touched . When we reached our car after church Ruby was at its door waiting for us . " I 'm real glad to meet you folks , " she said , and appeared to mean it . And she added , " Your big girl 's the age for my Sunday school class . Maybe you 'd like to have her come . " We thought it rather noble of her to be taking a Sunday school class , with a little sister to care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and I are very busy people . My wife , a college professor , drives daily seventeen miles to her work . I am at my desk till noon , after which there is a great deal to do on our two-acre place . The cow , chickens , ducks , and pigeons have to be cared for on Sunday just as on other days . We were starting a vegetable garden and hoped to have some flowers also . My wife explained to Ruby that even to get to church took a good deal of planning , since we like to stay a little later in bed on Sunday . To get Dumpling to Sunday school an hour earlier would not be possible unless we drove her in , which , since it would necessitate our making two trips if we were to go to church ourselves , was out of the question . And then she asked Ruby , " Can we drive you home ? " We knew from Dumpling that they lived only a little way from us . As Ruby seated herself I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by us . Naturally people without a ' car would take it as a matter of course that a neighbor who lived close by and had one should drive them . Yet Ruby 's manner seemed to imply that the car was rightly as much hers as ours . But then I have a rather vivid imagination , and I felt somewhat ashamed when we set them down before a shabby little house on all sides of which weeds grew in rank profusion . My wife caught my eye as Ruby stepped from the car , and , getting the meaning of her upraised brow , I nodded acquiescently . When we moved to Almond Vale we brought . a maid with us . After three days the maid took her departure . We had been trying in vain to get another . Maids will not go seventeen miles into the country , even though there is a town with a movie theater close by . " Do you ever work ? " asked my wife of Ruby in her most politely tentative tones . " Oh , yes ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate reply . " We 're looking for help in the house , " said my wife . " I pay my maid forty-five dollars a month . She has time off from Saturday noon till Monday noon . I send the laundry out and I make the butter and attend to the milk myself before I leave home to go to my work . The children are away from eight o'clock till three-thirty or four every day except Saturday and Sunday . When they are at home they are not allowed to be nuisances . We seldom have company and when we do have more than two people I either get extra help or pay my maid something additional . " " I 'd think you ought n't to have any trouble at all getting good help , " remarked Ruby encouragingly . " I was wondering if perhaps you would consider the place , " said my wife . " I could n't . I have to stay home and take care of Camelia , " came the instant reply . " I 've had maids who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd care to think it over , I 'm sure we could arrange for you to have Camelia with you . " " I have to be very careful of sister . I just dare n't neglect her at all for a minute . She 's not strung , and with my poor brother like he is , she 'll be all I have before very long , I 'm afraid , " replied Ruby , wiping away a tear . " I 'm so sorry for you ! " exclaimed my wife , her own troubles put out of mind . " If ever there 's anything we can do to help you you must let us know at once . " " I 'm real glad to meet you folks . It 's a hard world for a poor woman all alone , " said Ruby , with a large tear in each meek eye . " I 'm worried about them . Camelia looks as if she does n't get enough to eat , " said my wife as we were driving home . On Tuesday we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . " I bet she 's got a cold or something . Her nose was running yesterday . I had to lend her my new handkerchief , the embroidered one I got for my birthday , " said Dumpling . " You should n't lend other children your handkerchief , " remonstrated my wife . And then she put a dozen of the day 's eggs and a two-quart jar of fresh milk and a pint of cream and the pound of butter she had made before starting to work that morning into a basket and asked me if I 'd mind taking it over to Ruby . Ruby appeared so quickly when I rapped that it seemed as though she must have been expecting me . " My wife sent you a few little things for Camelia . I hope you wo n't mind accepting them , " I said . With one hand she pushed open the screen door a little , and with the other reached for the basket . Without a word she shut the door and took the basket into the house  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery boy . " Do you think she was glad to have the things ? " asked my wife when I got home . " I do hope she was n't offended at my sending them . " " It seemed , from her manner , that they belonged to her anyway , " said I. " Poor thing ! She was probably terribly embarrassed , " said my wife . On Saturday afternoon the minister called on us . " You look very tired , " said my wife . And he did look very tired . " Being tired 's part of a minister 's job , " he replied with a cheery smile . " I drove Miss Charnwood up to see her sick brother in the mountains Iast night and did n't get home till close to three o'clock this morning . " " Where 's Camelia ? " inquired my wife . " Camelia 's staying with that old couple who live a little way up the road from them , " replied the minister . " Miss Charnwood will be back on Monday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " Dumpling had spoken of the old couple . The Dornbacks kept a cow and a pig and chickens , and worked all their spare time in their vegetable garden . They were both rather deaf and suffered from rheumatism . When the minister was gone my wife said , " It 'll be very slow for Camelia with those old people . Suppose you go over and tell them we 'll be glad to have her till Ruby gets back . " The Dornbacks told me that they 'd promised to keep Camelia , and would n't feel right to make other arrangements without Ruby 's consent . So I said to Camelia , " When your sister gets home you tell her we 'll be glad to have you stay with us any time she wants to go and see your brother . " On the Saturday following , Ruby appeared at our door with Camelia who carried a little brown-paper parcel . " Camelia told me you folks wanted her to come and live with you , so I 'm going up to see my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on Monday morning , I suppose , " asked my wife . " I thought I 'd stay a week or maybe two weeks . I do so need a good rest , " Ruby replied . " I 'm fearfully sorry , " demurred my wife , " but we still have no maid , you see ; and I 'm afraid it would be too much to ask my husband to take the responsibility of an extra child for so long . He has to get our dinner , you see , and get the breakfast too before seeing our children off to school after I go in the morning . We 'd be glad to have Camelia till Monday morning though of course . " " Then I suppose I 'll have to be back Monday , " sighed Ruby , bestowing upon me a rather cold look . " Where does she get the money for a round-trip fare ? The church surely ca n't pay it continually , " said my wife , when Ruby was gone . " Better be careful . Camelia will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got plenty of money . We got our relief money yesterday , " piped up Camelia , who already had overheard . " Let me see what you have in the parcel , dear , " said my wife . Camelia opened the parcel in which was a soiled nightgown . " Did n't you bring a hair brush , dear ? " asked my wife . " Mother took the hair brush , " replied Camelia . " And did she take the tooth brush too , dear ? " inquired my wife . " We do n't have a tooth brush , " answered Camelia . Save that she ate very slowly , so that all our meals were delayed , and was very finicky about what she ate , Camelia was very little trouble . My wife took pains to make a custard with plenty of fresh eggs and new milk . There were vegetables straight from the garden . She did n't like custard and she did n't like vegetables . " What do you and mother eat , dear ? " asked my wife . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and we always have candy for dessert . We like chocolate candy best , " Camelia promptly answered . " Do n't you ever have any milk , dear ? " continued my wife . " The Dornbacks give us milk if we fetch it , but mother 's mostly too tired to go for it and we do n't like it anyway , " came the reply . My wife had to wash Camelia 's hair before she used Dumpling 's hair brush , and put her into a new nightgown just bought for Dumpling , and buy her a tooth brush , which . despite urging , she failed to use . At half-past ten on Monday night Ruby appeared . I had expected her in the early forenoon . We had put Camelia to bed at nine o'clock . " I thought you folks would n't mind keeping sister just through Monday . It was so nice in the mountains and I did so need the rest , " explained Ruby . " Now that she 's in bed , she 'd better stay there till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no We often sit up and listen to the radio lots later than this , " replied Ruby . So my wife woke Camelia , who came from her bedroom in Dumpling 's nightgown . " See the pretty new nightie I 've got , motherl " said Camelia . " It 's real nice of you folks to give sister a new nightie , " said Ruby . And away they went , with Dumpling 's new nightie and Camelia 's old nightie washed and ironed ; and as they went down the porch steps Ruby called back , " It 's real nice to have a place I can always leave sister when I want to go to see my poor brother and get a little rest . " My wife was cleaning out her chicken house next Saturday afternoon . She gets home at noon on Saturday . Dumpling and I were whitewashing the roosts . It was a very hot afternoon at the end of a very hot week . My wife , who is always rather tired by Saturday , does not enjoy cleaning the chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it would not be economical . She had on a ragged old dress , and a pair of downtrodden shoes . Pieces of litter and old feathers clung to her skirt . There was dust in her hair . There was a step on the graveled path outside . The chicken-house door opened and Camelia looked in . " You do n't have any chickens do you , dear ? I should think that mother 'd keep a few . It 's so nice to have fresh eggs , " said my wife tiredly . Shaded by a wide-brimmed cheap straw hat , Ruby 's meek face appeared behind Camelia . " The Dornbacks wanted to give me six hens , but I could n't take them . I never could stand the smell of a chicken house , " said Ruby . " You tellthem what we came for , sister , " she added , backing away with a hand to her sensitive nose and brushing a feather from her sleazy flowered rayon skirt . " Can Dumpling come to the movies with us ? " asked Camelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ? " asked my wife , rather surprised . Maybe once a month my wife and I go to a movie . Once a month seems to be about as often as we can afford . " Not very often , " replied Camelia . " How often 's not very often , dear ? " inquired my wife . " Sometimes only once a week , " answered Camelia . " I 'm afraid Dumpling ca n't go . She 's spent all her week 's allowance , " said my wife . " Oh , that 's all right . Mother 'll pay , " retorted Camelia . " I 'm afraid that would be taking advantage of mother , " suggested my wife . " Mother 's got plenty of money . We got our relief money this morning . " " I 'm afraid I must keep Dumpling at home to-day , dear , " said my wife . We met Ruby and Camelia after church next day . They were waiting at our car when we reached it . " How was your Sunday school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine ! " replied Ruby , and added all in the same breath , " We saw the best movie yesterday ! I wish you 'd let your girl come . I wanted to pay you back for keeping sister . " " Oh , that 's all right . Maybe there 'll be some little thing you can do for us sometime , " replied my wife . We set them down at the shabby little house on every side of which grew tall weeds in rank profusion . " It 's wonderfully rich soil . Anything one plants will grow in it . All that 's necessary is to drop in the seeds and give them a little water and attention now and then , " suggested my wife . " If I did n't have to take such care of Camelia maybe I 'd try to plant a garden , though I 'm not very strong , " said Ruby mournfully . During the week my wife unexpectedly had an afternoon with no classes and was home soon after noon . Jackie , our sixyear-old , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be out till three-thirty . If we picked . up Jackie we could hurry into the city , get some much-needed shopping done before the stores closed , have something to eat , and be home comfortably , if we were lucky , by very little after her regular bedtime . But we could n't go off and leave Dumpling to come home to find no one in , and to go without supper till our possibly delayed arrival . We could take her out of school of course ; but to do that was against our principles . " I 've got it ! " exclaimed my wife , " I 'll send Jackie over to Ruby 's with a note to ask if she 'll keep Dumpling till we come for her . Then we can ' phone the school and get word to Dumpling to go straight to Ruby 's as soon as she 's out . " We were not able to go into the city for our sorely needed shopping . Jackie brought back word that Ruby had to go into the city herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be . Also we wondered about Camelia . There was no train back from the city till after ten o'clock . " Where 's Camelia this afternoon ? " asked my wife , when Dumpling came in at four . " She quit school at noon and went home , " replied Dumpling . " They 've gone window shopping in the city . " The round-trip fare for one passenger by the little electric railway that runs between Almond Vale and the city is ninety-two cents . On the following Saturday the minister called on us . I accompanied him to his car when he went . In the back seat was a large box of fancy peaches . " Fine fruit ? " said I. " Yes , is n't it ? " he replied . " One of my congregation asked me to leave it at Miss Charnwood 's . It 's the best variety for canning . Ruby and Camelia will have canned peaches enough for all winter , poor girls . " But , though on the shelves of her screen porch were some dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received full from various church members , Ruby did not can the peaches . In the tear of her house was a heavily laden old tree of the same variety . Camelia came over one day with a note for my wife . " I thought maybe you folks 'd like to can the peaches off our tree . There 'll be enough for all of us all winter . If you 'll do the picking I 'll be glad to let you have the fruit in return for half of it canned . " We did not accept the offer . Together with those delivered by the minister , the peaches rotted . Again there came a Sunday when the minister prayed for Bradford . This time he asked also that strength be given Ruby to bear her affliction . She mopped her meek eyes and sobbed while the congregation glanced sorrowfully her way . After the service she was surrounded by sympathetic women . The Almighty Himself got scarcely more notice than did Ruby that Sunday . It seemed that the latter part of the minister 's prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our car when we reached it . Again we drove them home . Despite ourselves , we felt in a strange way sorry for Ruby . With Bradford gone , there would be no more free trips to the mountains , no more being publicly prayed for . A little while later Bradford died . We did not go to the funeral . It was on an afternoon when my wife was able to be at home . We were cleaning her chicken house when the slow procession passed . Bradford 's body had been sent home by the county , the taxpayers footing its fare . The church was paying for its burial . With Camelia beside her , an embroidered handkerchief at her eyes , Ruby sat very upright mopping her meek cheeks in the back seat of the big shiny car owned and driven by the Sunday school superintendent , its rear windows wide open that all might see . " How 's Ruby ? " inquired my wife , when Dumpling came in next day ; having on her way from school stayed to visit Camelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's swell ! " exclaimed Dumpling . " She 's reading the front page of the Almond Vale Echo and of the county newspaper too . She 's reading them over and over , out loud to Camelia . There 's a piece about their brother 's funeral on the front page of both . " My wife and I have never made the local , let alone the county paper . Though our names are in Who 's Who , not yet have we achieved that distinction . On the following day , having again visited Camelia , Dumpling arrived in great excitement . " Gee , they 've only got six dollars in the whole world ! " " Where did they get the six dollars ? " asked my wife . " The teachers chipped in and raised it for them to-day , " replied Dumpling . " Camelia took it home in her handkerchief ; the embroidered one I got for my birthday . It 's the only one she 's got and the six dollars is all the money they 've got in the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I could n't say . It depends on how they spend it , dear , " replied my wife , and added , " It was nice of the teachers . The Almond Vale teachers get very meager salaries , and had another cut just lately . " That night there was showing at the Almond Vale movie house a picture that my wife and I had long wanted to see . We talked over whether we could affordit and decided that we could not . But , since it was said to be the best picture of the year , we at last decided that we would , even though the price of admission was higher than for other pictures . My wife 's hens were laying well . The cow had had a calf , and was giving three gallons of rich milk a day . Our vegetable patch was producing very nicely , and we had canned fruit enough for all winter . We were a little late starting . " No , Dumpling , " remonstrated my wife , " we have n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we 'd not . We ca n't afford candy whenever you feel Iike it , dear . " " The loges are all taken . I 'm sorry the only seats left are in the back row of the balcony , " said the girl in the booth when we bought our tickets . " That 'll be all right , thank you , " said I and added , " we never blow ourselves for the loges anyway . " With Dumpling in the lead , we started up the stairs . Suddenly Dumpling stopped . " Gee , thanks ! " exclaimed Dumpling . With Camelia beside her in the front row of loges , Ruby , in her sleazy flowered rayon , held out to us with one soft hand a box of drug-store chocolates , while with the other she gently fanned her meek face with a new five-and-ten fan . " We always like candy when we go to a movie , " said Ruby , and added sympathetically , " Too bad you folks were n't in time to get nice seats . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
