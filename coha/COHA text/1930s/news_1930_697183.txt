This is- a poetic version of an earlier prose essay which found in such desire itself the only assurance and evidence of unseen things and of conscious immortality . Beauty has not written her testimony in more persuasive philosophy or in more enticing phrase . Science has made its contributions of fact that have furnished new languages in which to present the movements and moods of human life ; and Nature ever teaches man by beauty , though he often wonders why Nature , being so " inexhaustible of beauty , " should not be " all beam teous .
