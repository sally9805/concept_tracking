In rural North Carolina  --  and most Southern States for that matter  --  we begin to think about the Lord when late July and August come . Crops are laid by  --  corn hilled and cotton ploughed for the last time , even tobacco-curing held in abeyance  --  and every little church from Bethel to Shiloh is rocked for a week by the fighting paradox of God and the Devil . Then it is that the way of the transgressor grows hard . Little children are herded terrified into the fold , the drunkard denies his dram , the profane man softens his speech , and shy , tough-knotted old fellows with land lawsuits greet each other gently as " Brother . " Then too the way of the chicken grows hard . He is slaughtered by the thousands and his plucked feathers blown heavenward by the impersonal winds . The smoke-house suffers its onslaughts , the bin is visited and revisited , the pig is snatched and barbecued , the watermelon and " mushmelon " patches are devastated . The tired housewife sings " Blessed be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , and the farmer 's last dollar is pleaded forth from its hiding-place . For now it is that the preachers are abroad in the land . And now too the city cousins and kin are down like Assyrian kings to eat and talk of the pleasures of farming and the open air  --  and to attend " big-meeting . " Through it all the providing farmer moves quiet and subdued , comforted by the presence of the men of God and vaguely hoping to profit somehow thereby . He listens to the blarney of the city-bred , his impassive face concealing the superiority he knows is his . To the preachers he is all respect and gentleness . And bless God , even when he suspects their thievery and quackery , he comforts himself that the True Message can never be contaminated by scurvy containers  --  a metaphysic St. Thomas himself could not surpass  --  and accordingly under all pomp and circumstance his faith remains . There are exceptions , of course  --  for instance one of the farmers depicted in this piece . But all glory to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of Piers the Plowman when the land was likewise overrun by heavenly grafters was the burden borne more dutifully and stoically . But wonderful cures were wrought then and wonderful cures are wrought now , and the response now as then remains a general and irrational " hallelujah . " And these gentlemen go their rounds and will go . Let them . They saved me and they may save others  --  preachers thin and wan and holy ; preachers fat , oily and unctuous ; preachers dashing and handsome crying out with pleasurable anguish the story of their red-light days  --  God wot ; preachers Hebraic , awful and thundering . They will go their way in the service of imagination and the Lord . Thanks be Where is he who used to leave his photograph to delight the daughters ?  --  it meets me now from many a country mantelpiece  --  He is still doing the Lord 's work and passing the plate to pay the photographers .

Let us continue to feed and clothe them and leave the subtlety of an ethic to furnish them forth to action . For fairies and fierce convictions are salty savor to a land . So it is as the curtain rises on LANIE ENNIS sweating up supper on a hot August evening for a carnivorous man of God . She is a rather pretty young country woman , neatly and plainly dressed , with large babyish blue eyes and a quick bird-like step . From behind a door on the left come desultory sounds of a booming voice lifted in exclamations , snatches of song and hallelujahing . LANIE stands listening a moment with a steaming dish of food in her hands . She places the food on the table and waits , abstractedly fingering the chain of a locket around her throat . VOICE Within . Hallelujah , hallelujah . p. 3 LANIE Softly . Hallelujah ! The sound of her own voice seems to wake her from her abstraction and she moves swiftly through an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the darkness . Come on to supper , Walt ! A VOICE Near at hand , outside . I 'm coming . LANIE turns back into the room and goes into the kitchen at the rear . WALT enters at the right , carrying a bucket . He is a hot sunburned young farmer below medium height , slender and wiry and with a steel-like hardness about him . WALT Got any slops for the pigs , Lanie ? LANIE They 's some pot liquor there by the stove . He disappears into the kitchen . The voice at the left is quiet and LANIE goes to the door and calls . Supper 's ' bout ready , Brother Simpkins . VOICE Thankee , sister , thankee . WALT Reappearing with his bucket . How long ' fore you 're ready to eat ? LANIE Soon 's the coffee boils . WALT I 'll be back in a minute then . He starts out at the right and then stops . Wo n't he be too late for service ? p. 4 LANIE Working rapidly about the table . Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but immediately returns and sits down in a chair near the door . LANIE Ai n't you going to feed the pigs ? WALT Are you going to the church tonight ? LANIE I cai n't miss the last meeting . BROTHER SIMPKINS Within . Hallelujah , hallelujah , glory ! He begins singing and clapping his hands . WALT Makes more racket than usual . LANIE Quickly . He 's thinking of all the sinners that 'll not be saved . With a catch in her voice . Might be singing with you in his mind , Walt . WALT Better change his tune then . LANIE Oh , Walt ! WALT Yeh , and he had . LANIE All of them preachers and them prayers ai n't made no impression on you . WALT Made a impression on my smokehouse all right . Been feeding Brother Simpkins for the last week . That 's a eating white man , I 'm here to tell you . p. 5 LANIE We 'd ort to count it a privilege to feed him . WALT sits looking at the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . BROTHER SIMPKINS is heard washing himself in a basin , splashing and blowing the water through his hands . LANIE All the evening I been thinking about that song  --  " Why not tonight ? " Chanting in a childlike voice . " Tomorrow 's sun may never rise , To bless thy long deluded sight " WALT Do n't worry about me . LANIE But I cai n't help it . WALT And I 'm worried about a heap of other folks myself . He gives LANIE a sharp look . LANIE You 're ' bout the only sinner in the neighborhood not saved . WALT Naw , your daddy 'll keep me company . LANIE He got saved this evening , and went home shouting . WALT Good gracious ! LANIE And he stood up in the church and testified every single mean thing he 'd ever done . WALT He could n't a-done that . p. 6 LANIE Oh , Walt , tonight 's the last night and wo n't you go ? WALT A bit sharply . You 've been enough for both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and the world and now  --  She raises her face to heaven . WALT Ah ! He sits looking at her mournfully and then picks up his bucket and goes quickly out and down the steps . BROTHER SIMPKINS comes through the door at the left carrying a Bible in his hand . He is a dark bearded man of middle age , heavy-set , with a bloated ignorant face , but somewhat kindly withal . He is dressed in a thin black seersucker suit , a celluloid collar with an enormous white tie . BROTHER SIMPKINS In a deep throaty voice , hoarse from thundering in the pulpit . Ah , sister , he 's unworthy . LANIE I du n no  --  BROTHER SIMPKINS Coming close to her . I 've told you  --  Suddenly opening the Bible and pointing to a verse . Read there  --  it 's the message again , coming another way  --  plain  --  plain . Reading in a low vehement voice . " For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are of one . " His eyes bore into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 LANIE Yes , yes . BROTHER SIMPKINS Ah , you are sanctified  --  the seal is on your forehead  --  pure and holy . He bends quickly and kisses her . LANIE Oh  --  I  --  BROTHER SIMPKINS It is written in Corinthians , one , one and two , " They that are sanctified are called the saints . " And the saints are those saved forever , sealed for the rapture , and they can do no harm . LANIE I know it , I feel it  --  BROTHER SIMPKINS Amen ! WALT comes abruptly in again with his bucket . WALT Forgot to put any meal in these slops . He brings a dipper of meal from the kitchen , pours it into the bucket and stirs it . BROTHER SIMPKINS How ye tonight , Brother Ennis ? WALT Tired  --  How 're you ? BROTHER SIMPKINS Bless God I 'm carrying on happy towards the Glory Land . LANIE moves around the table arranging supper , now and then looking at WALT with a puzzled expression . WALT With sudden admiration in his voice . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 8 BROTHER SIMPKINS Nothing but sinful clay . LANIE looks at him with undisguised admiration . WALT 's eyes narrow a bit . God gave me a big voice and a big body to use in his vineyard and I 've brung him big harvest for twenty year . WALT He 's proud of you , I bet . BROTHER SIMPKINS Softly . Hanh  --  And the biggest harvest of all has been gathered here in this neighborhood these two weeks . WALT Kin you shoulder a sack of guano ? BROTHER SIMPKINS Well , I du n no  --  I ai n't  --  WALT They do n't have guano ' way off yonder where you come from , do they ? BROTHER SIMPKINS I du n no . My work has been in the church . WALT You was talking ' bout a vineyard . BROTHER SIMPKINS Perplexed . The Lord 's Vineyard . WALT Brother Simpkins , let me tell you something . BROTHER SIMPKINS Yes . WALT I can shoulder a sack of guano . LANIE Yes , he can . p. 9 BROTHER SIMPKINS Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right smart weight . WALT Yeh , it is . And that ai n't all . I can shoulder it standing in a half bushel peck-measure . BROTHER SIMPKINS Looking around him uncertainly . Yes , yes . WALT Pleasantly . I weigh a hundred and fifteen pounds . How much do you weigh , Brother Simpkins ? BROTHER SIMPKINS Two hundred and twenty . WALT A right smart weight . Lanie , you and Brother Simpkins better go ahead with your supper . I hear the folks starting their music over at the church . He gets up and goes out with his bucket . BROTHER SIMPKINS Seemed like your husband was making fun . LANIE No , he wo n't thinking of that . BROTHER SIMPKINS I fear he 'll never turn from his ways . LANIE We must do all we can this last night . BROTHER SIMPKINS After a moment , sternly . No . He 's refused again and again , and there 's nothing to be done . p. 10 LANIE Nervously . I du n no I 've tried to get him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be there . LANIE Yes  --  BROTHER SIMPKINS We 'll go straight on from the church . LANIE Sitting down in her chair by the table . Oh , I do n't see how I can do it . BROTHER SIMPKINS It 's the hand of God behind it . He 's sending us forth to labor together for bringing souls to the anxious seat , and set them forth in the morning light . LANIE Standing up , as he puts his arm around her . Yes , Yes BROTHER SIMPKINS Like a lily of the valley , a sister of mercy . He kisses her and strokes her hair . Unto such glory thou wilt go . LANIE Her face shining . Wonderful , wonderful !  --  Is it fine there where we 're going ? BROTHER SIMPKINS Fine , fine , but sinful . The wastefulness of the rich , the pride of the haughty , the sweating and groaning of the poor and oppressed , injustice and crime , sin  --  sin  --  sin . The houses lift themselves up high to heaven , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk and finery , lights and crowds and moving , moving , moving down the devil 's sinful road . I 've stood on the streets there and cried : Repent , repent , remember Sodom and Gomorrah ! Like them sunken cities they pay no heed  --  but you and me 'll go back there , go back there and keep crying : Repent ! p. 11 LANIE Keep crying repent , and they will repent . Slipping out of his arms . Oh , but people will think hard of me , I 'm afraid . BROTHER SIMPKINS They had n't ought to . LANIE No , they ca n't , they wo n't , and me going with you , will they ? Looking up at him suddenly . But I ai n't told him yet . BROTHER SIMPKINS You must n't tell him maybe . LANIE But you 've preached about deceiving . BROTHER SIMPKINS I do n't know . I been thinking while ago he talked funny , like he already knew something . LANIE You will explain everything , I know you will . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields comes the pulsating rhythm of the meeting 's song . BROTHER SIMPKINS raises his face in a ragged smile . BROTHER SIMPKINS Hear Brother Jackson 's voice  --  hallelujah , amen ! LANIE Softly . Amen . BROTHER SIMPKINS Moving up and down the room . That great old song , how they sing it ! Listening . There 's Sister Eason 's alto , and Sister Jernigan 's soprano rising to heaven in the night . Amen , amen , give ' em power , hold up Brother Jackson 's arms , touch his tongue with fire , amen , amen . Let him prepare the way , for tonight I come with the power . p. 12 LANIE Watching him in loving terror . Hallelujah ! BROTHER SIMPKINS Joining in the far-away song with a roar . " As I journey thro the land , singing as I go , Pointing souls to Calvary  --  to the crimson flow , Many arrows pierce my soul  --  from without , within  --  " He suddenly flings out his arms , turning upon LANIE . Yes , tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing can . I 'll sweep on , move everything before me with you at my side . LANIE Her gestures hypnotically beginning to resemble his . Yes , yes . BROTHER SIMPKINS Singing . " On the streets of Glory let me lift my voice , Cares all past , Home at last , Ever to rejoice . " LANIE Joining in with a high piping voice . " When in valleys low I look towards the mountain height . " BROTHER SIMPKINS Yea , yea , sealed for the rapture . Brokenly . Lanie , Lanie ! Hurt not the earth , neither the sea nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads . p. 13 LANIE Chanting and staring at him wide-eyed . Sealed and set unto the day of redemption . BROTHER SIMPKINS Glory ! LANIE With a sharp hysterical giggle . Hallelujah . BROTHER SIMPKINS Shouting . The power , the blessing coming down ! LANIE Moaning . I cai n't stand it no more , I cai n't stand it  --  BROTHER SIMPKINS Pour out , pour it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like buckets of water , let it come down , let it come down drenching us , flooding us . LANIE Springing up and down in the room , her face set in a sort of mask . Let it come down , let it come down  --  give it to me , give it to me  --  give  --  give  --  give  --  BROTHER SIMPKINS Jumping to his feet and prancing back and forth as he throws his hands above his head . Glory  --  glory  --  glory  --  glory . Give it to us  --  gloryglorygloryglory  --  rrry . His words pass into a frenzy of senseless sounds . **28;996;TOOLONG **35;1026;TOOLONG  --  He shudders , closes his eyes , swings his head from side to side , his lip fluttering in a flood of sound . **25;1063;TOOLONG  --  whizzem-whizzem  --  loki-loki  --  p. 14 LANIE Fluttering towards him and stretching out her arms before her .

BROTHER SIMPKINS Hah-hah-hah . LANIE Laughing in oblivion . Hee-hee-hee . BROTHER SIMPKINS closes his eyes , a smile spreads over his face , and he falls to whistling a thumping barbaric tune to which their heels click rhythmically against the floor . LANIE closes her eyes and abandons herself to him . They whirl up and down the floor faster and faster . Now and then the whistled tune is punctuated by a shout or scream . BROTHER SIMPKINS With a blood-curdling yell . Yee-ee-ee-h ! LANIE **30;1129;TOOLONG ! Presently WALT rushes in at the right and stops thunderstruck . WALT Shouting . Heigh , you ! Stop that !

I thought you 'd done enough o that unknown tongue business at the church without doing it here . LANIE Everything looks so purty . Walt , Walt , I love everybody . Your face is so purty . She springs up and throws her arms around his neck . He fights her away from him . Oh , I wisht you could see how purty this room is . WALT Have you gone plumb crazy ? LANIE drops into her chair and begins to cry softly , her body quivering and jerking. p. 16 BROTHER SIMPKINS Twisting and looking around him . I must get on to the church  --  we must get on . WALT Yeh , and I reckon so . From the sound of it they 's a big outpouring over there and you 'd do better to spill yours there .

WALT She ai n't fitten to go nowheres till she 's had some supper . LANIE Quavering . Le 's all set down and eat .
