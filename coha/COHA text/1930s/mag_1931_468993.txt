PRACTICALLY every article on the Jewish question gives offense . This one , far from being an exception , is likely to offend more than most . Let me state , therefore , at the outset that it is not the sort of subject one writes about for fun . Or for money . There are plenty of other subjects , controversial subjects , in which the limits of possible injury to either side are fairly understood , and no vital hurt is likely to befall . But this subject is different . It is like one of those quarrels between lovers arising from some trifle that suddenly flares up in symbolic significance of deep and radical division , in which love and life may irretrievably go down . None the less , every student of Western culture , especially American culture , has at some time to wrestle with it . The existence of the Jewish people is a perpetual challenge to the Gentile world . The subject follows where other subjects are left behind . It will not be ignored . I look out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out over farmlands and townships and the distant river , to where the hills range couchant in their eternally arrested leap toward the west . A train is crawling by the river ; very faintly the noise of it comes through sunny space to me in my sea of rocks and last year 's leaves . Now the smoke is gone ; the noontide silence falls again . . . and my mind goes back to those other hills , six thousand miles away , from which the patriarch first looked westward toward the sea , and to the blessing his ordeal in those same hills won for him . " In blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven . . . and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed . " Does it sound , here in twentieth-century America , a little ironical ? Well , we have stopped killing Jews because we do not like their faces . And very gradually and partially both they and we are ceasing to teach hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these achievements , negative as they are , let us be thankful . But it almost seems as if , for every mitigation of the estranging factors in the conscious sphere , they assert themselves the more powerfully in the sub-rational ways of group and individual living . It is all to the good , no doubt , that the problem should be aired ; but all the while it is growing in magnitude and in complexity , and I doubt whether all the discussion makes much impression on it . It is not that sort of a problem . If it were , it would have been solved long ago . Instead , the pressure on the Jewish people in America all the time is increasing . The average Gentile does not know how insistent , how ubiquitous this pressure is . He does not have to know . But let him reflect , and much of it becomes knowledge so common as to be taken for granted . He instantly ? and as a rule , obviously ? tightens up when he finds himself in business dealings with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to good-will which often he makes up by other means , willy-nilly . Non-Jews perpetuate the distinction by their unwillingness to work with or for him . His Gentile customers assume an apologetic attitude to one another and seldom recommend him to their acquaintances . But suppose our tradesman prospers none the less and cherishes ambitions for his children . Bright children they are likely to be , and for that reason alone subject to some suffering from the herd-mindedness of the average classroom . But in addition , they have had from earliest years the sense of separation ground into them , positively in the home , negatively everywhere else . They can not from earliest years forget that this is not their civilization , not their nation , not their social system ? because nobody gives them a chance to forget . If it is to a private , instead of to a public school , that the children are to go ? children of professional parents , let us say ? their father will have the problem of finding not only a community in which he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school that will accept his offspring . How much of an added restriction that is , only those who have tried it realize . None the less , let the children emerge still able and undaunted and aspire to college . If they , or their parents for them , cherish social and cultural ambitions ( the two can hardly be separated , nor perhaps should they be ) the best they can hope for is to be accepted in a liberal college as Jews ? but always as Jews : in a sense , or to a degree , different from that applying to other foreigners . The physiognomic distinction may or may not be patent ; the difference derives from all that goes with that distinction on both sides . Certain select circles will be closed , not to the Jew as an individual ? whatever kind he may be ? but to the Jew as a Jew . The matter is fordone as it is for no other group whatever . A Nordic may , and frequently does , possess in full measure the less agreeable traits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to the Nordic they will not be an insuperable social barrier ? he will be given the chance , and a variety of incentives , to tone them down , with social success quite easily in view . But let a Jew exhibit exactly the same psychology ? the matter is ended : he is a Jew , and that is all there is to it . With college over , the question of career becomes urgent . And here we strike the gravest fact of all . While the Jewish rate of increase holds its own with that of other stocks , the sphere of possible employment has undergone a marked and deliberate restriction in recent years . To which of the professions shall the young Jew turn with ? let us not say an even chance , let us say a sporting chance ? of success ? Perhaps the law is still open ; but consider the competitive handicap if he would be a doctor , a dentist , a teacher , an accountant , anything that depends on general patronage . How much harder must he work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more humble pie must he eat , to get as far as his non-Jewish colleagues , merit for merit . Suppose he turns to finance . He will early discover the force of conscious anti-Semitism wherever the influence of one of our greatest banking houses may reach ? and that is very far . He will discover the extent to which that policy sets the tone of conservative firms everywhere . Bitterest of all , he will find a scarcely warmer welcome from many prominent firms of Jewish ownership , which prefer to attract Gentiles , if only for shop-window purposes . If of exceptional ability , he may be hired and put to work behind the scenes , where others will pick his brains for a remuneration held down by the narrowness of his alternative employments . Possibly ? probably indeed ? he will concentrate with success on the sole task of making money ; what else can he make ? From the standpoint of life , of personality , be will be luckiest if he can find a vocation that he can pursue mainly alone . We hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualism of the Jew ; but who can say how much of it is a forced habit , forced by the growing sentiment of extrusion ? And the number of strictly individual vocations in America is shrinking at a tremendous pace : not merely in business , finance , and the professions , but in art , letters , and science as well . The consequences are visible in the concentration of Jewish economic life in a few ? a very few ? secondary trades , and in the increasing severity of the struggle for career in the world at large . Other consequences which we shall presently consider are less visible . Let us glance first at certain other , less visible , factors in the segregation . No one may ignore the rise , or resurgence , of intellectual anti-Semitism since the War , with the Hitler movement in Germany as the peak of it . Every war brings some such resurgence , for the simple reason that the Jew is not good army material . As Maurice Samuel very candidly remarks , all this army business looks comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . War as the great game ( which it is ) appeals to him less than any other game . He never really appreciates its rules or its purposes , makes a difficult soldier and a tenacious pacifist , and is naturally about as congenial to the army man as is a camel to a horse . Still worse , he tends naturally to reject the entire conceptual outfit by which the Nordic renders war acceptable to himself ? and to his womenfolk ; and in such a matter rejection savors of treachery . Accordingly , the suspicion of treachery rises spontaneously aboutthe Jew in every national crisis , and fastens as if by magnetism on the smallest unorthodox act he may be tempted to commit . Consequently when , as in Russia , we find Jews suddenly acting by the light that is in them , treachery is the first and most fatal cry . Somewhat the same tendencies appear in the economic sphere . American as well as other states may indulge in defalcation or repudiation without incurring irredeemable moral stigma ; but let Jews repudiate , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibles . Of course they will . The rules of the game are liable to be ignored by the Jew ; the systems of Western economics and polities are in some measure matters of indifference to him . What more natural than that he should be subject to exceptional suspicion , exceptional hostility from people who value their own systems so much , or trust them so little , as to hate the very possibility of change ? II But there are other and more fundamental factors at work than the sporadic outbreaks of conscious anti-Semitism : forces of the blood , stronger and deeper than those brittle phantoms that we call ideas . And though these forces manifest themselves in conceptual forms , it is well to remember their origins lie deeper than the plane of argument . It is well to remember , because the circumstances of our time are bearing down upon the very roots of the schism between Jewish and Gentile spirituality . In trying to set forth the deeper levels of that schism , let me say frankly that I am speaking only to the initiates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be many on either side to contradict : that I know well . But even among those who will understand , some will regret that these things were not left unsaid , thinking no good can come of saying them . And these I hold in all respect , while it is to them I appeal . They may be right : no good may come ; but on the bare chance of better luck I , for my generation , must risk the offense . There is upon us a profound historical crisis that none who becomes conscious of it can ignore ; and though any one individual may be wrong , as a man sees the matter so he must speak ? be the cost to him what it may . Let me put the thing in a series of contrasts . First , then , there is the Contrast between the palpable loss of faith by the Nordics in their own culture and the Jewish genius for faith in theirs . I am not thinking merely of the campaigns of the radicals of each country directed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be . It is the lack of positive conviction , of creative conviction , behind them that is alone significant in this connection . And riot behind them only , nor mainly . Everywhere Western industrial democracy is on the defensive , not merely against its enemies without , but against the corrosion that is devouring its heart from within ; and more significant than the complaints of the radicals are the increasing signs of uneasiness among the leaders in business , in politics , in diplomacy , in thought . The mighty ruthlessness of the constructive period is gone , and with it the leadership of those days . Policy is everywhere vacillating , diplomacy spineless and mildly liberal ? whether from fear or good intentions ? and the courage of genuine conviction conspicuously absent . Postwar America has produced a literature of discontent that is almost unparalleled ; but even more striking than its volume is its lack of affirmation . The mere fact that men are discussing the survival of our culture as anopen question is more significant than what they say ; but their conclusions tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order suffers from a chronic and growing malaise , " writes that ex-champion of the Nordic , Mr. Lothrop Stoddard . " There is increasing dissatisfaction with what is , coupled with a restless and rather aimless search after the new . Faith decays . Lastly , men lose interest in many things hitherto deemed of vital import . . . . An impressive body of evidence from several distinct angles clearly tends to show that our civilization is nearing its end . " Not merely its accomplishments , but its ideals begin to pall . The sense of direction grows faint within us . The hands that built the machine are too weary to control it , the eyes too dim to hold the distant vision . Noisily and with frenetic capers we reaffirm our pride in our achievement ; but the voices lack conviction , the gestures seem a little ridiculous even while we make them . If we choose to look deeper , the best that science and philosophy have left to offer is a sterile neo-Stoicism . It is the fashion to disparage Spengler ? as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is in him ; but among more popular writers one may search a long time in vain for the note of confidence , of reassurance . Bertrand Russell 's position , for instance , finely as he puts it in " A Free Man 's Worship , " is hardly a sustaining one for the average man . Nor does John Dewey 's Quest for Certainty attain any final goal . " At the best , all our endeavors look toward the future and never attain certainty . The lesson of probability holds for all forms of activity as truly as for the experimental operations of science , and even more poignantly and tragically . " Philosophy must abandon " its guardianship of fixed realities , values and ideals " and find its role in application to the practical issues of a life from which the raison d ' ? tre has imperceptibly departed . It is true that science , having finally dissipated the world of everyday experience and expanded the universe in inconceivable dimensions , ends by assuring the layman that he may consider himself still at liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to be that kind of a person ; but for the sort of faith men live by , neither it nor philosophy has any firm ground to offer . Nor is there any longer in the Western mind the strength to utter a credo quia absurdum . And is the Jew differently placed or constituted in this respect ? It is both his curse and his blessing that he is . Stripped through the centuries of every chance to pin his hope on transitory values , purged by sword and fire of all the vested interests of corporate living , the Jew has a direct hold on life itself where the Nordic clutches it only with an apparatus of concepts , institutions , rationalized ends and purposes . For this reason it is not , generally speaking , within the power of the Jewish mind ? . as it certainly is within that of the Gentile ? to undermine the incentives to living . The thought of the Jew may be somber , pessimistic , tragic ; it is hardly ever decadent . His blood believes , Iet brain do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and die an apostate , the race in him utters from day to day its pragmatic affirmation . You will hear shrewd and cynical appraisal of men and motives oftener from Jewish lips than from Gentile ; but you will seldom hear , even of this civilization , the doubt , the disparagement , the denial of its hopes and ends that are common among Gentile intellectuals . As many Jews as Gentiles , no doubt , reject it ; but the Jewish rejection will more frequently have the strength of passion and hatred where the Gentile gets no farther than distaste , aversion , disillusion . For some of this difference race is no doubt responsible ; for some of it , history . I am not concerned here with causes . The dynamic outcome of the two factors is an element of Jewish psychology that I am tempted to call , at the risk of a contradiction in terms , pragmatic idealism . Pragmatic , because the experience of the Jews has been such that at no time did their faith , their hope , dare get far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; idealism , for lack of a better word , to imply the spirit that still finds life worth while when all its extrinsic sanctions have been denied or torn away . It is in virtue of this quality that the Jew has never been tempted to hope or believe too much . Give the Gentile a bit of new truth , and what does he do with it ? Not content with merely living it , he must needs spin out of it a whole series of concepts and theorems , which presently he will institutionalize and fashion into a System . With this System he will transform cultures , build empires , found schools of thought or religion or jurisprudence , and run energetically about the world proclaiming that all who do not believe in his System are damned irrevocably to a specially constructed part of the System called Hell ( every System has its Hell ) . That is the way of life ? for the Gentile . Consider what he did with the prophet of Galilee . Christianity never bothered itself much about understanding the poor prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the starting point for a new System , for the most staggering superstructure of metaphysics and theology that ever dazed mankind ? but a System , none the less , that made history . Now the System fails , breaks up , collapses , as sooner or later Systems do . The Jew quietly goes on living , unshaken , not even disillusioned ? and is hated for it . But the Jew was never tempted to put his faith in the extravagances of any such System . Three gods in one , vicarious atonements , transubstantiations , preelection , redemption , damnation ? the Jew could not attain such heights of Gentile architecture , though he tried hard at various times and places . He sat in the cellar , or the dungeon , or the gutter ? waiting and reviled . His god did not dwell on the summit of any such System . His god sat in the gutter with him . For it may truly be said that where the Nordic god is authority and sanction for the Nordic System , the Jewish god is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling . The god of the Jew is the way , the truth , and the life . The god of the Nordic is the rationalization of the Nordic will to power , the ultimate excuse for doing what that will to power dictates . Those who reject such things are forced to deny him . The Jew does not have to deny his god in order to achieve freedom . A similar contrast is revealed in a comparison of the Jewish ethic , not with that of Jesus , which is in the main a part of it , but with that of Christianity . The Jewish ethic is distinguished by its realism , its intense humanism . It grows out of experience and history , not out of metaphysics and theology . It does not demand the impossible in compliance with the postulates of an ultra-human system . It parts company from the Christian , not with Jesus , but with the abnormal ? supernormal , if you like ? Paul . For it is inspired by too deep a knowledge , too profound a love of ordinary human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and aspirations . True enough that the Christian record is studded with jewels which stand out in fantastic brilliance against the sense of sin and shortcoming which is necessary to keep the Christian soul at tension . But the heroes of the Jewish ethic do not have to be saints and ascetics ; and the man or woman of today has more to learn from Gluckel Hameln than from Saint Theresa . The Jewish symbolism speaks of a broad humanity rather than a narrow sainthood , of a pattern that accepts on equal terms all the fructifying possibilities of human nature . It does not inculcate the nerve-racking tension of Christian idealism ? compare , if you doubt it , the atmosphere of a " good " Christian family with that of a corresponding Jewish one . And for that reason the Jewish ethic shows a vitality , a persistence , in high contrast with that of the Christian West . Again , the dynamic West must deny its tradition in order to achieve freedom : the Jew can move and breathe freely in his own tradition without the agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows a momentous consequence . Gentile , particularly Nordic institutions , human enough in their origin , become under the architectural impulse of the West parts of the elaborate conceptual and social System that is Nordic civilization , with the result that as the breakup of that System approaches , they also suffer tremendous strain and are in fact faced with probable dissolution , notwithstanding that no substitutes may be discernible for the enduring needs they originally satisfied . Such imperiled institutions are , as is well known , marriage , parenthood , the family . Their disappearance is everywhere discussed , and in the great cities is actually in progress . The prospect is viewed both with equanimity and with apprehension , but it is nowhere denied . Among many other observers , Bertrand Russell , in a recent essay , admits it very frankly . Except within an economically privileged minority ? which perhaps will not be indefinitely toleratedvariety of places , some of them friendly rooms in which I could work without too much difficulty , some of them elaborately indifferent or frigidly hostile . If I strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generally the cheap rooms that are friendly ) I get out the few bits of things that are specifically me ( readers who have traveled a good deal will know what I mean ) and become tolerably at ease with myself . If the luck is against me I waste some time wondering what is the matter and just what can be done to put it right , before the room finally expels me ? a depressing experience that I can not always explain to my friends or my hosts , whom in consequence I frequently annoy . But none of these rooms is mine . None ? " be it ever so humble " ? is what I would have made it . . . . When I was at Cambridge I belonged to a club called The Ishmaelites , whose only obvious justification was the indulgence of certain simple appetites plus an unusually flagrant blazer , but whose real basis was that it consisted solely of stray people who stood in pretty much the relation to the university that the name implied . Perhaps if we had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , I think we were merely a mild joke among clubs and occasionally a collective nuisance to the authorities . Such people always are . Now magnify this type of experience several million times and run it back over nigh on two thousand years . Postulate , at the root of it , a blood that is one of the purest in the world , and a tradition that has survived several civilizations and is in at least some respects stronger than the one in which it lives now . Throw in , for good measure , a fiercely cherished memory of enmity and oppression triumphantly endured through many centuries . Add to all that the intolerable humiliation of being tolerated , the perennial affront of being patronized . And then state , if you can , in words of one syllable , the sort of psychological outcome you have to deal with ! Good heavens ? watch the poor British scholar when after an exhausting tour of the States he goes up from Portland on the Vancouver boat and comes across the obviously British bobby on Victoria Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expands within him . Watch the small-town American when his delighted eyes rediscover Woolworth 's in the heart of London , or contemplate pityingly the English fumbling with the new traffic lights in Oxford Street . " Mine ! " he feels , and his soul expands within him . . . . What is it like , do you suppose , gentle reader , to go through life , through generations of life , without once finding occasion for that simple ego-maximation , that natural and naive release of self-esteem , in the outward and visible trappings of the world one lives in ? How intense , do you suppose , is likely to be the throwback upon all that is peculiarly one 's own in the inward things ? How jealously , can you imagine , will the tradition of those things be guarded , how passionate a reassurance will it harbor , how unfathomably deep a pride ? Therein lies the real danger to Zionism : that as release it may be too successful , and add yet another neonationalism to a world that is already distraught with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spring , was frank as to the peril of it . " As Israel is scattered and dispersed , as the destiny of the overwhelming majority of Jews is to remain in the midst of peoples of different racial heritage , and as even if the hopes of the neo-nationalists were realized only a very small minority of the Jews could live a national life on their own soil , the theory of nationalistic self-isolation is not only false as to Jewish ideals , but is disastrous as to Jewish rights and interests . " But he might have added ? perhaps in his heart he did ? a prayer for the success of the Zionists in their real , their unheard-of enterprise : the creation of a living , toiling community that shall be primarily a symbol , in precisely the same sense in which bits of colored cloth are symbols to other peoples . Even so conceived , one may doubt whether Zionism will be enough . But whatever else there may be ? and it is the purport of this paper to suggest something else ? will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortitude ? the very words are a challenge . And I see as I write them the slow smile dawn on Jewish lips , half pitiful , half sardonic , as if to say , Where will this fellow blunder next ? I know ? who does not ? ? that baffling paradox in Jewish eyes , uniquely blent of pity and irony , arrogance and humility , abnegation and invincible disdain . " In them shall all the nations of the earth be blessed " ? it is the young generation of Jews rather than of Gentiles that is embarrassed by the idealistic tradition . The Gentile can simply dismiss it : refuse , or find himself comfortably unable , to accept it . The Jew of to-day , unable either to accept or reject it , takes refuge under a cultured and immaculate skepticism . For he is tempted , much of the time successfully , to play the game of adjustment for its own sake . It is second nature to him . Faith in the heritage , the destiny , of the race becomes mere confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation as it is , and ends perhaps in a denial of the possibility , even the desirability of change . What was wisdom in the old generation becomes craft in the young . Pride in that craft , a secret and nihilistic pride , fulfils the place of pride in that wisdom ? almost , but never quite . If only their race would let them go ; but it will not , altogether . It clutches unexpectedly , wrecking where it has been ignored . That is why the " assimilated " Jew is seldom entirely happy ? because assimilation is essentially a negative gesture , and the blood is affronted . That is the peril of many a mixed marriage entered upon as a compromise , a surrender , rather than as an alliance , a new challenge to destiny . The Jewish heart is then secretly shamed by the children . In such situations faith and courage fail . And last for only at that point can it enter ? comes the inward peril that Lewisohn alone , I think , has dared to point out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible of all the results of our long persecution ? a shadow of our persecutors ' estimate of us . Not our greatest have quite escaped that curse . " But under that curse one can achieve nothing . What , in any case , is there to achieve ? V The achievement ? let me state it baldly ? is the salvaging of Western civilization . That is the challenge to Israel . The word diaspora , I read , has two meanings . It may mean , as our Bible has it ( Dent . xxviii , a " tossing to and fro among all the kingdoms . " It may mean , in the Septuagint version of the passage , a sowing as of seed : that seed in which all the nations of the earth shall be blessed . All the nations of the earth ? not Jews as such , not Gentiles as such : the full humanity of the Messianic vision . Is there faith in Israel , is there need in Christendom , to reap that harvest ? As to the former , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a student of these things , that there are yet alive in Israel powers and possibilities of which the Western world stands in sorest need . Among these I have chosen three for emphasis . First , its theism : as I think , the only theism that is still possible to Western man ? a pragmatic theism , hi which the god is literally a way of life . For Israel never insisted that other people subscribe to its beliefs , nor were its own sins ever matters merely of a wrong idea . Its errors were always of the deed , its mandates always of the life among men . " He judged the cause of the poor and needy . Was not this to know me , saith the Lord ? " Second , therefore , its humanism ? if that term may be broad enough for an ethic that cares even for the animals . Israel was foremost in the fight for humanism in the strict historical sense . But along with the passion for disinterested thought she has retained , in Einstein as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the keen concern for the day-to-day welfare of ordinary men and women : a concern immeasurably keener than that of those beneficent governments which slaughter millions of them for their own good in the name of abstract ideas and the precise interpretation of phrases . Third , therefore , its social stamina . It has been said that the Jew can judge , but not create , values . Yet in those values which , as institutions , make for social solidarity , Israel , despite its class distinctions , its own caste system , is richer than we . Naturally so ; since its life as a society is less dependent upon extrinsic factors , and the forms of that life are less in bondage to a conceptual system which those factors are rapidly demolishing . Israel ? chaotic , slipshod , disorderly , as it appears to the efficient Nordic ? has yet the life of an organism : Western society takes on more and more the aspect of a machine , held together by the brute pressures of necessity , drenched in the tears and blood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much even of the palliatives that temper the fate of its unfortunates does it not owe to the Jewish sense of pity , the Jewish concern for suffering men and women ? There are things Israel can not do , necessary things , in which the Nordic has excelled and of which Israel reaps the benefit . The architectural impulse , the urge to plan and design and abstract order ? these are essential wherever huge masses of people have to live and work together . But untempered they end , as they have ended , in a generalized notion of mankind itself , a reduction of flesh and blood to mere averages , formula- , stereotypes , terms in a series , a dismemberment of the concrete individual person by countless batteries of calculating machines . How much of modern fiction and modern drama are an exposition of precisely that theme ! There are qualities of which Israel stands in need if ever its vision , and ours , is to be realized : nerve ? I will not say courage , for that may be passive : a dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not reckon costs or risks too closely ; these also being things that untempered may make ? have made , times out of number ? for inhumanity . Why does it seem fantastic to suggest that from Israel may come , can come , the inward guidance of which Western civilization stands in need ? Why this instinctive incredulity on both sides ? . . . The Israel you write of ? it is Jews who will say this ? is the idealized Israel of an ancient dream . Look around you at the Israel of reality , of twentieth-century New York . Where , even in the best of it old , or liberalizing new ? will you find the substance of that dream to-day ? And why , in any case , should Jews bother themselves with any such world mission ? Is not their own existence problem enough for them ? True enough that the thing must begin , as it has begun , with a reacceptance by the Jews themselves of their own tradition : a rexpression , a reinterpretation , for themselves of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a scale actually comparable with the golden age in Spain . Only here and there , as yet , is that renascence conceived in its relation to the Western world . For the most part , as yet , it is a reassertion ? sometimes an aggressive , an exclusive reassertion ? of Jewish genius , for Jews . And that is the immediate necessity . Beyond that it is not necessary now to speculate . For a destiny evaded is a doom ; and the instinct of the race is yet alive . It proceeds by no rational dialectic . To argue the larger case would be presumption . It is not in payment of any debt that the Jewish redemption of Western culture can be urged . There can be only one debt : the debt indicated in Lewisohn 's fine phrase , " Being a Jew is what he owes mankind . " It is not in virtue of any claim the world can make upon them . It is because they have been despised and rejected of men ; because they have suffered and sacrificed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is even yet so little room for them , so slender a security , in the richest nation of the earth ? that they will come at last bringing new blessing to the world that has reviled them , offering that which can not be taken from them to those that sit in darkness and the shadow of death .
