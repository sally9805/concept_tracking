txt More than 1,500 persons promi-i nent in banking , business and professional circles in New York City attended the dinner opening the drive of the Greater New York Fund , Inc. , and heard various speakers stress the need for cooperative action to finance private welfare and health organizations . The fund is seeking $10,000,000 from business and industry . At the close of last night 's dinner at the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria , Winthrop Rockefeller announced that $760,000 already had been raised . In one of the principal addresses of the evening , Walter S. Gifford , president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , said corporations probably would have larger tax bills if business did not contribute to private welfare agencies . " We in New York are proud of our city , " Mr. Gifford said . " We like to feel that it is a leader and not a follower in all forward-looking movements . We consider , and properly so , that our city is a generous city . In cases of disaster we are among the very first to respond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , is always wholehearted and generous . In the Emergency Unemployment Relief campaigns the contributions of corporations and firms were more than generous and , in spite of the financially hard times ; were given gladly . Extension of Public Relief " With the assumption by governmental agencies of responsibility for the cost of unemployment relief , these city-wide appeals for emergency unemployment relief funds ended and the situation as to corporate giving for private social welfare work in New York City reverted largely to what it had been prior to 1930 . With some exceptions , notably gifts to the ' United Hospital Fund of New York and to the Federation for the Support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies of New York City and the Brooklyn Federation of Jewish Charities , corporate giving to welfare agencies practically ceased . " I do n't know how many of us realize that in the failure of business generally to support normal private welfare needs , New York not only did not lead the rest of the country , but was sadly out of step with it . American business organizations today are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . Their contributions vary from 25 per ' cent of the total funds given to 50 per cent in some highly industrialized cities . Some corporations whose markets or offices are nationwide in scope contribute in as many as 100 cities . " Thus , we find that an American custom , in fact , an American institution  --  business support of private welfare agencies  --  has grown up with New York City oblivious or ignorant of , ' or , which I can not believe is true , indifferent to that fact . Even including contributions to the United Hospital Fund and the Jewish Federations , which I just referred to , business organizations in New York City contribute only about 8 per cent of the total that private welfare and health agencies need . " To some of us actively connected - with welfare agencies or the rais- ing of emergency funds , this fact was known . It seemed to us that something should be done about it . Fortunately one of those who felt strongly about the relative backwardness of our great city in this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaine . He not only thought that something should be done about it but he did something about it . That is why we are here tonight . " Need for " Healthy " City Mr. Blaine , who is president of the fund 's sponsoring committee , stressed the . necessity for a healthy community if business itself is to thrive . " No corporation can exist profitably for long in any community unless that community is a healthy one , " he said . " By ' healthy ' I mean not only healthy in a physical sense but mentally healthy , strong in morale , able to resist the viruses of social discontent , free from the weakening sense of insecurity and instability that , in the mass , undermines any , form . of human society . " Sol M. Stroock , a member of the board of directors of the Federation - for - the Support of Jewish , Philanthropic ' Societies of New York City , pointed out that while the cost of social security was high , that of " social insecurity " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which confronts us , " he said . " Did you know that in this city at this time approximately 1,200,000 persons  --  men , women and children  --  are receiving public or private assistance ? Did you know that in addition to this army of the needy there are the physically and mentally sick in our hospitals , as well as delinquents convicted ' of crime , and that the cost of maintaining them exceeds $300,000,000 in each year ? " President Sends Message A telegram from President Roosevelt was read at the dinner . It said : " I wish you success in your efforts to broaden the base of financial support for private social welfare and health work by giving organized business and its employes an opportunity to contribute to its support . I am also glad that in your great cosmopolitan city , men ' and women of all races , all creeds and all faiths have joined in a common effort for the good of all . That kind of cooperation augurs well for the future health and welfare conditions . " Many of the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast . Among those who spoke were Paul Felix Warburg , John D. Rockefeller Jr. , David Dubinsky , Leon Fraser , former Governor Alfred E. Smith , Douglas P. Falconer , Henry Ittleson , Postmaster Albert Goldman , Frank C. Walker , George J. Lyons , Henry C. Aumann , Martin Conboy , Mrs. Sidney Borg and Colonel Julius Ochs Adler . Those sitting on the dais included Mr. Blaine , John S. Burke , Commissioner Alexander M. Damon of the Salvation Army , Mr. Dubinsky , Mr. Falconer , George Hecht , Henry Barklie , Thomas W. Lamont , George , Junius S. Morgan , Bayard F. Pope , Winthrop Rockefeller , John D. Rockefeller Jr. , John M. Schiff , former Governor Smith , Mr. Stroock , Dr. George E. Vincent and Mr. Warburg . J. P. Morgan occupied a table with several business associates .
