Yacht racing for the America 's Cup , since its beginning in 1851 , has been characterized by confusion . Confusion of the forthcoming Cup races next August started last fortnight when Harold Stirling Vanderbilt 's new contender Ranger lost her mast in a storm off the New England Coast . Last week the confusion continued with the arrival of Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith 's potential challengers , Endeavour I and Endeavour II . <P> Deed of gift of the America 's Cup , which specifies that the challenging yacht must sail to the scene of the races , has been interpreted since 1899 to allow the challenger to be towed across the ocean . Last week Endeavour II arrived safely at Bristol , R. I. hitched to the Belgian trawler John , but two days later , when Viva II , convoy of Endeavour I , put in her appearance , Endeavour I was nowhere to be seen . First rumor , that she had been lost at sea with all hands , was speedily denied by Viva 's Captain Wallace Grint . He explained that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , at almost the same hour that Ranger was losing her mast , Endeavour I had mysteriously disappeared from the end of her 600-ft. towline . After a vain 40-hr , search for her charge , Viva had proceeded to port , leaving Endeavour to fend for herself . Of all doubts that Endeavour was capable of fending not only Captain Grint but Skipper Sopwith was contemptuous . Said he in London : " Endeavour carried a very light rig . ... If there 's a blow , she 'll be better off on her own . . . . " <P> Confusion about Endeavour I was increased last week by the fact that radio reports of her position and progress ceased five days before Viva reached port . The confusion grew after Viva 's arrival until , just before Endeavour 's fate became cause for real alarm , she was finally discovered by an Associated Press airplane . Sighted 35 miles south of Nantucket , Endeavour was soon taken in tow by the U. S. Coast Guard cutter Argo . The Viva took her away from the Argo at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Viva 's towline the Endeavour entered the harbor in triumph while Newport 's fire whistle blew , a gun boomed from Old Lime Rock Light . Captain Ned Heard explained that they had cut the hawser lashings because " it was coming on night , we had a head wind and we were having heavy going of it . ... "
