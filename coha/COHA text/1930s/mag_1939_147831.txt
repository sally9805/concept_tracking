Marx Bros . At The Circus ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) checks the recent decline in Marx Brothers ' pictures with two of their fastest , funniest sequences-a riotous Newport society and circus climax , and Groucho doing a combination rumba , tango and nautch dance with one pant leg kitten-ishly hoisted while he sings of his tattooed lost love , Lydia that Encyclopedia . <P> She can give you a view of the world in tattoo <P> If you step up and tell her where . <P> For a dime you can see Kankakee or Paree , <P> Or Washington crossing the Delaware , <P> Oh Lydia , oh , Lydia , say have you met Lydia , <P> Oh Lydia , The Tattooed Lady ; <P> When her muscles start relaxin ' <P> Up the hill comes Andrew Jackson . . . . <P> For two bits she will do a Mazurka in Jazz , <P> With a view of Niag'ra that no artist has , <P> And on a clear day you can see Alcatraz , <P> You can learn a lot from Lydia. * <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mrs. Dukesbury ( Margaret Dumont , stately stooge of the Marxes ) , a Newport dowager . Groucho , who has never seen Mrs. Dukes-bury before , barges into her boudoir , woos her with this Marxian dialectric : " Those June nights on the Riviera . . . and that night I drank champagne from your slipper - two quarts .

In the windy March of 1918 Manhattan 's flag-wrapped Broadway Theatre flaunted an announcement : " WARNING : Any person throwing mud at this poster will not be prosecuted . " The poster advertised a new thriller : The Kaiser , Beast of Berlin . Inside the theatre , girl ushers , togged out as Belgian peasants , distributed programs which promised " an amazing expose of the intimate life of the Mad Dog of Europe . " The picture did not quite live up to the promise . It described the hardships and eventual victory of the conquered Belgians . Hero was the original Tarzan , big , soft-looking Elmo Lincoln , playing a blacksmith into whose custody the captured Kaiser ( Rupert Julian ) was given after the War . The late Lon ( Man of a Thousand Faces ) Chaney played walrus-whiskered Admiral von Tirpitz , as mild-looking a Santa Claus as ever ordered an ocean liner spurlos versenkt ( sunk without trace ) .                  @ @ @
