txt John M. Ginsburg , manager of the Hotel Monticello in West Sixtyfourth Street , who fled Sunday morning soon after Jack ( Legs ) Diamond was shot by two unidentified gunmen who escaped , surrendered in District Attorney Crain 's office yesterday as a material witness . He was accompanied by his wife , Sue W. Ginsburg ; Wallace D. Bennett , a real estate operator of Edgewater , N. J. , in whose car the Ginsburgs and their 3-year-old son , Harold , fled from the hotel , and Ginsburg 's lawyer , Hyman Bushel , former magistrate . Ginsburg made a statement to the prosecutor in the presence of Police Commissioner Mulrooney and other high police officials , in which he denied having seen the gunmen , but admitted he had heard the eight or ten shots fired at the gang leader and had summoned a private physician for Diamond . He then was arrested as a material witness and later held in $25,000 bail by General Sessions Judge Donnellan . Four other witnesses were held in $5,000 bail . They are Miss Marion Strasmick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day of the shooting , and three employes of the hotel  --  Joseph Goldie , assistant manager ; Thomas Marshal , clerk , and John Hughes , bell boy , who also had been ordered arrested as material witness . Only One Able to Give Ball . Only one of the four had been able to furnish bail late last night . Goldie was released when his bond was supplied by a surety company . Ginsburg and two of his employes were lodged in the house of detention in West Thirty-seventh Street , while Miss Strasmick was sent to the women 's detention house in Harlem . Meanwhile Diamond was slowly dying in the Polyclinic Hospital , where he was taken on Sunday after being shot four times , one bullet entering near the heart and another the abdomen . Pulmonary congestion had complicated his condition and word was sent to Mr. Crain that he could not long survive . The dying gangster 's wife , Mrs. Alice Shiffer Diamond , escorted by a friend of her husband , had been secretly led to the bedside of the gangster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office , and left just as secretly . Ginsburg was expected by Commissioner Mulrooney to be the key witness in his investigation of the shooting . The commissioner said on Monday that he hoped Ginsburg would give the first clue to the identity of the gunmen and supply a motive for the shooting , but at the end of the two-hour interrogation of the witness yesterday both he and Mr. Crain admitted that Ginsburg had given little aid . " From the manner in which Ginsburg recited events following the shooting and his sudden departure from the Ginsburg suite on the eighth floor of the hotel , where he left the wounded Diamond even before the arrival of a physician , " said Commissioner Mulrooney , " we got the impression that Ginsburg took the shooting in his hotel as something not very much out of the ordinary . ' Later Mr. Crain made public part of the stenographic transcript on the examination of Ginsburg . Ginsburg explained that a few days before he and his wife had made an appointment to have dinner with Bennett , the real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road , Edgewater . Sunday morning Bennett called for them , he said , and arrived with his little boy in the car in front of the hotel at about 10:45 o'clock . Heard Noises Like Shots . " While Mrs , Ginsburg was stowing some things in a handbag in little Harold 's toy room , and while I was standing in Room 825 , " said the hotel man , " I hear a lot of noise  --  it sourlded like a lot of shots . I became startled , and called to my wife in the next room . " I listened for a moment or two and nothing further happened . Then I opened the door of 825 and stepped into the hall . I saw Diamond coming out of 828 or 829 . He was holding his head and , in a crouching position , was staggering toward the elevator . " ' What happened ? ' I asked him as I ran up to him . He said : ' I 'm hurt . Please get your doctor right away . Take me to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . I 'm badly hurt . ' " In fact , he went into my room and laid on my bed. , and then I asked Diamond : ' My God , what can I do for you . Is there anything I can do for you right now ? ' He answered : ' Yes , get me a big drink of whisky . ' I ran into the next room , where I had a little in a bottle , and gave it to him . " Then I telephoned downstairs to Marshal , the clerk , and told him to connect me on the phone with Dr. Howell Babcock at the Hotel . When I got Dr. Babcock I said to him : ' I wish you would come up here to the Monticello right away . Some one has been hurt . ' " Dr. Babcock said : ' I ca n't come right away . I 'll be up as soon as I can . ' " Ginsburg said he then phoned to the clerk downstairs to get Goldie , the assistant manager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . Goldie , Ginsburg said , Diamond moaned : " Call Harry Drescher for me . " Ginsburg here explained that Drescher was a close friend of Diamond and an occupant of Room 625 , two floor below . The witness added that Goldie appeared before the arrival of Drescher in his bathrobe . When the assistant manager saw Diamond lying on the blood-stained bed in Ginsburg 's suite , the latter continued , he asked the wounded man : " Who shot you ? " " Do n't ask me any questions , " Ginsburg quoted Diamond as replying . " Get me a doctor . Somebody ' gave ' it to me . I do n't know who it was . " Diamond Demanded an Ambulance . Ginsburg said that when Diamond was told Dr. Babcock would not be able to come to the hotel for some time , Diamond cried : " To hell with the doctor . Get me an ambulance and take me to a hospital . They 'll know what to do . " At this point Ginsburg said he left . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Babcock , " he told District Attorney Crain . " I told Goldie that I was going to join Bennett in the lobby . " When I reached Bennett he told me that Sue was in his car outside and was terribly upset . I think she too had seen Diamond with his body covered with blood in the bed in our suite . " Ginsburg then was brought back to Drescher and was asked whether he appeared in Diamond 's room before he left for the lobby , and he replied that Drescher had hurried in while he was giving Goldie instructions to stay with the wounded man until the arrival of Dr. Babcock . When Drescher saw Diamond on the bed , he said , Drescher said to the wounded man : " What 's the matter , Jack ? " Ginsburg said Diamond made some reply which he could not recall . The hotel manager then recalled that before joining Bennett downstairs he took Goldie , the assistant manager , into Room 823 of the Ginsburg suite and said : " This is a terrible mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in his home in Edgewater and I 'll go right over there with him and Sue . Then get in touch with my attorney and see what he thinks I should do . " That was the last he saw of Diamond , Ginsburg insisted . In answer to a question by Mr. Mulrooney he also insisted that although he came into the hall from his suite a few seconds after he heard the shots fired at Diamond he saw nobody but Diamond coming from the direction of Room 829 , in which the police say Diamond was shot . He added that he was so excited over the shooting that he could not recall whether he walked down the eight flights of stairs to the lobby or whether he took the elevator . He was equally in the dark , he added , as to just when and how Mrs. Ginsburg left the suite or how she got downstairs . Fixes Time of Shooting . Answering another question by the District Attorney , Ginsburg said the shooting of Diamond took place between , 11:35 and 11:40 o'clock . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett in his car at 10:45 o'clock , their trip of about twenty minutes to Central Park to get Mrs. Ginsburg and the stay of Mrs. Ginsburg in their suite up to the time he heard the shots . He was pressed repeatedly by Mr. Crain to tell just how many shots he heard , but insisted he was unable to say . When Commissioner Mulrooney urged him to explain why he did not remain at the hotel until the arrival of Dr. Babcock or an ambulance , he declared he was unable to answer , except that he wanted to get away to the Bennett home in Edgewater . Ginsburg said that after dining at the Bennett home at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon he and his wife had sat around the house with the Bennetts for a while . He admitted he did not telephone to the Monticello to inquire about Diamond 's condition or to find out what had been done with him . After spending some time at the Bennett home , he says he announced that he would like to visit his mother in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had been ill , and Bennett agreed to drive him to her . They left Mrs. Ginsburg and their son with Mrs. Bennett , and . on the way to Philadelphia he made several telephone calls to the home of a sister in the outskirts of that city , but got no answer . Then he went to the home of another sister in Philadelphia , where his mother joined them . He and Bennett registered that night at a Philadelphia hotel , Ginsburg said . Several unsuccessful attempts were made by him on Sunday night and Monday morning to get in touch with his lawyer . Bennett drove him back to Edgewater on Monday , he said , and yesterday morning Bennett went to Mr. Bushel 's office in this city . He told the lawyer that Ginsburg wanted his advice on what to do , Ginsburg said , and Mr. Bushel , calling the hotel manager on the telephone at the Bennett home at noon , told Ginsburg to come right over to his office , prepared to make a complete statement to the District Attorney . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started for the prosecutor 's office he called up Commissioner Mulrooney and then Mr. Crain . The Police Commissioner , Deputy Chief Inspector Stapleton of the detective bureau and a squad of detectives were on hand when the lawyer , the Ginsburgs and Bennett appeared . The arrival of police officials in automobiles at the entrance to the District Attorney 's office drew a large crowd of the curious , which hung around until Ginsburg and the other four witnesses in the case were taken away after their court arraingment . Bennett was understood also to have made a statement to the District ? Attorney corroborating Ginsburg 's story of the real estate man 's arrival at the Monticello and the subsequent departure of the Ginsburgs with him for Edgewater and Philadelphia . Ginsburg and Bennett were interrogated after the District Attorney and the Police Commissioner had finished questioning Miss Strasmick , the dancer , who is known on the stage as Marion Roberts . Mr. Crain said her statement was substantially the same she had made to the commissioner and himself on the day of the shooting , with additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector Sullivan and Assistant District Attorney Marro . In this story Miss Strasmick told of Diamond having received a telephone call in her room-831 ? shortly before the shooting . Diamond left in response to a knock on her door a few minutes later , she said , but she did not see the faces of the men who called him . She left the hotel about two hours later , she said , without seeing Diamond again , and knew nothing about the shooting until she read of it in a newspaper in the late afternoon . Earlier in the day Commissioner Mulrooney had admitted that the night before a general alarm had been sent out for Ginsburg as an important witness in the Diamond shooting . When the commissioner was asked at the time whether the police were aware of the identity of the men who did the shooting , he replied : " The police do not know who did the shooting . " It developed at the time that Ginsburg was the manager of the Harding Hotel about a year ago when Diamond was a guest there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became acquainted with the gangster then . In the forenoon Mr. Crain issued a statement in which he said he had information which made him feel positive that Diamond grappled with one of his assailants before he was shot . He said he believed only on of the gunmen did the shooting , while the other held Diamond . He continued that it even was possible that a third man participated in the attack . Diamond 's Actions Reviewed . The prosecutor added that Diamond was accompanied to this city by two of his gang on the train which brought him to this city last Thursday midnight from the Diamond Summer home at Acre , N. Y. Diamond joined Miss Strasmick immediately at the Monticello , he said , and remained there until he was shot , occasionally going out late at night to visit night clubs and other rendezvous of his gang in the midtown district . " I think that ' Legs ' knows who shot him , that he will continue to refuse to tell who did it , and that his story of how he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Crain said . " I also think it possible that the license number of the car seen by a witness outside the hotel and in which the gunmen were believed to have escaped , may be traced and that the telephone calls made to Room 831 Sunday morning may be traced . " Although Mr. Mulrooney repeated yesterday there was nothing to connect the shooting and killing of Abraham Figura , a gangster , last Saturday night somewhere near Harrison , N. J. , police officials in Newarie Insisted there was a connection . Bot0 William Chariot , chief of detrativrs of the Hudson County prosecutors office , and Chief of Detectivits Phillip Sebold of Newark said they had reason to believe that Figura was slain by the same gunmen who shot Diamond . Figura , they said , was a lieutenant of Diamond and formerly had occupied an adjoining room to that occupied by Diamond in the President Hotel in this city . Figura , they added , was known as Diamond 's " finger man " in New Jersey , ex plaining that the " finger man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunmen or beer runners who are to be " taken for a ride . " Figura was shot in the back and thrown out of an automobile in Harrison a short time before his body was discovered . A key found in his pocket was reported to be for one of the rooms in the Hotel President . Mr. Mulrooney admitted yesterday that his detectives are seeking Charles Entratta , alias Green , a former Diamond lieutenant , as a suspect in the shooting of the gang leader . It was also learned that the Commissioner had ordered the arrest of Robert Miller , alias Robert Duval and " the Count , " as another suspect . Mr. Mulrooney 's interest in Miller , it was explained , was due to the belief that it was Miller who received the cablegram from Hamburg , Germany , last Oct. 8 at the Hotel Monticello telling of arrangements having been successfully made for another trip of Diamond to Germany . Miller , detectives learned , had occupied a room at the Monticello up to the day of the Diamond shooting , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
