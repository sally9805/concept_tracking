txt Feeding Pigeons The recent arrests and convictions for pigeon feeding have stirred up a lot of feeling on the subject . In one case the complainant quoted Magistrate : Anthony Burke as stating that in his opinion folks who feed pigeons are morons and need to have their heads examined . This was an unfortunate semaec for a mart in his position to make . As one of the so-called morons , I wonder if Park Commissioner Moses is in the same class with us , for he has installed in many of our parks fountains with fresh running water for the sole use and benefit of our city birds , mostly pigeons . I do not know that Commissioner Moses feeds pigeons , but we all thank him for this humane and thoughtful service to our feathered friends . Would Dr. Fosdick of the Riverside Church also be classed In this same category because he recently sent out a call to have somebody destroy the hawks that were killing the pigeons that : flock around his church tower ? We so-called morons wish to thank him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , July 1 , 1936.
