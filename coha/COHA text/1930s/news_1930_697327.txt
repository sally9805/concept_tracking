txt The proposed schedule of rates for electric current , submitted to the Public Service Commission on Friday by the New York Edison and associated companies in . New York City , offering to reduce the kilowatt hour charge from 7 to 5 cents , was questioned yesterday by Dr. James C. Bonbright of Columbia University , expert on utility rates . - At the same time the schedule was opposed by the Utility Consumers ' League of New York , which based its objections on an analysis of the rates made by Dr. John Bauer , city rate expert , who is director of the . American Public Utilities Bureau . Dr. Bonbright , expressing confidence in the judgment of Milo R. Maltbie , chairman of the Public Service Commission , suggested that the proposed rate schedule , which fixes a monthly charge of 60 cents for each meter , and a demand charge of $1 for commercial consumers , should not be adopted without a guarantee that the demand charge would not be increased from time to time . Says Rate Hits Small User . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secretary of the Utility Consumers ' League , was quoted as having said that the new schedules , despite the 2-cent reduction in rates , would represent an annual aggregate increase of about $2,700,000 to the smaller consumers because of the fixed meter charge . According to Mr. Milgram , Dr. Bauer estimated that some small consumers ' bills would be increased as much as 58 per cent . " I have read newspaper accounts of the new rate schedule and I am frankly suspicious of it , " said Dr. Bonbright . " The usual custom of a public utility in moves for an ultimate higher income is to establish a monthly demand charge that is so small that it at first seems insignificant . " The 60-cent demand charge asked in this schedule proposal is small and would not have a great effect on the individual consumer . " But if this schedule is adopted , and the Public Service Commission allows the companies to have this demand charge , then a dangerous precedent is established . Fears Increased Charge . " After the precedent is established It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming before the commission with demands that the fixed monthly charge be increased . This would eventually work a hardship on the small domestic consumer by increasing the amount of money he had to pay for his electricity without outwardly increasing the rate . " And that is just what the power people want to do . What they want is to lower rates for large users of current and increase rates for the small users . They have to keep their rates low for the large manufacturers , anyway . " While I believe Sloan 's proposal is a counter-move against the fight of public representatives to lower rates , I do not believe the electric utPilities will put anything over on Chairman Maltbie of the Public Service Commission . He knows too much about utility company tricks for them to get away with it . " Personally , I should not be willing to approve such a schedule of rates unless I was assured by the electric companies that no further increase in the demand charge would be asked . " If those fellows had been more frank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that they are sincere in this move . " Bonbright said he could not tell , before a more detailed analysis of the proposed schedule , what effect , if any , they would have on the sub-metering companies , but he said that , depending entirely on the wholesale rates allowed to the sub-metering companies , the reduced rates per kilowatt-hour looked like a cut in their margin of profit . Speaking for the Utility Consumers ' League , Mr. Milgram made the following statement : " According to an nalysis by Dr. Bauer , the reduction in electric rates proposed in Manhattan , Brooklyn , Queens and the Bronx turns out to be an increase of nearly 58 per cent for all residential consumers served by the four affiliated companies . " The proposed servite charge is GO cents per customer and then would reduce the so-called energy charge of 7 cents to 5 cents per kilowatt hour . This would not be much of a reduction at best for residential users , but would actually increase the charges to nearly 1,000.000 small customers . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 7 cents nc kilowatt hour pay $1.40 per month , but under the new rate they would pay $1.60 per month , an increase of 20 cents per month-or i $2.40 a year . They would pay 8 cents per kilowatt hour instead of the present 7 cents . In the aggregate the small users would pay an increase of over $2,700,000 annually to the company . " I can badly imagine any justification for this result , ' The mass of small users are , according to Dr. Bauer 's analysis , entitled to low rates as well as the large users . The five-cent rate should be the maximum for all consumers except that it might be coupled with a ' minimum bill ' of 50 cents per month per customer . This would assure the companies against any out-of-pocket losses and would give everybody the benefit of the five-cent rate , which is still too high for New York conditions . " The Utility Consumers ' League is opposed to the new schedule coupled with the proposed service charge , and will ask the city to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies have been trying to establish for the past three years .
