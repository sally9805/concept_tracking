HARRY 'S DRESSING ROOM The two men face each other . Underneath their complacent appearance there is a tense feeling of hatred . &nbsp; HARRY ( brazenly ) Hello , Al  --  ( he touches his ears with perfume ) &nbsp; AL WONDER ( fighting to control his anger ) So ! At last you 've condescended to honor the joint with your presence ! You know you 're a little late , do n't you ? &nbsp; HARRY ( lightly ) A little . Where 's Inez ? &nbsp; AL WONDERI do n't care .

If you lay a hand on me I 'll walk out and Inez goes with me . &nbsp; AL WONDERJust keep talking and you 're a cinch to have an accident . Al , a seething volcano of emotion , gets a grip on himself . Harry triumphantly smoothes his coat . &nbsp; HARRY ( quietly ) Calm yourself , Al . You 'll have to announce me in a minute .

It 's worth five times that much but  --  Inez enters . &nbsp; AL WONDERFirst tell me where you got it . &nbsp; HARRYThat 's one thing you 'll never know . &nbsp; AL WONDERYou stole it !

All three principals quickly jump for the door . CUT TO : 57 : A TABLE IN CAFE Simpson , Pratt and their wives are at a new table . Claire and Mitzi are hovering , like two vultures , in the b.g . Suddenly Mitzi brazenly comes over to Simpson and deliberately puts her arms around his neck , cuddling his bald head . The wives are speechless with shocked amazement . &nbsp; MITZI ( stroking Simpson 's bald head ) You big sugar plum  --  last night I dreamed I met a bald-headed gentleman and he gave me fifty francs . &nbsp; SIMPSON ( sputtering ) I would n't dream of doing such a thing ! &nbsp; MITZI ( dryly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

CUT TO : 58 : ENTERSOL An attractive , business-like man , immaculately dressed , but bearing all the evidences of a tired , over-worked business man enters . He is not wearing dinner clothes . Gee-gee takes his hat and coat . Instantly Richard steps forward and greets him with profound respect . &nbsp; RICHARD ( bowing ) Good evening , Monsieur Renaud ! Right this way . Your wife is holding a table . &nbsp; MR . RENAUD ( kindly ) Just a moment , Richard . I think I 'll wash up . Tired . It may freshen me up a little  --  Richard bows .

Must see you immediately . She then signals for a waiter . &nbsp; LIANE RENAUD ( calling a waiter ) Waiter ! The waiter steps quickly into the scene . Liane feverishly starts to fold the menu .

I realize how important the bank must be to you . Suddenly her expression changes as she notes he has absent-mindedly picked up the menu and is toying with it ! &nbsp; MR . RENAUD ( thoughtfully ) If it were n't for you , Liane , sometimes I think I 'd throw the whole thing over . ( he sighs ) However  --  some day  --  ( he starts to open the menu ) &nbsp; LIANE RENAUD ( trying to keep her voice steady ) Darling  --  I  --  let me see it  --  ( she extends her hand )  --  35  --  &nbsp; MR .

On my tummy . &nbsp; DOWAGERBut what 's that got to do with your weight ? &nbsp; AL WONDERWell , you see when I get home at night and undress , I always look at myself in a long mirror . If it says " Al " across my stomach , I know I 've eaten lightly . But if I 've eaten too much , it says " Alice " . He hurries out of scene , leaving the dowager gaping at him . CUT TO :  --  37  --  65 : CLOSEUP AL as he leaves the Countess , suddenly he catches sight of something off scene and his eyes suddenly stare with horror as he sees : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - AT BAR One hand , holding a sharp-pointed pocket knife , is carefully drawing the blade lightly across the wrist of the other hand  --  as though the owner of the hands were thoughtfully contemplating just how deep and how wide one must slash to sever the jugular vein .

Why , it must have been in my evening bag all the time . ( she looks up at him like a mischievous child ) Are you going to scold me ? &nbsp; MR . RENAUD ( gazing at her for a second  --  and then chuckling ) Of course not , you silly child  --  although you ought to be spanked for being so careless . He chuckles and offers her his arm .

Nothing to it ! In fact  --  Captain Von Ferring is driving him home now  --  in the morning everything will be okay  --  &nbsp; INEZAnd he 's not going to die ? &nbsp; AL WONDER ( laughing it off ) I told you  --  he 's hardly scratched !

Pratt and Simpson rise dejectedly to their feet . &nbsp; MR . SIMPSON ( bitterly  --  to Pratt ) There ought to be a law against a man who brings his wife to Paris ! &nbsp; PRATT ( nervously ) Law ! It ought to be capital punishment ! &nbsp; SIMPSON ( getting his temper up - in drunken bravado ) Look here ! We 're going to assert ourselves . ( he claps his hands at Mitzi and Claire ) Oh , girls ! Come here a minute ! Mitzi and Claire come eagerly over to them .  --  85  --  &nbsp; MITZI ( expectantly ) Yes , Mister Simpson . &nbsp; SIMPSON ( quickly ) Look , baby . Me and my friend are taking our wives home .

He steps calmly into the scene . &nbsp; TOMMY JOHNSONCome on in , Al  --  &nbsp; AL WONDER ( quietly ) Thanks . ( to Inez  --  trying to be casual ) How do you feel ? &nbsp; INEZ ( smiling a trifle ) Shaky  --  but Tommy 's been talking to me  --  ( she looks at Tommy gratefully ) &nbsp; AL WONDER ( uneasily ) Maybe , if you 'd touch up your makeup you 'd feel fresher .

He clears his throat . &nbsp; AL WONDER ( trying to keep his voice steady ) When you 're ready , Inez  --  I thought maybe a ride home in the fresh air might  --  you know  --  rest your nerves a little . CUT TO : 153 : INEZ , TOMMY AND AL as the two young people are a trifle embarrassed . &nbsp; INEZThat 's sweet of you . &nbsp; TOMMY JOHNSON ( awkwardly ) Sure , Al , but you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tunes I wanted Inez to hear .

Come on ! Will you ? Al looks at them a second . He can plainly see that they are merely being kind . He forces himself to grin . &nbsp; AL WONDER ( roughly ) Me ? Sit and hear a couple of kids croon ballads ? Nothin ' doin ' . Them days are over for me. ( he turns to the door and is anxious to get away ) No  --  you kids beat it . I do n't know but what you got the best idea , anyway . ( he gazes once more at them ) Good night ... Happy landing . His shoulders droop . He turns , suddenly grown tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO : 154 : THE DANCE FLOOR Just a FLASH . The tables are empty . The evening is over . Only the confetti , broken streamers and wilting flowers remain . Waiters are collecting linen . 155 : THE BAR The last customer leaves .

MAIN FLOOR as Al comes listlessly up the steps from the dressing room . He stops and gazes sadly at the vast dismal room  --  now stripped of its tinsel . The silence is oppressive . Al shivers , tries to grin , and continues on towards the mezzanine . CUT TO : 162 : MEZZANINE - TRUCK SHOT A porter is working a droning vacuum cleaner over the rugs . Only one light is on . Al enters the scene . He stops at a piano and unconsciously hits several chords of Inez ' song . The droning vacuum makes it sound like a discord . Al stops . Listlessly he starts to cross to the Entersol.  --  93  --  The CAMERA TRUCKS on him as he listlessly crosses and enters the Entersol . Suddenly a news urchin pushes open the front door and enters , selling an extra . &nbsp; NEWSBOY ( hailing Al ) Extra ! All about the big accident ! Car plunges over cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads : CAPTAIN VON FERRING AND HARRY , FAMOUS DANCER , DIE , IN CRASH ! Al shakes his head at the boy . The boy exits . THE CAMERA TRUCKS on Al as he crosses to : 163 : THE CASHIER 'S DESK From under the counter Al absent-mindedly brings a dice cup . He rolls the dice on the counter several times and suddenly reacts as he obviously makes a pass . He promptly rings " no sale " on the cash register , takes out all the money , stuffs it into his pocket , pulls up his coat collar , pats his hat  --  and then slowly starts for the Entersol and front door . MUSIC CUE The strain of Inez ' number is softly picked up now and continues until the FADE OUT . At the front door an aged night watchman carrying a time clock , opens the door respectfully and Al wearily exits into the street . The night watchman closes the door , locks it , snags out the lights and we BLACK-OUT . THE END pp. 53-74 &nbsp;     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
