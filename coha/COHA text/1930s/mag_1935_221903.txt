" President Roosevelt as a practical farmer , " began a dispatch to the arch-Republican New York Herald Tribune last week , " has given concrete proof that agriculture can sustain itself and even operate at a profit without the aid of his New Deal . " <P> On the brow of scrubby Pine Mountain , five miles out the Franklin D. Roosevelt Highway from Warm Springs , Ga. , the Herald Tribune 's correspondent had sought out lanky Otis Moore to find how things were going on the 2,500-acre farm which the President bought while convalescing at Warm Springs in 1925 ( TIME , Dec. 10 ) . Manager Moore , father of five , reported the best crops in years , said the farm 's two white and five Negro tenant families looked forward to a reasonably comfortable winter . The farm , which directly adjoins a New Deal homestead project , has never paid its own way , but this year Manager Moore thought that it might even show a profit . Most of the farm 's crops go to feed its 130 cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about profits until next spring 's stock sales . <P> Only about 150 acres of the President 's hilly farm are cultivated and his barns and Negro shacks are only now being made less down-at-heel than those of his cracker neighbors . Largest crop this year was corn , with some 100 acres producing an average of 15 bu. per acre - not enough to justify an AAA corn contract . <P> " We do n't sell hogs , " drawled Otis Moore . " There 's more money in other products . Of course , we raise all we want to eat , but we depend on our cattle and our grapes 15 acres for cash . We got $1,200 or $1,300 last year for our cattle and ought to get at least that much this year . " <P> Other income will be from 500 bu. of sweet potatoes , from lumber cut by a sawmill installed a few months ago . " I begged the President to let me plant a little cotton , " said the employe of the man who has cut the South 's cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big broad smile and shook his head . So of course I did n't raise any cotton . "
