When Malin Craig became Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in 1935 , he found a military mutual aid society thriving in Washington . Ranking generals excused themselves or were excused from physical examinations . Old colonels were promoted to brigadier general , old brigadiers to major general , on the theory that a long life in arms deserved a good ending with maximum retirement pay . The result , in Malin Craig 's opinion , was that the list of generals on active duty included too many inactive crocks . <P> Generals and lieutenants alike now get a medical going-over once a year . However much he has done to raise the pep quotient , Malin Craig has not been able to do a great deal about age in the upper ranks . He ran into the facts that : 1 ) it takes a long while to make a colonel ; 2 ) only colonels may be made generals . By last June 30. after two and one-half years of Malin Craig 's regime , the average age of 46 brigadiers was down one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 major generals , down one month ( to 61 years , two months ) . <P> Last week , Malin Craig , who reaches the mandatory retirement age of 64 next year , took his biggest swipe yet at general age levels . Upon his recommendation , the President promoted Brigadier General Henry H. Arnold. * 52 , to be major general and chief of air corps ; Brigadier General William H. Wilson , 60 . Coast Artillery , to succeed retiring Major General Fox Conner as commander of the First Army ; Brigadier General Robert McCandlass Beck Jr. , 59 , an assistant chief of staff , to succeed retiring Major General Frank McCoy . Also upped were seven colonels to brigadiers . Average age : 53 . <P> An army flier since 1911 , assistant chief of his corps since 1936 , lively General Arnold succeeds the late Major General Oscar Westover , who crashed last fortnight ( TIME . Oct. 3 ) . Air corps officers esteem Henry Arnold for administrative spunk , his recent efforts to take the kinks out of procurement , his help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TIME , Sept. 26 ) . To get to Henry Arnold , Malin Craig passed over eleven senior air corps officers . Shortly before this selection was announced . Chicago Daily Newsman Paul R. Leach reported another result of Oscar Westover 's death at 55 . The War Department , wrote Correspondent Leach , soon will ground all air corps officers over 45 . <P> * Henry Arnold is used to explaining that he is related neither to Traitor Benedict Arnold nor to the several Generals Arnold who have since borne the name with honor .
