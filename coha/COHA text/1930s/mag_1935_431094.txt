 | Can You Beat the Lie Detector ? Condensed from Esquire Wiliam Moulton Marston Psychologist ; discoverer of the systolic blood pressure deception test , popularly known as the Lie Detector WHEN , in 1913 , I began research on lie detection in the Harvard Psychological Laboratory , I proceeded on the principle that no normal person can lie without effort . Now , it is impossible to increase one 's effort - mental , nervous or otherwise - without increasing the strength of the heartbeat . And increased strength of heartbeat shows in an increase of the systolic blood pressure - that is , the pressure of blood in the arteries when the heart muscles squeeze together . Therefore , I reasoned , no normal person can lie without increasing his blood pressure . This reasoning proved sound . Every time a subject lied , his systolic blood pressure went up . The more important the lie , the greater the mental effort and the greater the rise in blood pressure . I published the systolic blood pressure test for deception in rgy . Immediately the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a mysterious apparatus . Actually the Lie Detector uses standard types of the sphygmomanometer - that little gadget which doctors wrap around your arm just above the elbow to take your blood pressure - to reveal the added mental effort used in lying . Innumerable objections to the Lie Detector came in from all parts of the world . Only one seemed to me important . A psychiatrist maintained that anybody could beat the blood pressure test if he believed his own lie - believed it , that is , with his conscious mind . Many people , especially criminals , he said , repeated a lie so often that they came after a while actually to believe the stories they had manufactured in self-defense . About this time I met Mr. L. in Washington , D. C. Respected member of a well-known southern family , L. had been convicted of second-degree murder and had served a term in the penitentiary . Since his release , his one hope was to prove to the world that the  | story he had told to the jury at his trial was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story that he begged me to test it with the Lie Detector and publish the results . Here was a case , perhaps , which would test the psychiatrist 's theory that a man who consciously believed his own story could beat the Lie Detector . L. had shot his uncle-in self-defense , he claimed . His story had two angles : First , his alleged motive for quarreling with his uncle , some financial transaction in which his uncle had cheated him . This the jury evidently had believed . The other part of his story had to do with the physical action on the occasion of the shooting . L. said his uncle had threatened him with a heavy cane , L. had drawn his revolver as he backed out of the room , and the uncle had rushed him swinging the cane at his head . This part of the story the jury had not believed . But the jury had been wrong . This part of the story was true according to blood pressure results . Then - came the eclipse ! The Lie Detector faithfully revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale was a lie ! He broke down and wept . Then he told the truth . The whole affair had happened over " the honor of a Southern lady . " The lady , whom the uncle had seduced , it turned out was a relative of L. 's wife . This was later verified . The true story would have acquitted L. in any court . His honest belief in his own innocence had spread emotionally , during his solitary years behind prison walls , to an equally strong belief in the wholly fictitious tale of a shady financial transaction . Here was a singularly satisfactory proof that subconscious knowledge of the falsity of a story would reveal itself in heightened blood pressure , even though the witness had come consciously to believe his own lie . When the United States entered the World War it was proposed to use deception tests as part of our spy-catching system . A psychologists ' committee , named by the National Research Council , arranged with the Municipal Criminal Court of Boston to try out the most promising deception tests on prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our exhaustive examination , we reported to Washington that the blood pressure test was 9 ' 7% infallible when used by an expert . Extreme skepticism met this endorsement . Then it chanced that the all-important code book was stolen from the Surgeon General 's office in Washington , probably at the instigation of a German spy . I was called upon to examine 70 Negro messengers who had access to the building . Some of those colored boys had to be herded into the examining office at the  | point of a gun ! They thought the test was black magic , and they were all terribly afraid of it . Here was an excellent opportunity to test out another criticism of the Lie Detector - namely , its alleged failure when suspects were afraid or emotionally upset from causes having nothing to do with the problem under investigation . None of the Negroes , terrified as they were , beat the lie-catching expert . We uncovered an amazing list of articles which some of them had stolen from various offices . Moreover , the messenger who had stolen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered . Since the war , application of the blood pressure test has been made by many criminologists with uniform success . Dr. John L arson , of Chicago , has demonstrated in more than 2000 cases that the Lie Detector can not be beaten by the ordinary criminal . The test is now being used in more than 25 leading American cities by police or criminal authorities . In 1922 the Lie Detector test was proposed for the first time in court-room procedure . Dr. Brown , a wealthy colored physician of Washington , D. C. , had been killed , and a reward was offered for the arrest and conviction of his murderer . James A. Frye , a young Negro , confessed . Then suddenly he recanted his confession and claimed he had nothing whatever to do with the killing . Asked why he had confessed , Frye said he had been promised half the reward for his own conviction ! Frye 's lawyers , completely baffled by his fantastic tale , begged me to test their client 's story with the Lie Detector . It was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro who had promised to share the reward money with Frye and to get him out of jail as soon as the reward had been paid . But the other Negro could not collect the reward , so Frye had retracted his confession . At the trial an offer was made - before the jury - to put in evidence the blood pressure test record showing Frye 's present story truthful . Undoubtedly this offer made a great impression upon the jury . The test itself was excluded on the legal ground that it had not been made in court . Nevertheless , with no other evidence in Frye 's favor save his own testimony and the offer of Lie Detector results , the jury acquitted him . A subsequent investigation verified the Lie Detector findings . Frye and his attorneys gave the Lie Detector full credit for saving him from otherwise certain hanging . The ruling in the Frye case left only one way open to put the Lie Detector test in evidence . The test must be given in open court . This was done successfully by a  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indianapolis in 19-24-It was an assault and battery case . Both defendant and witnesses submitted voluntarily to taking the Lie Detector test while on the witness stand . New then went on the stand as an expert , showed the charts of the blood pressure variations made while witnesses were testifying , and pointed out lies in the defendant 's testimony . The defendant was convicted . Since that time , Lie Detector results have been used in cases before the courts in California , Washington and other states . The difficulty of getting the Lie Detector accepted by legal authorities has been greatly enhanced by the failure of other types of deception tests previously proposed . For example the breathing test , rated by psychologists as next most reliable to blood pressure , is handicapped by the need of very complex apparatus . This test is based on the fact that people put more effort into their breathing when they are about to lie . This " catching of the breath " is involuntary , it can not be controlled , and therefore makes a good test . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath continuously . While he can not help doing it when he is about to lie , he can do the same thing voluntarily when he is telling the truth . But to beat the Lie Detec- tor test one would have to master the rare art of controlling the heartbeat . Although jurists are over-skeptical concerning the blood pressure test , it has a far higher rating of reliability than tests upon which handwriting experts and psychiatrists base the opinions which are accepted in evidence . It is true , of course , that the Constitution says that no criminal defendant can be compelled to give testimony against himself . Legal authorities generally believe that this prohibition applies to the Lie Detector . If compelled to take a deception test against his will , a defendant might have to give evidence against himself . However , following the Indianapolis case , the Lie Detector can certainly be voluntarily introduced by the defendant in many courts . Dean Wigmore of Northwestern University Law School , America 's greatest authority on the law of evidence , suggested that an enlarged blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtroom , thus enabling the jury to observe directly the fluctuations of a witness ' blood pressure while he tells his story on the stand . Mr. VVigmore 's idea was that there could be no more legal objection to permitting a jury to watch the behavior of a witness ' blood pressure than there is to their observing his facial expres-  | sion or the flushing and paling of his cheeks . Sooner or later this suggestion will probably be put into practice . When judge and jury are able to determine with scientific certainty the guilt or innocence of accused persons , the greatest step toward justice in the world 's history will have been achieved .
