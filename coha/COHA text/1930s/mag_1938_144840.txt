Cliff Knoble was doing all right until January of 1937 . A serious young man , he had worked his way up from male stenography via International Correspondence Schools to head a firm of his own . His Business Promotion Corp . had 14 employes , some fairly profitable accounts with Chrysler and other automobile dealers who bought his sales ideas . But when Michigan auto workers went on strike dealers no longer felt like spending money . Soon business for Cliff Knoble dried up . Last week the consequences of Cliff Knoble 's personal depression blossomed in a full-page advertisement in the Detroit Free Press : <P> " I am the Middle Class Citizen . <P> " ... I am the man in the middle . " <P> The pronoun did not refer solely to smart Cliff Knoble . Signer and buyer of the advertisement was The Middle ' Class Alliance Inc. , composed of small merchants , professional men and upper-salaried white-collar workers who thought they , too , had been caught in the middle . Promoter Knoble placed another full-page advertisement to appear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more if $3 annual dues and contributions flow in properly . <P> As defined by Promoter Knoble 's smoothly professional copy , function of the Alliance is first to collect information about the problems of the middle class and then to DO SOMETHING . What Cliff Knoble proposed to do , first for Detroit and then for other localities , he did not make clear . But the things about which he proposed to do something were made plain : 1 ) taxes , State and Federal ; 2 ) labor disputes . Major emphasis was on taxation ( in an M. C. A. pamphlet , eight of 15 listed objectives deal with reducing Michigan and Federal taxes and expenditures ) . Excerpts : <P> " . . . Is n't it your tax money that is going to pay these WPA workers ? And if it is , what are you getting for your money ? ... A square deal for both Capital and Labor-the equalization of responsibility - compulsory arbitration-and the outlawing of ' wildcat ' and ' sitdown ' strikes . In other words , industrial peace through cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing all right again . Alliance sales headquarters were housed in the same impressive office suite where Business Promotion Corp . still holds forth . Cliff Knoble counts on onlisting 50,000 followers in Detroit . Then , he figures , he will be ready to devise and broadcast his " Messages " for middle-classers everywhere .
