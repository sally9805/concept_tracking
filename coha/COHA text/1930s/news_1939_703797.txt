txt While the testimony of the dead George Weinberg , gangster member of the Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer policy racket , continued yesterday to be read to a jury hearing the second trial of James J. Hines before Judge Charles C. Nott Jr . in General Sessions , forces in and out of the court room were working in the direction of making his death a major issue in the case . In the court room District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey insisted , over the objections of Lloyd Paul Stryker , counsel for the defense , in placing before the jury the fact that Weinberg , during his time in the Tombs last Summer , had received permission from Supreme Court Justice Ferdinand Pecora to leave jail to see a physician because of stomach ulcers . With Governor Lehman interested in the Weinberg death as a result of two telegrams from an attorney , George E. Mulry of Mineola , L. I. , Mr. Dewey 's insistence on having the jury told of the gangster 's illness took on added significance . The demand came while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reading to the jury in question and answer form the cross-examination of Weinberg at the first Hines trial before Justice Pecora , which was halted last Sept. 13 . Dr. Squire 's Action Awaited It is expected that Medical Examiner Amos 0 . Squire of Westchester County will examine all persons in the house outside White Plains who were present last Sunday when Weinberg killed himself , and from this more light will be shed on a death that already has been officially crossed off as a " suicide . " Those in the house included J. Richard ( Dixie ) Davis and Harry Schoenhaus , two remaining principal witnesses against Hines . Also there were Joseph Kaitz , whose .38-caliber revolver Weinberg used in his death and who is an investigator for Mr. Dewey , and five New York detectives assigned to guard the three co-defendants of Hines . Mr. Mulry sent another telegram yesterday to the Governor . In this he said : " Sincerest appreciation for consideration given my telegram . Newspapers divulge Mr. Dewey states he investigated case . However , information is no evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolver , nor was any test made of any other hand in house Sunday . A reporter reputedly had determined that homicide revolver was in possession of an individual police officer for forty-eight hours subsequent to death . " Sticks by " Crackpot " Remark Mr. Dewey declined to make any further answer to telegrams by Mr. Mulry , sticking to his earlier remark which characterized them as ' " crackpot stuff . " Against the eventuality , however , that the Weinberg death might be- come an issue in the second trial , he made it a point to get into the record the history of Weinberg 's ailment . This came as Mr. Stryker and Mr. Brassel were outlining to the jury the story of Weinberg 's past and his character as revealed in Mr. Stryker 's cross-examination last Summer . During the first hours , as Mr. Stryker hammered again at Weinberg , who was impersonated by one of his own trial staff , the jurors were interested . But after more than 100 pages of it they tired , became bored and seemed no longer interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weinbem 's admission that he was a " burglai , a perjurer and a gangster , " and that he had carried a pistol . But omitted was the incident at the first trial when , called upon by Mr. Stryker to face Hines and repeat his accusation , his repetition had brought from the defendant the low-voiced contradiction , " You lie , and you know you lie . " Once Assistant District Attorney Charles P. Grimes asked the court to review his admonition that the testimony be read in an ordinary voice , after which Mr. Stryker said that he had , perhaps , been too overcome , and lowered his tones . Meanwhile , in Westchester County , District Attorney Walter Ferris declared that the White Plains Chief of Police , William Miller , had informed him that no wax impressions of Weinberg 's hands had been made , or of those of any other person in the Chappel Mansion last Sunday . " I wrote to Governor Lehman , " Mr. Ferris said , " that in my opinion and in the opinion of every one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . "
