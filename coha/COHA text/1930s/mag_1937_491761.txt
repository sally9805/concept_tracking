FIAT securities are not secure ought to be fairly obvious by now , but one of the principal reasons for this state of affairs has , strangely enough , escaped notice in the welter of accusations , political exaggeration and self-serving declarations which generally surround this subject . Recently it has been easy and politically expedient to put the blame on the stock exchanges , distributing houses and investment dealers . They deserve censure for many past practices . But when all malpractices are stamped out , securities will still not be secure . This is largely because the businesses that issue the securities have a shockingly high mortality rate . Corporations die , just like human beings , only more so . And since they die , they should not he regarded as permanent or as having a constant value . Consider the absurdity of applying the word " security " to a bond or a stock . It is hard to find a sillier misnomer . The word " security " is derived from the Latin se , meaning " without , " and rura meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those who have owned bonds or stocks can figure out for themselves whether the literal translation is an accurate description of the goods they bought . Now , most of us have been taught that " security " means freedom from danger or risk . Its use , therefore , to describe paper evidences of debt , or of ownership , both fairly bristling with risks , is clearly misleading and no doubt tends to support the myth of unchanging value , absolute safety , and so on . It is worth noting that only in English-speaking countries is the idea of security confused with investment . In France , they call securities titres , meaning , literally , titles , rights , and so on ; in Germany , Effekten , meaning effects or possessions , or Weripapiere , meaning valuable papers . Perhaps it is natural enough in England ? where Rotten Row is the swank bridle-path and where words like " Cholmondeley " become " chumlay " ? that a risk should be called a security . The real wonder is that , in the process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurts to think that in God 's own country we should follow the fine old English custom of calling something precisely what it is not . Perhaps it is only human , however , for us to pick pretty names for ugly facts whenever we can , and to call evidences or a debt or a share in the risk of some enterprise by a word denoting the exact opposite , Thus we reach the point where our original comment that securities are not secure can be expanded to include a further statement that we believe securities are really " risks . " If this causes the reader of this article to become confused , we can only say that it is an ideal state of mind in which to approach the subject of investments , since it brings the reader down to the level of those of us who have to work intimately with bonds and stocks . In this discussion , therefore , we shall try to find out what has been the experience of the average investor in the present century ; to point out the extremely high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor has bought at various periods during the last thirty-five years ; to indicate that , in the nature of things under our type of national economy , designed for progress , capital is not perpetuated but is consumed in the processes of production and distribution of goods ; and finally , to suggest that not only the average investor but the so-called businessman investor as well had better keep an eye on his investments . For businesses die of old age , or have a fatal heart attack from fright , or are killed by epidemics of paralysis through taxation , or are murdered by hit-and-run politicians , or meet the sudden accidental death of new invention , or have a fatal accident from taking reckless chances , or are choked to death by poor or dishonest management , or commit suicide because they are hungry and life is not worth living . Whatever the reason , they die . Let us see , then , what happens to the next of kin . Our first task is to find the average investor and to see what he actually bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the alluring pastime of using hindsight and find some method which is adequate and completely impartial . We must not bring today 's judgment to bear and select securities of thirty-five years ago in the light of present knowledge . And since this study has a serious purpose , we must use figures or cite sources , so that statements of fact can be verified . Fortunately for us , figures are available which make our study possible . When we speak of bonds and stocks , we ordinarily mean the securities of our publicly owned and nationally known business enterprises  --  Big Business . The names of these companies are well-known . Stocks and bonds of practically all of them have been traded in for years on the New York Stock Exchange . The selling prices of these investments , the volume traded in , the dividends and interest which they receive , and the outstanding developments in the affairs of the companies which originally issued them have been published regularly for years in the leading newspapers throughout the country and are matters of public record . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must endow him with some of the frailties of us human beings and assume that he has to have something to live on  --  income , in other words . The average person rarely buys an investment which is not paying any dividend or interest , at least at the time he buys it . Professional traders and smart investment men might buy the nondividend payers , but not the hard-working average investor . He needs income , If , therefore , we take the twenty dividend-paying stooks which had the largest volume of sales on the New York Stock Exchange in any given year , we shall have a list of the twenty most popular issues at that re  --  ntenued on Paso 1041 THE SATURDAY ( Continue/id from Page 101 ) " My dear child , " said Markelof , " there never was but one thing and , down underneath , I am certain that you knew it as well as I did . " Alma rose to her feet and he rose with her . She held out her hand . " Good-by , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't worked for you at all . Apparently I 'm never going to work for you . And yet I feel that I have been working for you for years . " " And I hope that you will continue to work for me for a good many years more , " answered Markelof , " but not in Tin Pan Alley . " He followed her to the hallway and watched the lights of the elevator sink down in the shaft . He glanced at his watch and left the door ajar , for Gladys Tolles would be along at any time now . Surely enough , in three or four minutes , from his dressing room he heard her tentative call in the little entrance corridor . " Come in . Come on in , " he answered . " I 'll be right there . " time . In fact , in one year covered in this discussion , the volume of these twenty stocks was almost 80 per cent of the total transactions in all stocks , both dividend and nondividend paying . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel fairly sure that the list represents about what the average member of the buying public would have selected at that time . Similarly , if we take the twenty interest-paying corporate bonds which had the largest sale on the New York Stock Exchange in the year in which they were bought , and which were still outstanding  --  or for which securities received through reorganization were still outstanding  --  in 1936 , we shall get a fair picture of what was being bought at that time . There is no hindsight possible here . We just take the figure of volume from public records , eliminate the companies paying no dividends or interest , and retain the twenty most actively traded stocks and bonds providing an income . In addition to giving us a list of popular favorites of the day , this procedure also automatically gives effect to the element of fashion in investment . When fashion compels the automobile to have a facial and a finger wave annually , some attention had better be paid to it . Just to see how it works and what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he considered attractive during 1936 among those stocks that paid a dividend before the year 's end . He liked the looks of American Radiator &; Standard Sanitary , American Water Works and Electric , Anaconda Copper , Chrysler , Columbia Gas &; Electric , Commercial Solvents , Consolidated Edison of New York , Consolidated Oil , Curtiss-Wright " A , " General Electric , General Motors , Montgomery Ward , North American , Packard Motor Car , Socony-Vaeuum Oil , Sperry Corporation , Standard Brands , Standard Oil Company ( New Jersey ) , United Aircraft , and United Corporation . The quality of his list is not so good as it was in 1935 . But people always buy lower-grade and lower-priced stocks as recovery accelerates . Our friend seems to have obtained some degree of diversification by industries and to have avoided the EVENING POST They came face to face in the living room , Gladys looking very smart and night-elubbish in her evening wrap , he looking mussed and rather grayer than usual in his dressing gown .

" What do you mean ? " Markelof laughed . " She 's going on a sixteen weeks ' concert tour as accompanist for Kasschau . After that she 's going to Europe . " " With Kasschau ? " " Yes , Kasschau . Odd as it sounds , until about forty minutes ago he was running in second place to Levinne &; Co . But now he 's first . " ( Continued from Page 20 ) more conspicuous cats and dogs . So we can say that he seems to do a fairly good job . And if he did it in 1936 , it 's reasonable to assume that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the light of conditions existing then . For our purposes , therefore , we may be satisfied that our average investor will do about what the average untrained man would do year in and year out . We are going to take our average investor back to the beginning of this century and let him start investing . We are going to give him ample funds to diversify his investments . We are going to give him about $200,000 for stocks , plus something extra to take advantage of rights , and approximately the same amount for bonds . Then we are going to get him to invest in three other periods , so as to give him a fair chance to benefit by every type of money market and start him off in various stages of the business cycle . For this purpose there have been selected four representative periods since the beginning of the present century , in order to determine exactly how the average investor in each of those four periods would have fared through December 31 , 1936 . The years selected are 1901 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection are given mere fully below . Investing in 1901 The year 1901 was at the beginning of a golden age in American financial and economic history . The building up of the West had just been completed and the country was beginning to reap the fruits of its labor . The first Bryan campaign and the fear of bad money that went with it were long since past . A period of remarkable scientific and industrial expansion lay ahead . The automobile , the telephone , the electric light and the radio were in their infancy . There was a plentiful supply of capital for industry , and interest rates were low . During the succeeding generation , the standard of living and the general prosperity of the people of the United States were to advance to the highest levels in history . Surely there could scarcely be a more favorable April Jr tp , s , In fits and starts , Markelof told her the story , then shut himself in the inner room to finish his dressing . When he appeared again he was very much the impresario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a white scarf draped over his shoulders , but , as he entered , Gladys Tolles , from her seat by the fire , did not look up or turn . " All ready ? " asked Markelof , and only then did he realize that she was quietly sobbing . " Oh , Dave , " she murmured , " I know you were right , but  --  but  --  oh , this is perfectly ridiculous , but I feel as if I had lost my baby . " " So do I , " answered Markelof gravely , " but that was exactly why I did what I did . " Rather stiffly he moved around the room , collecting his coat , his gloves and his stick . He stood for a moment behind Gladys ' chair , then reached down gently and pressed his hand on her shoulder . " Well , old girl , " he suggested , " shall we carry on ? " 4 time than this for the profitable investment of funds in American industry . But what is the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 shares of each of the twenty most popular dividend-paying stocks on December 31 , 1901 , and held them through 1936 , adding , in the meantime , all the melons in the form of stock dividends , and all the plums in the form of stock split-ups , and had exereised all the valuable rights to subscribe to additional stock , the aggregate market value of his total holdings at December 31 , 1936 , would have shown a shrinkage of 39 per cent as compared with the cost of his original investment . In plain English , the average investor paid $294,911.90 for things worth $180,072.06 on December 31 , 1936 . That is a big disappearance of dollar value in any language . Now , it may occur to the reader that 1936 was not representative of a normal period . We do not believe that it was normal for every type of industry . Frankly , we do not know any accurate way of determining what is normal for a nation of 130,000,000 people ; we do not know that what was normal yesterday will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes make normality a 4 more or less fluid and changeable thing . And we believe that 1936 was a good year in many senses . Farm income was high , industrial employment was expanding , automobiles had one of their best years , retail trade was at a high level , and steel production was very good  --  in fact , finished steel production was not much below 80 per cent of the 1929 total . To offset the hangovers of depression on prices , there was a most unusual forced dis- ' tribution of dividends , caused by the penalty tax on undistributed earnings . The Federal Reserve index of instils-trial production  --  adjusted  --  stood at 121 ? preliminary  --  in December , 1936 , compared with its normal of 100 , having been 97 in January , 1936 . But we can take some other period as normal to avoid argument on an unimportant point . Certain experts have picked 1926 as a normal good ( Continued en Page 106 ) ( Continued from Page 104 ) times or well-balanced year for purposes of comparison with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor in the above stocks came out , comparing 1001 with 1926 . He still showed a capital loss  --  this time of 6 per cent . What he paid $255,312.37 for  --  including additional investment through exercise of valuable rights up to December 31 , 1926 ? was , at the end of the normal year , worth $240,216.08 . The detail underlying these figures is even more significant for our purposes . From 1901 through 1936 , five of these twenty companies went into receivership or got into other difficulties . That gives us a death rate of 25 per cent . Out of twenty companies , the stocks of ten , or half , showed a shrinkage of 50 per cent or more as compared with cost . The average investor 's capital can fairly be said to have taken quite a lot of punishment . It should be noted that we have discarded those stocks which , though they might have been favorites in 1901 , were paying no dividends at the time of purchase . The reasons for this were explained at the outset . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payers had been included . Railroad stocks constituted the backbone of the list in those days and accounted for thirteen of the most popular stocks in that year . Industrial stocks accounted for four issues , and utility stocks for three . The reader may be inclined to wonder whether the result shown above was because our investor bought stocks , and to feel that bonds would have given him absolute safety of capital . He will no doubt agree that the highest level of averages of bond prices ever seen in this country gives our investor the best break he could possibly hope to get for comparison purposes . If , in addition to the twenty most popular stocks , the investor had also purchased , on December 31 , 1901 , $10,000 principal amount of each of the twenty most popular interest-paying corporation bonds , his investment , by the end of 1936 , would have shown a shrinkage of 4 per cent in market value as compared with the original cost . Nineteen of the twenty bonds in 1901 were railroad bonds . Comparison with 1926 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of all-time highs in bond averages in 1936 , seven issues showed losses as compared with cost ; thirteen issues showed profits . Three issues were worth less than half of what was paid for them . Five of these twenty issues went into default before the end of 1936 ? a mortality rate of 25 per cent . If our investor had followed normal practice and diversified his holdings between bonds and stocks in the interest of greater safety , we can get some idea of what would have happened to him by combining the two lists . After having his capital at risk for thirty-five years of enormous industrial progress and national growth , our investor would show an aggregate loss of about 25 per cent . And one out of four companies in the bond list as well as the stock list would have gone into bankruptcy . If this is a sample of what happens to the bloated bondholder , we need not feel so badly about missing the bloat , investing in /910 Between the years 1901 and 1910 the United States showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term capital , and funds were obtained from abroad . Bank credit was expanded . The standard of living of the American people was rising . The airplane had been invented . The number of telephones and automobiles in use was increasing rapidly . Within ten years the extraordinary war prosperity was to be experienced . In 1910 , railway securities were still the leaders in the stock and bond markets . Of the twenty leading stocks , twelve were railroad issues . The favorites among the railroad stocks had changed somewhat from the end of 1901 ; some of the issues which were in a weaker position having been shunted aside for those whose position was strengthening . The period from 1901 to 1910 saw great developments in the copper industry of the United States . It is not surprising , therefore , to find that four out of the six industrial companies whose stocks were included in the twenty leading stock issues in 1910 were companies in the copper and nonferrous metal industry . The three utility stocks on the 1901 list did not reappear in the 1910 list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The individual who invested at the end of 1910 in each of the twenty most popular stocks in that year did much better than his predecessor who made the investment on December 31 , 1901 . The market value of the twenty most popular stocks from December 31 , 1910 , to December 31 , 1936 , went up about 5 per cent . This was , as in the previous instance , after receiving the benefit of all stock dividends , split-ups , and exercising valuable subscription rights . But out of the twenty stocks , fourteen , or 70 per cent , showed losses ; six showed gains . Six had losses of more than 50 per cent ; nine issues , or 45 per cent , were not on a dividend-paying basis at the end of 1936 . Three of the twenty companies had been through reorganization during the period , and one of these companies was in receivership for the second time . And that is quite a neat trick . The bond list fared worse . In 1910 , as in 1901 , railroad bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  three utility and one industrial  --  other than railroad bonds were included in our list of the twenty most popular interest-paying corporation bonds on the New York Stock Exchange . Money rates were moderate throughout 1910 . However , a business depression was not far ahead . This began in good earnest before the start of the World War . Of the sixteen favorite railroad bonds in 1910 , three went into default before America entered the World War . Two or three others had fairly close calls in the difficult years that followed the war . Moreover , two of the three public-utility issues on the list of bonds also went into default before 1920 . In other words , out of twenty bond issues bought in 1910 , five were in default within ten years . And by the end of 1936 , eight , or 40 per cent , of the companies had been bankrupt , in default or in reorganization . In fact , the effect of this death rate of corporations was such that the average investor who tried to be prudent and diversify his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up after twenty-six years with a capital loss of about 6 per cent on the combined portfolio . The investor purchasing , on December 31 , 1910 , $10,000 principal amount of each of the twenty most popular corporation bonds in 1910 , who continued to hold them  --  or , in place of the original holdings , , retained such securities as he received in accordance with the various reorganization plans  --  incurred a shrinkage of 20 per cent in the market value of his principal by the end of 1936 . Within this period our investor saw the 40 per cent of his bond purchases go into default . He can not explain away that type of per ) formance by saying it must have been something he ate . Investing In 1919 The year 1919 was a betwixt-andbetween year . The World War had ended and the boom that accompanied it had collapsed . The short-lived boom of 1920 had not yet developed . It was a year of confusion for the investor . The railway industry was in the dumps . The United States Government had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain standard return was being paid to the owners of the properties . The results of railroad operations themselves were for the most part very unprofitable . The automobile industry had received W. great impetus as a result of the war . Although tremendous progress lay ahead of this industry , no one was sure of what was going to happen in this or in other lines of industry , or which companies would do well in the future . In view of the conditions prevailing in 1919 , it is not surprising to find only two railroad stocks included in the list of the twenty most popular stocks of that year . The utility industry was to a large extent in financial straits . Stocks of utility companies were neglected and none appeared in the list of the twenty favorites in that year . The stocks of automobile companies accounted for three of the most popular industrial stocks in 1919 . These were Studebaker , Willys-Overland and Genp era/ Motors . Stocks of steel companies accounted for another four . One more of the industrial issues was the stock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 , were reduced to two issues . The results of an investment made in 100 shares of each of the twenty leading stocks in 1919 were peculiar . Before the end of 1936 , eighteen companies had stopped paying dividends and four of these had become bankrupt . That is to say , 90 per cent of these investments had been rather ill , and four , or 20 per cent , had died . Thirteen of the issues were not on a dividend-paying basis at the end of 1936 . Here enters one of those lucky breaks that make people believe in Santa Claus and provide high-pressure salesmen and customers ' men with sales arguments ? " Hit one on the nose and it makes up for the wrong guesses . " Maybe . Of the investment in the automobile industry , two of the three ventures were most unfortunate , with losses ranging up to virtually 100 per cent . The investment , however , in 100 shares of the stock of the General Motors Corporation , although disproportionately large because the stock sold at $339 per share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful . This single purchase retrieved the capital position of the stock list , so that the market value of the list as a whole at the end of 1936 was 17 per cent greater than the original investment . The excess of market value over cost was $39,655.26 . Eliminating this one stock would make the list as a whole show a loss of $76,205.24 , or 38 per cent , and in spite of the fact that our investor has a profit , the corporate mortality rate of the list was at the astonishing figure of one out of five , or 20 per cent . Bonds were on the bargain counter in 1919 , chiefly as a result of the pressure of the World War financing and the resulting high level of interest . At the end of 1919 , the United States Government 's Fourth Liberty Loan 4% per cent bonds , due in 1938 , sold at 92.20 to yield nearly 5 per cent to maturity , Compare this with current long government bond coupons of 2 per cent . and yields of about 2.35 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty most popular issues in 1919 , which is still paying interest regularly , sold on December 31 , 1919 , at a price to yield more than 10 per cent . Within a few months , railroads of undoubted credit borrowed on equipment-trust obligations with 7 per cent coupons . There have been but few occasions in our history when the holder of ready cash could have invested it in bonds to better advantage than at the end of 1919 . It , therefore , offers the opportunity we have wanted to give our investor the chance to buy bonds at a uniquely favorable time and to bold them to an abnormally high level , so that he might see his dream come true . Although the stocks of railroad companies were neglected in 1919 , their bonds still formed the backbone of the corporation-bond list . Fourteen of the twenty most popular bonds in 1919 were railroad issues . Due chiefly to the unusual conditions under which they were acquired , the experience of the investor with the 1919 list of the twenty most popular bonds was exceptional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty corporation-bond issues in 1919 , taken as a whole , actually showed an appreciation in market value of 19 per cent from the end of 1919 to the end of 1936 . This was due to a large extent to the very marked decline in money rates during the period , which in itself brought about a great advance in bond prices . We have found , therefore , a time when our investor 's capital would have been preserved and actually showed an appreciation . Yet . the companies went on dying and four of the bond issues had gone into default by the end of 1936-20 per cent mortality . Tho combined portfolio of stocks and bonds bought in this delightful year for investors showed an aggregate appreciation of about 18 per cent . This is the first , and , as we shall see , the only one of our four periods in which our investor ended up with as much as he started with on a combined list of stocks and bonds . The fact that his portfolio value is higher than cost generally leads our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being human , he begins to think that he is pretty good and that he has found a way to make easy money . And thinking so , he is all set to receive the kiss of death . Investing In 1926 , the Normal Year The year 1926 was one of general prosperity . It has been frequently used in recent years as the normal year of the past decade . It was a year which was free from the depression influences of the early 1920 's , and it . preceded the final boom of that decade which culminated in September , 1929 . Money in 1926 was in good supply and the rates of interest were moderate . Of the twenty most popular stocks in 1926 , six were the issues of automobile companies , three were those of oil companies , and there was one stock of a steel company . Railroad stocks were still comparatively neglected , THE SATURDAY It is of interest to see how the popular favor in stocks and bonds had ? hanged by the end of 1936 . Last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's hat . The list of the twenty most popular dividend-paying stocks at the close of 193 ( 1 contained not one railroad stock . Only one of the 1901 list of most popular stocks was still a favorite in 1936 . Only two of the 1910 and 1919 lists and lour of the 1926 List reappeared on the list for 1936 . The list of bonds still showed railroad obligations predominating . The changed fashion in bonds , however , in 1936 , was even greater than in stocks . Not one of the bonds appearing on the 1901 list , only one on the 1010 list. , and two of the issues on each of the 1919 and 1926 lists appeared on the list of the twenty most popular bonds in 1936 . A Look Backward  --  and Forward If we were to examine in detail the record of investments prior to the beginning of the present century , we would probably find the same process of the slow consumption of invested capital as outlined above . The history of corporation finance prior to 1900 is largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American railways , one of the things that made EVENING POST America possible , was done at terrific expense . By and large , the profits of investors from the early railroad ventures were comparatively short-lived and the losses were staggering . Most of the great railway systems of the United States have undergone receivership or financial reorganization since their original establishment , and some of them have had such unfortunate developments occur two or three times in their history . The investor and his capital , of course , were sacrificed on each one of these occasions . Since 1929 , about eighty railroad companies have failed . About ninety companies , representing more than 25 per cent of the total railroad mileage , are now in receivership or bankruptcy . The pessimist cites such figures to show that railroads are being ruined by other forms of transportation or by governmental regulation . The optimist uses the very same figures to show that nearly 75 per cent of the rail mileage is free from default. , and that. , to support themselves , railroads must still provide the cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures merely to suggest that railroads are like any other businesses  --  the good ones live , the weak ones die . Commercial and industrial enterprises have a much more appalling mortality rate . Though no accurate figures are available showing the amount of capital funds lost by investors or proprietors , it is a matter of record that an average of one out of every five active commercial and industrial enterprises in the ' United States went out of business in each year from 1930 to 1935 inclusive . An average of about 416,000 business enterprises discontinued in each of these years . The life of the average business which disappeared during this period was under six years , This mortality rate-20.3 per cent  --  compares with a mortality rate of slightly more than 1 per cent for all human beings in the United States . Another measure of the death rate of big business is found in the number of defaults existing as of July 1 , 1936 , in issues of which the corporate trustees were banks in cities of 1,000,000 population or over . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or about 19 per cent  --  were in default . In an effort to make a fairly difficult subject a little more tolerable , we have tried to use examples within the experience of most of us . We have , therefore , shown what happened to the dollar value of our investor 's portfolio . But we do not mean to emphasize the matter of gain or loss through price change resulting from a variety of influences . Our principal concern in this study is to find out what happened to the businesses that issued bonds and stocks to the public . This can be shown in the table below , which summarizes what we have given in more detail above : O  --  M , " J , May The situation disclosed by this table enables us to say that the failure or death of about one out of every five big business enterprises , over a period of years long enough to include at least one period of depression , is not an unusual happening . Businesses , therefore , seem to have a death rate very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high a degree of risk in the very existence of business , it is little wonder the paper promises that corporations issue and evidences of a part ownership in them are not secure . But you must not think that these figures merely show that business is a poor physical and moral risk . Such reasoning might lead you to the false conclusion that government obligations are better on both counts . It is true that governments rarely default on their bonds expressed in their own currencies . They do not have to . They can always print paper money to pay off their bonds , Therefore , we can hardly give them much credit for doing so easy a thing . Let us take a quick look at governmental morality and fair dealing . The record of international debts is not very inspiring . England , France , Italy , Belgium , and many others have defaulted on their obligations held by this country . Germany 's bond defaults are notorious . Our own Government repudiated its promises on gold bonds and gold certificates , thereby making a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own citizens who had relied on its promises . There is certainly no point in getting excited about all this or falling into a fit of moral indignation . We merely must recognize that in dealing with people in mass or with governments , one is dealing with something very A similar to a natural or elemental force . ' No one would consider for one moment entering into a contract with the Pacific Ocean by which it agreed to stay calm , or of accepting the promise of the North Wind to blow only once each quarter . Yet we have been taught cheerfully to accept the assurances of representatives of forces just as unpredictable , just as full of moods , and just as far above and beyond laws which an individual must respect . When debt becomes very burdensome , actually or politically , a government 's promise is generally no better than the famous scraps of paper . In fact , the record of governmental honesty with its people is definitely had over the life of a nation . And since governments are normally in the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injured party can do about it . Hence , many careful credit men claim that the word of honor of a private citizen of character who has a family is as good an obligation as one can get . We do not have to go that far . All we need to say for the ( c ? mow . d on Page 110 ) **26;1241;TOOLONG . . ... ( Contin ... 4 from Page 108 ) present is that bonds of governments can hardly be called " absolutely safe . " Perhaps we have seen enough by now to concede that no investment is safe or unchanging enough " to put away and forget , " as one is so frequently advised to do in periods of rising prices . For our part , we are convinced that the only permanent investment is one which has become a total and irretrievable loss . The old adage " from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations " leads us to our next observation . It would appear that consumption of capital by industry is a natural accompaniment of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth is consumed or is dissipated . We do not know the precise stage , but it seems to be a continuous process , and we suspect that overvaluation of investments has a great deal to do with it . The natural business hazards of improvements in manufacturing technique , new fashions , varying interest levels , taxation , competition , and the like , should be obvious to us , To this list governmental competition or subsidy should be added in certain businesses . But we particularly want to By judicious advertising , the solicitor said , Henry could increase his sales ; more sales would make it profitable to carry bigger assortments ; bigger assortments would naturally at tract still more business . Henry Smith was in good shape to experiment with advertising . It is a ruism of business that advertising alone ca n't do much for your business unless you are already doing well . If you are n't doing well , then that is proof that something is fundamentally wrong with your business . It is up to you to find out what is wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . Henry had been making a fair profit in his store . It was a very sensible . Theme that the advertising solicitor persuaded him to go into . Henry could afford to spend about forty dollars a week with the newspaper , and still not be hurt much in case the campaign turned out a dud . For his forty dollars he could have , every day , in the newspaper a space six inches deep and two columns wide . The advertising solicitor agreed to prepare the publicity , and did a really good job . In the center of the space he ran an announcement : HENRY M. SMITH , NUMBER SO-AND-SO MADISON STREET , ONLY EXCLUSIVE LEATHER-GOODS DEALER IN CITY , OFFERS BEST VALUES , and then all around the edges of the space were illustrations of handbags , purses , steamer trunks , and the like , with prices . The copy was changed three times a week . A Case of Too Much Co  --  operation Things ran along that way a little while , and Henry was beginning to get some results  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right track . But then something happened . I believe the owner of the rival newspaper had been out of town ; on his return he noticed the new advertiser in the evening publication , and , it was said , gave his advertising staff a call attention to the hazard of emotion . The influence of emotion on all prices has been recognized by careful observers for a long time . However , its tremendous effect . on security prices is not so generally appreciated as it should be . Perhaps this is partly because of the talk about inside information and partly because Wall Street is popularly thought of as coldly rational and scientific in figuring out security values . Well , it is not . On the contrary , it would be much nearer correct to call that imaginary Wall Street of the press a center of emotion . Finally we come to the question of what to do if these somewhat gloomy findings are true . We would like to be bland about it and ready with a simple solution to the problem . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , we will suggest certain precautions which might help the reader , since we believe them to be generally useful . First of all , remember that corpora tions , and businesses in general , die easily and frequently  --  much more frequently than human beings . This suggests that our average investor should try to pick sturdy companies of thorough dressing down for letting business slip through their fingers . A solicitor hotfooted it around to Henry 's store . Though Henry was a good salesman himself , he was a bit weak in sales resistance , The solicitor put it up to him strongly : " You ca n't do a full job , Mr. Smith , by advertising in just one newspaper . " And at the end of his sales talk he said meaningly : " As a merchant , Mr. Smith , you ca n't afford to make enemies . You know , Mr. Smith , that we have quite a lot of people working in our office . We are only human , and it is natural that we like to spend our money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how about a contract ? " A small community is n't like a metropolis , where , if you happen to make an enemy of a person , there are plenty of other people to take his place . In a small city the supply of possible customers is strictly limited . Henry weakened at the thought that the people in the newspaper office might harbor ill will toward him . But he could n't afford to spend any more money on publicity . Not , at any rate , until his business should grow . And so he compromised . Instead of using six-inch , double-column space in one paper , he used a little single-column space in both papers . That brought about the end of his venture into publicity . In such a small space there was only room to run the stereotyped announcement that Henry Smith offered " Best Values . " But he did n't prove that his values were best . He did n't show actual illustrations and prices , so people could judge for themselves . In a few months he dropped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his opinion , advertising did n't amount to anything . I hope it is understood that I am not trying to tell anyone how to run a newspaper . I do n't know much about the newspaper business . But I do know about merchants , and I will venture this : If I were a newspaper owner and 8 . IRIS good quality and reasonable life ex. peetancy . No matter what stage of the business cycle one is in no investment is " good enough to buy with your eyes shut . " Second , remember to be extra esze ? ful when everything begins to look good . No level of prices continues unchanged for long . Third , remember that you are buying risks and not securities . Risk in varying degrees is present in all investments . The safest bond you can buy is still only gilt-edged insecurity . Fourth , remember that governments break promises just . as businesses do , and frequently for the same reasons , There is no such thing as absolute safety in investments . Fifth , remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched all the time , and some responsible and impartial invest . ment man or banker ought to be consulted at frequent intervals for news of your companies . And when you have done all these things , remember that nobody knows much about investments . For the reason that nobody knows much about people or why they want the things they want . had a competitor , I would go to him and say , " From now on , let 's go on the principle that finder 's keepers . If you catch a little merchant first , he 's yours . If I catch him first , he 's mine . " I have seen enough cases like Henry Smith 's to know that the best kind of co-operation is to work your own side I of the street . Front-Page.itis There was one case in our town where a newspaper executive cooperated with a merchant in an ingenious manner and made it pay . The merchant , who was in the furniture line , was a heavy advertiser ; he used , in fact , almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time there had been a merger of our two newspapers , and the consolidated sheet was a. very profitable property . A friend of mine was advertising manager , and he used to tell me a good deal about the furniture merchant . The merchant liked personal publicity . Whenever he was about to go to Chicago on a buying trip or to Atlantic City for a holiday , he called up the newspaper and told them to send a reporter around . Once he went abroad and , on his return , wrote an essay called An Intimate Study of Europe , that was copied from a guidebook , and demanded that the newspaper print it , with his name as author . Another time his daughter played the piano at a church entertainment , and the next day the merchant came around to the newspaper office in person and raised Cain because the society reporlf did n't give any more space to Ifs daughter than to any of the other performers .
