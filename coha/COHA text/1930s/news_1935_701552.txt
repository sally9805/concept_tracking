txt Plans for rapid advancement of the $416,861,000 transit unification plan recommended by Samuel Seabury and City Chamberlain A. A. Berle Jr . will be discussed with the Board of Estimate tomorrow by Mayor La Guardia , who will also take up the question of early demolition of the Sixth Avenue elevated line , as provided in the tentative agreement with the Interborough and the Manhattan Railway Company . " I have ambitions for drastic action with regard to the Sixth Avenue elevated line , " Mayor La Guardia said yesterday . He has I already discussed the matter with John H. Delaney , chairman of the Board of Transportation , and with Borough President Samuel Levy of Manhattan . The Seabury-Berle " memorandum of understanding " with spokesmen for security groups of the Interborough and Manhattan , recommending purchase of these properties at a net price of $232,251,000 , contains a provision under which the city may , without waiting for actual unification , begin " forthwith " the condemnation and razing of the elevated structure . The report submitted by the city 's negotiators , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimates that the proposed early demolition of the elevated line is closely linked with a possible change in plans for construction of the new Sixth Avenue subway . Have Alternative Plans . Although the first contract for the new subway has been let on the basis of doing the entire $57,000,000 job with the elevated structure in place , it is known that engineers of the Board of Transportation have been working on an alternative set of plans and specifications which assume that the elevated structure would be razed before the subway was built . This would save from $5,000,000 to 87.000,000 on the cost of building the new subway. since it would be unnecessary to do the expensive job of underpinning the elevated structure while the underground line was being built . The tentative agreement with the Interborough Manhattan Railwayi groups provides that they will offer no opposition to immediate condem. nation under a law enacted in 1924 . The city is to pay to the trustee of the Manhattan 4 per cent mortgage bonds to the amount of the condemnation award , to be held by that bank as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city . If unification fails the bank will pay it out to the interested parties in accordance with their legal rights . Cost May Exceed $100,000,000 . The cost of condemnation of the Sixth Avenue elevated line , which extends from the lower end of Manhattan to its juncture with the Ninth Avenue line at Fifty-third Street and Ninth Avenue , has been estimated at sums ranging from well over $100,000,000 to much higher figures . An idea of the amount which the city would have to pay for the structure , easements and other rights , may be obtained from the fact that the final award on condemnation of the two blocks of the East Forty-second Street spur was $539,117 . In that case nothing wa. allowed for the franchise and only $235 for junk value of structure . The problem along the route of the Sixth Avenue line is more complicated . That line is an . integral part of an active transportation system . The Seabury-Berle proposal . if adopted , would eliminate corn ? pany and security group opposition to preliminary proceedings before the Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer needed for public convenience and necessity . The agreement contains , however , a provision that the company and its security holders waive no legal rights , and permits them to raise all possible questions at a later date should the unity negotiations break down . In exchange for the non-opposition to preliminary steps toward condemnation and demolition of the elevated structure the city is , under the Seabury-Berle proposal , to defer enforcement of certain tax liens , as well as forego collection of the 10 per cent tax delinquency penalty now imposed on ordinary taxpayers . These forbearances are not unlimited as to amount , however . Although the Board of Estimate is expected to give informal approval to the Seabury-Berle memorandum on the purchase of the I. R. T.-Manhattan properties and to . send word of its action to the Transit Commission , the State body will not act until it has before it a complete and definite plan embracing the B. M. T. , the Interborough and the Manhattan companies . Preparation of the definitive plan will be in the hands of the same group which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction companies . Mr. Seabury will probably exercise only a supervisory function , however , as he is said to feel that his main job  --  that of establishing prices and the outline for a. comprehensive unification plan  --  has been completed . The active work of drawing the plan , drafting the intricate legal documents required and conducting important additional negotiations , will be entrusted to C. D. Williams and William C. Mulligan Jr. , assistant corporation counsel , and James T. Ellis , accountant . These men carried the brunt of the detail work necessary to bring about the tentative agreements . City Chamberlain Berle will continue to function and Corporation Counsel Paul Windels will be in charge of the general job of drawing the definitive plan . When it is completed the Board of Estimate will be asked to give its approval and it will then go to the Transit Commission , which will promulgate it , as drawn or with changes , as the basis for public hearings required by the State Unification Law . The Seabury-Berle proposals were assailed by Assemblyman Edward S. Moran Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that the prices named were excessive and that the 5-cent fare was imperiled . Mr. Moran asserted that he would introduce in the 1936 Legislature a bill calling for a mandatory popular referendum before any unification purchase could be made . He would also introduce , he said , a resolution calling for an investigation of the unification " deal " and the relationship between the La Guardia administration and the " traction ring . " Both measures were submitted by him to the 1935 Legislature , but failed to pass . Mr. Moran also declared that he would seek , in a taxpayer 's action , to enjoin consummation of the proposed unification deal should the Seabury-Berle plan be approved by the Transit Commission . One of his reasons for such action , he said , would be his belief that bonds of the proposed Board of Transit Control would be construed by the courts as direct obligations of the city and therefore charges against its constitutional debt limit .                    @
