txt Prohibition was assailed and defended by leading opponents and supporters last night at a dinner of the American Woman 's Association at the clubhouse , 353 West Fiftyseventh , Street . Former United States Senator James W. Wadsworth , one of the most outspoken of the wets , and Mrs. Charles H. Sabin , president of the Women 's Organization for National Prohibition Reform , led the attack on the Eighteenth Amendment and - its enabling legislation . Dr. James M. Doran , Federal Prohibition Commissioner , and Mrs. D. Leigh Colvin , president of the New York State W. C. T. U. , argued in behalf of prohibition . Mrs. Marion Booth Kelley , first vice president of the association , presiddd . Mr. Wadsworth characterized the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment as a " fundamental error " which had brought " bitter trouble ever since . " Wadsworth Urges I:epeal . " We shall not emerge from these troubles , " he said , " until we retrace our steps and repair that error . It is a question of government much more than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' provision continue to poison our political system such as an abscess at the root of a tooth poisons the human system ? Should not the people of the States have restored to them that power which they possessed for 139 years and which their Legislatures surrendered in time of war ? " If not , how long can the Federal Government stand the strain ? Today the strength of the . Federal Government , in spite of its efforts , is being impaired . Respect for it is decreasing . The people are resisting . They wink at evasion ' and applaud successful hypocrisy . The young are growing up in that atmosphere . Public life is shot ' through with false pretense . No government can prosper in the face of such conditions . " We should be infinitely more concerned about it from this standpoint than from . any other . People tell me there is no way out , that the Eighteenth Amendment can not be changed , much less repealed . I do not believe it . I do not believe that what has been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people are aroused . " Says Liquor Supply Is Unchecked . Mr. Wadsworth , in drawing a bill of particulars against ten years of prohibition , pointed to 250,000 convictions for violation of the ' law , and 80,000 persons . ' arrested . under the prohibition law last year alone . He cited the ' vast expense of enforcement , including the increase in Coast Guard , customs and Treasury Department personnel . Despite all this , he avowed , the liquor supply was unchecked . " It is apparent that effort at enforcement ' is to be further intensi- ' fled , if the supporters of prohibition are to have their way , " he said , referring to suggestions offered by President Hoover 's law enforcement commission . " The right of trial by jury is to be restricted through a system of indirect coercion imposed upon the accused . The purchaser is to be made liable equally with the seller . Should this be done , the number ' of arrests and convictions will be ' tremendously increased . The demand for more prisons which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises of ten years ago , will increase in : proportion . " Mr. Wadsworth went on to recall the " suggestion of Dr. Clarence True Wilson , ardent prohibition advocate , that the marines and the regular army be called out for enforcement purposes , and said that Dr .. Wilson spoke with apparent authority " and practical prevision . " The public wanted liquor , he asserted , and . that was the real reason for the large number of bootleggers . It had been proved useless , he said , to expect one citizen to aid in enforcing the dictates of the law upon another . " We might just as well recognize , " he said , *that the American people are scarcey lifting a finger to help in the enforcement of the prohibition law . Millions are violating it every day without hesitation . Exhort as you please , pile penalty Upon penalty , enlist an enforcement army , call out the regulars and the marines , threaten with bayonets , sprinkle prisons all over the country , spend hundreds of millions , ignore the Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a people . " " Too Much Whisky , " Doran Says . Dr. Doran , in lauding prohibition , said : " The unfavorable symptoms we note in our present situation are due to social changes lagging somewhat behind industrial changes . The speakeasy results from this lagging behind . " It may be that the majority are not in sympathy with the law . If that is so I think it would show in Congressional elections every tWo years . I doubt if the consumption of whisky . is greater than before prohibition , particularly among the middle and producing classes . The Eighteenth Amendment must remain in the Constitution or the country will go back thirty years . Nobody worships the Volstead act . The courts are going to be tuned up and our social , habits are surely going to be changed . " Our problem is not too much prohibition but still too much whisky . The Federal Government should furnish the framework on which . the State should build the details of constitutional action . If the Eighteenth Amendment should be repealed tomorrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be forced to rebuild a machinery at . once to curb alcoholism or suffer a national breakdown . " The way out is ahead , not backward . We should support all moves that aim to eliminate abuses within this broad , conservative course . The Eighteenth Amendment has been , beneficial , and apart from the top and bottom strata it Is apparent that the great middle and producing class has made great forward strides . Their welfare will be a deciding factor . " DUring the question period Dr. Doran. said that the situation on the Canadian border would be improved this ' . year ; : Mrs. Sabin Links Crime to Dry Law . Mrs. Sabin declared that national prohibition was responsible for the " largest organized criminal class in this or any other country . " She recalled promises of members of the Anti-Saloon League of ten years ago that prohibition would reduce crime " by at least one-half . " The " co-educational speakeasy ? one in which men and women , even boys and girls , gathered , " was stressed by Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Today in any speakeasy in the United States " she said , " one may find boys and girls , 16 and 17 years of age , drinking alcoholic beverages , poisonous or non-poisonous . The youth of this nation is rapidly acquiring a taste for hard liquor . " " It is generally conceded , and I believe it to be correct , that the influence of women played a large part in the enactment of this law . The majority of those who worked most actively were women who had had the unfortunate and unhappy experiences as a result of excessive drinking among those close to them . They felt that prohibition would strengthen a weak character . They now realize with heartbreakings and heartburnings that if the spirit is not ' within , legislation can be of no Women should work for a change in this law . Women should pray for a change in this law . " Mrs. Sabin , challenged the W. C. T. U. to turn over to her organization within thirty days the " names . addresses and authoritative proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess prior to the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment , who have ceased drinking as a result of the Eighteenth Amendment . " Mrs. Colvin Wants State Law . Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . Mrs. Colvin declared the need for a State enforcement act in New York State , in coming to the defense of prohibition . " The Eighteenth Amendment " she said , " is the authoritative expression of the will-of the nation that the liquor traffic shall be suppressed . Prohibition has shut off the main sources , of supply . Before prohibition , there were over 1,400 breweries . MVt of these have been dismantled sad turned over to legitimate industries . Some are running and violating the law but sooner or later most of these are caught . " Despite poor enforcement , prohibition 's social , economic , educational and moral benefits have been incalculable . Even in New York the benefits of prohibition are apparent . The only remedy for the evils of bootlegging is not more nullification or repeal but enforcement . The only sensible remedy for existing conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will open the courts in all the sixty-two counties and put 35,000 peace officers to work in the enforcement of the law . " Mrs. Colvin went on to assert that the majority of the country was " dry " and to compare " the president of a large university , an exSenator and men and women of wealth and position " to babies " kicking and screaming when their bottles were taken away . " In response to a question as to whether or not she considered beer an intoxicant , Mrs. Colvin said : " Personally I believe it is n't exactly what I consider an intoxicant . " Shi -- painied and then added : " However , for years previous to the passage . of the - Eighteenth Amendment it was so considered by numerous Legislatures , and appearances here and in other countries seem to bear that out . " The audience appeared to be overwhelmingly unsympathetic to prohibition and it was necessary for the chair to ask that hissing be discontinued : diirlbt Mrs : ** steech :          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
