fairly deep in color , and his mouth was big with full lips that curled in a smile in his soberest moments . Augustus said he did not see how in the world Abraham could cause Mr. Dilliehay to enter the Confederate army . " Well , " explained Gillie , " Dad voted for Abe Lincoln and Granddad before him was a Republican . But about a year ago he had a debt on a man and the man paid him off with Abraham here . So when sesesh come along , Dad thought he 'd better secede too , seeing as he owned Abraham . " Augustus was astonished to know that a man would change his political belief through considerations of property . He had supposed that politics was like religion , an infallible revelation handed down from on high . " I would n't change my politics for a debt , " declared Augustus stoutly . " I guess you would if politics was about to take your stuff away from you , " cried Gillie , laughing . " That 's what law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that 's right , too , " admitted Augustus . " And it jest struck me and Dad to take Abraham down and make him fight on the Confederate side and make him defend our property rights in himself . " Everybody , including Abraham , began laughing . " Yes , suh , " said the black man , poking his lips out , " I 's gwi he'p Mas ' Dilliehay keep me . " " Well , what 's he going to do ? " inquired Augustus , amused at the idea . " I 's gwi stan ' aroun ' on de aidge o ' de battle , an ' if'n Mas ' Gillie gits hu't I wade in an ' fotch he out . " The two boys burst out laughing again at Abraham 's idea of a battle . " Say , nigger , " directed Augustus , " slip back behind the saddle on that mule . You can ride behind just as easy as I can walk . That 's your first work for the Confederacy . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abraham . " P201The change was made and the two boys rode into Savannah laughing and talking . Two or three times Abrahamsaid jocularly : " Mas " Gustus , dis heah mule sho is skinnin ' my behin ' . " " This 'll be good practice for you when the Yankees skin you with their bagnets , " said Augustus winking at Gillie . The blond boy was hilarious in his appreciation of Augustus ' humor . This attitude was utterly delightful and novel to Augustus . At the Vaiden home in Alabama when any member attempted a jest the others sat on him either singly , doubly , or en fanzine . At the courthouse in Savannah , Tennessee , the prospectiverecruits found a patriotic barbecue in progress . A great crowd was on the square , and on the courthouse steps a man was making a speech . He was a compact man with a handsomesquare-cut dissipated face and curly black hair . He shook his head , leaned forward and drummed on a little table before him . " Tennesseeans , countrymen , defenders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of happiness ! I come asking you to lift your sword to defend the sacred altar of your country 's freedom ! Vandals ravish the temple ! This time not British greed and lust for power , but a motley crew from Yankeedom whose hearts are as stony as the inhospitablesoil that bred them ; who make gold their god and a tradesman 's duplicity their ritual of worship . " Cheers and shouts interrupted the orator 's period . Voices cried out : " That 's right , Bailey ! Give ' em hell , Bailey ! " The speaker paused , flung out an eloquent arm . " I intend to give ' em hell ! I 'm here to-day asking you to help me give ' em hell ! " A roar of laughter greeted the turn , and a medley yelled : " We 're with you , Bailey ! Shore we 'll help you ! Lead us to the damned Yankees ! " Augustus plucked Gillie 's sleeve.  | " Who is that man making the speech ? " he asked . Gillie was astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Joe Magnus Bailey , the silver-tongued boy of Hardin . " " He do n't look like a boy . " " Well , no , he do n't , " conceded Gillie . " I 've seen two or three silver-tongued boys and they all look old . However , you 're mighty lucky to hear silver-tongued Joe Bailey make a speech . " The orator had tossed off some water during the cheering and now proceeded with his speech . " Friends , countrymen , if you would fight , you must fight now . The foe withers like dried grass before our invincible arms . Joseph E. Johnston has already strung a rosary of victories from Manassas to Winchester and laid it as an offering at the capitol at Richmond . Shall we allow the bosom of Virginia cavaliers to receive the sword that was thrust at Tennessee ? " Cries of " No ! No ! We 'll go with you , Joe Magnus ! " An uproar broke out among the crowd . Men pushed forward from all directions . New voices on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll find the enlistment officers in the county court clerk 's office ! " cried these guides . " Enlistment papers in the county court clerk 's room ! " There was nothing eloquent about this . It was edged with fact and serious fighting . The crowd poured into the courthousein a sluice . In the midst of this press Gillic Dillichay and Augustus clung to each other and helped push . As they went into the dark room of the court house a sharp-faced man standing beside the entrance said in their ears : " Boys , when they ask you how old ye are , be shore and say eighteen . " " All right . All right , sir , we will , " nodded both youths , deeply grateful for the hint.  |p203WITH  the recruits in Savannah , Augustus drilled more gloriously than did the men in his brother Miltiades ' companybecause Augustus had fallen in with the cavalry . Every morning and afternoon for two weeks Augustus trotted and galloped Abraham 's mule up and down the Savannah fair grounds . He caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column , line to the front , squadron charge . . . and off went the long line of horses and mules , anything the men could find to carry them . It was the most exciting sport Augustus had ever known . At first the horses were inextricably mixed , but gradually both men and animals began to move with that appearance of order which is the terror of cavalry . The recruits who came from out of town were quartered in the different homes in the village or on near-by farms as long as the drilling continued . In between drills the men played cards or wrestled or jumped or got up bets on who owned the fastest horse . Augustus and Gillie were quartered with the Poags . The two boys were quite illuminating to Mrs. Poag . She was a large tanned motherly woman , who had thought that cavalrymen were wild buccaneering fellows . To see her two cavalrymen sitting quiet and rather abashed at the table and to hear them giggling in their room at night was disconcertingto her ideas . They were not fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect might get hurt . Theyp204began to prey on her mind . Her uneasiness about them took the form of food , and every meal she prepared was a feast . She said if she had known they were going to worry her life out of her she never would have taken them in the first place . And Gillie would say , " Now , Miss Emmy , you know you would ! " And Mrs. Poag would declare roundly , " I would not , Gillie Dilliehay ! When you-all are gone I 'll never know a night 's rest wonderin ' what 's happenin ' to you . " One day she asked if they both wrote home regularly . Augustus ' evasive answers led her instantly to suspect that not only did he not write but that he had run away and his mother did n't know where he was . Then " Miss Emmy " was going to write herself . Augustus became very uneasy becauselong ago he had told " Miss Emmy " about his family and where they lived , how many niggers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Poag 's threat to write home about him Augustus would not have been surprised any day to see old man Jimmie ride up and snatch him from the glorious hog-killing time he was having in the cavalry . However , his three weeks ' training was up at last and " Miss Emmy " either had never written , or the information was disregarded from the Alabama end . When the boys were ready to start Mrs. Emmy produced two meal sacks and two big pieces of oilcloth as equipment for her riders . The meal sacks were sewn up at each end and split in the middle to make a kind of rude saddlebag . Mrs. Emmy had put in shirts and socks and enough eatables almost to fill the sacks . The oilcloths were for raincoats or for ground cloths , or they could be propped up with sticks for tents . It turned out later than in fair weather they made very good gaming tables , but at the moment of parting with " Miss Emmy " the boys did not think of that . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls were kissing their brothers and sweethearts and sons farewell.  |p205Mrs  . Poag started in to shake hands with Augustus and Gillie but wound up by kissing them and crying over them . She was afraid something was going to happen to them . But up to the last moment Augustus was not quite sure that " Miss Emmy " would not produce his father and have him miss all the battles and the riding . He left her blinking his eyes to keep back uncavalier tears but greatly relieved to get away unhindered . The troops crossed the river in ferryboats and then rode toward the west , into Mississippi . The country they traversed rose and fell in long undulations , with here and there deep ravines cut by the creeks in the loamy soil . When the troops had ridden three days these undulations had diminished to the vast , almost level plain of the MississippiValley . The horizon was visible so far away that the trees were a faint purpling against the remote sky . They themselves were an oddly equipped cavalry , riding horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their first engagement with the Yankees they expected to improve their mounts and their armament . One day news came through Captain Bailey that the companywould join Forrest 's cavalry at Poplar Springs . Immediatelythe troops were buzzing with talk of Forrest . He was fighting the Union cavalry under General Sturgess . The Yankees were trying to cut the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad which supplied the Confederate forces at Corinth . Here Albert Sidney Johnston blocked the road of the Union armies which were moving down from Kentucky toward Vicksburg . All this talk painted the vastness of the military operationswhich engaged the southern half of a continent . Augustus was surprised that the Yankees had ever got that far south . He asked McClusky , an older man in the troop , if he thought they would win . " Sure we 'll win , " said McClusky . " Jeff Davis has orderedp206out another hundred thousand men . Lee 's moving up into Pennsylvania . . . . " The older man drew out a greasy deck of cards and a handful of Confederate bills . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilliehay played McClusky . Augustus sat by and watched because he had no money . Presently Gillie had no money either , and he sat with Augustus and watched McCluskyplay . The following day , at Poplar Springs , in the early afternoonthe recruits joined the salted troopers under Forrest . These seasoned men were lank and brown , their horses worn and thin . Some of the men wore Confederate gray , some had on civilian clothes , and some had captured blue coats and sabers and carbines from the enemy . Here and there rode a rider with a bandaged head or arm or leg . Augustus ' own troops set up a great shouting when they saw Forrest 's men . They rode forward in their best order while the veterans receiving them laughed with one another at the enthusiasm of the newcomers . " We 'll see what speed you make when the Yankees salt your tails with a few carbine balls , " called out one of the older men . The newcomers were divided up among the seasoned companies . Gillie and Augustus were put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Brewer . That evening , when the quartermaster gave out the bacon and meal , Brewer received the supply for the mess . He gave a slice of bacon apiece to Augustus and Gillie and kept the rest for his two comrades . Gillie was greatly put out . A few minutes later he got up from the camp fire and nodded Augustus after him . When they were aside he said with a long face : " Augustus , Brewer has given all the bacon to Risner and Haddock ! " " Yes , I see he has , " said Augustus , equally disturbed . " What 'll we say to ' cm ? "  | " Well , we can say to " em they made a mistake . " Just then they saw the older men were laughing as theyheld the bacon on their ramrods out over the coals . " All right , you go say that to ' em , " said Gillie . Since Augustus had suggested it it fell on him to say it . So he went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " have n't you made a little mistake ? " " Mistake how ? " asked Brewer , looking up innocently . " Well , in our share of the meat , " Augustus exhibited histranslucent strip . " We eat here , " said Brewer , " according to how good a man you are . A good man eats a lot of bacon but a couple of thin spindlin ' Tennesseeans nachelly do n't require so much . " The other two men were laughing and Augustus became angry . " I 'm from Alabama , " he said , " and I eat as much as anybody . " " Why , that 's funny , " cried Brewer . " I always heard Alabamians was like frogs , they stayed fat on wind . " At this slur on Alabamians Augustus became furious . " No , we do n't eat wind ! " he cried . " We eat wind bags , and I 'm goin ' to make my supper on you ! " With that he shucked off his coat . Brewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two troopers walked away from the fire with a certain formality and the next moment were pounding and biting , gouging one another in the eyes and at the hinge of the jaw . Men from other messes came running in and formed a ring about them . They put up bets on the outcome . " Are they fighting about anything , " asked a man in the ring , " or are they just fighting ? " " They 're fighting about the bacon I got here on this ramrod , " said Risner ; " the winner eats it if he 's got any teeth left . "  |p208Just  then some person in the ring , either with intent to make peace or have a diversion , yelled out : " Hey , you damn fools , Risner is eatin ' your bacon ! You ai n't goin ' to have none left ! " Augustus happened to be on top at the moment . He leaped up from the ground and made toward Risner , who had faithfully stewarded the bacon . At the sight of Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Here you are , " he ejaculated , " if you can hold it . " Augustus took the bacon and looked around at Brewer . " I think I can hold it . If  --  if Brewer do n't think so , we 'll continue  --  the argument , " he panted . Brewer was up , merely standing in the ring of men looking at Augustus . ' That was more bacon than me an ' Risner an ' Haddock could eat anyway , " he said . " We intended to split up with you when we got through laughin ' at ye . " " Well , you 're through laughin ' now . It 's time to split up , " panted Augustus . The incident of the bacon was a very good thing for Augustus . The show he had made with Brewer helped his morale . He could now talk about what he was going to do when he met the Yankees , and Brewer at least was in no position to dispute his word . As the troops rode on day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy . The old men were not uneasy on this point ; they knew they eventually would meet some Yankees . They had met them before and it would happen again . Villages and plantation houses were passed on their endlessmarch through the Mississippi dust . Augustus had never dreamed there could be such thick dust . Compared to it , Alabama dust was as a haze to a bee smudge . It covered both riders and horses in a uniform brown . The troopers ' eyes appeared grotesque batting in the brown masks . One day as the troops rode on , leaving behind them ap209cloud of dust in the air , they saw far off on the horizon another cloud hanging high . It drifted up from the horizon in the shape of a mushroom . Involuntarily the whole column quickened its gait . Augustus turned to Brewer . " Are the Yankees kicking up that dust ? " he asked excitedly . Brewer turned dryly to Risner . " Alabama thinks that 's a dust he 's seeing yonder . " Augustus did n't like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except when he had made some mistake . " Well , it is dust ! " reiterated Augustus warmly . " It 's smoke , " said Risner . " From the color , I judge it 's the damn Yankees burnin ' up the Confederate taxes . " Augustus saw that Risner had set in to make fun of him , too , so he rode on in silence . Gillie Dilliehay , however , braved a possible " catch " and wanted to know how the Yankees could be burning up taxes . " Why , the farmers around here have to pay their taxes in corn and cotton to the Confederate government . That 's corn burnin ' . . . it makes a yellow smoke like that . " The ill-equipped cavalry moved faster and faster toward the distant pyre . The fact that the Yankees were burning corn in such vast quantities stirred Augustus tremendously . If it had been anything else besides corn he could have borne it better . He had worked too many hot days in the cornfield to endure the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had furnished him . He glanced around at the dusty riders and saw that Brewer was watching him . Brewer was watchingto see how Augustus would act when the Yankees were just ahead . Augustus made a resolve that he would outdo Brewer . The squadron increased its pace.  | " How many men has Sturgess got ? " asked Gillie of Brewer . " Enough for Augustus , there , " nodded Brewer . " What do you mean by that ? " asked Gillie . " Why , I mean they 'll be so blamed thick when Augustus shoots into ' ern with his shotgun , I imagine he 'll blame near bring down the whole covey . " Risner and Haddock broke out laughing loudly enough to be heard above the horses ' hoofs pounding in the dust . His shotgun was another sore point with Augustus . Now as the squadron galloped toward the smoke , Augustus resolved to come back with a carbine if he could shoot a Yankee or find a dead one . The smoke was rising out of a town . As the cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman would run out of a house to scream with joy at the coming of the Confederates . They would shout at the dusty riders : " They 're down at the railroad ! " They 're burnin ' up the corn pens ! " At a turn in the village street the riders took to an old field and deployed . Augustus fell in his place in the line as he had been trained . A sudden feeling of invincibility came over him . He waited to cock the barrels of his shotgun . The first glimpse the hobbledehoy caught of the enemy were the silhouettes of horsemen dashing into line in front of the blazing corn pens that lined the railroad . Two hundred yards down the track the little station was in flames . The riders about Augustus suddenly broke into yells , kicked , spurred , and dashed forward at top speed . The squadron spread out right and left like something that tautened before the wind as it charged . The labor he had spent in the Savannah fair grounds kept Augustus and his mule equi-distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal cavalry hastily formed to receive the onslaught.  |p211Before  Augustus ' eyes everything quivered with the vibration of his mule . He yelled and could not distinguish his own voice in the high shrieking uproar of his men . A grotesque rattle of guns broke out around him ; the snap of rifles , the boom of shotguns . Flowers of fire suddenlybloomed among the Federal horsemen who were still chivvying into line . Out of the corner of his eye Augustus glimpsed one of his own comrades slump out of his saddle . His foot caught in the stirrup and he was dragged forward with his head pounding the earth by the frightened horse . Right up on the Federals , Augustus leveled his long jiggling shotgun at a blue cavalryman . A blast of powder smoke shut him off from view . As the boy dashed through his own smoke lie saw the fellow sway . But the Yankee righted himself and drew a saber . A furious hope of finishingthe man with his second barrel seized the youth . As the horse and the mule dashed together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pistol , and fired point blank at his man . The flame tore a hole in the neck of the Federal 's horse . The next moment something bit the boy 's shoulder and back as he leaned almost flat on his mule 's neck . With the saber cut , that assailant made way for others . The tiny glimmer of another sword licked at Augustus , he mashed it down with his shotgun barrel and it flickered into his mule 's shoulder . At that moment the blue fighters around Augustus wheeled about and were suddenly flying back toward the burning corn pens . The mixed character of the Confederate small arms hastened some and stopped others . Augustus loaded his shotgun as his mule lunged forward . He rammed down powder and buckshot . The lunges of his mule grew shorter and unsteady . Suddenly its front legs collapsed , its sharp breast plowed the ground , Augustus went over its neck , fell sprawling but did not lose his gun . In the whirl around him Augustus saw a man holding a horse near a burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . The Yankee had a gun . He leveled it . Augustus bent down , leaped sidewise . As the gun fired he was in the midst of these acrobatics . His own weapon was loaded . He dashed full tilt at the man before he could load his rifle . At that moment the Yankee 's gun fired again . Augustus ' side went numb . He braced his legs in a desperate effort to keep from falling . He fired both his own barrels and the man with the rifle dropped to the ground . At that moment Augustus saw all the Confederate cavalry had turned back . Up from the village came another gallopinghorde of blue coats . Augustus tried to get to the horse the dead Federal still held . His legs seemed limber . If he could reach the horse .. . and mount him . . . At that moment hoofs dashed up behind him . Somebody leaped to the ground , seized him around the waist , and hurled him upward to the saddle . Brewer 's voice shouted : " You Goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of us run ! " The blue cavalry down the track let loose with a crackling volley at the two riders on the flying horse.  |p213HE  Confederate cavalry had employed the usual Forresttactics at Okalona , Mississippi , where the main body of Sturgess cavalry had been concentrated . They had struck and vanished with equal suddenness . The ill-furnished gray horsemen went out of Okalona at full tilt . They dashed out on the road they had entered and slid down the railroad track for another stab at the Yankees . As Augustus clung on before Brewer , the dust , the flying horsemen , the people running out of their houses to shout at the Confederates all formed a scene painful and vaguely unreal , as violent action always appears to a wounded man . In the clatter of flight Brewer growled , " You 're bound for the hospital , damn you ! . . . what the hell I ever fooled with you for ? " Brewer gave the last acrid flavor to Augustus ' bad day . " Where are we headed  --  camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't see how to ride . " Augustus looked at the red sun through a haze of dust . One side of him seemed dead , but his back and shoulder where the saber marked him burned . He did n't know how far he could ride . Brewer was bitter against the boy he had picked up . " What did you run on that Yankee for , him with his gun on you ? Why n't you shoot him at the start ? " " Hell , " groaned Augustus , " his gun ought to ' a ' been empty . . . he shot at me once ! " " Of all damn fools ! " flared out Brewer in utter disgust.  | " You ai n't worth totin ' off . Do n't you know them Yankees load their guns in the mornin ' an shoot ' em all day long ? " " That 's a lie , " said Augustus . " You 're trying to stuff me . " " You 're hard to convince , " observed Brewer dryly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yankee could have shot time after time without reloading his gun . He had never heard of a repeating rifle . He thought of the terrible advantage such a weapon would give a man . Here he was with his side numb because he had made a mistake . His frustration and his pain made Augustus sick . The flying cavalry turned off the road and halted in a grove of cottonwoods . The sergeants began the roll call . When it came to his own company and mess , Gillie Dillliehay was missing . The colonel came around on inspection . He looked at Augustus holding on to Brewer 's saddle . " That man goes to the hospital , " directed the officer . A fear that had been hovering in the back of Augustus ' head materialized . " Is n't that hell , " he mumbled to Brewer  --  " sent to the hospital at my very first battle ! " " You 'd fought better if you 'd had brains , " growled Brewer . " Besides , that was n't a battle ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The colonel said , " Your lieutenant tells me you rescued Vaiden under fire , Brewer . " Brewer put his hand to his hat with the awkwardness of a volunteer soldier . " I 'll mention that in my dispatches , " said the colonel . Brewer glanced from side to side to see if any of the men were listening . Just then the colonel said , " What 's wrong with your boot ? " Brewer looked down . " Nothin ' wrong with my boot that I knows of . "  | " It 's full of blood , you 're wounded . " Brewer dropped all military formality and began swearingit was nothing but a flesh wound . The colonel dropped all military formality and told him to get off his horse damn quick and let a surgeon put a tourniquet on that leg . Brewer and the colonel argued about this . The colonel threatened Brewer with arrest . When Brewer got off his horse he could n't stand on the leg . " Well , damn such a come-off ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twelve other men were put in wagons and started for the hospital . The wagon beds were padded with pine tops and covered with blankets.  |p216N  THE hospital at Lauderdale Springs , Mississippi , Brewer lay two cots removed from Augustus . For that much luck Augustus was thankful , but he could have wished the fellow well on the opposite side of the big square frame building . At times he wished Brewer were kicked completely out of the hospital and that he himself was the kicker . The cause of this mental violence was Brewer 's jokes . The trooper was the sort of fellow who keeps telling the same thing over and over . The two of them had been in the hospitalbarely two hours when Brewer began explaining to the surrounding cots that Augustus was wounded because he had stood waiting for a Yankee to get through shooting at him before he opened fire in return . Everyone laughed . This embarrassed Augustus , and when he tried to explain that he never before had seen a repeating rifle , the laughter rose to an uproar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded with Brewer to shut up . Even the woman nurses had to control their faces , and this took the last remnant of self-assurance from Augustus . After that he lay thinking of the different things he would like to see happen to Brewer : scalding , to be led around by the nose with red-hot pincers , and so forth and so forth . Brewer would repeat the story of Augustus ' wound at least three times a day . He would turn to some cot and ask its occupant if he had heard how Mr. Augustus Vaiden came to be wounded , or how Mr. Vaiden of Alabama camep217to be wounded . The addressed man would always declare , with great interest , Why no , he had n't heard it , how did it happen ? Then Brewer would tell it over again with any variation that he had studied up since the last rehearsal . The story grew more and more ridiculous from day to day . Augustus ' wound ached at fairly regular intervals but he suffered acutely only when the surgeon dressed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His name was Wright . He was a young doctor who was still in the stage of using long scientific terms before the nurses . Also he had the Napoleon complex and moved about the hospital with lips set very firmly together . He performed any operation indicated without regard to the fact that wounds are the torn ends of agonized nerves . He attended the patients under his care in the spirit of Napoleon destroyingthe enemy at Austerlitz . A nurse whom everyone called Miss Mack helped Wright at these dressings . Now it was a point with Augustus never to seem to be suffering . He tried to keep the muscles in his face from twitching , he regretted the perspiration that broke out on his forehead . But with all his resistance , once under an excruciating stab , he gasped out : " Gad damn it , Doc , ca n't you be easier ? " Lieutenant Wright was neither easier nor harder . He proceededwithout a word , as if Augustus had said and felt nothing at all . Presently he went away and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry that he had exhibitedpain before Miss Mack . However he made an ex post facto show of stoicism by saying : " Look yonder at Brewer lying there . That 's all he does , lies . . . and usually about me . " Augustus had not intended this pun when he started his sentence , it had just worked itself out to his own surprise and pleasure.  | Miss Mack broke into pleased laughter . " You ought n't to let him tease you . You ought to say that to him and cut him off . " " I 'll do that next time , " said Augustus , " if I can remember it . " " You stand your dressings better than any man in the ward , " added the nurse . An almost pathetic gratitude flooded Augustus to find an unmocking soul in the midst of a life of endless mockery or inattention . He would have thanked her but he had no words . He said : " How long have you been here , Miss Mack ? " " My name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me that . My name is Rose McClanahan . " " Oh ! " ejaculated Augustus , with a very odd impression , as if the nurse had gone to the trouble of taking off her cap and apron and showing herself a woman in a pretty dress and with bright combs in her black hair . It had accomplished more than any mere telling of a name Augustus had ever heard . Then he added awkwardly , " Much obliged . " Miss Mack simply smiled in response to this . As she bent over him , fluffing his pillow , he could see the closure of her full lips , the tiny darker flecks in the iris of her brown eyes . Her eyebrows were dark and a little rough . One had a tiny curl at the bend of her forehead . Her complexion was smooth , and looking up under her chin he saw a delicate ivory cast blending into her whiter neck . What her age was , or even that she had an age , never entered Augustus ' head . When she finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say the nurse , Miss Mack , went to the other patients ; the astral Miss Rose McClanahan remained by Augustus ' cot . When the wounded boy looked out the windowat a grove of maples he saw Miss Rose McClanahan there . She looked at him also from the rolling clouds of spring beyond the maples . Breaths of cold and scented airp219that came in through the window were Rose McClanahan 's cool fingers on his face . Other things amused Augustus through the hospital window . Buzzards sailed across the sky in funereal argosies .. . and the boy wondered where was Gillie Dilliehay ? Then two squirrels lived in the maple grove and made Augustus wish he had a gun to shoot them . Bluebottle flies cruised into the unscreened window with metallic whines . They plumped down on Augustus ' blankets with an abrupt stoppage of their drone that was like a tiny blow . Now and then Augustus poised his good hand and tried to catch one , but it always launched its note three semitones higher and vanished in a gleaming greenish streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke two patients were arguing in angry voices about which was the greater general , Joe Johnston or Beauregard . Finally Brewer spoke up and laid a claim for Forrest . It finally wound up in a quarrel and one of the patients climbed out of his bed and wanted to fight , but a doctor ordered him back in his cot . As a tag to this incident , Miss McClanahan came and sat down by Brewer 's cot and began talking to him in low tones . One of the other men had called Brewer a liar and the nurse was soothing him , telling him that the term liar could not be applied to a matter of opinion . Brewer said when a man called him a liar he took it as meant and did n't try to sneak out of it by the rules of grammar . Then Augustus could hear Miss McClanahan say soothingly , " A big strong man like you ough n't to pay any attention to . . . " For some reason Augustus grew acutely depressed and miserable ; for Miss McClanahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewer was not particularly strong or big , and was not the sort of person a woman like Miss McClanahan ought to talk to . Presently he could en/dure the conversation between them no longer and he called in an uncertain voice : " Miss McClanahan , my  --  my bandage is pulling . " A few moments later , when the nurse came to him and asked where the bandage was pulling , Augustus was in much confusion . He pointed out a place and then said rather breathlessly : " M-Miss Rose , if I was you I would n't fool my time away on Brewer . " Miss McClanahan considered this cryptically for a moment . " You do n't like him , do you ? " " It 's not that , " said Augustus , taking higher grounds . " Him telling you how big and stout he was . . . " " He did n't tell me that . " " Well you-all were talking about it , " complained Augustus . " I heard you . " " I think I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that . He ought to ' a ' told you better . Why , I licked him when I first joined the army . . . nearly . " The nurse tried to compose her face . " Your bandage did n't really hurt , did it ? " she asked . Augustus ' face reddened . " Naw , it 's all right , " and he looked away from her . The woman stood smiling faintly at him , revolving in her own thoughts whether to ignore the meaning of the boy 's unconscious attitude or to accept it on his own terms and make of his hospital days one of those sweet foolish extravaganzasof adolescence . She decided and said : " Listen , Augustus , after while when your back and arm are better we 'll go out and have tea in the garden at the back of the hospital . " " Tea ? " repeated Augustus , who had never heard of takingtea as tea in a garden or anywhere else . " And sandwiches , " included Miss McClanahan by wayp221of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or we might have gingerbread . " Augustus ' face lighted up . " I like gingerbread , " he admitted , and then he pondered mentioning pies . He really would like a green-apple pie , and there was something about Miss McClanahan that suggested she made excellent green-apple pies . From that time on the nurse was never entirely out of Augustus ' head . He fancied himself eating gingerbread , or pies , with her in the garden . The tea part had dropped out of the picture . He had no idea why one should choose a garden to eat a snack in . At home Augustus had always made his four o'clock tea on whatever he could find to hand while he moved out of the kitchen as discreetly and as inconspicuouslyas possible . At night the nurse haunted him most persistently . At night Augustus left behind him his wound and the hospital and went forth to war again and did mighty things for Miss McClanahan . He would start off his mental adventures by licking Brewer for insulting the nurse . Brewer never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy he did so and got licked for his pains . After this auspicious start Augustus fared on to other high emprises , such as founding great cattle ranches in Texas and finding gold mines in California , all for Miss McClanahan . Between the hours of 1 and 3 A.m . Miss McClanahan was indeed a great boon to Augustus , because between those hours , as regularly as the clock struck , the soldier 's arm began to ache . Then he lay and watched the stars move through the dark branches of the maples , and he clung to the thought of his nurse against the crescendo of pain . He thought of how beautiful she was , what he would say to her the next morning . He would tell her he loved her and ask her to be his wife . At three o'clock his arm eased off and he went to sleep . Then the next day , when Miss McClanahan really sat by his cot finishing Dr. Wright 's dressing , all he did was to look at her and talk of indifferent things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Okalona . But one night at three o'clock the arm did not ease into sleep . It continued an angry throbbing until morning . Ten o'clock brought nurse and surgeon to a nerve-racked boy . When the two came to the cot Dr. Wright produced a thermometer and stuck it in the patient 's mouth . Rose ejaculated with concern : " Augustus , did you sleep well last night ? " " All right , " said Augustus , who never admitted a frailty . " How does your arm feel ? " " All right . " However , his wound throbbed so that he turned faintly sick when Dr. Wright removed the bandages . A peculiar malodor penetrated Augustus ' nostrils . The surgeon looked at the arm and then at the patient with a sort of impersonal annoyance . " This arm has been exposed , " he said , and pressed the flesh until it sent streaks of pain deep into Augustus ' shoulder . Miss McClanahan ejaculated under her breath , " Oh , is n't that " and caught herself . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bandages loose . " Augustus clenched the rail of his cot , caught his breath and asked in a brief strained sentence , " What 's the matter with it ? " " Thagedwna gangrenosa , " said the surgeon , replacing the bandages . Dr. Wright got as much satisfaction out of the incomprehensible term as Napoleon from some military subtlety . Then he added , " I think I 'll go speak to Major Landry about this . You may come with me , Miss Mack . " Something in Dr. Wright 's manner penetrated even the boy 's suffering . " What you going to do ? " he asked apprehensively.  |p223To  this the young doctor made no reply whatever but walked out of the sick bay . As Miss McClanahan followed him she glanced back at her patient with her dark eyes wide and a look of anxiety on her face . The professional pleasure in Dr. Wright 's manner and the distress in Miss McClanahan 's face told Augustus what they were going to do . For a moment he lay perfectly still . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain ringing up and down his arm like a struck bell . . . . That was what they were going to do ! He knew that in a few minutes Dr. Wright and Dr. Landry and the orderlies and Miss McClanahan would be back for him , and then , no matter what he said , no matter how he begged . . . Two cots from him lay Brewer . Augustus eased over , put his chilly legs out in the aisle . Then , with a flame licking out from his arm into his neck and side , he inched himself up to a sitting posture . The soiled white walls of the hospital seemed to sway . He got to his feet , and bending over , holding to the edge of the cots , he crept along the aisle toward Brewer . The intervening man drawled in amazement : " For Gawd 's sake , what are you doin ' ? " At the second cot Augustus shook Brewer 's shoulder . " Brewer ! Brewer ! " he quavered . The trooper awoke with a start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewer , they 're going to cut my arm off ! " said the boy in a ghastly whisper . Brewer lay staring at Augustus out of slate-colored eyes . " By God , they 'll hall to hold their noses when they do it . " " But I wo n't have it ! God damn it ! I do n't want my armoff ! " " I 'm glad you told me that , " said Brewer , " I thought you did . " " Damn it , Brewer , " gasped Augustus , about to faint , " I want a knife  --  a pistol  --  something . I tell you they 're goin ' to cut my arm off ! " Brewer lay blinking at his comrade as if trying to think what the word " pistol " meant . Finally he said : " My clo'es are under the cot , " and turned his back on Augustus and seemed instantly to go to sleep . Augustus got down , fumbled through the clothes with his good hand , then crawled on his all-fours back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the revolver under his blanket almost eased the beating in the patient 's arm . He lay watchingthe door and panting as if after some enormous exertion . Presently he saw the two doctors , two orderlies , and Miss McClanahan coming up his aisle . Augustus wriggled his head further up on the pillow to talk . " Listen , " he said to the five with a quavering certainty in his voice , " you 're not going to cut my arm off . " All of them came to an involuntary pause except Dr. Wright . Major Landry , the head surgeon , began in a conciliatorytone : " We may not need to take your arm off , Son . " Dr. Wright was coming up to the cot when the boy lifted the blue cavalry pistol . " Take another step , Doc , an ' I 'll shoot you ! " Miss McClanahan cried , " Augustus ! " Even the immutable lieutenant paused . " Where did you get that revolver ? " he asked in a peremptorytone . The major repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your arm off , Augustus . " " Yes it is , " chattered Augustus , " and you ca n't do it . . . . I wo n't be one armed ! I wo n't go around one armed ! " " If we decide to , it will be purely for your good , Son , " argued the major . " Rather be dead than one armed ! " cried Augustus . " Look here , Vaiden , " condescended Wright , " there isp225necrotic tissue in your wound . It will create a toxic condi-tion . " " He means you 've got proud flesh and it 'll poison you unlesswe take that out , " explained the major . " I do n't want my arm cut off  --  I do n't want --  " " All right ! " cried the major at last . " We wo n't cut it off . Let us take you to the operating room . " " You wo n't cut it off ? " " No , we wo n't cut it off  --  put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the least confidencewas the nurse . " Miss Rose , " he quavered through fear-dry lips , " if I put down my gun you wo n't let ' em , will you ? " " They wo n't cut off your arm unless you consent , Augustus . " He dropped the great weight of the pistol and reached for her . The orderlies and the doctors concentrated quickly around him . In the operating room Augustus was at times conscious of nothing except the stream of agony from his fly-bitten arm . Between spasms he dimly realized he was clutching Miss McClanahan 's waist , her hips , her arms as he writhed and dripped with sweat . . . . The Confederate hospital at Lauderdale Springs had no anesthetics.  | CONVALESCENCE flooded Augustus with its voluptuous weakness , of which , naturally , he was ashamed . Miss McClanahanwas with him very often even during her rest periods . When he could walk they did go out into what she called the garden ; but there was not a vegetable in it , just flowers and bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him within herself but appeared thinking , pondering . He would surpriseher gazing fixedly at him with her dark eyes , and if he asked her of what she was thinking , she would say : " Of nothing at all . . . . You 'll be discharged before long , Augustus . " To Augustus the phrase " before long " sounded millenniumsdistant . Life had ceased to be anything but a loiteringamong flower beds with Miss McClanahan . His discharge held the insubstantiality of the fancy of winter in the summer time . The convalescent neither thought of nor wished anything more than to sit in a chair near Miss McClanahan . She would put off her nurse 's cap and her dark hair would glint in the sunshine . That was quite enough for him in his lassitude . Once she asked , " Why do you look at me all the time , Augustus ? " " Mainly to see you , " he said , making his adolescent jest . " Ca n't you remember how I look ? " she asked with a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Augustus , dropping his rustic smartness , " somehow you sort of surprise me like I 'd never seen you before . Your eyes surprise me . Your hair is done up in shining black ropes . " " What are you going to do when you get out of the hospital ? " " Go back to the army , I suppose . " " You ca n't , you are n't strong enough . " " Shoo ! I can fight , " bragged Augustus dreamily . The mere weak look of Augustus somehow hurt something in Miss McClanahan 's chest . " If they do n't take you in the army what will you do ? " she inquired . " I  --  do n't know . " " Go back to your home ? " " No-o , " he decided slowly , " I would n't go home . " The woman studied him . " What is your home like , Augustus ? " she asked in a softened voice . Augustus inhaled a long breath . " We-ell . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , have n't you any brothers and sisters ? " " Oh , yes , lots of ' em . But take Cassandra . She tells you what to do . And Marcia , if she 's not trying to get something out of you she 's not thinking about you at all . And Miltiades , he 's always studying about getting rich and what a grand man he is. , , " Is he very grand ? " smiled Miss McClanahan . " I . . . guess he is , " Augustus admitted rather unwillingly . " And who else ? " " Polycarp . Me and him started for the army and he walked two miles out of the way to see his girl . " Miss McClanahan sat under some roses . She broke one off . " I think I like Polycarp next to you , Augustus . " " Polycarp gets nearly everything . He 's Mammy 's pet . "  | His life at home seemed something quite gone ; a kind of cramped existence which he would never take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long a conversation with anyone as this tete-a-tete he was having with Miss McClanahan . He had never before found anything to talk about because up to this moment nobody had ever been willing to talk about him . On the third day after tea in the garden the blow descendedupon Augustus quite suddenly . The orderly came up the aisle with fresh linen in his arms and told him quite casually that they wanted to see him in the office . And that he might take his things . When Augustus lay in bed his things consisted of his hat and shoes , when he sat up his things was his hat . When he walked outside he had no things . Now he sat up , put on his shoes , took his hat in his hand , and went down the aisle toward the office . As he moved away the orderly began stripping the cot , throwing the used sheets and pillow slips on the floor . And Augustus knew that he was leaving the hospital . He felt a little queer , really walking down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows he saw a numberof ambulances had arrived . The orderlies were hurrying to make room for new casualties . In the office a group of men were being discharged from the hospital . A clerk was busy asking questions and filling out papers . He asked their name , company , and regiment . Augustus waited on a bench in a queue of men . The men on the bench were talking about where the new arrivals had come from . They were some of Pat Cleburn 's men . General Pat lost men but he gained victories  --  he ought to have been in control of the defenses of Vicksburg and Corinth . Augustus asked if the speaker were not an Arkansas man . He was . At this point Augustus heard his name called . He got upp229and walked slowly to the desk . He answered the questions saying : " Augustus Vaiden , Company K , Seventh Tennessee Cavalry , a private . " The clerk handed Augustus a paper . " You enlisted in Savannah , Tennessee , " said the clerk . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can catch a ride . " " Oh , I 'm to go back to Savannah , " said Augustus . " Not unless you want to , " said the clerk . " Well , I do n't want to . " " That 's with you , " said the clerk , and he called another name . Augustus turned away from the desk with a queer lost feeling . He did n't belong to the hospital any more . He did n't even belong to the army any more . He was in Okalona , Mississippi , about which he knew nothing at all . He moved toward the reception-room door and out into the sunshine , paused there , looking about aimlessly on weak legs . If he had felt strong it would n't have been so bad , but he wanted to sit down at that very moment . He thought of going and sitting in one of the empty ambulance wagons . But he really had to start in some direction . In order not to be without any guidance at all he spat several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with his forefinger and watched the direction it splashed . Earlier in life he had found strayed cows by this method of divinationand it might work in pointing out the best general direction in starting one 's life . It splashed more or less in the direction he had meant it to . He started walking weakly in this direction . He had gone perhaps fifty yards when he heard steps running behind him and a voice in distress : " Augustus ! Augustus ! " The boy stopped , turned about slowly , and was amazed to see Miss McClanahan . He stood looking at her curiously.  | " You  --  you 're discharged ? " she panted . " Y-yes , " nodded Augustus . " Well  --  come on into the garden . Let 's talk it over . You ca n't just walk off like that  --  without any plans at all . " " Well , I . . . " He started to tell her about thumping spittle in his hand to get a point of departure , but let it go . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the garden . As he entered the enclosure the colored light of flowers poured upon him , and a seat under the rose arbor invited them , and Augustus had the relaxed feeling of reaching home after a desolate journey . The two sat down together . " There 's a lot of new casualties come in , " explained Miss McClanahan in a distressed voice . " They had to make room for them . " " I understood that , " said Augustus . Her fingers still on his wrist were cold . " Were you going to leave without  --  without saying goodbye ? " She glanced at him with a kind of sad smile . " I did n't know what to do , " said Augustus with a queer dizzy feeling . " When I went into your ward and saw your cot made up , " said Miss McClanahan in her shaken tone , " I  --  I did n't know what to do either . I did n't even know how long you had gone or where . " Her voice still held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come out a little later I 'd been gone , " said Augustus , " and I sure do n't know where . " She squeezed his hand tightly . " Just suppose I had ! " Augustus had a feeling not that he had barely escaped tragedy but that he had barely escaped vacuity . It was just a chance that the warmth and reality of Miss McClanahan had held him back , momentarily , from wandering into nothingness . Of course , in ten or fifteen minutes , or half an hour , he would get up and go away.  | " Now  --  now we 've got to make some plans  --  where you 'll go ? " said the nurse . " Well I  --  I sort of had a plan , " said Augustus vaguely . " Oh , you did , " she said in a somewhat dampened tone . " Yes . I  --  uh  --  you know  --  popped some spit in my hand and it went over in that direction . " Augustus looked about , got his orientation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again , Miss McClanahan was crying . She said : " Oh ! " and took her hands from his and placed them determinedly in her own lap . " Listen , " said the woman . " I  --  I do n't know whether to or not  --  but when you clung to me so , Augustus  --  you know  --  when the doctors cleaned your wound  --  you remem-ber " " Y-yes , I remember , " said the boy , with her excitement somehow entering his body . " Well , ever since then . . . " She hesitated , then went on unsteadily , " I do n't know . . . when I saw your cot made up , Augustus , I thought I would faint  --  it was like my heart had suddenly  --  been torn out . " " The cot  --  my cot ? " " Yes , your cot . " Miss McClanahan was weeping . " If  --  if you had n't held to me like you did , I could have stood it ; but now . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand to see which way to go . . . " Miss McClanahan sobbed outright . She reached her arms for Augustus , guarding his wounded arm , and the boy found himself amazingly kissing the lips as he had imagined incessantly in his night-long vigils . " We can either marry , or you can just stay at my father 's home as long as you want to . I want you to be happy , Augustus . " Augustus came out of the bewilderment of her softness and perfume to plan on an inspiration : " I tell you . . . Brewer was discharged , too . Let 's find him and have him stand up with us for best man . "  | FROM ALL THE countryside around BeShears Crossroads the men were gone . Only the women were left , the negro slaves , an occasional boy , and a few oracular graybeards making phophecies that grew more and more uncertain as to the probable duration of the war . The war itself was a kind of swelling rumor that seemed to be moving closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , seemed to be moving farther and farther away . Those distant soldiers acquired something of a legendary character . Youths from the Crossroads neighborhood whom Marcia Vaiden had known and overlooked in their ordinary state were now soldiers , and took on the dignity and importanceof the cause for which they fought . Lieutenant A. Gray naturally shared this romantic enhancementin Marcia Vaiden 's thoughts . He had , in fact , ridden away with a tacit understanding of marriage with Marcia on his return . Marcia had been washed into her secondengagement to A. Gray on the surf of the war . The impact of hostilities had brushed away those nameless perceptionswhich had separated Marcia from the young officer . On the day A. Gray actually marched away Marcia would have married him point blank out of an overflowing heart . His uniform fitted beautifully . Another to whom his general enhancement would have spread was Major Crowninshield , except for a puritanicalp233strain in the girl 's thoughts which would not permit even an unacknowledged glamour toward a married man whom once she had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miltiades . He fitted perfectly with the heroes of the fiction she read . He had flung away his position to serve his country , he had been betrayed by a supposed friend , deceived by his sweetheart . It never occurred to Marcia that the betraying sweetheart and false friend might have had their own inward compulsions . Naturally , Polycarp and Augustus and such emotional small fry obtained no such hero worship from their sister . The manner in which they had gone to war precluded that . Nor did the boys have their hearts broken , which was a prerequisitefor Marcia 's heroes . Of course there was Polycarp'sescapade with Ponny BeShears , but that was merely absurd . Augustus touched the nadir of the romantic . Extraordinaryrumors were afloat about Augustus . Tales were in circulationthat Augustus had gone up into Tennessee and enlistedin the Yankee army , that he had been in a skirmish against a small Confederate force . Marcia got the first inklingof this news from Eliza Ham under the usual irrational promise of secrecy such as obtains among girls . Marcie deniedthe charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ham plantation she asked Gracie about it . She knew that the negroes would have more details about any rumor in the neighborhood than would any white person . ' 1'liese details might be a bit distorted , but there would be more of them . Gracie looked at Marcia with a doubtful face . " You really want me to tell you , little missy ? " " Of course I do ! " cried Marcia , wondering what in the world Gracie had to tell . " Well . . . they say he  --  he went up into Tennessee and . . . joined up with a band of Yankee horse thieves . "  |p234Marcia  stood staring at Gracie with the strength gone out of her . " Why , that is n't so , " she said out of white lips . " No 'm , no 'm , " echoed Gracie earnestly , " that sho ' ai n't so , little missy . I told them it was n't so . You asked me what they said . " But back of her denials Marcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hare brained . . . she had never known what Augustus thought about anything except when he was angry . Now , for him to run away from home and become a Yankee horse thief . . . She said , " That 's all , Gracie . . . that 's the meanest tale . . . " She caught her breath and held it like a lump compressedagainst the base of her throat to keep from crying . Gracie turned and went up to her eternal spinning in theattic . Marcia went to the door of the living room on legs that felt weak . Miss Cassandra looked up at her and then got to her feet . " What 's the matter , Marcia ? " she asked anxiously . " Sister Cassandra , I went to see Eliza Ham . She askedabout Augustus . The way she asked I knew she had heardsomething about him . And then she said . . . " " What ? " cried the older sister , staring at the girl 's white face . " Augustus is fighting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then broke into a contemptuous laugh . " And you believed it ? " " Why , no , I did n't , " said Marcia blankly . " I told ' em I did n't believe it . " " Yes , you told ' em that , but you did believe it  --  that a Vaiden would fight against his country . Tchk ! You 're such a fool , Marcia ! " " Gracie knew about it , too , " said Marcia , now beginningp235to uphold the idea of Augustus ' treason since he had a defender . " Oh , Gracie . . . Had n't you noticed something about Gracie ? " " Why , no , " said Marcia . " What is there to notice ? " " I think she is about to become a mother , " said Miss Cassandradisapprovingly . " Well , what of that ? She 's married . " " Oh , I 'm not talking about the baby . I mean she 's nervous and flighty . What she says does n't amount to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , I did . " " And I 'm sure she told you something different from what Eliza Ham told . " " That 's right . " " There you are . Never pay any attention to nigger gossip ; it 's merely a corruption of white gossip , and the white is bad enough , goodness knows . " Although white gossip was discountenanced and nigger gossip was set aside unconditionally by Miss Cassandra , still the tale lingered in the minds of the Vaiden family . When old man Jimmie Vaiden got wind of it he declared he would give that stinking yellow nigger gal a beating and make her take it back . But Marcia stopped this by declaring that she had to drag the story out of Gracie , and Cassandra pointed out sardonically that if one beat his niggers for tale bearing none would be left alive . The old war horse had to content himself with wagging his head and grumbling out , " Anyway , she needs a good beating . You-all are ruinin ' Gracie , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura 's mind , and one morning the old lady told Marcia in the kitchen that the tales about Augustus were going to be cleared up that day . " How will they be ? " asked the girl curiously . " We 're going to get a letter from Augustus , " stated the old woman with the utmost simplicity , " and I imagine it will clear up the tales they 're telling . " " Mammy , how do you know we 'll get a letter ? " inquired the daughter curiously . " I 'm just sure there 's a letter in the office from Augus-tus . " " But that 's what I 'm trying to get at  --  how do you feel ? " " Why , you do n't feel at all . I just know there 's one there and that 's all there is to it . " The two had been lifting their voices somewhat during this conversation , and now from the living room old man Jimmie thundered : " Marsh , do n't pay no attention to your mammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might jest as well have married a cotton-fiel ' hand . . . presentiment about a letter ! There ai n't no such thing as a presentiment , and if there was it would n't be about a letter ! " The two women in the kitchen fell into complete silence . Marcia pointed to her chest to ask if her mother knew it emotionally . The old woman pointed to her head to show that it was a purely mental operation . And this was one of the reasons old man Jimmie became so furious over these matters . No matter how much or how well he reasoned , these irrational beliefs simply sunk below the surface and flowed smoothly on . The old man got up from his chair in the living room and went out to the lot because he could feel the two women looking at each other and motioning about the letter , when any idiot would know there was no way of obtaining information on any point whatsoever , except by a matter-of-fact seeing and hearing and touching . Some time later that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten his irritation , Mrs. Laura suggested that her husband ride down to the Crossroadsand buy a spool of No. 60 white , " and , " she added casually , " you might ask if we 've got any mail . "  | " Are you in any grand rush about the thread , Lorry ? " inquired the old man craftily . Well , in no particular hurry . . . she was out of 60 . The old man narrowed his eyes and nodded sardonically to himself . " Send me riding two and a half miles because she 's got a feeling she 's got a letter at the Crossroads . She ai n't a-goin ' to do it ! I 'll be dad blamed if I 'll go traipsing around over the country follerin ' a cotton-field superstition ! " So he told her he would get the thread the next time he went to the store . Nevertheless a restlessness began to invade old man Jimmie'sbones . At odd moments he would find himself thinking intently what it was that he had to get at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would remember it was a spool of 60 white . So a few minutes before twelve o'clock , just at a time when he knew they did not want him to go , he stalked out to the gate , heaved himself on old Joe , and set off for the Crossroads . Old man Jimmie Vaiden liked to ride alone . He enjoyed old Joe 's sleepy singlefooting , the blue horizon , the red hills , and the yellow sedge . He abhorred company on such rides until company caught up with him and began gossiping . Then he would not have had the fellow ride on and leave him for anything . This time it was Sheriff Bill Dalrymple . The sheriff was a leathery man who wore a holster and bore a sort of provisionalgood will to the world at large which could be revokedwithout notice for good cause . Now he rode up beside old man Jimmie and stated with some passion that he be God damned if he believed the SouthernConfederacy should be held responsible for a passel of Yankee boss thieves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Jimmiep238with the sharp pleasure of a countryman in the villainies of the neighborhood . " Well , a gang of damned Union guerillas stole old man Candy McPherson 's hoss last night and run off up into Tennessee . Now in dealin ' with this there 's a number of things to be tuk into consideration . " " Which one of his horses ? " " That of stump-suckin ' claybank . " " Why n't they take his saddlin ' filly ? " " He was off fox huntin ' on her . But Candy says it 's a matter of principle with him . He swears he 's jest as mad as if they 'd got a boss that was some ' count . " " Well , Candy 's swearin' ' a lie , " stated old man Jimmie flatly . " He 's human even if he is a Campbellite . " Old man Jimmie hated the Campbellites bitterly because they believed so nearly the same thing he did there was no chance of downing one of them in an argument . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but if they ralely had tuk his saddlin ' filly he 'd be surprised how much deeper down in hell he 'd wish they 'd sink . " " I agree with you there , " conceded old man Jimmie . " It may be a error of the head and not of the heart . Candy 's heart ai n't much , but his Maker knows it 's a lot better'n his head . . . . What time o ' day did his claybank git stole ? " " Do n't know exactly . Some time before Candy got back 1 from his fox chase . " " He did n't see nobody ? " " No . " " What makes him think it was Union men ? They do n't usually work at night . " " Well I . . . " The sheriff paused , looked intently at his companion for a moment . " Do you know it was n't any Union men ? " he asked oddly . " Why , no , " said the ex-blacksmith blankly , " why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied the officer vaguely . " It 's my duty to make inquiries . " This slight quirk upset the rambling conversation that usually enlivened the ride along the road . Old man Jimmie felt constrained to shake his head once or twice and repeat that he did n't know a thing in the world about it . Thus they came to the Crossroads where Sheriff Dalrymple left him . Old man Jimmie Vaiden dismounted and climbed the high platform in front of the store with a good deal of effort . The sun was hot and he mopped his face as he stepped into the dark multi-scented house . " Alex , " he called loudly , seeing nothing in the gloom beyond the dim outline of barrels and coffee sacks , " wrap me up a spool of No. 60 . " As the noise created by the old man subsided , he heard someone say in a low tone , " There 's old man Jimmie now , " and nothing more was said . Mr. Alex BeShears bestirred himself somewhere in the depths of his cavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I be dad blamed , " boomed the old man in frustration , " I do n't any more know whether my of woman wants white or black . " He stood considering what he should do . " What 's it wuth , Alex ? " " Five cents cash , ten cents credit . " " Well , by the gray goats I 'm goin ' to take one o ' both , Alex . After all 's said and done , a man ai n't got but one wife and he might as well treat her right . She can use the one she wants and lay the other'n by . " " Oh  --  er  --  Mr. Vaiden , would you step back here a moment ? " invited the storekeeper . The old man walked back into complete darkness in silence . Talk started up at the front end once more . Some of the customers with finer feelings were faintly shushed by others who wanted to hear what the merchant said to the old man . I lowever , the talker went on : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand five hun'erd and eighty-nine men at Fort Donelson . Our boys simply butchered ' em . " " Yeh , but they fin'ly tuk the fort . " " Yeh , but Gosh , man , he 's bleedin ' the Nawth white . " " The papers said it was a Pyrrhic victory , " put in anothervoice . " What 's a Pyrrhic victory ? " " That 's one where you get the hot end of the poker after all . " In the back end of the store Mr. BeShears was inquiring whether Mr. Vaiden wanted the thread cash or credit . Disregardingthe difference in price , old man Jimmie chose credit . The storekeeper then explained with morose courtesy that times were uncertain and he had adopted a cash-payment plan . Old man Jimmie was instantly angry . " You mean my credit ai n't good for two spools of cotton thread ! " " Thread nothin ' ! " snapped BeShears in irritation . " I 'm tellin ' you this for future tradin ' . Undoubtedly you got a dime in yore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't spend a dime with a derned of skinflint who 'd sell off his house niggers when his country was goin ' to war about that very thing . " " I can buy ' em back to-day for a third what I sold ' em for , " snapped BeShears with an edge to his drawl . " Yes , and you may buy ' em back to-morr ' for half what you can to-day ! " roared old man Jimmie . " But by the gray goats I say you 're robbin ' me and ever ' other patriotic slave holder in Alabama when you done it . " " ' Y God , " flared the merchant , " I 'd a lot ruther sell myniggers than to go over to the Yankee lock , stock , an ' bar'l ! " " What ! What ! " shouted the old man , beside himself atp241this thrust . " What in the thunderation do you mean , Alex BeShears . . . goin ' over to the Yankees ? " " I mean your dad-blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that 's who I mean . He 's stealin ' with the " Old man Vaiden made a flail-like blow in the direction of the voice . He struck nothing . BeShears wheezed out : " By God , you damned VaidensThe loungers leaped from counters and barrels . " Alex ! " " Mr. Vaiden ! " " Do n't hit him with that cleaver , Alex ! " " Let him come ! Let the damned traitor come ! " roared old man Jimmie . " I 'll pestle his pants tull his tongue lolls out ! " But the loungers did not permit such a one-sided fight . They got between the two and began their soothing : " Now , Mr. Vaiden , after all this is Alex 's store . What he done may not be patriotic but it was legal . " " Thunderation ! A man can be the worst neighbor in the world and still be legal  --  the legaler a man gets , the worse he is ! " " Yes , but I would n't give him Hail Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians ? " demanded the ex-blacksmith angrily . " We hope we are , " said one of the men who was easing the old fire eater out onto the platform . " Well , do n't you know the Bible says to reprove , admonish , and take counsel with your neighbor ? " " Was that what you was tryin ' to do ? " " Hell far , of course it was . . . an ' you boys draggin ' inc out ! " However , before he went out of the door he turned and ordered within his unquestioned rights : " Alex BeShears , my wife Lorry 's got a letter in your stinkin ' Yankee post office , and by the gray goats you 've got to hand her out ! "  | The storekeeper went to a little square of nine pigeonholesand handed out the letter . Old man Jimmie received it with satisfaction . He looked at the postmark and suddenly exclaimed : " Look where this come from  --  Corinth , Mississippi . My of woman said it was from Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tarnation could he be in this country and writin ' letters from Mississip ' ? "  |p243WHEN  OLD MAN JIMMIE returned from the post office , he found even some of the negroes on the place waiting around the entrance of the big hall to see what Augustus said in his letter . When of Pap came riding up with the letter old Mrs. Laura made no comment on the fact that her presentiment had come true . In fact she never thought of it as a moral victory over her husband . These victories over the old exblacksmith'sunbending logic occurred with such regularity that they had ceased to attract any attention at all . The letter itself was addressed in a lamentable handwriting . It 's ink was washed out and brownish colored of a sort that can not be purchased in any store , but of which every well-regulated Southern family possesses about a fourth of a bottle . The letter was handed to Marcia to read because Miss Cassandra read a personal letter in such a detached fashion it did not seem to be from anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom it was addressed , did not read it because in her youth her father had not considered that the art of reading pertained to girls . " It 's from Augustus , sure enough , " said Marcia . " Den he 's boun ' to be alive , " opined Aunt Creasy . Marcia tore open the letter with the greatest curiosity , ran her eyes down the page , then paused , her mouth droppedopen , she looked at the family in utter blankness.  | " What 's the matter ? " " What is it ? " cried a chorus . " Why . . . he 's married ! " gasped Marcia . " Not married . . . at his age ! " cried Miss Cassandra , because , according to Miss Cassandra , no Vaiden ever becameold enough to marry , much less Augustus . " Pappy ! " ejaculated Mrs. Laura in dismay . " Imagine . . . our baby , married ! " The old woman 's eyes filled with mist at the untimely complicationand responsibility that had befallen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmie philosophically , " it don'tmake no diff'runce whether a man marries early or late , he always feels like he 's been married forever anyway . " " Read the rest of the letter , Marcia , " advised Cassandra . Marcia did so . It ran : " DEAR MOTHER , I joined the army at Savannah . I came to Mississippi . I got wounded but not bad in the Battle of Okalona . I went to a hospital at Lauderdale Springs . I married Miss Rose McClanahan who nursed me . We have moved to Corinth . Your very respectful son , AUGUSTUS VAIDEN . " " A nurse ! " snapped Miss Cassandra . " I wonder what sort of family she came from ? " " He does n't say , " said Marcia , looking at the simple letteragain . " She must be a fine patriotic girl , " hazarded old Mrs. Vaiden , " to be nursing the wounded soldiers . " " I 'll venture , " said Miss Cassandra , " she could n't get married around her home and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weak . " Old man Jimmie stood by with a worried look on his face . " Which army do you reckon she followed him to ? " Everybody was amazed at this question . " Why , the Confederate army , of course ! " " He do n't say so , " observed the old planter gloomily.  | " Why , Jeems , it 's bound to be the Confederate army . Do n't he say he was in the Battle of Okalona ? " " Do n't be a fool , Lorry ! D'reckon the Confederates got out an ' fought that battle all by theirselves ? Bound to ' a ' been some Yankees thar ! " " Well . . . I s'pose they was , " agreed the old woman at this wider view . " What are you asking for ? " inquired Miss Cassandra with a touch of uneasiness . " Why , by the gray goats , " flung out the old man roundly , " I come purty near havin ' a fight with Alex BeShears down at the Crossroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How in the world did that rumor ever get out on Augustus ? " cried Marcia . " It 's so ridiculous  --  nobody would believe it for a minute . " " Why could n't he say in his letter which side he was a-fighting on ! " boomed old man Jimmie , quite out of patiencewith Augustus . " Now , Pappy , " put in old Mrs. Laura , " ai n't you glad you did n't whip Gracie for telling a lie when she did n't tell one ? " This was news to Gracie , that she had ever been in dangerof a flogging , and she looked at her master and mistress with widening eyes . " She may not ' a ' lied , " brushed away old man Jimmie , " but you kai n't give a nigger a lick they do n't deserve . " Gracie stood silent at this . Marcia cast her a glance of passing sympathy . In her heart Marcia excluded Gracie from her father 's blanket condemnation , but all other negroes , the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . This diversion about the advisability of whipping negroes removed Augustus ' marriage a little out of their minds . Old Mrs. Vaiden said : " I did n't know they were fighting down in Mississippi ? "  | " Yes , in Mississippi and Arkansas , too . " " Goodness gracious ! " exclaimed the mother . " That sounds like the fighting is coming South . I had an idyah the battles would be more and more toward the North . " " De Battle o ' Molasses was two 'd de Nawth , " mumbled old Aunt Creasy . " Manassas , Creasy , " corrected Miss Cassandra . " You alwayscall it the Battle of Molasses . " " Dat niggah Lump Mowbray come ovah heah an ' sta't me off wrong , " complained the gargoyle . " What diff'runce does it make what she calls it ? " said the old planter . " Let her call it Sorg'um if she wants to . . . . By the way , Lorry , I did n't get the spool of 60 you ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you wanted it white or black ? . . . but anyway I would n't have bought it from Alex BeShears . I 'm through with him after his insults about Augustus . " The old wife was disturbed . " Where you going to trade ? " " Florence , of course . " " Ride sixteen miles after a spool of thread ? " " When I first built this house here there was n't any Crossroads ! " snapped the old man . " We got along then just as good as we do now . No , if Alex BeShears thinks I 'm beholdento him , he 's wrong . I 'm through with him . " " Jeems , you 're always bitin ' off your nose to spite your face , " disparaged the old wife mildly . " No man can talk about a son of mine like he did an ' hol ' my trade . He 's lost it . I 'm through with him ! " If old man Jimmie was really through with the Crossroads storekeeper , the planter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting in with him . About two days after the near fight in the store , Sheriff Bill Dalrymple came riding up the rutty public road and stopped at the Vaiden gate . Old man Jimmie came out of his open hallway , calling in ap247loud voice for Dalrymple to alight and rest his saddle . The sheriff alighted but did not rest his saddle . He stood with his hand lying loosely on it . Neither was his reply delivered in the same hearty tone of the planter . He asked if he could see the old man a minute . " Why , shore , " cried the ex-blacksmith , a little at sea . " Come right on in . " No , the sheriff would n't do that . He had just a minute to stay . He was riding up the road . Candy McPherson had located his claybank up near the state line and he was going up to reclaim him as stolen property . So old man Jimmie walked out , rather wondering at the sheriff 's haste . " Well , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . Dalrymple reached in his saddle pockets and drew out a great bundle of yellow paper with red and blue lines on it . The sheets were covered on both sides with an endless string of items whose price bore a monotonous repetition in the figure column of ten cents , fifteen cents , five cents , twenty cents . . . page after page . At the end of each column the total was added up and carried over to the next page . It was an itemized account of the purchases of the Vaiden family for a period of more than a quarter of a century . Not once during all that time had the Vaiden account at the Crossroads store been balanced , although at intervals it had approached a balance . The mere meagerness of the list of a lifetime 's purchases was as pathetic in its way as the bare yard and heavy log house where that lifetime had been spent . " We-ell , " said the old man in an odd voice that somehow suddenly had lost its boom and violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's Alex BeShears ' account , " explained the officer in a dry , impersonal tone . " How much does it come to ? " asked the old man . " Well , three hundred an ' forty-six dollars an ' thirty-fivep248cents . He put it in my han 's an ' gim me instructions to elect . " Old man Jimmie also put a hand on the sheriff 's saddle because his legs felt suddenly weak . " That 's what comes o ' truckin ' with a low-down snake , " he said in a shaking tone ; " pretend to be yore friend fer twenty-seven year , then when you begin to trust him a inch , turns an ' bites you in the back like a snake in the grass . " The officer said nothing but behind his somber silence old man Jimmie felt sympathy and a tacit agreement that the presentation of this account was a shameful and iniquitous breach of trust . " Well , " said Dalrymple at last , " what are you goin ' to do about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man , taking a long breath , " I  --  I hope you 'll  --  er  --  give me a little time on this account . I  --  I ca n't lay my hand on the whole amount right this minute . " " BeShears ' instructions was to elect , " repeated the sheriff . " I 'm good for ten times that amount , " said the old man . " I know you air , Mr. Vaiden , " said the officer grayly , " an ' so does Alex BeShears . I 'd jest as soon have this accounton you as the Bank of England . It 's nothin ' in the worl ' but spite work on the part of Alex BeShears  --  haulin ' you up an ' wantin ' his account paid off all of a sudden like this  --  nothin ' in the worl ' but spite work ; but it 's legal . " Old man Jimmie stood batting his eyes at the formidable bundle . " Well , " he said finally , " leave it here with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' see if that stinkin ' skunk has put anything in here that we did n't git . "  | GGOING over the twenty-seven years of accounts was not a gainful task . The storekeeper , from the very first sale , had set down opposite each entry the name of the person who made the purchase . It would be one package of pins per Cassandra ; half pound of soda per Lycurgus ; buckles for shoes per Miltiades ; one barlow knife , per Sylvester . As the auditing proceeded , all of Mrs. Laura 's first set of six children came crowding around her again , holding to her skirts , begging her for this and that , desiring once more their outlived and long-forgotten needs and petty extravagancesthrough the pages of an old account . Most of the things neither the old man nor the old woman could remember at all , but some they could . The barlow knife Sylvester had wanted to skin rabbits  --  that had cost twenty-five cents . Hair ribbons for her little girl Vivian , who had died of the measles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassandra , but she had remained in their hearts with clear blue eyes and flaxen hair , unchanged by the saddening changes of time . So , instead of something to deny , the old account became something the two old persons sat long over trying to remember . It spread before them not a merchant 's account but the strange insensible mutations of life which move so slowly that all things seem permanent , unchangeable , and of immenseimportance , until some day its shifting , casual , and unplanned flow is suddenly and disturbingly reduced to human comprehension in a history or a package of old lettersor a storekeeper 's account . The upshot of all their inspection was that , while there was much neither old man Jimmie nor Mrs. Laura could remember , there was nothing they could deny , and most likely the whole long scroll was exact within a sixpence . At the justice trial preliminary to obtaining a judgment and execution , the account was admitted as far as the Vaidensknew . So in due time Sheriff Dalrymple came around and tacked up two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the county court clerk . It gave notice to all men that at the door of the courthousein Florence , Alabama , the following personal propertybelonging to James Vaiden , Esq. , living and residing in the third civil district of Lauderdale County , would be cried for sale to the highest bidder , viz. : Three negro men called Columbus , Robinet , and George ; two negro women , one black called Creasy , one light yellow called Gracie ; two mules , one blind in the left eye called Lou , a horse mule called Rab ; one milk cow called Sook ; also sundryplows , guns , fox hounds , chickens , a set of blacksmith tools , an anvil ; corn , hay , two bedsteads . These articles to be auctioned off both separately and in the lump . All persons take notice . Oddly enough , it was not the owners of this property who were most utterly dismayed at the impending sale , but one of the chattels themselves . The one described in the circular for the benefit of prospective buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house servant . She had never worked in the fields . She did not even sleep in the negro quarters but in a walled-off middle attic over the open hallway of the big house . Her bedroom was quite dark all the twenty-four hours but in the daytime fine razor edges of sunshine sliced between the dark clapboards over her bed , and there was a door between her cell and Marcia 's room . In the afternoon ,  |p251when  the sun was shining straight into Marcia 's small high window , Gracie could see through her open door a sort of ghost of day . The fact that she had never worked , slept , or eaten outside the big house was not so much a point of pride with Gracie as it was a condition of her existence . With a negro 's assimilative power she had absorbed the big house . She had a touch of Miss Cassandra ; she exaggerated old Mrs. Vaiden 's feeling of mysticism ; she had molded herself almost into a reproduction of Marcia , whom she loved and admired with the fanatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her white mistress . In the past there had come moments in Gracie 's life when she had envisioned the possibility of being sold out of the Vaiden family . But also she had thought of the day when she was going to die . The one was as terrible as the other . Gracie could read . In fact she could read perfectly . It was impossible for any girl to grow up under Miss Cassandraand not learn to read . The white bluestocking had carried on quite an elaborate self-deception in teaching Gracie to read . To begin with , it was against the laws of her country to teach a slave to read . But for the strictures of code and ermine no Vaiden , either man or woman , ever had the smallest regard . As Southerners , the Vaidens believed in states ' rights ; as Alabamians , they believed in individual determinism on all legal and moral questions ; as Primitive Baptists , they believedthey were supernaturally foreordained from before the laying of the foundations of the earth to do as they damned pleased on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious . Therefore one day Miss Cassandra had said to her mother , " I have decided to teach Gracie to read . " " It 's against the law , " said Mrs. Laura Vaiden , who was not so old then , nor was she born a Vaiden . " I 'm going to teach her to read because I think it will be convenient for her to know how , " stated Miss Cassandra.  | " The law certainly was not intended to put anyone to any inconvenience . " Mrs. Laura was not sure that laws could be repealed so casually , but she had no argument so she called in Cassandra'sfather , who could be relied upon to have arguments . Jimmie Vaiden , he was not old man Jimmie then , went to Cassandra and stormed and thundered that , besides being against the law , there was no sense in teaching a nigger to read . " The law is jest good sense , " he said . No woman white or black should be taught to read . That ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she could n't read , and what a paragon of a woman she was ! Then Miss Cassandra had said that perhaps some day all of the children would be gone from home and he , her father , would be too old to read ; then , when that state of affairs came to pass , Gracie would be useful to read the letters the children would write home . The father said if the children did n't write with any bettersense than they talked , it would n't be any great loss if their letters never were read . With that he went back to his forge and set to work and Gracie 's education was begun . Gracie had such a tingling desire to be like her white mistressesthat she sucked up instruction as a drowning person gasps at air . But even then , when she made mistakes , Miss Cassandra thumped her shining black curls with her thimbleand asked her please to exhibit a little brains even if she was a nigger . Later Miss Cassandra told her mother that , unless the seams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the fashion of all negroes when they gained maturity , Gracie was going to know a whole lot more than Marcia did . Of course , back of Miss Cassandra 's argument about the utility of Gracie 's learning to read was merely the bluestocking'sfidgety desire to see everyone read and become as nearly like herself as their limited capacity would permit.  |p253Thus  it came about , as the usufruct of her study and toil by a candle in her dark room , Gracie was enabled to read , posted on the big gate , " one of light-yellow color , called Gracie , to be sold at public outcry at the courthouse door in Florence , Alabama . " To the quadroon the little white notice stuck on the gate post was the most conspicuous thing in the whole harsh landscape . When she approached the big house it seemed she could see its white gleaming as far off as she could see the house itself . At times it did not seem possible that the notice included her . She felt that it was possible , even natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her own soul and body to be turned over to some strange man . . . faint chill waves went over the girl 's body . Whether she spun or wove or brushed Marcia 's hair , the fact stood before her that she was going to be sold just as Solomon was sold ; that she would drop out of existence just as her husband Solomon had dropped out of existence . Some negro trader would load her in a hack and drive away with her to be resold somewhere  --  to pass from white hand to white hand . The man who bought her might put her in the field and beat her , or be stingy and give her nothing to cat but fat bacon and corn dodgers such as thousands of her race lived on . Where she lived , what she ate , what she did , what man made use of her  --  in all of these things her own wishes not only would never be asked , they would never be thought of . She , who could read the notice of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was one with the mules , the cow , and the forge . Truly , for once Miss Cassandra had been wrong , and the lawmakers of Alabama had been kind , kind men when they forbade the art of reading to slaves . Marcia was as forlorn as Gracie , but she had hopes . Every night when her maid brushed her hair Marcia would remindp254Gracie that of Pap was riding the country to borrow money and pay himself out . Indeed , every day the old man set forth on old Joe in the morning and returned in the evening . Each evening he told his family that he had heard of a man up on Big Cypress or down in the Reserve with money to loan . He knew he would get it the next day . These men with money were like will-o ' - the- wisps who floated farther and farther afield as old man Jimmie advanced . Old man Vaiden was not the type of man who could successfully borrow three hundred dollars . None of the Vaiden family was aware that the borrowing of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire and much more difficult to learn . The very loudness of his voice spoiled his credit . Money should be borrowed sotto voce . . . or in complete silence . One day old man Jimmie rode east to sec a man in Waterloo , the next day south , past Florence , to see a farmer near Tuscumbia . He even traveled as far northwest as Pulaski , Tennessee . It took him four days . When he got back , George had to help him from his saddle and to bed . In the midst of this distress of the white and terror of the black , Lump Mowbray , one night just before dawn , drifted into old Aunt Creasy 's cabin . Creasy 's cabin was a port of call for Lump . There was a sort of kinship between the knotty little negro man and the wizened old crone . The old negress herself , apparently , never went to bed , and Lump seemed never to spend a night in a house . The two of them were tendrils in the vast complicated grape-vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come from , Lump ? " mumbled Aunt Creasy , preserving her touch of mystery by not looking around to ascertain who had entered her room . " Been pas ' de McPherson place , crost de line . . . . Whar 's Gracie ?

" " I heahs a ahmy is comin ' , " replied Lump with the beginning of his sing song . " I heahs dey 's a ahmy ma'chin ' in de wrath o ' de Lawd .

" When Lump Mowbray was gone old Aunt Creasy continued in her chair , fumbling her greasy black clawlike fingers at her withered mouth . She thought of her master and mistress , of old Hannah , the mother of Gracie and George , and of Jericho , Hannah 's husband . All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African headsman deciding the fate of his tribe . She sat on with legs and buttocks numb from her long sitting . Outside the sea-blue night paled to gray , then , in the east , unfolded the peach bloom of dawn . In the cabin next to her own , Columbus and Robinet stirred . Sounds came from the big house . Hounds walked about stretching themselves in front of Aunt Creasy 's door . From the plum thicket came the noise of a hen flying down from her roost and hitting the ground with a thump . Aunt Creasy arose painfully , stood on her old legs for ap257minute or two , and finally moved . She hobbled out of door and moved slowly toward the big house . In the kitchen she heard a rattling . The old woman waited in the bare yard before the door . Presently Gracie came out with a milk pail . The quadroon 's single outside chore was attending to the cow . " Gracie , " said the old woman in a significant tone , " Lump Mowbray wuz heah las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ejaculated Gracie , who despised the hard , compact little negro with his bullet head and sooty skin . The crone fell in beside Gracie . " Lump is a pusson , same as you is , " she said with a touch of reproof in her mumble . " He gwi come back heah to-night . " The girl looked at the wizened creature beside her . " To see the last of us before we 're sold and scattered ? " The old woman glanced about the empty yard andchanged her tone . " Lump tellin ' me las ' night ' bout de ahmy o ' de Lawd , what 's a-ma'chin ' dis way rat now . " Gracie looked sharply at the old woman . " The army of the Lord ?

To be used like an animal , by any man . . . and now this army of which Lump Mowbray had caught rumors . . . " I could n't ever get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't possibly get past the first padero . " " Lump Mowbray gwi come heah to-night . He knows evah road , yeh , he know evah hawg path .

An ' Lump 'll lead you by de han ' , Gracie . . . yeh , Lump 'll lead you by de han ' to de ahmy o ' de Lawd . " The old woman turned around and went back into the kitchen.  |p259To  GRACIE the means of her salvation were as repellent and as filled with danger as was the fate of being sold South . Her initial objection was Lump Mowbray . She disliked Lump because he always looked at her . She had for Lump the concentrated despisal which women have for an admirer whom they thoroughly do not admire . Added to that was Gracie 's white woman 's reactions toward a small ugly black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and watching her walk through the yard . But such an escort to the problematic army was the smallestof her woes . To run away from home was to risk being caught and beaten by old Pap  --  it was to leave Marcia and never again to lose her heart in the gray eyes of her young mistress , never to brush her hair , never again , in the person of the white girl , to go to white dances and waltz with white men . To every cool love affair Marcia enjoyed , Gracie throbbed with a sympathy more quivering than the original passion . So to leave Marcia was , for Gracie , to fill her life with emptiness . But , on the other hand , if she did not escape she would be sold away from home anyway . There was only one possibility of escape from one or the other horn of this dilemma  --  that old man Jimmie might find u money lender . Late that evening , as the old ex-blacksmith came up the road to the gate , Gracie saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The droop of the old man 's shoulders told her in a picture what she had known all the time , but now that it was set before her like that , Gracie simply stood and looked with a sinking feeling in her chest . She turned and went upstairs to her room . It was quite dark there . She groped to her straw-mattressed bed and sat down . Through her door she could see Marcia smoothing some ribbonsunder the light of two candles . One of the candles began guttering and her mistress picked up a pair of snuffers and cleared the flame . The dimly seen white girl came to Gracie like a saint in a niche : Marcia 's slender arms , her hair ringed with an aura against the candlelight . The cream-colored girl began weeping . She wanted to go in and cover Marcia 's hands and hair with kisses of farewell . Even her passionate tenderness did not contemplate kissing her mistress 's lips . " Oh , little missy , " thought the girl in the black room to the girl under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help it . I 'd rather brush your soft hair than to . . . " Her emotion forsook inward words and became a kind of trembling absorption in this last glimpse of her mistress ; this white girl who was so far above her , so far better than she , so dear , so lovely , so pure . But she said nothing at all . To have uttered a word , even to have shown her tear-filled eyes , would have frustrated all her plans . She went silently downstairs , filled with the terror of being caught and the heartbreak of losing Marcia . In Aunt Creasy 's cabin sat Lump Mowbray , a small dark shape with a greasy knot of forehead showing of about the size and convexity of Lump 's own fist . He got up as Gracie entered . " Well , de Lawd speaks an ' de people hears , " said Lump oracularly . " You may claim you don ' heap , but you do heah . Yo ' ears may not heah but yo ' hea't heahs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  possibly nothing at all . Lump had a habit of venting deep repetitive phrases out of emptiness.  |p261Old  Aunt Creasy got laboriously to her feet . " Ah hopes God dorects you to His ahmy , Gracie . Fare you well . A black woman has a ha 'd time in dis life , but a highyellahgull lak you . . . " She shook her head heavily at Gracie 's comeliness . " Well , if'n de Lawd kin make ' em , maybe He kin save ' em . . . I du n no . " " He sont His ahmy , " intoned Lump . " Come on , I 'm ready to go , " said the girl with a little shiver of repulsion that her farewells were being said to black folk . Somehow , in this tension of parting , they seemed not like persons at all , but like dark silhouettes cut out of the faint illumination of the fireplace . Suddenly she exclaimed , " Aunt Creasy , why did you arrangeall this just for me ? " " Ah promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " explained the old negress simply . " 01 ' Hannah know what a yellah woman go through if she try to save huh soul . Ah promise Hannah Ah do whut Ah kin , so when Lump tells me ' bout God 's ahmy , Ah ' members my word to of Hannah . " The thought of Aunt Creasy keeping faith with her dead mother brought the wizened old creature within the range of Gracie 's sympathy . She stooped , put her arms about her life-long friend , and kissed her dried cheek . " Aunt Creasy , " she said weeping , " I may never see you again . Before I go . . . who was . . . my father , Aunt Greasy ? " The old black woman came to a kind of pause in the midst of their embrace , then nodded her head silently toward the big house . The quadroon stared with a catch in her throat . " You mean . . . " The old black woman nodded again slowly . " Yo ' mammy Hannah was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " breathed the girl aghast . " Oh , Lord , help me ! " And she followed Lump Mowbray away from the home of her father and her half brothers and sisters . Lump Mowbray had a tireless flat-soled gait . He padded noiselessly in front of Gracie at a pace that taxed her powers . She was no sooner in the cotton field than she began having to hurry every few steps to catch up . The effort of keeping within sight and hearing of the glimmering Lump prevented her thoughts from pouring into tragic channels . At times she would lose her guide completely and would have to run forward calling in an undertone : " Lump ! Lump ! Where are you ? " And the black man would reappear . " Rat heah . . . kai n't you see me , Gracie ? " Lump , apparently , saw everything and could hardly understand that to Gracie the night was black and impenetrable . Once he touched her hand and whispered , " Stoop down , Gracie , ' hin ' dose blackberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dat lane ! " She heard the hoofs of the white man 's horse and it brought to the girl the realization that she was on an equalitywith Lump Mowbray . They were two negroes slipping away . She was one of the articles posted up in the sheriff 's notice . This body of hers , this intangible something that looked out through her eyes and tiptoed behind briers past patrols , this sentient unique thing that was herself  --  it was for sale to-morrow at the Florence courthouse , because for twenty-seven years of Pap 's other children  --  his white children  --  hadrun an open account at BeShears ' Crossroads store . They had lived her up . Hysterical laughter shook Gracie 's throat . Lump suddenlywhirled and shook her arm . " Fuh God 's sake , woman , whut you laughin ' at ? " Gracie drew a long breath , stood still and began weeping.  | " Nothing , " she said . Lump stood hushing her and moving his flat feet restlessly . " Come on out dis fiel ' . Jess a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wrist with the rough hard hands of a cotton laborer . Gracie quieted and hurried on after the vanishing guide . At the end of the field Lump helped Gracie over a rail fence and reduced her speed in the comparative safety of the wooded hills . In the inky undergrowth Gracie was forced to hold his shirt to follow the path at all . She could see absolutelynothing . Her heart was beating heavily from her unaccustomedexertion and she breathed audibly . " When  --  are we going to get there  --  Lump ? " she panted at last . " Tiahed ? " asked Lump , with a shiver in his voice . " No  --  I 'll  --  go on . " But her legs were like wood that somehow could ache . Twigs of undergrowth hit her in the face . After walking clown an endless hill and starting up another , she gasped out : " Lump  --  I 'll  --  have to  --  sit down . " Both stopped . Gracie sat down weakly in the black path just where she was . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump-bump-bump of blood in her ears , and feel her heart like a quick rubber ball bouncing in her breast . " Oh-o-oh . . . " she sighed . " Lean on me , " invited Lump 's voice , and she felt his arm groping around her back . " No . " " You 's mighty tiahed , " persuaded Lump . " I  --  know I am , " she said , with her heart shaking her voice . " An ' . . . we 's heah all by ouahse'ves , Gracie , " mumbled bump , with a faintly audible swallow at nothing.  | A quiver of alarm and repulsion went through the weary girl . " Let 's go , " she said , and got to her feet again . Lump obeyed mutely . He got to his feet and submitted his shirt to her hand again . He walked much more slowly now . " Gracie , " he mumbled at last , " I been hangin " round yo ' place a long time on ' count o ' you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , with her fright rising . " I say to muhse'f , I ruther lay my han ' on Gracie than any othah woman in de worl ' . You looks lak heben to me , Gracie . You looks like heben walkin ' de yeth fo ' de sunshine o ' man . " " Lump ! Lump ! " cried Gracie in terror . " Do n't talk like that ! " The memory of being raped in the barn rushed over her . That was terrible enough , but this small , warped , hideousthing . . . " Why kai n't I talk lak dat , " cried Lump , " when I been wantin ' you all my life long ! Gracie , honey , girnme somethin ' , honey ! Oh , Gracie , you 's a flamin ' fifth an ' I 's a can'l fly wantin ' to bu'n myse'f up in you . . . Gracie ! " He stopped . Gracie felt him turning around on her in the blackness . " Lump ! " screamed the girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! Do n't ! " " Ah ai n't techin ' you ! " " I know you 're not . " " I 's axin ' to tech you . " " And Lump , I 'm asking you not to touch me . " For upward a minute the girl stood in the blackness with her heart pounding in her throat , seeing and hearing nothing . Then Lump 's voice mumbled heavily , " Look like , Gracie , when a man 's been wantin ' you fuh ten yeahs , an ' when he 's ca'in ' you off fuh always , an ' when he 's wid you out in de nighty woods takin ' you to de ahmy ob de Lawd , to yo ' freedoman ' happiness , does look like to me , Gracie , you mout lay down wid him wunst. "  |p265BELOW  THE TWO lay encamped the army of God . Their tents , tiny with distance , lay stretched along the valley , and above the encampment , in a long level line , hung the pale morning mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , like a supernatural canopy lowered by the God Who sent them to protect His warring hosts . The serenity , the soft aerial perspective , the great cause behind this armed multitude touched the two watchers with a pentecostal mood . The small knotty man held up preternaturallylong arms , his face took on the solemnity of simplenegroes , " Oh , Gracie , Ah brings you at las ' to de Promise Lan ' . Oh , de Lawd has come , yes , de Lawd has come ! He sont His suvants on His holy work ; He sont ' em to strack de rope f'um ouah wris'es an ' de whop f'um ouah backs . " We cry out , How long , Oh , Lawd , how long will yo chillun be kep ' in Egyp ' ! ' We din ' think He was a-comin ' , but hyar He is . Oh , Gracie , don ' nevah say de Lawd don ' lieah His chillun pray ! Don ' nevah think His yeah don ' heah yo ' prayuhs ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gracie up with a sudden ebullience of strength and mysticism . She forgot her blistered feet , her utter weariness of body ; she even forgot Lump 's night-long pleadings for the intimacy of her body . She caught the small negro 's hand . " Come on , Lump , let 's go down , " she gloried.  | Lump did not move . " No , Gracie , I 's got to go back . " " You 're not going down there with me ? " she asked in amazement . " No , Gracie , I 's got to go back an ' spread de news ob de glory my eyes has see . I 's lak Moses , Gracie . Ah comes to de Promise Lan ' an ' looks , but Ah tu'ns my back . Dem Ah guides goes in , but Lump tu'ns back . He gwi back to spread de news in Egyp ' , what his eyes saw an ' his yeahs heah . " As he actually turned away , the first quiver of admiration the girl ever felt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Moses covered Lump 's shoulders . She had no idea , nor had he , that the real reason of Lump 's return was that the flat-footed negro was an irrepressible gossip , and he would rather pad up and down the Crossroads neighborhoodwith this marvelous tale than be a free man . When his quick padding steps had removed him from Gracie 's sight , a thought passed through the girl that , after all , she might have granted him what all night long he had prayed for and wept for . Then he passed out of her mind . Exactly what Gracie expected when she went down alone she did not know . Some great beneficence , some transcendentalgood . Like all religious expectants , she was unable to define the marvel she dreamed of . She walked down the wooded hillside , and just when she had decided that she had lost her way a sentry moving back and forth between two trees challenged her . She said she wanted to come inside the lines . The youth with the musket considered the extraordinary visitor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazarded . Gracie reflected that she was a piece of property flying from a forced sale and said that she had a complaint to make . " Well , " said the sentry , yielding to the dark eyes in thep267pale oval face , " I suppose you 've got a right to state your complaint , but I 'll tell you now it ai n't going to do any good . When a house is burned , it 's burned , and that 's all there is to it . " " Nobody 's been burning any house , " said Gracie , utterly at sea . " Well , all right . I was just telling you that much . Come on with me an ' the corporal 'll talk to ye . " In a soiled tent which bore not a hint of the fair vision Gracie had seen from the hills drowsed the corporal 's guard . Just outside the fly lay a few smoldering faggots on which simmered a coffee pot . A little removed from the fire three muskets were stacked together in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gray blanket . The noncommissioned officer sat up , looked at Gracie , then rubbed his eyes and looked again . " She wanted in the lines to make a complaint , " explained the sentry , not sure that he was right in bringing her in . " What 's gone ? " yawned the corporal  --  " horse  --  cowpigs. . . would you know your horse if you was to see it again ? " " Of course I 'd know my horse ! " ejaculated Gracie , thinkingthe soldiers in the army of God asked queer questions indeed . The corporal rolled his tongue about in his mouth to rid it of the dryness of sleep , then said Gracie would have to remainwhere she was until the lieutenant waked up and shaved and had breakfast . " Go to him before he 's had his eye-opener , " warned the corporal , " and you 'd never get your horse back at all . " Gracie almost said she had no horse , but her negro instinct to say nothing and allow as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sentry returned to his post . The corporal lay down in his blanket , evidently intending to finish his sleep , but his head lifted now and then to look at Gracie . Presently he gave over the idea of sleep , sat up , and asked the girl where she lived . " Down toward Florence , " said Gracie . " Toad what ? " asked the corporal . " Florence , " repeated Gracie . The noncom considered this for several moments . Finally he pushed another rolled-up blanket with his toe . " Catlin ! Catlin ! Wake up , " he yawned , " and tell me what these soft-talking Southern beauties mean when they say they live toad flaunts . " Out of the blanket roll lifted the blackest hair and the bluest eyes Gracie had ever met . " What 's the matter ? " Gracie had decided , almost with a feeling of sacrilege , that the corporal in the Lord 's army was drunk . She repeated to the youth called Catlin that she lived toward Florence . The hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " which the Northern corporal had not caught . Catlin told the corporal where she lived . " Where is Florence ? " " About a day 's march down in Alabam ' . " The corporal became more attentive . " How in the heck did she lose a horse down in Alabama when we have n't reached there yet ? " he inquired of Catlin , in the fashion of a person talking through an interpreter . Jerry Catlin sat up and blinked at Gracie , then without asking her drew his own deductions . " I imagine it 's that Leatherwood gang . They 've been raising the devil all through this section . They claim to be Union men when they steal from secessionists , and claim to be Confederates when they steal from Union men . " " I see , " nodded the corporal . " Well , if that 's the lay-out , I calculate I 'd better take her to the left'nant right now . " He rose up , put on and buttoned his blue coat , looked into a metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow , and set off some fifty yards to a street ofp269tents . He paused before one and scratched the canvas flap ; then called in a voice that was subdued apparently not to awaken the officer inside , but yet it was too persistent to let him sleep : " Left'nant Beekman . . . Left'nant Beekman . . Left'nant Beekman . . . " At about the sixth or seventh repetition the flap was jerked aside , a red face with a choppy blond mustache looked out , and a voice brittle with anger snapped : " O'Malley , how many times have I instructed you " " The lady has news of the Leatherwood gang , sir , " hastened O'Malley , saluting . " Would n't news of the Leatherwood gang keep till after breakfast ? " " Yes , sir , I 'll take her back , sir . " Lieutenant Beekman glanced at the informer on the Leatherwood gang , and his manner changed abruptly . " Perhaps I might look into the matter . We 've been havinga number of complaints about those outlaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , miss . " The face withdrew and Gracie heard a brisk moving about inside the tent . She and the corporal stood waiting in the gray-lighted street . Presently the lieutenant came out again and looped back the flaps , apparently for the day . " You may go , Corporal . Now , if you 'll be good enough to come in out of the chill , miss ? " The lieutenant pulled around a camp chair inside the tent . Gracie entered with an odd feeling that a white man should call her " miss . " Inside she found herself standing on a rubber ground cloth . In one corner stood a camp trunk ; a sword and a holster hung from the tent pole . Lieutenant Beekman himself was now buttoned up formally . He and everything in the tent looked ready for inspection . He introduced himself and asked Gracie 's name . " My name is Gracie , " said the quadroon , then , feeling the lack of a surname in the first introduction she had ever had in her life , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those small , blond incisive men who do not appear small . His lips fitted tightly together . He bit off his words sharply in his friendliest moods . He now said : " Take that chair , Miss Vaiden . . . . When was your horse stolen ? " " I  --  Lieutenant Beekman , " hesitated the girl , " I  --  I did n't lose any horse . " " I thought you did . " " N-no , sir . " " No ? Then what complaint do you wish to file ? " " Well . . . it was n't exactly a complaint . . . " Gracie grew more and more uncertain what to do . She saw Beekmanhad mistaken her for a white woman . She knew she was receiving a consideration based on her supposed whiteness . If she told him the truth she might possibly get sent back home . " I just heard about this army , " she ventured . " You are not concerned with the Leatherwood gang ? " " Y  --  n-no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you tell O'Malley you were ? " " No , he just  --  just looked at me and  --  and supposed it . " The glimmer of a smile went across Lieutenant Beekman 's sharp features . " And what am I to suppose ? " " Well , I  --  I came up here last night " Where from ? " " From Florence . " The officer reached for a map and looked at it . " Did you ride all night ? " " N-no-o . " He looked at the condition of her clothing . " You . . . did n't walk ! "  | " Y-es . . . I walked , " whispered Gracie , not having the slightest notion how this catechism would end . " Miss Vaiden , " inquired the officer , curiously and intently , " will you tell me why you attempted such a difficult march  --  at night ? " Gracie 's heart almost stopped . Her lips grew chilly . She had no idea what would happen to her . Already she had discoveredLump 's transcendental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to be . . . sold , " she whispered . The blue-uniformed lieutenant sat perfectly motionless in body and face . The quadroon momentarily expect to be asked to get out of the chair , to be reprimanded for her presumption in sitting down to a conversation of equals with a white person . " Sold , " he repeated at last . Gracie nodded faintly . " I see , " he said , with a faint change in the metallic Northern overtones of his voice . He sat thinking for several minutes . Gracie watched him anxiously . Finally he said , in the tone of one taking command of actual things and not sentiments : " You must be very tired and hungry . Your feet must be raw . " " They are , " said Gracie , " and I am . " " Well , we can fix that . Just keep your seat a moment , Miss Vaiden . I 'll be right back . " He got to his feet with quick movements and hurried out into the street of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might be arranging to have her sent home and get the reward . Why should he be in such a hurry ? However , she had not waited long before he reappeared with another soldier , bearing a basin of water , towels , bandages , and a brown bottle.  | He placed them beside her on the ground cloth , told her to bathe her feet and wrap the raw places up in arnica . Then he went out of the tent to let her dress her wounds . He did not go away but stood just outside his quarters . Gracie drew off her stockings with the oddest mingling of gratitude and uncertainty . From the outside of the tent Beekman directed her to pour some arnica into the water . Gracie did so and put her burning , aching feet into the penetrating comfort of a hot foot bath . The sensation spread up her legs and into her weary body , intensifying the gratitude and allaying the suspicion that had just entered her head . " I 'll tell you what I can do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that he had been studying the question . " Yes , what is it , Mr. Beekman ? " asked the girl , in the respectful voice she always used toward white persons . " You must be acquainted down toward Florence . You must know who are the Union sympathizers and who sympathize with the rebels ? " " Nearly everybody sympathizes with the Confederates , " said Gracie . " Yes , I know that , but that could be a reason why you should come along with the army , do n't you see ? . . . one of our information staff . " Gracie perceived that he was trying to think up a reason for her going with the army , but she did not know what an information staff was . After a moment he asked in a less speculative voice , " Do n't you need fresh hose ? " " Mine are torn , " said Gracie . Beekman reappeared in the tent while Gracie made an instinctive effort to cover her knees and calves with the towel . The officer opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of spoons , watches , handkerchiefs , hose , and what not . He selected a pair of silkp273hose and offered them with his slight , rather compressed smile . " This is the very thing . This holds a kind of poetic justice , of which any sort is rare enough in this world . " He hung them over the back of the camp chair . " Do you know how to bind your feet ? " he continued , looking at her feet through the brown arnica-tinted water . " Oh , yes , " said Gracie , suddenly becoming afraid he was going to do it for her . " Let 's see if you do ? " This was an order to the quadroon . She took her foot out , held down her skirt with her elbows as she dried it . It was a well-shaped foot because it had never worn a tight shoe . The girl had no idea at all how to bandage a foot . She passed the cloth around her heel and over the arched top . Sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bandage , fitted it between her great toe and the next and wound a fan-shaped bandage covering ball and heel and finally tucked in the end without a knot . " There you are , " he said . " Do the other one the same way as this , then roll your stockings and put them on so they wo n't disturb the cloth . I 'm out to get some break-fast . " He got to his feet and disappeared in his usual quick fashion . After a longer interval he returned with a companion , bearing a tray of steaming pots and platters . A folding camp table came from behind the trunk and the things were spread out on it . " You wo n't get cream , " said Beekman . " You 'll have to take your coffee black . " All these things had been surprising , but for the lieutenant evidently to be about to eat with her was acutely embarrassing to the girl . She felt very queer indeed . The unknown softness of silk on her calves and knees filled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and cat with her was incredible . It was not an honor , it was a nervous shock . As if the man suddenly had stabbed himself before her eyes . The girl felt no distaste for it , she simply felt as if such a breakfast could not go on . Something must happen to stop it . Her hands trembled so she could hardly lift the thick army cup to her lips . Her nervousness was so marked that finally Beekman asked her what was the matter . She said nothing was the matter , but gave up her effort to sip the coffee . " Really , what is ? " Beekman leaned toward her with sharp curiosity . Gracie drew a long breath . " Must I tell ? " " Certainly . " " Well  --  I  --  my master and mistress  --  never let me  --  eat with white folks . " Gracie had a faint chill feeling in her cheeks as the blood dropped out of them . The blond lieutenant got to his feet , leaned across the little table and patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were a slave then ; you 're not now . Go ahead and finish your breakfast by yourself if you like . " He let his hand remain a few moments on Gracie 's shoulderand then stepped away . Another touch of faint apprehension invaded Gracie at this touch . It was not a simple friendly pressure . Added to that , to eat her breakfast alone while a white man waited was still more anomalous . She looked at him and felt herself flush . He stood a little away from her now , smiling faintly at the absurdity of this reversed position . Presently he said : " While I was out I spoke for a place for you in the quartermaster 's wagon . " " Did you ? " " He said he 'd take you along to-day and dig you up a tent and blankets from somewhere . " He came across andp275patted her shoulder again . " That will be very nice , for you to have your own private tent . " At the way he said " private tent , " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed . She suddenlydid n't want her silk hose or her breakfast . The food in her mouth became without taste . For the same sort of thing to spring up again at her first contact with an officer in the army of God ! It dawned on Gracie that there was nowhere at all for her to go . Lieutenant Beekman said , with an effect of his faint mirth , " I 'll run along now to the officers ' mess , and you can finish your breakfast alone . "  |p276AN  houn later the camp fell into the stir of departure ; tents were struck ; blankets rolled up ; the mess things were packed ; the wagons swallowed them all up . The soldiers marched forward . The encampment unwound itself along the trail and moved deliberately toward the south . Gracie had been given a place in a baggage wagon . She stretched out among the rolls of canvas tents and rode back in the direction from which she had come . Behind Gracie 's wagon rumbled the rest of the baggage train in a haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of camp followershung onto the regiment ; not only runaway negroes but a number of poor whites . This riff-gaff carried spoil : things they had picked up for themselves in the spoliated region behind them , or equipment they had stolen from the soldiers . The teamster who drove Gracie 's wagon was a short , square , red-faced man who , at first , had declared he would have no nigger wench riding his cart , but who had changed his morose expression when he saw his guest . This driver 's name was Leeks . He had found a place forGracie in a space between two rolls of canvas near his seat . He drove three pairs of horses and wielded a maze of reinsand a whip . It was a long whip and with it he could pick ahorse fly off the ear of any animal in the string before him . " I understand ye'rre going along with us , " tailed theP277ostler , looking around at Gracie once he had his team strung out in the line of march . Gracie said she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did you say ? " asked Gracie apologetically . " W'erre to ? " " Oh , I do n't know where to . " The fellow jerked a rein without disturbing the others , whistled , drove for some distance with a quizzical expression . Finally he asked : " ' Ow can they sell a w'ite woman ? " " You mean me ? " " Yes , you . " " I 'm not white , " said Gracie , with her familiar depression coming over her . " You look it , " nodded the ostler ; " if I may say it , you look very w'ite . Not a spavin nor a blemish nor a chafed spot on ye . " " My feet are chafed , " said Gracie , smiling faintly . " I werre speaking figgerative , " said the ostler . " I 'm not , " said Gracie . " My feet are a sight . " The red-faced man reached over and took hold of her ankle . " Let 's see ' ow bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Gracie kicked loose in sharp anger . " Touch me again and I 'll " She searched futilely fora threat , " I 'll tell Lieutenant Beekman . " " Ho ! . . . yes . . . Beeky Beekman . " Leeks wagged his big square head . " Who keers anything about Beekman ? " Gracie pushed herself further toward the rear of the wagon and looked angrily across the hills . A smoke was volleying up beyond the skyline in rolling masses . Leeks drove on for some distance in silence but finally turned about and called back in a rough placating voice : " Say , I did n't mean nothin ' while ago , c'm on back . " As the girl made no reply , he added presently in aP278cynical tone , " Un'erstan ' the Q.M . ' s going to issue you a tent to-night all to yerse'f . " " Is he ? " said Gracie resentfully . " It 's what Barney told me . " He waited a moment and then added , " I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched his leader with his whip . The silence following this last remark piqued Gracie 's curiosity . " Timid . . . about what ? " " Skeered to sleep by myself at night . Look like a finelookinggal like you might do something about it . " He looked around at her and broke into loud laughter . Gracie got to her feet . " I 'll get down , " she snapped . " I wo n't ride with sucha --  " , " Wait ! Wait ! God ' ! Mighty , woman , kai n't ye take a joke . Set easy in the boat . I wo n't say another damn word . " Gracie paused on the back of the wagon . She began to see that , no matter to what cart she resorted , it would be the same thing . She and Leeks were almost isolated on their wagon . Winding after them along the crooked road came four or five more wagons . When she turned and looked ahead she saw the infantry , a column of dusty blue winding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl jolted along watching the column of smoke . The fact that the quartermaster had issued her a tent stuck in her mind . To-night she would be in a tent by herself . . . and there was Leeks . . . and Lieutenant Beekman . . . After an hour or two the quadroon saw still another column of smoke ahead of their line of march . She finally asked the teamster what it was . The question gave Leeks permission to talk . " Come sit back herre w'erre you werre , " he burred in low-caste Northernese . " Afterr all , if we'rre going to rride togetherr , we need n't yell like this . " Gracie crept along the wagon top and resumed her place .   " Now , therre ye arre , " nasalized the ostler comfortably , and with satisfaction . " Now the smoke therre . . . well , they'rre getting theirr dues at last , that 's all . " The girl looked from the smoke to the driver . " Who 's getting what dues ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his in'umanity , " declared Leeks warmly . " You mean that smoke 's a house . . . burning ? " breathed Gracie . " Surre . . . surre ! " " What did the owner do ? " asked the girl blankly . Mr. Leeks was amazed at his passenger . " Why , God ' 1 Mighty , gal  --  you running away to keep frrom being sold , and ast me what he done ! " " What did he do ? " " Why , helping sell you ferr yourr masterr 's debt , of courrse . " " He was n't ! " ejaculated the quadroon . " He 's not the sheriff ! " " No , but he could ' a ' come and bid on ye , could n't he , if he 'd liked to ? " " Of course he could do that . " " Therre ye arre , " cried the ostler , reaching over and slapping the girl 's knee . " Takes fourr to make a auction : the man that owns th ' goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctioneerr , and the people to buy . . . . We'rre going to clean out all four kinds , miss , ferr theirr merrciless and in'uman trrafic in ' uman flesh ! I ferr one am glad to see ever ' column of smoke rrise up . . . to ' ell with th ' last of ' em , say I ! " Gracie jolted along staring at the smokes . She thought of the hideous things that had been done that deserved this  --  the selling away of Solomon , her own rape in the barn loft  --  but whoever lived in the burning houses really had nothing to do with her and Solomon . The tent wagon drew nearer and nearer to the column of smoke . As it moved over the hill it came into view of the actual building itself . Then a very strange thing happened to the landscape . Gracie had been moving through an unknowncountry ; now the terrain seemed to gather itself up and mold itself into something solid and known . The cardinal directions suddenly reestablished themselves with a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . A few miles farther on stood the Vaiden big house . A trembling set up inside the girl that this army would pass ol ' Pap 's place . She was afraid he would come out , take her off the wagon and whip her . She could not imagine the army itself estopping old man Jimmie from seizing his property . It seemed to Gracie that she had been gone from home for weeks . Then another fear came to her . . . they might burn down ol ' Pap 's house ! She reached over and caught the ostler 's arm . " Mr. Leeks , who  --  who is the boss of all these men ? " " You mean the officer in command ? " " Yes , sir . " " Colonel Higgenbotham . . . but say , Sisterr , do n't trry th ' colonel . You stick to the damn little left'nant who got ye th ' tent . " " But listen , " interrupted Gracie , not even understanding what he meant , " five or six miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , wot'rre ye skeered of . . . they 'll ketch ye again ? ' Y Gawd , gal , they 'll neverr do it ! " " I 'm afraid the men 'll burn down ol ' Pap 's house ! " The driver was amazed . " Hell , do n't ye want it burrned ? " " Of course I do n't ! What would I want my own house burned up for ? " " Because they kept ye a slave all yerr life ! " cried Leeks angrily ; " because they'rre going to sell ye like a cow ! Imagine it ! Sell a piece like you to jest any damn man ! . . . Gracie ! Damn it , Gracie , lemme come to yerr tent to-night ! " P281He squeezed her soft thigh unconsciously in a spasm of desire . She shook him loose furiously , then saw a man on horseback , trim looking even in the dust , picking his way down the line of wagons and men . Gracie just had time to composeherself when he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl and smiled . " We 're getting into your country , " he called up . " I know we are , " replied Gracie , wondering and dreading whatever would happen now . " There 's a man named McPherson lives down yonder where you see that smoke . Do you know whether he 's a rebel or a Union man ? " " Mr. Candy McPherson ? " " He may possibly be named Candy , " agreed Beekman with his dry smile . " Why , he  --  he 's a Union man , " breathed Gracie , defendingMr . McPherson , whom she liked , by the natural slave method of lying . Then a thought struck her that she had better not say all her neighbors were good Union men or she would not be believed . She would better say some were rebels . She would save of Pap and say he was a Union man . Besides , Mr. Candy 's house was already on fire . So she caught up her words , swallowed them and gasped out : " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Candy McPherson 's got three boys in the Confederate army . " " Have you anything personal against Mr. McPherson ? " " No-o . . . of course I have n't . He 's a good man . " The lieutenant was in no hurry . He reined down his horse and rode along looking up at the girl . Even in the dust he enjoyed watching her . Under his eyes Gracie became conscious of the soft jouncing of her bosom at every jolt of the wagon . She wished he would ride on away , and folded an arm across her breast to steady herself . After riding some little distance , Beekman said , " I succeeded in getting you a tent for to-night . "  | " Yes , " said Gracie . " Well . . . are n't you pleased to have sleeping quarters ? " inquired Beekman lightly . The quadroon broke away from the topic of sleeping to which , apparently , every soldier in the army of God recurred . " Mr. Beekman , " she said in a disturbed voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses in this country just because the people own slaves ? Ought their houses to be burned  --  when us colored folks have to live in them , too ? " The lieutenant looked up at her curiously . " Do you think this invasion is on account of Southern slavery ? " " Yes  --  is n't it ? " asked the girl , trying to save the last touch of her apocalyptic vision . The officer gave his thin smile and lifted a dusty blond eyebrow . " We 're invading this country , Gracie , because Southern cotton growers want to buy cheap English goods , duty free , and we want them to buy Northern-made goods with a tariff added to the cost price . Why , after the Battle of Fort Sumter , Lincoln offered to make slavery perpetual down here if the planters would agree to the tariff . " He turned off with a shrug . " But that 's neither here nor there . . . . I picked up a dress for you at an old log house down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you to-night . "   CANDY MCPHERSON 'S house was on fire . As the army wagons creaked past , the logs fell in and such a wave of heat rolled out that Gracie held her hands before her face and twisted her shoulders away from the sting . It seemed fantastic , it seemed impossible to the quadroon , that human beings could march past a burning home , laughing and joking while the family fought the fire and tried to rescue some little part of what they possessed . And she thought with a kind of stunned credulity that all this destructionwas being wrought because the people of the North wanted the people of the South to trade with them and not with England . The explanation Beekman had flung off corroded in her thoughts . So that was the object of the army of God . Beckman'sown trunk full of spoons and watches ; the immediate attempt of the soldiers to possess her own body  --  that was the army of God . The wagons were past the burning buildings now . Beekmanwas gone . He had ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolted forward the ostler began again talking about coming to Gracie 's tent . Her feeling of insult changed to one of simple disgust . " You can come to my tent and welcome , " she said with a shudder , " I wo n't be in it ; " and she turned her legs away from him . " Wait ! Wait , gal ! " he cried . " You'rre the purrtiestP284woman I ever talked to . . . . God damn it , I 'll marry yuh rratherr than lose ye ! We 'll go to the chaplain . . . . Hell firre , wait  --  ye'rre not climbing down ! " When he saw her swing off to the ground with a girl 's wobbly lack of precision , he shook his free fist at her and bawled , " Well , go to hell , ye damned ungrrateful nigger bitch ! " He could n't leave his wagon to detain her . The driver of the next train was roaring with laughter at what he caught of the brief comedy . Gracie ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swinging her foot over the top rail and exposing her legs to the passing men with a kind of furious indifference . It was like climbing a fence before animals . The girl knew exactly where she was . She would cut across field , save three long turns around corners and arrive at the big house quickly . She hurried ahead in her bandaged feet , peering across the fields , then looking back at the dust that floated high above the army . She did not know what she was going to do but hurried on , moved by some confused motive of protectingher master 's home . Sight of the far-off black oaks in the Vaiden yard gave Gracie 's heart a squeeze of recognition . No smoke was comingup from among them , so the big house was not on fire . The girl hurried on , taking long and short steps between the inconvenient widths of the cotton ridges . As she neared the place she heard a many-tongued howling from the hounds : defiant barkings , yelps of fear , howls of flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard fence , and behind that barrier turn and bark at some intruder in the yard . The white and black Vaiden family were in the yard talking to some Federal cavalrymen . At one moment all the Vaidens would be trying to say something at the same time , even to the negroes . Then an officer in dust-colored uniform would ask a question . The group was in the midst of one ofp285those fantastic catechisms by the Federal raiders to see if the planter were such a strong rebel that his home deserved to be burned . " Is there a member of this family in the rebel army ? " clapped an officer in his Northern voice . " No ! No ! " boomed old man Jimmie with a very red face . " By the eternal , none of my sons are in the rebel army ! " The inquisitor glanced at the negroes . " No sah , boss . " Robinet shook his head with much white eyes showing in his black face . " Nuh-uh , " shook Columbus , " you sho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are n't you the father of two boys , Polycarp Vaiden and Augustus Vaiden ? " inquired the officer . The old man hesitated , then nodded stiffly . " Yes , yes , Carp and Gus are my boys . " " Well , I understand they 're in the Confederate army ? " snapped the officer . " They are ! They are , suh ! " boomed old man Jimmie . " But when you say rebel army you 're insinuating a damned lie , suh . The South never belonged to the North " Here he was interrupted by Marcia who cried out , " We heard Gus was fighting on the Yankee side ! " The old man whirled on his daughter . " Well , you know it was n't so , Marsh ! " he stormed . " No , I do n't know it was n't so ! You nearly got into a fight about it ! " At this moment the colloquy was interrupted by several soldiers coming out of the house with hands full of plunder . One had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pewter spoons from the kitchen ; still another carried two hams which he had found in the smokehouse . The family stood looking mutely at their tableware and linen being taken away . Just behind these came three more soldiers pushing a fourth man out the door in front of them.  | " Here , Cap'n , " called one of the privates . " Here 's a fellowwe found hiding in the dark middle part of the attic . " " Is that Augustus ? " snapped the officer , looking at theprisoner . " No , " cried the old man , " that 's a neighbor over to see me . " " Who is it ? " " His name 's Dalrymple . " The officer swept away the explanation with a gesture . " Set fire to the house ! " he cried . " It 's nothing but a nest of rebels ! " The soldiers went running to the rail fence for kindling , when Gracie hurried through the paling gate that led from the field into the yard . " No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried ; " it 's the sheriff who came here to sell all of us colored folks . He 's going to take us to Florence and sell us ! " All the Vaidens turned with the utmost astonishment at this sudden reappearance of Gracie . " What does that nigger wench know about it ? " cried oldman Jimmie furiously . " Bill Dalrymple 's my neighbor . " Just then Gracie recognized the man with the pewterspoons . She ran to him . " That man came to sell us colored people , LieutenantBeekman ! There 's the notice he stuck on our gate ! " " I had nothing to do with it ! " cried Dalrymple . " He 's just a neighbor ! " boomed the old man . The officer turned to old Mrs. Laura . " Who do you say he is , madam ? " " Well , " said the old lady in her unruffled voice , " Mr. Dalrymple is certainly our neighbor and has been for many years . " " But is he the sheriff ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " admitted old Mrs. Laura reluctantly.  |p287The  soldiers broke out laughing . The officer waved the sheriff away , and two soldiers marched off with him . The particular excitement about the sheriff 's capture was forgotten because at that moment the Vaidens saw a column of smoke rising up from the road . Robinet cried out , " It 's the gin ! The gin 's afire ! " Others took it up . The Vaidens , white and black , cried to one another , " The cotton gin 's afire ! " " Run for the buckets ! " And off went the white masters and their slaves , making the futile effort to extinguish the houses the soldiers had fired . Began a great rattling and lowering of the bucket at the well . Columbus and Robinet went running with two pails of water up the road toward the mounting flames . Some of the water spilled on the way . By the time Columbus reached the place a light flame had run all over the film of lint that covered both the gin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the structure from top to bottom , then apparently was gone . Columbus flung his two buckets on the fire the soldiers had built . It died down a trifle , but all the water was spent . He turned and started running back the two hundred yards to the well , when Robinet came hurrying up with two more buckets . Behind him old man Jimmie wobbled with a dishpan . By this time the van of the marching soldiers was coming into sight . They began shouting and laughing at the familiar spectacle of the rebels trying to save their houses . " Hurry , old man ! Whoop ' em up , old man ! " called a dusty stentor . The old planter paused long enough to wish his tormentorsin the pits of hell . Robinet 's buckets almost had the lower fire conquered when little flames , like reddish-yellow banners , began waving in three or four places in the upper works of the gin.  | " Git up thar ! Mount you , Robinet , " roared the old man . " Git watter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft to the great wooden cog wheels above . As the old man pushed up his dishpan half of it spilled over him . A roar of renewed laughter went up from the soldiers . Robinet dashed what was left on the nearer flames . Those in the further cogs made headway . Marcia came running and sobbing down the road with a quart cup of water . Miss Cassandra hurried out to the well and began urging on Columbus who drew the water . " Hurry ! Hurry , Columbus ! They 're getting it out ! " Columbus hauled away on the wooden bucket . " Reckon dey wo n't set hit afar no mo ' , Miss Cassie ? " " Do n't know . . . pull . . . " The wooden bucket deep in the well struck the rough stone curbing , clashed from side to side . Miss Cassandra could hear the water spilling from it . Presently there was a plop . Columbus staggered backward with a loose line in his hand . The old rope had broken , the bucket was lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drawn . The soldiers marching past were now waving at Cassandra and Marcia and laughing at the negroes and the old white man . One of the marchers stepped out of line , ran in and seized a brand from the gin and flung it into the ancient blacksmith shop . Old Aunt Creasy screeched , made a queer rush of flutteringrags and waving arms , and got to the brand . It had caught some shavings . The old gargoyle jerked up her skirts , squatted over the tiny flames and watered them out . Tremendous laughter roared up and down the line of march . A soldier bawled out , " You win , charcoal ! " Another hallooed , " That 's a rebel fire extinguisher ! " The gin was now wrapped in flames . Presently the particularsegment of the column that had seen the old negress'sp289act was out of sight down the road . The men passing saw nothing but another building on fire and another family of blacks and whites standing looking silently at the flames . When the gin had fallen in and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Jimmie went back to the big house . Marcia had hushed crying and walked silently behind Cassandra . Then came her mother . " You go on in front , Gracie , " said old man Jimmie grimly . A tingle of apprehension passed over the quadroon . Her sudden shift from the role of white girl back to a negro slave again gave her a queer impression . She was a slave once more and old Pap was furious . By this time the army wagons at the end of the long line of march were rumbling past , but they were nothing ; the great wagons , the big horses , the shouting drivers were nothing . The old man turned on his wife and broke forth : " Lorry , of all idiots , you 're the biggest ! Telling Dalrymplewas sheriff ! " " He was the sheriff , " answered the old woman absently , trying to estimate how many of her things the soldiers had taken . " Of course he was the sheriff , " thundered the old planter , " but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'd posted Columbus , as soon as he 'd levied on ' cm , to say who Dalrymple was . " The old woman and the girls stared at the head of the family . " What 's the use o ' that , Jimmie ? " cried Mrs. Laura in amazement . " What 's the use ?  --  thunderation ! If he 'd ever levied on ' em I would ' a ' got credit for ' em . They 'd all got away and I 'd ' a ' got credit for ' em jest the same . Now my gin 's burnt and everything 's stole , and they ai n't a thing left on thep290place except the debt . . . . Gracie , you go out thar to Aunt Creasy 's house . " At this , apprehension filled both the girls and their mother . " Pap , what are you fixin ' to do ? " asked old Mrs. Laura uneasily . The old man sensed resistance gathering against him in his family . He turned and boomed out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her can come disputin ' my word before a damned Yankee , gittin ' my gin burned , and runnin ' away at night and not get the hide skinned off her back ? " Hurried feminine protests broke out against this . " Why , ol ' Pap , she did n't have a thing to do with burning the gin ! " " They were going to burn the house till she come ! " cried Marcia . Such fear filled Gracie that her legs almost gave way under her. " 01 ' Pap ! 01 ' Pap ! " she babbled . " I conic back to help , ol ' Pap . I  --  I did n't make ' em burn the gin . " " Shut up , you impudent hussy , contradicting my word ! " " Father , " interrupted Cassandra , " you 're not going to whip Gracie while you 're mad like that . " " Cassandra , mind your own business ! No nigger can run off from me an ' not get licked . " He caught Gracie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shack . The white women were about to try to hold Gracie back . They hurried after her , Marcia weeping . But in the movementthey saw the silk hose on Gracie 's legs . Miss Cassandra turned abruptly around . " Imagine such a thing ! Imagine it ! " she ejaculated brittly . " One night away from home and trading on her-self ! " The white women turned back to the big house.  |p291Old  Pap snatched off a peach-tree sprout as he jolted Gracie along toward the cabin . " Strip off your jacket , " trembled the old man . " Take her off ! I 'm not going to split a good dress to save your yellow hide ! " " O-oh , P-Pap ! " begged the girl through blackish-red lips . " I  --  come back to try to help you  --  I wanted to help you Oh ! Oh ! Pap ! Pap ! Do n't hit me so hard ! Thathurts ! Pap ! Oh , God , Pap ! I 'm going to have a baby ! "  | WhEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found not only was their gin burned and their home looted , but their livestock had been driven away . Only one mule remained on the place , old Rab , and this was because Negro George , on the morning of the Yankee visitation , had , by good luck , turned old Rab out to water . After the despoilers had gone away the old mule came up again . Old Aunt Creasy found him at the barn gate waiting to be turned inside . When the old crone reported this to her mistress she said : " If I 'd seed the Lawd in his ' tension robe I wouldna felt no mo ' lak shoutin ' dan when I seed of Rab come back . " Old Mrs. Vaiden told her not to talk of the Lord like that . To add to their losses , the quadroon girl , Gracie , had fled on the night of her whipping by old man Jimmie . Her escape had been the simplest possible matter . The Yankee detachment had encamped at the Lacefield plantation ; their scouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol no longer ventured on their beats . Therefore Gracie simply had walked away during the night without hindrance . Any of the black folk could have done the same thing but they stayed on where they were for several reasons : the plantation was their home , the white members of the group depended more and more on the black members . The negroes not only had to plant and tend the crops , but the black men fell into the most primitive methodp293of obtaining food . Columbus and Robinet set out rabbit gums and dead falls , while Negro George diverted the hounds from the aristocratic fox chase to trail the unexciting but edible opossum . George ruined the dogs but added sundryplatters to the lean table of his master . Old man Jimmie Vaiden was furious about Gracie 's escape . It became certain through rumors that she had found refuge at the Yankee camp . The old planter had ridden down to recover the slave girl . Old Mrs. Laura advised her husband that he was throwing away his time trying to get Gracie back , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode down there . But the old planter boomed out that he had the law on ' em . He was referring to the Fugitive Slave Act . The old man could quote the text verbatim . So off he went to the Yankee camp , relying with a curious literalism on one of Henry Clay 's obsolete compromises . Exactly what happened to him the family never did find out . Certainly nothing physical . But late in the afternoon old man Jimmie rode back , holding to the pommel of his saddle , barely able to sit his mule , and reviling Lincoln , Garrison , and the Yankee nation . Simple anger had exhaustedthe ex-blacksmith . When the women and George had run out in alarm and helped him down into the house , they asked him what was the matter . The old man burst out : " They told me she was n't there , and me looking straight at her in her tent . . . said she was a white woman visiting her brother who was one of the officers . I yelled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know that 's you ! I 'll have t h e law on every damned Yankee here ! ' " Everybody was a-laughin ' like fools and the surgeon walked up and says , says he , Here , here , old man , do you want to drop off with the apoplexy ? Come to the dispensary and let me give you a potion . ' I said , Potion be damned , a Yankee could n't give me a brush to shoo flies off a dung hill , and you , Gracie , ' says I , shaking my finger at her as shep294set in her tent , May God damn your black disloyal soul to hell ! ' " 01 ' Pap was really ill . Mrs. Laura thought he ought to have some whisky , but naturally the Yankees had taken all they had . Miss Cassandra , who was prejudiced against whisky on account of her brothers drinking , said she thought ammonia would do . With patient hopelessness Mrs. Laura replied , " I declare , Cassie , I do n't believe any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about each other . Do n't you know he would n't smell an amony bottle if his life depended on it ? " " It would be the sensible thing for him to do . " " He do n't require any better reason than that for not doing it . Now , you , Marsh , git on the mule and take out down the road and see if you can get a little whisky somewhere . Git back with it as quick as you can . Your pappy 's a Hardshell Baptist . He believes in water for his soul and whisky for his body . " So Negro George changed saddles on old Rab and Marcia set out down the road , apprehensive about her father and full of disturbed thoughts . What her mother had just said remained in Marcia 's mind . It did seem that none of the Vaidens understood each other . Her mother , who was not a Vaiden at all , was the spiritual center around which the centrifugal Vaidens revolved . Without Mrs. Laura the family would fly to pieces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of principle . Cassandra and her father were full of principles which they applied to other people with a strict morality . That was the great charm about her mother : old Mrs. Laura had no principles , she had feelings instead . That was one of the sweet things about pretty , affectionate Gracie : she had no principles . And yet , look what a pitfall into which she had stumbled  --  a hanger-on in an army ! Marcia could not imagine such ap295spiritual cataclysm for the gentle , loving companion who had grown up with her in her home . But while one part of Marcia 's brain grieved for Gracie , another sector reflected that , after all , Gracie was a negro , and negro women were by nature unchaste . They consorted wantonly with whoever came to hand . They were as the animals , and so , perhaps , were without sin . That was what a negro was . Yet , in all her life , Gracie had never appeared in the faintest degree like this . . . . Marcia drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy logic was distracted by a dolorous singing and a twanging accompaniment around the bend in the road . A moment later three blue-clad soldiers came in sight . One of them had a banjo . One of the men , with hair so blond as to be almost white , took the instrument from his companion and said in a hill accent : " Dad blame it , Billings , it goes this-a-way . " He tucked the banjo under his forearm , began flapping it with his finger tips , and in a nasal tenor set up a melancholy yowl-ing : " Oh , the dangdest luck I ever sawWas the luck I had in Arkansaw ; I gambled an ' drunk like a bold outlaw But the shurf grabbed me in Arkansaw . . Yea Ho ! Dang the luck ! " Billings received the banjo back , evidently pursuing a music lesson , but just then he saw Marcia on the mule and came to a pause . " Must we ask her , Dilliehay ? " he queried of his companionwith the blond hair . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up and appraised Marcia . " Might as well . "  | The three blue uniforms and bright brass buttons looked to Marcia like three natty demons out of some stylistic hades . She made up her mind that she would answer nothing they asked her . Billings , the short soldier with the banjo , held up a hand and said in the clipped accent which was so detestable to Marcia : " Excuse me , madam , but have you passed some men in blue uniforms , one of them riding  --  what was he riding , Dilliehay ? " " A claybank mare , " specified Dilliehay in a voice that held the nasality of the hills and not the North ; " a claybank mare with stockings on her front feet , blind in her left eye , and she was a stump sucker to boot . " " If I had , " stated Marcia crisply , " I would n't tell you . " The soldiers dropped their jaws in amazement . " Well . . . why . . . would n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why would n't you ? " clipped off Billings . " Because I would n't help you Yankees in any shape , form , or fashion , that 's why ! " The Yankee with the banjo tipped his cap courteously . " Then , madam , would you pardon us if we run along and ask somebody else ? " " I wo n't pardon them if they answer you , " bit off the girl with compressed lips . There was such anger in her gray eyes that the Northern youth did not pursue his jest . However , the very blond hillmanbegan to argue : " Looky here , miss , this is just as much for you-all as it is for we-uns , " he drawled ; " more , ai n't it , Billings ? " " I consider it much more , " stated Billings judicially . " It do n't make any diff'runce to the army , " went on the blond Dilliehay , " if the Leatherwood gang comes aroun ' and steals all your horses an ' mules , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , we orter keep things straight . " " Oh , you 're after the Leatherwood gang ? " " Yes , we air , miss . " " What are you going to do to them ? " " Shoot ' em if we ketch ' em , miss . So you see it 's in yore own intrust after all . " " Yes , our interest ! You Yankees come down here burning and stealing everything you can lay your hands on , then if anybody else starts stealing a little something so you ca n't get it yourselves , then you want to catch ' em and shoot ' em  --  in our interest ! " The Northern youth said , " Come on , Dilliehay , this does n't seem to be our lucky day . " " You 're the one who said ask her , " grumbled Dilliehay . " You 're a liar , you proposed it yourself , " snapped Billings . And the two youths moved on up the road . Marcia kicked old Rab and proceeded toward BeShears Crossroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had fabricated their question about the Leatherwood gang merely to have something to say to her . She thought how metallic was the man Billings ' voice . She continued these disparaging thoughts , when she heard footsteps running after her mule . She glanced around and saw one of the three soldiers . As he came up her annoyance broke off in surprise as she recognized him wen in spite of his spick blue uniform . " Why  --  why , Jerry Catlin , " she ejaculated , " what are you doing in that uniform ? " " Well I  --  I joined up , " said Jerry , who evidently had expected a more unkind greeting that he received . " Well , I did n't suppose , when you offered me them apples that day , the next time I saw you you 'd be burning our houses when you know all our men folks are gone . " " Miss Marcia , when I joined I did n't know it was going to be like this . I thought we were going to fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing I 'd quit . " " Well , you ca n't just quit , " said Jerry , walking beside her mule ; " that 's desertin ' . " The girl glanced down at him once or twice but vouched no further remarks . His uniform made his shoulders appear much broader and squarer than when she had seen him on the cart . The color of the cloth keyed up his eyes to an almost turquoise intensity of blue . She thought to herself , " If you looked like a prince in blue I would n't have anything to do with you . " Jerry was evidently pondering something to say for he brought out : " Uh . . . what , you said to Gillie Dilliehay certainly got him . " " It ought to have got him , " said Marcia sharply . " It did . Gillie joined up with the Confederates before he come here . Now you throwing up to him about burning and stealing , against the very side he used to be fighting for  --  that got Gillie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you mean to say he belonged to the Confederates ? " " I  --  do n't suppose I should have mentioned it , " hesitatedJerry . " Then he really is a deserter ! " ejaculated the girl . Catlin was troubled . " I would n't exactly call him that , Miss Marcia . . . you see , he really did n't know which side he wanted on . " " What did he expect ? " demanded Marcia with gray eyes wide , " a try-out ? " " It 's like this , " tried to explain Catlin . " His daddy had a nigger named Abraham . So Gillie decided to join up with the rebels and keep Abraham . But when he found out the rebels did n't feed as good as the Yankees , or pay either , he said he 'd be blamed if he starved hisself just to save one nigger . Now he tells me the money he 'll make in extry pay , if the war lasts two year longer , will pay for Abraham . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not making it a bit better on that Dilliehay boy telling me this ! The idyah ! The idyah ! Eating . . . making money . . . no more principle than a pig ! He 's exactly where he belongs  --  slap dab in the Union army ! " Jerry Catlin took off his blue cap , scratched his head , and dropped a step to the rear of the mule . " Sorry I mentioned Dillie , " he said in a lowered tone . The girl returned no answer to this . She considered that for Jerry to defend Gillie implicated the black-headed boy in the crime of being a Yankee . The hillman felt this condemnationfor he repeated in a flatted tone : " Wish I had n't said anything about it now . " And he would doubtless have gone on slowly losing pace after pace until distance released him from Marcia 's baleful attraction , but in searching about for something to say , he observed : " I never could understan ' why your brother Augustus went North to enlist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mule with a fence rail she could not have been more startled and dismayed . She stopped old Rab abruptly . " What do you know about Augustus ? " " Why , nothing , except he come by our house on his way to enlist , " said Jerry blankly . " Come here ! " ordered Marcia with a pale face . The blue coat came closer with an odd look . " Where did he join ? " " In Savannah . " " Which  --  which side ? " she almost whispered . Jerry stared at the girl , as shocked at the idea of Augustusjoining the Union army as Marcia would have been herself . " Why , the Confederates , of course  --  he joined with Gillie . " p 300 The blood came back to Marcia 's face . She reached an involuntary hand toward the black-haired soldier . " Oh , Jerry  --  thank goodness for that ! We  --  we heard he was fighting on the Union side . " The two more or less shook hands on this outcome . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle and she gratefullypressed it . For a few moments the Federal felt the touch of the girl 's slender workless fingers . " Who in the world started such a lie on him ? " cried Jerry , evidently resenting it . " I think it was the Leatherwood gang . I do n't know why they did it , but people believed it  --  people will believe anything that 's bad . " " But what made ' em say he was fighting on the Union side ? " " I do n't know at all . " Jerry flung up his hand and caught the girl 's pommel . " I do . Your brother came and warned my mammy when the Leatherwood gang tried to steal our horses . My daddy 's a Union man . Augustus was fighting on the Union side then . " " Against horse thieves ? " " Yes . " " Well , I 'm proud of that ! " The two went on down the road talking intently . Jerry was telling Marcia all about the fight , how brave Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leatherwood gang charged him . All the sisterly pride and affection which Marcia felt for her younger brother in his absence , even if it never took form when he actually was with her , all of this emotion tended to spill over and transfer itself to Jerry Catlin who told her about it . " Is n't it pitiful , " she said at last , looking at the sinewy fingers on her saddle horn , " that he got married ? " " Who got married ? "  | " Augustus . " " You do n't mean he is married ! " " He sure is . Is n't it awful ? " Jerry hesitated , looked at the girl . " Well , now , I do n't know , Miss Marcia , " qualified Jerry earnestly . " Marrying is n't such a bad thing if you 've got the right person . Nobody 's happy till they find somebody they love . " " Oh , well , that 's different , " said Marcia , " but Augus-tus " She meant by that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons like herself or Jerry , but the idea of her brother falling in love with anybody or anybody falling in love with him was patently absurd . As Jerry did not follow this logic he said nothing but walked on abreast of the mule in a very pleasant silence indeed.  |p202WHEN  Marcia and Jerry Catlin drew near the Crossroadsstore , the girl received a shock . A number of horses were hitched under the sycamores near the spring and blue coats were moving in and out the store . The girl drew up old Rab abruptly . " They must be robbing Mr. BeShears . Let 's go back  --  I 'm going back . I hope they do n't burn his house . Think of poor Ponny ! " She began pulling her mule around hastily when Catlin calmed her fears . " They 're not robbing they 're trading with him . " " Trading ! How came them not to " " I imagine somebody gave a favorable report about him at headquarters . " Marcia 's sympathy changed . " You mean they found out he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " " Maybe he was n't so outspoken as some , " minified Jerry tactfully . " He certainly was n't , " agreed Marcia tartly . " He 's as mealy mouthed as a grist mill . Now he gets a big trade for it . That 's justice , is n't it ? Looks like the Lord would n't allow a man to be paid for being a mugwump . " Jerry Catlin pondered what to say to remain a loyal Union soldier and at the same time comfort an indignant rebel . " The Union army could n't very well go back on a Unionp303man , Miss Marcia , even  --  even if both of ' em was wrong . " " I wish they 'd rob him , " said Marcia . Catlin glanced about for some topic more nearly neutral . " Nice bunch of horses they 've got , ai n't it ? " He nodded at the animals hitched to the fence and the hanging branches of the trees . " Too good for the use they 're put to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BeShears to her escort . Jerry perceived this . He wished he had agreed with her in denouncing BeShears . He regretted that he had mentioned the Yankee 's horses . As a matter of fact , they were not unusual animals ; all sizes and colors champing andpaw- against the flies . He took a last look at them , when one of the horses caught his eyes and sent a little tingle of surprise and the necessity for action through his nerves . He turned to the girl . " Are you going to the store to buy something ? " he asked quickly . " I 'm going to get some whisky for Pappy , " said Marcia . " I 'll take your jug in for you . " Marcia looked at him , sensing some sudden change hadcome over her companion . Her dislike for him vanished . " Look here , I can tell you 're not offering that out ofpoliteness . What 's happened ? " " Nothing . I did n't suppose you wanted to go into that crowded store . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice girl 's selfdelusionthat she did not want to enter a store crowded with strange young men all of about her own age . She handed her jug to Catlin . " How much do you want ? " " Well , Pappy feels weak . . . about a gallon , I sup-pose . " She pulled up her mule . The soldier ran to the store with the jug on his finger . He was hurrying so Marcia would bep304subjected to the glances of the strange young men no longer than necessary . Marcia sat her mule with an impassive face , looking straight between the ears of old Rab , but her side glances were fixed on the soldiers going in and out . They , in turn , looked steadfastly at her . Besides watching the soldiers , Marcia wondered why Jerry Catlin really took her jug . The way he did it showed motive . It annoyed her that she could not fathom him at once as she did Augustus and Polycarp . While this dissatisfaction moved vaguely through her mind she was also listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , and watching out of the extreme tip of her eye a faint blur of figures in the sector of the BeShears residence . Inside the store a voice was laughing . " Hey , Johnny reb , you would n't mind an invasion like this every day , would you ? " Another voice answered for the storekeeper : " This man 's a wise man . They tell me he sold his niggers in the nick o ' time . " " I hope , " said the first voice , " you did n't take shin plastersfor ' em , Mr. BeShears . " " Now I 'll bet he done that very thing , " laughed the second man . Then she heard BeShears grumble , " Do I look like a fool ? " The two questioners cheerfully took up this topic . " What do you say , Bill , does Johnny reb look like a fool ? " And the second speaker suggested , " You stand over there by him and I 'll see . " Loud laughter filled the store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad as Augustus ' jokes . At that moment she was interrupted byp305a girl 's voice calling her name . She turned and saw the plump figure of Ponny BeShears at her gate . Marcia turned her mule and rode toward Ponny , whom she had not seen since the trouble between her father and Mr. BeShears . An inevitable blue soldier was talking to Ponny , and this man now turned and looked with interest at Marcia . He wore a full brown beard and had a rather laughing face with gray eyes . He was not quite so tall as Jerry Catlin but was more compactly built . Marcia thought with a touch of disgust , " It would be just like Ponny to fall head over heels in love with one of ' em . " Ponny herself was calling in her hearty voice , " Marcia , come over and meet Mr. Maldebranch . . . Miss Vaiden , this is Mr. Maldebranch . " " Er  --  I 'm glad to meet you , Miss Vaiden , " said Mr. Maldebranch in a guttural voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ponny began to laugh . " Well , Ponny , " cried Marcia , acutely embarrassed , " what 's funny about me ? " and she tried to look at herself . " Is my face dirty ? " " Miss Vaiden , " said the deep voice of Mr. Maldebranch , " I assure you the petals of the rose are not so pink as your cheeks . " " Hush ! " cried Ponny , hitting Mr. Maldebranch 's arm , and laughing harder . Marcia was disgusted . Ponny would start a strong-arm flirtation with anything that wore trousers , even a Yankee . " Do you know her pretty well ? " asked Mr. Maldebranch , nodding at Ponny . " Quite well , " said Marcia . " Will she get over this ? " " She never has , " disparaged Marcia . At this point Jerry Catlin came up with the jug and tiedp346it to the horn of Marcia 's saddle . The subdued excitement which Marcia had felt in him still hurried him . He moved more quickly , explained in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excused himself , and set off down the road . He had not gone far before he stopped a Yankee cavalryman , swung up behind him , and the two rode off together toward the Lacefield plantation . Mr. Maldebranch watched the two figures on the horse disappear around the turn in the road . " That 's odd , " he commented , " for anybody in the cavalry to give an ordinary soldier a lift . " Here Ponny turned to Marcia . " Who was your beau ? " she asked smiling . " He 's not my beau , " stated Marcia tersely , " he 's a Yankee . " " He got something for you . " " 01 ' Pap ran out of whisky . " " How came that ? " asked Mr. Maldebranch in surprise . Marcia straightened in her saddle . " You ought to know . You and your regiment stole all he had ! " At this Ponny began laughing again . " That 's right , Marcia , give it to him , " she commended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " This irritated Marcia , for Ponny to speak lightly of all the losses her father had borne while her own father profited by the Yankee invasion . " I ca n't condemn them completely , " said Marcia , with the faint smile girls wear when they are saying a nasty thing ; " they do n't seem to steal from everyone alike . " Ponny was not dampened . " Death and the Yankees , " she said , " love a shining mark . " Then Marcia felt ashamed of herself for feeling illnatured toward her friend 's prosperity . The two girls begantalking about what had happened since they had seen eachp307other . Ponny had Marcia tell all about the loss of the Vaiden stock and the burning of the gin . As Marcia related her story she became interested herself and began to enjoy the drama of her own misfortunes . She made the flames flicker in the burning gin , be almost extinguished , grow larger before more water could be brought ; finally she piled up a great suspense and cried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well rope broke , we had no water at all . We could n't do a thing but just stand there and watch the gin burn up ! " Ponny gave a sympathetic scream . " U-ugh  --  I know you nearly had a duck fit ! " Here Mr. Maldebranch excused himself . He said he had to go see a man in the store for a moment . When the Union soldier was gone Marcia 's enthusiasm for telling her adventure fell off completely . Ponny herself stopped listening with such eloquent interest . The two immediatelybegan talking of things that could not be mentionedbefore Mr. Maldebranch . " Did you hear how old Aunt Creasy put out the fire ? " asked Marcia , pulling down her lips . " Yes . . . was n't that awful ? " " Imagine such a thing . . . the soldiers nearly killed themselves laughing . " " I was surprised , " said Ponny , " to hear about Gracie  --  doing what she 's doing . " " Oh , if a girl 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcia philosophically , " she 's sure to end up badly . " " I suppose that 's so . How do you get your hair brushed now ? " " How do you ? " laughed Marcia . " I do it myself , but I 'm used to it , and I have n't got so much . " " Well , " said Marcia , rather pleased that Ponny acknowledgedthat she had the most hair , " I tried to get Aunt Creasy to brush it , but she pulled , then I asked Cassandra would she . She said she had spent years trying to cultivate the inside of my head and had failed , and she had no heart to start on the outside . " Ponny leaned over on the gatepost helpless with laughter . " Marcia , you Vaidens are the funniest family in the world . What you people say about each other is a caution . " Marcia began laughing at the cleverness of her own family . " Are we really unusual ? " she asked , basking modestly in Ponny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , had you heard about ' Drusilla ? " Marcia 's pleasure vanished . " No  --  what about her ? " " She 's in a family way . " Ponny tipped her head to one side with bright-eyed interest . " Oh . . . is she ? " said Marcia , with a complete fall of spirits . " Oh , Marcia ! " ejaculated Ponny , instantly repentant . " I would n't have mentioned it if I 'd thought of Mr. Milt . " " Oh , well . . . that 's all over with , " said Marcia , not thinking about Miltiades . " Really , of all the men I 've known , I believe Mr. Milt comes nearest being . . . what you call it ? " " Ideal , " supplied Marcia . " Yes , more like a hero in a book . Just think  --  after all Drusilla did to him , not a word of reproach . Just went on serving as an officer under Major Crowninshield . I know he still loves her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his country . . . " Tears formed in Ponny 's blue eyes . " What gets me , " said the sister bitterly , " is that he would ever waste himself on a girl like Drusilla Lacefield . " " There is n't any girl good enough for Mr. Milt , Marcia . You know that . A person can find an ideal man once in a while , but there 's no such thing as an ideal girl . " " I suppose that 's true , " agreed Marcia , with a faint touch of annoyance with Ponny . " I know I am far from one . "  |p309These  admissions of the imperfections of their sex was interrupted by an extraordinary disturbance far down the road . It looked like a large undefined mass approaching swiftly and leaving a trail of dust in its wake . Ponny peered through the sunshine , and suddenly ran out and caught Marcia 's bridle : " That 's a company of cavalry  --  is n't that a companyof " The next moment she lifted her voice in a shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's name ? " " ' What man 's name ? " " That man talking to us ! " " Maldebranch ! " prompted Marcia in amazement . The next moment Ponny dashed out of the gate toward the store screaming , " Maldebranch ! Oh , Mr. Maldebranch , the Yankees are coming ! Yonder 's the Yankees ! " This , of course , was sheer insanity . Marcia sat on her mule , staring after her plump friend in the blankest amazement . The distant object had developed into horsemen coming up the road at full speed . When within two hundred yards of the store , the horsemen spread out over a wide front and came storming up like a blue cyclone . Marcia herself became terror struck . She began adding her screams to Ponny 's . Just when it seemed that Mr. Maldebranchwould be trapped in the store , suddenly out of the ( lark little house bolted , not one man , but a whole troop of blue coats . They dashed helter skelter toward their horses . The animals were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there set up a sharp popping of carbines . Splashes of dust flew up about the fugitives from the store . These men leaped at their plunging horses , grabbed them around the necks , and went astride them at a single flying leap . They untied their bridles in a breath , and the next moment were flying up the Florence road , lying flat on their horses ' necks and shooting pistols at the troopers.  | The air around Marcia was suddenly full of a droning as of bees . Marcia 's mule began backing into the BeShears fence . Ponny was flinging up her arms screaming : " They 'll kill him ! They 'll kill him ! " The Federal cavalry was just sweeping up even with the store . Amid the uproar of their carbines , Marcia could barely keep her seat on her plunging mule . She thought she heard Alex BeShears shouting , " Ponny , lay down , you 'll get shot ! " Ponny did n't lie down . She was shrieking : " Is that him , yonder ? Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard . The girl saw a chance and jumped to the ground . The whisky jug struck her leg . She fell down but leaped up on her feet . " Who ! Who , Ponny ? Who is it ? " " Mr. Maldebranch ! " wailed Ponny . The cavalry was past the store now , spread out over the road in full pursuit of the blue coats from the store . Then Marcia saw two of the horses still tied to the sycamores and two men on the ground twenty or thirty yards distant from the horses . One was feebly pulling himself toward the hitchingplace . These were the men Ponny was screaming about . The fat girl went flying down to the spring with a jellylikerun . Marcia dashed out the gate and went after her without understanding a thing of any of it . She drew even with Ponny by the time they reached the wounded man . He was not Mr. Maldebranch . He was a small wizened man with a hole in his blue coat where he had been hit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ponny with clay-colored lips . " Want us to take you in the house ? " asked the fat girl , looking in the direction the flying battle had vanished . " No  --  no  --  he'p me on my boss , " he whispered , " I  --  got to git away ! "  |p311Ponny  was strong . She put her hand under the wounded man 's boot . He clutched the horn of his saddle and the two got him up . " Can you stay on ? " panted the fat girl anxiously . " Reckon so , " gasped the man . He turned his mount toward the Florence road and kicked it feebly into a slow trot . As he did so the blood leaked out a hole in his boot . The girls watched him with drumming hearts . When he reached the Florence road he turned west , toward Waterloo , in the direction opposite the course of the fight . " Ponny , who is he ? " gasped Marcia with shaken nerves . Ponny drew a long breath . " Have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Yankee or  --  or what ? " cried Marcia utterly at sea . " Marcia , you saw him same as me . " " You mean you were helping men to get away you do n't even know ? " Just then Marcia observed that the wounded man was ridinga claybank mare with white stockings on the fore feet . " He was one of the Leatherwood gang ! " gasped Marcia . " Was he ? " said Ponny.  |p312As  MARCIA VAIDEN rode home , the assault of the cavalry on the men in the store tingled along her nerves . She had been frightened and excited by the violence of the action . Her heart still beat in her breast at the danger . She knew now that the fugitives were members of the Leatherwood gang and it annoyed her that she had not guessed it at once . Everything she recalled was informative now : Jerry Catlin 's excitement , the clay-colored horse , the villainous looks of the men in the store and Maldebranch ; she had felt something odd and villainous about Mr. Maldebranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Maldebranch on the arm , and thinking how unmaidenly it was . Subconsciously Marcia listed maidenliness and unmaidenlinessas rival forms of attracting and holding the attention of the opposite sex . But unmaidenliness she held not to be quite fair , it was hitting below the belt . And , what was still worse , Marcia believed it eventually lost in the end . Here she thought of Drusilla Crowninshield who had not lost . She was not very modest and yet Major Crowninshield had loved her and married her . Drusilla could not even understand the major 's moods . She , Marcia , understood him and inspired him with great visions ; he had said so . Yet he had yielded to the warmly molded and not particularly modestflesh of Drusilla and she was burgeoning with another life . A sense of vague , impersonal frustration filled Marcia . Ofp313not many men would she have expected something finer than the simple use of the flesh , but Major Crowninshield was so subtle . He could have formulated in words Marcia'squiver- feeling that the bodies of men and women were but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , but it was only an acolyte in the temple , and not the high priest . . . he could have formulated it in substance , too . Her name hallooed gayly across the hills startled Marcia out of her reverie . She looked up and saw a horseman gallopingtoward her . He wore a blue uniform and waved a blue cap . Three minutes later horse and rider took the fence with the effect of easy , almost languid strength which the leap of a powerful horse always produces . Marcia stared at the rider in amazement . " Well , Mr. Maldebranch ! " she gasped . " So they did n't kill you ? " " Very poor shots , Miss Vaiden , need target practice . " " Awfully kind of you to provide them with a target , " observed Marcia crisply , remembering he was a horse thief . " Oh , it was n't for that , " laughed the horseman in high spirits . " I thought I 'd lead that Yankee beau of yours off on a wild-goose chase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped her mule and straightened as stiffly as the absurd modeling of her side saddle permitted . " You certainly are not going to see me home , Mr. Malde-branch ! " Mr. Maldebranch was amazed . " Now , I like that ! " he cried . " Here I risk my life to rid you of a very dull-witted Yankee beau . I lead him away , lettinghim shoot at the cross in my suspenders , then when I cut across country and provide you with some really lively and amusing compan why you do n't want it . That 's not gratitude , Miss Vaiden . " Marcia remembered once more that the fellow was a horse thief.  | " It may not be gratitude , " she said flatly , " but it 's de-cency . " " Decency ! " cried Maldebranch in a pained voice . " How have I offended the strictest rules ? I was properly introduced to you by a maiden more plump but less fair than yourself " Listen ! " cried Marcia in a temper . " You 're a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it a thousand times worse for you than it does for those poor men who got shot . You 're educated , you should know better . I imagine you think it is very romantic , stealing horses . You talk like you do . But you 're just a plain ordinary horse thief , and I wo n't ride a step with you in any direction ! " Mr. Maldebranch began laughing immoderately . He held to his saddle horn and wiped the tears from his eyes . Like all moralists , Marcia was infuriated that her strictures were not received in ashes and sackcloth . " I hope next time the Yankees see you , " she cried , " they hit you instead of that poor innocent man ! " " Marsh Vaiden ! " cried Maldebranch in an offended tone . At this annoyed and intimate use of her name , Marcia stared at Mr. Maldebranch . The eyes and forehead above the brown beard transformed themselves into lines as familiarto her as the reflection in her own mirror . And the annoyed voice was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard all her life . " Why , Carp Vaiden ! " she screamed . " What in the world ? " and she reached for him from the saddle of old Rab . Polycarp reined his horse over to her . They put their arms about each other , hugged and patted each other on the back . She nearly fell out of her saddle . " Carp ! " she cried incredulously . " What are you doing here ? " " Home on a furlough , " laughed the youth , getting her balanced in the saddle again.  | " Think of that ! But what are you doing running around with a gang of horse thieves ? " " Well , I knew I could n't stay around home in either civilianclothes or in gray . So when I heard of the Leatherwood outfit rigged out in blue , it gave me an idea , and I got a blue suit myself . " " I hope you 're not helping them steal horses so you can wear their color ! " cried Marcia with sisterly frankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not ! " He hesitated a moment and then added , " No , I have n't a thing to do with the moral end of their operations . " " What end have you to do with ? " inquired Marcia at once . Polycarp hesitated , stroked his new and highly stylistic brown beard . " I 'm awfully sorry , Marsh , but I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you . I 'm not at liberty to tell . " Marcia looked at him sharply , instantly guessed somethingand became piqued . " You go to Ponny with it , " she exclaimed reproachfully , " tell her all about it , but me , your sister  --  you 're very sorry you 're not at liberty to tell . " " Well , Marcia ! " cried Polycarp , " I thought you 'd be glad to see me when I got home not killed or wounded or anything . " " I am glad , of course , " said Marcia resentfully , " but it 's silly , you telling Ponny something you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Ponny ? " " From the way she looked  --  giggling like a ninny  --  she knew everything . " " Now , if I had been Miltiades , " complained Polycarp , " and I had told you I had a secret , you 'd ' a ' thought that was grand . You 'd ' a ' ridden home with me admiring me all the more because I was romantic and had a secret of some sort . "  | Marcia could not deny this , or , if she did deny it , it would n't be believed , so she shifted the subject . " Say , Carp , listen , would you believe it ? Augustus is mar-ried ! " " Married ! " Polycarp wrinkled his eyes incredulously . " Who in the world would marry him ? " " A nurse ! " cried Marcia derogatively . " A Rose McClanahanwho nursed him in the hospital . She 's a hundred times older than he is , of course . " " Is he at home ? " " No , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry into some outlandish Western family . " " Now , see here , you ca n't condemn a girl on account of her family . Look at Ponny . " This made Marcia think of the secret again and once more irritated her . " I am looking at Ponny , " she said dryly . " Now , look here , " cried Polycarp , annoyed at last . " You and Cassandra are so uppish about Ponny . She 's better naturedthan both of you put together . And what she says she thinks . " " Why , so do we ! " cried Marcia , offended . " I do n't mean you tell stories , " explained Polycarp , " but you think other things , too . You go picking everything to pieces in your heads , both of you , especially Sister Cassandra , and you ca n't help it , neither one of you . Ponny never does that . " " It 's because she 's dumb ! " cried Marcia with warm cheeks ; " that 's why we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is n't ! " At this point the quarrel was discontinued because they were nearing the house , and the two made it up to continue Polycarp 's disguise as Mr. Maldebranch and see if they could fool somebody . This plan , however , came to nothing because old Mrs. Laura and the hounds recognized the returner at once . Then ,  |p317after  the rejoicing was over , everyone , even down to the last negro , said that they would have known Polycarp . Since everybody would have recognized Polycarp except Marcia , this caused Miss Cassandra to give her sister a little lecture on using her eyes and wits , and not go about half dreaming , unable to recognize her own brother in the middle of the road . The phrase " in the middle of the road " seemed to pick out a very reprehensible place for a sister to fail to recognize a brother . Added to this , the whisky did not please old man Jimmie . In the first place , he was n't sick and did n't need the whisky . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' whisky as a gracious gift , so Marcia might as well lug it back if it was meant for him . In the third place , he 'd order his own whisky when he wanted it . With these reflections he took the jug , started for the kitchen with it , and nodded Polycarp to follow him . Naturally , it was not long before Polycarp 's blue uniform brought forth comment and demanded an explanation to the Vaiden family . The returned soldier repeated what he had said to Marcia . Old man Jimmie objected at once . " That 's no way for a Vaiden to act , " he announced . " The idyah  --  sailin ' under false colors ! I say let a man be what he is ! " . " Yes , Pappy , " put in old Mrs. Laura , " but if he did n't sail under false colors he would n't sail a tall  --  they 'd capturehim . " " Thunderation , Lorry , if he gits captured under false colors , do you know what they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what ! " " Just for wearing one of their ugly old uniforms ! " " Why , of course they will , woman ! " roared the planter . The old mother looked apprehensively at her son , think- ing how she could uphold him against his father . Finally she said : " Well , anyway , Pappy , they 're not so li'ble to run him down and capture him dressed in blue as in gray . He wo n't be so noticeable . " " Of all dad-blamed fools ! " roared the old man . " Lorry , that 's the very thing they 'd shoot him for  --  not being so noticeable . " " Carp , " directed Miss Cassandra in a kind of an aside , " go into the company room , out of Father 's sight . It is n't good for him to be excited . " " Why , that 's not so ! " cried the old man , resenting this accusation of weakness . " Father , I merely said it was n't good for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic on her parent . " I do n't say it 's bad for you , but what good will getting exciteddo you ? " " Uh  --  now , now , that was n't what you meant , Cassandry , that was n't what you meant ! " Cassandra was far too wise to argue with her father . She turned to Carp again . " You do n't have to wear that blue uniform do you , Polycarp ? " " I 'm afraid I do , Cassandra . " " What for ? We can post negroes around the place so no Yankee can slip up on you here in the house . " Polycarp lifted his brow . " I 'll think it over , " he said , and walked on into the companyroom . The moment he did this Marcia instantly knew that Polycarpwas going to tell Cassandra whatever it was that he had to tell . Jealousy and indignation filled her . To think that her brother would tell something to Ponny and Cassandra which he would not tell to her ! Tears stung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , and went out of the house.  |p319In  the yard one of the hounds came up behind her and touched her hand with its wet , sympathetic muzzle . Marcia jerked away and rapped the bony head with her fingers . The dog dodged back and walked off in another direction . The hound itself was one of the foolish younger set of dogs . It had not learned that when a human being came out of the big house wrapped in an aura of tragedy , and also wrapped in skirts , that any proffer of doggish sympathy invitedcatastrophe.  |p320WHAT  THE HOUND could not accomplish , the sunset did . Its smoldering abyss behind the black oaks set forth their hard design with the staccato beauty of a modern etching . The unintentional affront of her brother could not maintain its bitterness against the sad philosophy of the wounded west . Marcia stood leaning against the heavy logs of the big house in that half mood between waning resentment and an evening feeling of loneliness and wistfulness . Above her head a curtain waved out of the small high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicate lace curtains the Yankees had stolen . Well , that made little difference ; the new curtains probably would be taken , too . Anything they had to-day might be gone to-morrow . Indeed , everything they had might very well go . Almost every day came the news of the burning of some house in the neighborhood ; usually homes of the more violent secessionists . In the complete stillness of evening Cassandra 's and Polycarp'svoices became audible through the open window . Marciacould not understand what they were saying but she moved resentfully a little farther away as a moral guaranteeagainst eavesdropping . She moved away four or five steps then stopped and listened intently . She felt within her right to do this because already she had made an effort to avoid overhearing them . To prove to herself that she was not interested in what she heard , she looked at the fence , the barn , the ruins of the gin , until she caught a shocked sen/tence or two from Miss Cassandra , and then these material objects vanished from her attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sent home to observe the Union detachmentcamped at the Lacefield place . He was to learn its strength , keep track of its movements , report the damage it inflicted on the country , and where it finally went . " Why , you 're a regular spy , Polycarp ! " came Cassandra'sstartled comment . " I do n't have to go inside their lines necessarily , " said Polycarp . " I think I might get that information outside . " " . . . wear their uniform . . " . . . a man in the Leatherwood gang takes my reports . . . " " Then listen , " planned Miss Cassandra in a somewhat louder tone . " Whenever you are on the place we must post niggers up and down the road to give warning when the Yankees are coming . " The voices withdrew and became silent . A little later Marciaheard Cassandra calling George in a high curving voice . Marcia walked on out to the fence , oddly moved by the romance of Polycarp 's mission . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What impressed , what almost irritated her was that such a romantic opportunity should be thrown away on such a person as Polycarp . Now , if it had been Miltiades . . . Then she thought of Ponny BeShears once more and becameirritated again . The idea of Ponny BeShears being the sweetheart of a spy ! Big , fat , commonplace Ponny ! Now , if it had been she , Marcia . . . Oh , she could see herself standing on the gallows dying to protect Major Crowninshieldif he were a spy ! She could imagine herself saying , " Shoot ! Shoot me . I will never , never reveal his name ! " The intricate rhythm of two horses trotting up the road stopped Marcia 's imaginary execution , or at least granted her a reprieve . She peered down the road in the direction of the Yankee camp , sharing an apprehension felt by every family in the countryside when they heard horses approachmg . She turned and called in a guarded tone , " Carp , somebody'scoming ! " And from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , all right , but it wo n't amount to anything this time o ' day . " This piqued Marcia , that her very first warning should be set aside as not amounting to much . But there was some truth to it nevertheless . The Yankees were a methodical set . The army had hours to go to bed , to get up , to eat , to drill , to ride forth and steal and burn . If they had been as systematicallyvirtuous as they were systematically devilish , the whole army would have floated up to heaven , as did Elijah . So now she put her apprehension away and looked down the road in simple curiosity . The confused shape of two horses came into view , and presently it developed that a man rode one and led the other . The girl at the fence watched in silence as horses and man changed into dramatic silhouettes against the somber coloring of the west . But instead of clattering past as she had expected , the rider drew up . " Is n't that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girl said yes , in a tone bleak with her musings , then after a moment , with the automatic friendliness of the country , asked where he was going . " Riding up to see old man Candy McPherson  --  takin ' his mare back to him . " This was said so simply that only after a moment 's thought did a shock of surprise pass through the girl . " Taking his mare back ! " she cried . " Yankees taking a person 's mare ! Is that your idyah , Jerry , or did the Yankeessend you with it ? "  | " A little o ' both . When we got the mare Cap'n Sherrill says , Send word to McPherson we 've got his horse , ' and I said I 'd lead her up as I 'd like to get leave to come up this direction anyway . " This last phrase carried an involuntary unction that caused Marcia to disregard it and change the topic . " How did you come to get the horse ? " she asked curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road the direction that wounded man tuk . We found him about a mile and a half from the store . " " Waiting for you ! " ejaculated the girl in surprise . " Why-y , no-o , " drawled Jerry slowly . " He was dead an ' still holding the mare 's reins . We could n't tell whether he got off and laid down in the road or jest fell off . " " Oh ! 0-oh . . . " whispered Marcia . The thought of the wounded horse thief , whom she and Ponny had helped into the saddle , riding on until he toppledoff the claybank and died in the dust . It sickened the girl . The help she had given him changed that horse thief into a human being with a claim on her sympathy ; his tenacityand endurance of agony until death , brought him some measure of her respect . She deserted the point . " It 's queer , " she said slowly , " that the Yankees would burn Mr. Candy 's home and then bring him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Jerry in a detached voice . " You see , Mr. McPherson reported the loss to Colonel Higgenbotham , so if he relied on the army to get his mare back , naturallythe army would turn her over to him when they got her . " " I do n't imagine they would , " remarked Marcia realistically , " if she 'd been anything but an old broken-winded stump sucker . " " That I kai n't tell , " said Jerry , equally philosophic . The silence which fell between the youth and Marcia was not only unconstrained , it was unobserved by the girl . Thep324'things he told her , his voice , his presence on the horse becamepart of the furniture of her thoughts . Presently he said he was going to have to lead Mr. McPherson 's horse home unless someone would ride it . Then he added that the McPherson place was only four farms up the road and that if Marcia rode the horse up there she could ride his horse back as far as her home and he would walk that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very uncertain voice . Marcia hesitated about riding with a Yankee , but she reflected that taking a Southern man 's horse back to him was a very good thing to do ; furthermore , that Jerry Catlin was the least Yankeelike of all the blue coats that she had seen ; and finally , that the evening was a very pleasant time to ride . So she decided she would go . Jerry maneuvered the old claybank up to the fence ; Marciagave a leap and alighted sidewise on the animal 's bare back . She maintained her seat with the security of riding many horses to the barn from the pasture . A moment later the two were trotting up the dim road , with Marcia kicking her heel into the claybank 's ribs to see if she could pace . The McPherson mare was not a gaited animal . She did nothing but jog trot . As Marcia rode her up the highway , the girl talked of a dozen different things , but all the time kept automatically trying to edge the ancient animal into some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muffled clatter of the hoofs in the dust took on that odd quality of being a goal within itself , unrelated to mere transitionfrom one place to another . Presently , with a touch of apprehension , she discovered that Jerry was asking her in a troubled fashion about the man she and Miss BeShears had been talking to at the store . " What about him ? " asked Marcia in an empty , defensive voice . " Is  --  is he a friend of yours or  --  or Miss Ponny 's ? " inquiredthe hillman uncomfortably . " Oh ! " ejaculated Marcia very affably . " Ponny's. "  | " Well , I did n't know , " said Jerry , in obvious relief . " Yes , " said Marcia with detachment , " he 's Ponny 's beau . " " Then , Miss Ponny goes with a Union soldier , too ! " exclaimedJerry in a brighter tone . " M-m . . . yes , Ponny seems to  --  but she 's the only one I know who does . " Mr. Catlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcia , " he said argumentatively , " do you think which side a man happens to be fighting on has much to do with the fellow as a man ? " " A good deal would depend on the man himself , I suppose , and quite a good deal on how he fought . Now , if he came out burning down houses and stealing spoons and curtains . . . " Marcia shook her head . " Nobody who would do that could be much . " Jerry came to a halt in his catechism . He rode some distancein the gathering darkness . Finally he said above the mumble of the hoofs : " Look here , Miss Marcia , I  --  I do n't know what you think of me . I never have stolen a spoon or set fire to anything at all . I would n't do such a thing . " " No-o . . . I do n't believe you would , " agreed Marcia slowly . " And Miss Marcia , I knew you before I ever heard of an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at a picnic . She said you were the prettiest girl she ever saw , and I was wishful of seeing you before there was any war . " He had got the two horses together and now touched the claybank 's unkempt mane with a short riding switch . " And now that I do see you , Miss Marcia , I  --  I wish we could just ride and ride and ride like this forever . " A quiver of pity touched the girl . She looked at the switch caressing the mane of her mount . " Listen , " she said , " I want to tell you something . " " Yes ? " he queried expectantly.  | " The only reason I can ride with you at all , Jerry , is  --  is because you are a Yankee . " He stared blankly toward her in the darkness . " ' Y , Miss Marcia  --  what do you mean by that ? " " I mean I  --  I 'm engaged to a soldier in the Southern army  --  a captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rank was a delicate and deadly thrust which Marcia was too feminineto forego . Jerry took back his switch and allowed the horses to resumetheir usual distance apart . " I might have knowed you be engaged to somebody , " he said in a monotone . " I might have knowed a girl like you would " He broke off just at a point where Marcia would have given a good deal to hear the rest of his sentence . A kind of emptiness arose in Marcia , as if something warm and comforting had been withdrawn from her . She rode along thinking of young A. Gray , her Southern captain . He came to her with the vague poetry of resignation . It was the first time he had crossed her mind in weeks . When the two reached Candy McPherson 's plantation , Jerry meant to stay there only long enough to restore the claybank to its owner . They rode up to the gate and saw two stone chimneys and a blackened area where the McPhersonhome had been burned . Then Marcia remembered again that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family are living ? " she asked , with her sympathy for the soldier gone from her voice . " In one of the nigger cabins , I imagine . " They sat on their horses listening , and presently heard the rise and fall of a negro 's voice in some interminable speech . Jerry drew in a breath and called , " Mr. McPherson ! Oh , Mr. Candy McPherson ! "  |p327The  shout stopped the speech , then a negro 's voice answered , " Who is dat wants to see Mas ' Candy ? " " Jerry Catlin ! " " Who is Mist ' Jerry Catlin ? " " Private in the Union army ! " A low consultation sprang up at this , then a negro 's cottonyvoice inquired : " Which section ob de McPherson fambly does you desiah to interrogate ? " Jerry and Marcia looked at each other and laughed . " How many sections has the McPherson family ? " inquiredJerry . " Well , Mist ' sojer , " said the slave philosophically , " sence you-all bu'nt Mas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sections : one fuh de gu'ls , one fuh de boys , one fuh de of folks , an ' one fuh de niggahs . " Evidently part of the McPherson slave quarters had been taken over by the whites . This dialogue with the black man probably would have continued indefinitely , going into more and more detail and arriving nowhere , but the voice of the master himself called out in the darkness : " Here is Candy McPherson in the fourth hut on the right . What do you want , suh ? " The " sir " in this sentence held no courtesy at all but insteadthe pungent disrespect that a Southerner can inject into the word . " I 've brought back your mare , " said Jerry flatly . " Brought back my mare ! " ejaculated the planter in the utmost astonishment . " We captured her to-day from the Leatherwood gang , " explained Jerry briefly . " Captain Sherrill returns her with his compliments . " " Extend my compliments to Captain Sherrill , " called back the planter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old adage that there is honor among thieves . And you may turn the mare over to the niggers , Private Catlin , unless you decide to keep her yourself . Good-night ! " and the door of the fourth cabin on the right slammed shut . " Well , my goodness , " said Jerry , " that 's no way to act ! " " I imagine living in nigger quarters puts him out of temper , " said Marcia soberly . In view of old man Candy 's insult , she herself felt condemnedfor riding with a Yankee . " If you 'll exchange horses with me , " said Jerry in a disappointedtone , " we 'll go back . . . . I 'd thought he 'd be glad to get his mare again . " " Well , she is n't much of a nag , " said Marcia , sliding to the ground before her companion could help her . She was sorry she had come . Marcia 's jump to the ground undoubtedly was another disappointment to Mr. Catlin . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses . To Marcia the momentary intimacy she had felt for Jerry during his tacit avowal of love a few minutes past had quite vanished . He simply was another Yankee , one of the detachmentsent down to lay waste her country . She moved along very disgusted with herself . Old man Candy 's insult unintentionallyhad hit her . As the two led the horses down the dark row of cabins the voice of the negro orator once more rose and fell with the hortative cadence of his race . " Oh , my chillun , " he was saying , " de Lawd ai n't gwinter be mawked . You may think you is mawkin ' de Lawd , but you ai n't . You cheat Him when you think His eyes is shet , but His lef ' han ' will strack you down when you ai n't speck ' - in ' hit . " So takes you-all wa'nin ' f'um Mas ' Alex BeShears . He sol ' his niggahs away f'um they home . He sol " Lumbus away f'um he wife , he sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now his money is gone an ' his feet ah bu'ned an ' he kai n't walk . Yes , Lawd , he 's struck down in he strength an '  |p329now  he 's in a wuss fix dan de po ' niggahs he went an ' sol ' south fuh his money ! " At this period the voices of all the negroes arose chanting : " Roll on , Jurdan , roll ! Oh , roll on , Jurdan , roll ! Oh , I lif ' my soul to de th'one uv God . Roll on , Jurdan , roll ! "  |p330ON  THE FOLLOWING DAY the shocked gossip of the neighborhood supplied the details of Lump Mowbray 's apocalypticaccount of the horror at BeShears Crossroads . It was , briefly , that the Leatherwood gang had seized the merchant and burned his feet over a slow fire until he told them where his money was buried . Out of this , the negroes , very naturally , had evoked a wrathful God avenging the sale of Solomon and Calline . Old Mrs. Vaiden was inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vaiden property . But this irritated old man Jimmie so sharply that his old wife was forced to quit talking about her theory . Marcia and Miss Cassandra were not interested in the theological aspect of the BeShears torture and robbery . The question the woman and the girl kept silently asking themselveswas , " Where was Polycarp on the night of the rob-bery ? " Marcia had thought he was at home . She had returned from the McPherson place with this questioning assertion in her mind , but when she reached home her brother was not there . From that night her uneasiness about Polycarp grew more and more disturbing . The suspicion kept moving under the surface of her mind : " What if Polycarp had . . . " and then she would press it down , shove it back somewhere out of her mental foreground . But it would leave the girl with ap331tremulous feeling , as if some terrible thing , like an enraged bull , had charged her . Instead of assuming , as she always had done , that her younger brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts . She refused to believe that he would burn an old man 's feet over a slow fire for his money . When she was with Polycarp she would study his bold , rather handsome bearded face , thinking how honest and straightforward he appeared . And two or three times she had drawn in her breath to ask : " Carp , did you help burn Alex BeShears ? " She knew he would have to say no , but she was afraid his face would say yes . Suppose such a truth were writ before her eyes ? So , for the first time in her life , torn by her suspicion and her silent passionate defense , Marcia began to love her brother Polycarp . It was quite a different sort of love from the adoration she accorded Miltiades . It was an anxiety that made her realize for the first time how isolated she was from her younger brother . She could not mention to him a word about the robbery , she could speak of Ponny only in jest except when she was angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Major Crowninshield was beyond the power of her imagination . Indeed , every moment of her life that ever had really moved her was something quite incommunicable to any other member of her family . This seemed a melancholy thing to Marcia . It was like living unseeing and unseen in a house of ghosts . That Jerry Catlin had anything to do with her realization of her spiritual aloneness , Marcia was unaware . She thought of him often , but that , she supposed , was because she saw him often . She had seen him twice since the evening of the ride . Once Jerry had come to her father and told him that he believed if old man Jimmie would apply for the mule and horse the Yankees had confiscated , he could get them back . Whereupon the ex-blacksmith had burst forth : " Confiscated ! Confiscated , you thieving copperhead ! You and your accomplices stole my stock and you know it ! BeforeI 'd call it confiscated I 'd see every damned blue coat frying on the grids of hell ! " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmie that Augustus had stayed all night at the Catlin home just before he enlisted in the Confederate army , and he thought perhaps old Mrs. Vaiden would like to hear about her son . At this the old man must have divined the drift of matters , for he answered with dignity : " Mr. Catlin , never in my life have I turned from my door a human bein ' , rich or pore , who comes in frien'ship an ' honor . " Old man Jimmie paused , drew a long breath , fixed Jerry with his red-rimmed splenetic blue eyes , and continued . " But when a man comes to my home one day as a firebug , thief , and robber , and the next day askin ' social equality , I regret that I 've got to tell him in so many words what he is and where he Stan 's . " This was probably the most controlled speech the exblacksmithever uttered . The tender-hearted Mrs. Laura remonstratedwith him afterwards for being unforgiving to the boy . The old man replied : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times seventy like the Bible says , but by the gray goats , I do n't see any Scripture for colluging with a damn scoundrel after you have once forgive him and got shed of him ! " To Marcia her father 's spleen at Jerry seemed somehow anomalous . He seemed to have nothing to do with the Yankeeinvasion beyond wearing their uniform . Cassandra said Marcia should never have ridden over to McPhersons ' with the Yankee ; she might have known he 'd come hanging around afterwards . Marcia laughed and said she did n't see that his hangingp333around hurt anything , he got sent away in so many differentdirections . " You 'd let him come in if it was n't for Father , " accused Cassandra . " Me ! " cried Marcia , astonished . She did n't think she would . " Yes , me , " Miss Cassandra mimicked her sister 's bad grammar . " You 're like that fat Ponny BeShears  --  go with anything that wears trousers ! " Marcia felt hurt to be compared to Ponny . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed faintly amused . He was eating the hind leg of a rabbit , biting the meat from around the bone with his strong white teeth . He seemed to be enjoying the rabbit and amused at his older sister . " Jerry Catlin is really no more of a Yankee than Gillie Dilliehay , " defended Marcia . " I never heard of Gillie Dilliehay , " said Miss Cassandra , in a tone that suggested that she did not want to hear of him . " He 's a boy who went with Augustus to join the Confederates . After he had been with ' em awhile he decided he 'd rather belong to the Union army , so he changed . " The whole table stopped eating to stare at Marcia . " Deserted ! " ejaculated Miss Cassandra . " You do n't mean to say one of this gang of Yankees is a deserter from the Confederate army ? " propounded Polycarpwith sudden gravity . Suddenly Marcia remembered that her brother was a spy . She became afraid she had let slip something that would hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent he was . " Well , now , he did n't know which side he wanted to fight on . He lived back up there in the Tennessee hills where the people are divided . He and Jerry talked about which side to join . Gillie decided on the Confederate because his pappy owned a nigger. "  | " What in the thunderation did he change for ? " stormed old man Jimmie . Marcia flushed as if she were defending herself . " He said just one nigger was n't worth going hungry for . " " Marcia Vaiden , " cried Miss Cassandra , " of all mercenaryreasons ! " " They 're his , not mine ! " cried Marcia , more embarrassed than ever . " What 's a nigger got to do with it anyway ? " demanded Miss Cassandra . " It 's the principle of the thing , right or wrong " " Cassie , " roared old man Jimmie , " you 're as big a fool as Marsh . It 's obeying the will of God foreordained from beforethe foundations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Marcia . " How did I get into this ? I 'm not defending the Yankees ! I hate ' cm ! I hate ' em with all my heart . I wish they were all dead and in their graves ! " Suddenly Marcia began weeping . She got up from the table , leaving her piece of rabbit on her plate , and hurried out into the open passageway between the kitchen and diningroom . The group at the table looked blankly at each other . " Of all things ! What 's the matter with Marsh ? " puzzled Polycarp . " She 's not well , " said Mrs. Laura patiently . " A cry wo n't hurt her . " In the passageway outside Marcia 's tears subsided as quickly as they had arisen . She stood as surprised and disgustedat herself as she was at her family in the dining room . She did not understand how she had been maneuvered into defending Gillie Dilliehay , whom she loathed . What did she care if he deserted a hundred times ? She knew why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family had berated her for knowing.  | " The less a person knows in a family like mine , " thought Marcia bitterly , " the better off she is ! " She thought how her father was continually harassed , flinging out fools and idiots on every hand because no one ever agreed with him ; how her mother went her way silently and was never understood . Presently she stood looking across the plum thicket at the fields beyond , her thoughts quite empty of anything except the gray unhappiness that filled her body and mind . Presently her eyes followed a movement behind the rail fence that divided the field from the road . The thing darted into view and out again behind the blackberry briers in the fence corners . Then she saw it was Negro George running toward the big house . She became interested , stepped off the passageway and walked toward the fence to meet him . George , she discovered when she reached him , was hurryingin from sentry duty to report that some Yankees were coming . The arrival of a squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's excitement . Marcia inquired their number , thinking there must be a whole company on the road . " Ai n't but one , " panted George , widening the white eyes in his dark face . " He come snoopin ' up all by hisse'f . I look at him . I say to muhse'f , Pat man lookin ' fuh a niggah posted roun ' de big house . . . dat man ketch me he comb de kinks out'n my haid ! ' " " So that was why you ran so hard ? " " My ' spicion did n't hol ' me back none . " A sudden , rather surprising notion came to Marcia . " What sort of a man was he ? " she asked intently . " He  --  he a great big man , " stressed George nervously . " He could double me up wid one han ' an ' set on me . " Marcia 's flair died down at such a heroic description . " You go on in and tell Carp some Yankees are coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and see who it is. "  | " Yes 'm , " nodded George . " H-he come lookin ' dis way an ' dat cross de cow pasture . I say to muhse'f , Pat man see a niggah posted agin ' him , he leave jess a greasy spot whah I stood . ' " " You ought n't to be afraid , " counseled Marcia . " No 'm , I ai n't now . " Marcia let herself out the big gate and hurried down the road toward the pasture with an odd feeling of relief from some undefined distress . However , when she saw , standing in the lane , the man she had expected to see her relief vanished . In its place came that sense of strangeness and disillusion which the actual sight of an acquaintance whom one has once met and enjoyedalways brings . She paused , thinking with a touch of irony toward herself , " Why should I hurry down like this to talk to Jerry Catlin ? What has he done for me except to get me almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her quick welcoming steps and looked across the pasture as if seeking some animal , then turned back . Jerry Catlin came striding up the lane after her with nothing but a hillman 's sense of dignity keeping him from running . " Miss Marcia ! Oh , Miss Marcia ! " he called in a subdued voice . Marcia looked around . " Why , what are you doing here , Mr. Catlin ? " she asked , widening her eyes . " There was a nigger down here , " explained the soldier , conveying a sense of hurry and disturbance , " I wanted to send word by him for you to come down here , but he ran off before I could get to him . " " Good gracious ! " ejaculated Marcia with the utmost sincerity . " You were fortunate in that . I certainly would n't have come if you 'd sent word you were down here . " " Why , Miss Marcia , why could n't you ? " pleaded the sol/dier in a distressed voice . " You know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arranged to get Mr. Vaiden 's horse back but he did n't want it , then I thought he would like to hear about Augustus . " Jerry came to a pause . " Well , " said Marcia soberly , " I 'm here now . " " Yes , you are , " said Jerry hopelessly . " I 've been thinking about you ever since you rode with me the other night . But you do n't like me much . " " I 've thought about you once or twice , " admitted Marcia . " You have ! Well . . . but Miss Marcia , your family ca n't stand me . I ca n't even get to see you except by accident like this . " For some strange reason , Jerry Catlin 's privations took away Marcia 's own unhappiness . She felt a sense of comfort , poise , and well being . " Listen , Jerry , " she said , feeling very kindly toward the big unhappy fellow , " it 's just as well that everything is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Really better , I suppose , " she added in a musing tone . " I do n't see how that can be , Miss Marcia , when a fellow has thought about a girl before he ever saw her . . . just thought and thought about her , day and night . I certainly do n't see how that can be . " " Because , even if you were n't a Yankee , and my family liked you , and I was n't engaged to Captain Gray , still we  --  we could n't " Marcia hesitated at the word because her thoughts really had run on in advance of the situation . " You mean we could n't . . . marry ? " queried Jerry in an exalted sotto voce . The girl colored . " Well  --  yes  --  that was what I meant . We could n't . " " But why , Miss Marcia ? " he asked , having hypothetically climbed over all these obstacles and still not being allowed to marry his goddess . Marcia drew a breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because  --  because I think you  --  you really love me , " she said in an uncertain voice . " But Miss Marcia , " cried Jerry , " that 's a reason for ! " " No  --  not in this case , " said Marcia sadly . " You see , Jerry I  --  I love somebody else the same way you do me , only  --  only more so , I 'm afraid . " Jerry drew closer . " Do you , Miss Marcia ? " he asked in a stricken tone . Marcia nodded with a feeling of profound relief that shehad touched this thing that lay in the bottom of her heart . " Do you love the captain like that ? " asked Jerry reverently . " No , " said Marcia in a gray tone . " This man  --  married somebody else . I  --  I know I ought to quit thinking about him at all  --  he 's a married man " Marcia pressed her lips together to keep them from trembling . Jerry 's heart seemed to melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Marcia , cry if you want to , " he begged , touching her shoulder . Marcia did not cry but presently she was leaning against him , with his long arms loosely circled about her . Even while she was enjoying the massive comfort of his embrace she was mentally adjudicating the propriety of the situation . What she permitted seemed to be within the bounds of a confidant . If Jerry went beyond the bounds of some undefineddead line this lenten indulgence would be gently called off . Both of them knew this , and Jerry was just as gingerly uneasy about undue familiarity as was Marcia herself . " I do n't see why you could n't marry me just as easy as you could Captain Lacefield , " Jerry was saying in the midst of this probational adjustment . " Because I think if a person really loves you , you should really love them in return , " explained Marcia . " I think love is the most sacred thing in the world . I would n't give a per/son who really loved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  would you ? " " Oh , no ! " cried Jerry . Her speech was a little like religion to the youth . He did n't quite understand it , but it seemed all the more sacred and beautiful on that account . " What do you think of love ? " asked Marcia amid a great contented sadness for Major Crowninshield . " Well , " said Jerry thoughtfully , " I  --  I do n't think so much about love as I do about girls . " " Other girls besides me ? " asked Marcia , lifting wide gray eyes with a trace of old man Jimmie Vaiden 's intolerance . " Oh , no , not since Sister Elvira told me about you , " assuredJerry at once . " Well , " agreed Marcia , relaxing gently again , " you 're a nice boy , Jerry . I hope some day you 'll find a girl who loves you as deeply as you do her . I do really . " She stroked the back of his hand with her silken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , and behind her words lay the profound feminine belief that he could never love another woman as he loved her ; that on her altar must forever burn the candles of his devotion . Presently she found he was preparing to go . She asked why he was in such a hurry . He said it was nearly night . " Well , I declare it is ! " she murmured , looking at the yellowingafternoon . The man held her faintly closer . " Will you . . . kiss me good-bye , Marcia ? " he asked without hope . " Why , Jerry , you know I wo n't . " She stepped gently but decidedly out of his arms . He had gone over the line at last , as both had known he sooner or later must . If her family found this out , Marcia knew she was in for a wigging . When he was gone the girl stood where he had left her and continued to think about her family . What a shindy they would kick up for her talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuppence about him . Jerry was simply an agreeable person with whom to pass a few minutes of odd time . She remained in the lane looking in the direction Jerry had gone , filled with a purring comfort.  |p341MARCIA  TURNED toward home with a pleasant premonitionof possibly other accidental meetings with Jerry Catlin , when she observed a woman standing in the big road at the mouth of the pasture lane . A slight disconcert went through the girl at having been seen talking to a Yankee soldier ; then she recognized who the woman was and stopped in amazement . " Why  --  Gracie ! " she ejaculated , almost unable to believe her eyes . The quarter-bred girl whirled , caught up her skirts with a white woman 's movement when about to run . " What in the world are you doing here ? " asked Marcia . " I  --  I came back  --  just to look at the place , little missy , " stammered Gracie . , The quadroon stood questioning Marcia with dramatic black eyes , asking what she was going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her go ? " You . . . were n't going on up to the big house ? " inquiredMarcia delicately . " I  --  I had n't intended to , " said Gracie nervously . " Well , " said Marcia , disposing of the point of compulsion , " I imagine Mammy and Aunt Creasy and the rest of ' em would be glad to see you . " " I 'd be glad to see them , too , but I  --  I 'm afraid I have n't got time to . . . " Her verbal excuse gave out completely and she simply stood looking at Marcia with sad , grateful eyes for her implied promise of safety.  |p342By  this time the dress Gracie wore drew the white girl 's attention . It was a silk dress made over in such well-tailored lines that Marcia had not observed its costliness or the fact that Gracie was much further advanced toward motherhood . For the quadroon to have such a dress at all reiterated what Marcia already knew about Gracie 's mode of life . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical conditionhad made her drab calling impossible . So here she stood in her finery at the end of the pasture lane . Marcia did not feel the repulsion toward Gracie which she would have felt toward a white prostitute , because Gracie'smode of life was not so much sinful as inevitable . So now she stood speculating about Gracie with a sort of detachment , wondering how such a life was possible ; how a girl as sensitive as Gracie could go on with it  --  but , of course , she was a negro . " Where are you going , Gracie ? " she asked , not unkindly , with a suspicion that the girl had hoped to hide in the slave quarters and let the other negroes feed her . " Why , back to camp , little missy , " said the quadroon , somewhat surprised in her turn . " Will they . . . they . . . er . . . you in that condition ? " ejaculated Marcia incoherently . Gracie flushed and said in a low tone , " Lieutenant Beekmansaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . . . you 'll be with him afterwards ? " Gracie moistened her carmine lips and said nothing . " But Gracie , " speculated the white girl , disturbed , " Solomon'schild . . . it will be so dark . . . he wo n't have itaround . " An odd expression came over Gracie 's face . " It may not be so dark . " " But  --  you were in a condition before  --  you left home ? " " Oh , I suppose it will be dark , too , " said Gracie hastily . Marcia stared at her with an intake of breath . " Why , no , " she gasped , " you  --  you know it won't -- Oh !  |p343Oh  ! " She caught her breath as if at a pang of some strange far-away pain . " Why , little missy ! " cried Gracie , deeply disturbed . " You know it 'll be black , little missy , of  --  of course it 'll be black . " She stood gazing with tears of frustration in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life protecting and caressing and serving and loving . Now , at this last moment , to have given her a thread of a clew that her brother had ravished her . Marcia moved to the fence , leaned against it , and became as colorless as cotton . " Why  --  did you come here at all ? " she whispered . " Little missy , " trembled the quadroon , " I  --  wanted tolook at the big house and the cabins and the barn again . I'mgoing away . Lieutenant Beekman said I was going away . " Marcia pulled herself together . " Where to ? " " Lieutenant Beekman said up in Tennessee , little missy . Savannah , I think he said . " " Just you . . . and him ? " " Oh , no , everybody 's going  --  they 're striking camp now . " Marcia straightened . " You mean the  --  the whole army ? " she asked incredulously . " Yes 'm ; everybody ; they got orders to march to Savannah . " " Are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . " Why , I do n't know , little missy . " " Oh , they are , I know they are ! Oh ! Oh , Gracie ! " Gracie stared at this amazing turn . " Are you sick , little missy ? " she cried , terrified . " Must I take you to the big house ? " " Oh , no . Go  --  please go away ! " The quadroon turned , not knowing why , and went hurryingback down the rutty road toward the camp . Marciap344moved with a sick feeling up the big road toward her home . The rutty clay beneath her feet seemed to sway . She plodded onward , seeing nothing at all . That was why he had come : he was going away to-morrow to a battle . That was why he had waited for her in the pasture  --  whyhe had comforted her  --  why he had asked her to kiss him a last good-bye . As Marcia entered the hallway of the big house Miss Cassandra called out to her to ask what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know better , " contradicted the older woman . " Where have you been and what 's happened to you ? " Marcia tried to turn her weeping thoughts about and think of some truthful thing she could use to deceive her sister . She drew a long breath . " I  --  I 've just been talking to  --  to Gracie , " she said . " Where in the world did you see her ? " " Down at the pasture . " " What were you doing down there ? " " George said he saw a Yankee trying to spy on Polycarp and I wanted to see . " Marcia expected Cassandra to follow this Yankee clue and catch her , but Gracie was the more interesting topic . " What in the world was she doing down there ? " " She had come to say good-bye , " said Marcia with anotherlong breath . " Who was she going to say good-bye to ? " " Well . . . nobody , I suppose . She had just come to look good-bye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to cry , " said Miss Cassandra , half in sympathy and half in contempt . " You 're too soft , Marcia . You look at things too person-ally . " " I always think , Suppose it was me , " said Marcia sadly . " I , " corrected Miss Cassandra . " And that 's where youmake your mistake , " she went on with the argument . " YouP345ought to know a nigger girl has n't got the fine feelings of a white girl . You put too much in their place . You put more than is there . " " She was about to cry , " said Marcia . " Of course , niggers are emotional , but it does n't last , they have n't got any bottom . " " No-o , " agreed Marcia with a long sigh , " I suppose that 's true . " This agreement brought this strand of their talk to an end . After a pause Miss Cassandra 's sense of logic took her back to the original cord . " If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She is  --  to Savannah . " " What for ? " " Well , you know that  --  that fellow she 's living with . He 's going . " " Thought he belonged to the Yankee army . " " He does . " " Is he going to quit the army ? " " No , the army 's going too . " Miss Cassandra came to another blank pause ; her mouth dropped open . She drew a sharp breath . " Do you mean the regiment ? The regiment is going to leave Alabama ?  --  they are going to Savannah ? " Marcia looked in surprise at her sister 's agitation . A fantastic notion flitted through her head that somebody in the Yankee army admired Miss Cassandra , but immediately this explanation vanished as impossible . " Why , yes , but  --  what if they are ? " asked Marcia blankly . Miss Cassandra suddenly began planning . " Listen , " she said tensely , " Polycarp must know this . " " Polycarp ! " " Yes  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ejaculated Marcia .   " One of the Leatherwood gang . " Miss Cassandra stood thinking intently for a moment . " Run get George , Marcia , and bring him to me ! " A glimmer of dramatic understanding flickered through Marcia . She turned and ran toward the negro cabins , callingGeorge as she went . As she crossed the back yard , old Mrs. Vaiden hallooed from the kitchen to know what she wanted with George . " Cassandra wants him , " said Marcia in as commonplace a voice as she could muster . " You fin ' George in he cabin , " prompted old Aunt Creasy . Marcia ran on , and sure enough George was in the second cabin , asleep after an all-night sentry duty guarding his master . Marcia awoke him and took him to Cassandra . In the meantime Cassandra had written two notes ; one she gave to George and directed him to go to the still house over near the Ham plantation , and if he found either Polycarpor Red Kilgo , to deliver the note , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure and not let anyone else see it , " cautioned Miss Cassandra . " H you get in a tight place , chew it up and swallow it . " " Lawzee ! " ejaculated George . He took the extraordinary note , put it in his rag of a hat , and set forth to whatever end he might come . The older sister sat at her table , holding the second note and regarding the girl with a grave face . " Marcia , " she said in a low tone , " I 'm thinking of sending you with a note down to Ponny BeShears . " " You mean for Polycarp ? " " Yes , certainly . And there may be a little danger  --  quite a considerable danger  --  attached to it . " " I see , " nodded the girl . " But it will help  --  our country and our armies , " explained Miss Cassandra in a lowered tone . " The question is , are you willing to run a risk to do this ? "  |p347A  sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know I will ! " she cried . " I 'll do anything  --  anything in the world to help the South . " And back of Marcia 's fervor stood Major Crowninshield . It seemed to Marcia if anything should happen to her and Major Crowninshield hear of it , then he would realize . . . She did not frame her thoughts into words , but she could imagine the man she loved and A-hat he would think when he found out that she , too , was a heroine . As Marcia set out for BeShears Crossroads the sense of possible danger screwed up her nerves to that equivocal line between downright apprehension and a sort of pleasurable brilliance of attention . Her brain danced about thinking up reasons for calling for Mr. Maldebranch . Half a dozen came so quickly that she was afraid in the pinch of action she would forget them all . Under her stimulation , she forgot all about Jerry Catlin . As she rode along in the deepening dusk the sepulchral note of an owl reminded her of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army . Now here was she being netted in the vast conflict . A faint brightening of the sky far away to the west , in the direction of Waterloo , caught her attention . She wondered , with a throb of hatred toward the Yankees , whose house they were burning now . Eliza Ham lived in that direction ; so did the Treadwells and the Binghams . She studied the illumination , trying to place it in the dark vacuity of the night . Two dim gleams down the road apprised Marcia that she was nearing the store and residence at the Crossroads . Marcia rode old Rab up to the BeShears gate , tossed her reins over the post , slipped off onto the fence , and thence to the ground . As she did so a faint start went through her at the guarded click of the BeShears door being opened . After a moment someone came hurrying down the path toward her.  | Then the plump form of Ponny BeShears developed against the darkness and came to a stand , staring quite blankly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you doing here by yourself at this time o ' night ? " The two girls embraced and kissed automatically . " Listen , Ponny  --  do you know where Carp is ? " whispered Marcia . " Why , no , I do n't , Marcia , " replied Ponny quickly . The way she said it told Marcia that she did know , for Ponny was no stickler for those half truths that formed the basis of Marcia 's deceptions . Marcia hardly knew how to proceed . A thought flashed through her that Ponny might be inclined toward the Yankee cause . " Listen , Ponny , " said the girl earnestly . " I 've got to find Polycarp ! " " What for ? " " Why-y  --  I want to  --  tell him good-bye . " Ponny 's face took on a different expression . " Oh , then  --  you know ? " " Know what ? " Ponny hesitated . The trouble was , both girls had secrets to keep from each other . " Why  --  where he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , " I was expecting him here . When I heard you stop at the gate I thought it was him and ran out . " Marcia recalled the blobby feel of Ponny during their brief embrace and wondered how her brother could like that . " Listen , Ponny , I do n't know where he is , " persuaded Marcia desperately , " and I have something I just must give Polycarp . " " Marcia , if I knew . . . " lied Ponny earnestly . " Listen , " begged the sister , swallowing her anger , at Ponny , " even if you do n't know , could you give me some idyah about where he usually is ? I  --  do n't want to go around inquiring for him . "  |p349She  could have choked Ponny for keeping back her information . Ponny was instinctively good natured . She was torn betweenimpulses to keep Polycarp 's secret and to reveal it to Marcia . She pressed her friend 's finger . " Listen , Marcia , why  --  why do n't you inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kai n't tell you ! " " You 've got to ! You 've got to , Ponny BeShears ! " " Well then , " trembled Ponny , at the end of her resistance , " w-why do n't you go  --  down to the Lacefield place and  --  ask Mr. Lacefield ? " " Does he know ? " " I do n't know , " said Ponny , resolving to lock her stable , now that the horse was gone . " Well , all right  --  I 'll ride down . " As Marcia agreed to this , the door of the residence opened again and a slow thumping sounded on the narrow porch . Marcia turned in astonishment and saw a dim heavy figure on crutches leaning and swinging and clumping across the porch onto the graveled path toward the gate . She whirled to Ponny in amazement . " Who is that , Ponny ? " Ponny did not glance at the approaching figure . " Pappy , " she said in a sad tone . " You do n't mean --  " Marcia gasped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crutches but it had not impressed her . Now , to see him swinging along through the darkness was inexpressibly shocking . " Talk ! Talk ! " whispered Ponny urgently . " He gits mad if you watch him ! " " As I was saying , " began Marcia hurriedly , " he  --  heaskedme to kiss him , but I " " Why did n't you ? " rushed Ponny . " I  --  wanted to go to Florence and get a new dress -- Marcia bit off the talk about dresses , wondering what in the world made her say that.  |  The appalling clumping paused at the gate beside them and the incoherent conversation stopped . The cripple peered through the night . " Who is that you 're a-talking to , Ponny ? " he asked in a heavy voice . " It 's Marcia , Pappy , " stammered the daughter . " A Vaiden ! " ejaculated the storekeeper in a harder voice . " A Vaiden come to look at me , has she ? " " Why , Mr. BeShears ! " gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get well soon . " " Get well ! Get well when your feet air gone ! You hypocritical " He unlatched the gate with difficulty andswung his heavy body through . He closed it and stood for a moment , panting from his exertion . " What air you doing here anyway , Marsh Vaiden ? " he burst out with an increase of anger . " Ai n't it enough to beat me out o ' my account an ' burn my feet an ' steal my money --  " Pappy ! " cried Ponny outraged . " You know Marcia did n't have a thing to do " " Listen , Ponny , " stammered Marcia , utterly confused by this attack , " I must go down to the Lacefields ' . . . " " Do n't go on my account , " snarled the merchant ; " talk here with Ponny all you want to . She loves the Vaidens . She 's a Vaiden worshiper ! " The crippled man spat , turned painfully , and went clumping and swinging in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Marcia , " she plead , " do n't hold that against me . I ca n't he'p it  --  he 's wild about being robbed . " " What does he keep saying Vaiden , Vaiden ' for like that ? " asked Marcia with a painful recurrence of her own suspicions . " Why-y , I do n't know , " stammered Ponny . " He  --  just does n't like your family . " Marcia pressed Ponny 's hand with a question on the verge of utterance : " Ponny , does he think Polycarp . . . " P351It was like plunging into a cold , bottomless pool . The sister could not utter it  --  and then , of course , he did think it . The fat girl kept on soothingly and apologetically : " He 'll never get over it . I do n't mean his feet  --  of course they wo n't . I mean the way he hates the Leatherwood gang . He told me he wished he could put all those men in a furnace and  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such horrible things to them ! " Marcia felt sick . In her thoughts she cried out : " Oh , do you think Polycarp helped burn him ? Do you think it , Ponny ? " She asked these question with such silent concentration that Ponny looked at her oddly . " What 's the matter ? You  --  you 're not mad at me , are you , Marcia ? " " Oh , Ponny , you know I 'm not . Ol- , I feel so terrible ! Hold old Rab close to the fence so I can climb on . " " Listen , Marcia , " advised Ponny earnestly , " if you feelas bad as that do n't go down to the Lacefields ' . " " Why ? " " It 's a sign . " Marcia hesitated . " I  --  I do n't believe in signs , " she answered weakly . She said this because her sister Cassandra would have saidit , but Marcia did believe in signs . A portent filled her withfear as she uttered it . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in them , maybe nothing will happen to you . Oh , I hope not ! " Suddenly she put her arms around Marcia , hugged the girl to her heavy bosom , kissing her lips . " If you do see Polycarp , " she sobbed , " tell him , I  --  tell him I love him . Tell him I love him with every drop of my blood  --  no matter  --  no matter what " And so Marcia 's wordless question was answered without words . P352So PONNY thought Polycarp was implicated in the attack upon her father , or at least she was not sure that he was not . And old man Alex BeShears was so bitter and revengeful . . . as he had a right to be . Marcia 's sense of justice agreed to that . And yet he had brought it all down on his own head . What calamities had followed in the wake of Alex BeShears ' money hunger . He had tried to foreclose and had caused Gracie to be beaten and driven away from home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold his negroes and buried his money and invited torture and robbery on himself , and , as far as Marcia knew , he had turned her brother into an outlaw . No human wisdom could have foreseen such consequences . And it came to Marcia , as she rode along toward the Lacefieldmanor , that love and kindness and generosity were a sort of ready-made foresight , a kind of simple wisdom which anyone might use if only he had the heart to do so . This idea came to the girl with the newness of a revelation . Not once in all the religious arguments that had frothed in her home had she ever heard such a notion advanced . It lighted up her thoughts on this war-filled night with a kind of beauty as she rode on toward the Yankee encampment . An illumination glowing on the horizon in the direction she was traveling drew Marcia 's attention . The girl gazed ahead , kicked the patient ribs of her mule and urged the animal into a stiff trot . As she drew nearer along the softp353dark road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in red against the blackness of the night . A stab of apprehension went through Marcia 's heart . She saw the manor was burning . She gasped aloud , " Oh , my Lord , it 's the manor ! " She shook the reins and kicked the mule into a longer trot , staring fascinated at the distant fire . Presently she could see an occasional tongue of flame or a gush of sparks lick the sky . A faint movement among the trees told her that the silver poplars were swaying and bending in the storm of the heat . The girl pushed on her mule with a feeling of horror . After the Yankees had used the plantation and made their headquarters in the manor , then , on their final night , they had burned it . Three quarters of a mile farther on the girl rode into an illuminated area and saw scores of tiny silhouettes running to and fro against the flames . They were the Lacefieldnegroes fighting the fire . On Marcia 's right hand , spread over the Lacefield pastures , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doleful light of the fire . Soldiers were everywhere idly watching the black men fight the flames . Stationed at regular intervals along the edge of the fields were sentinels with guns . These continued marching slowly up and down their post looking at the flames . Their inertia amazed and angered Marcia . She directed her mule toward one of the sentinels . " Why do n't you soldiers help ? " she shouted , pointing wrathfully at the flames . " We set it afire , " said the man in a matter-of-fact Yankee voice . His Northern brogue completely stripped away any feelingof tragedy or drama that gave beauty to the scene . It was a prosaic burning of enemy material . When she rode still closer Marcia saw that the actual flames arose from the negro shacks , but that a great smoke was coming out of the doors and windows of the manor itself . She rode between the stone pillars of the gate into the grove of disturbed red-lit poplars . All the Lacefield slaves , men and women , swarmed in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the building , on the observatory , were posted more negroes with buckets to combat the sparks from the cabins . Marcia wondered what would happen to these negroes if the fire below got out of control . The girl looked about and saw Mr. Lacefield on the great piazza directing his slaves . He did not appear excited but she could hear his voice sharpened by the exigency calling , " Blue Gum , string your men up the stairs ! Henry , keep your men on the second floor . . . . How are the niggers on the roof getting on ? " Inside the smoking building the questions were relayed : " How de niggahs on de roof ? Need any mo ' niggahs on de roof ? " As Marcia. watched , she suddenly found her heart full of her old love and affection for Mr. Lacefield . And she thought with a clutch in her bosom , If only A. Gray had been like his father ! Marcia had followed the driveway . Now she glanced around and with a faint start of surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moment Marcia saw her she thought of her not as Drusilla Lacefield , but as Drusilla Crowninshield . The young woman wore a loose dress and the way it hung about her revealed the heavy shape of approaching motherhood . This notation was swept away by Marcia in sympathy for the destruction around her . She directed her mule a little nearer the young wife . " Drusilla , is n't this terrible ! " she called above the shouts and roar of the negro huts . " I 'm so sorry for you , honey . " The wife looked around and required a moment to realize who was there . " We did n't expect this , Marcia , " she said , with her lipsp355pressed close and her face quite colorless , except for the darkened circles of pregnancy about her eyes . " You might have expected it from Yankees ! " " Colonel Higgenbotham had his headquarters in our parlor . We  --  we tried to  --  treat him as a  --  a guest . " It was evident that Drusilla was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why n't you poison him ! " Drusilla gave a dry sob . " How did we know he  --  he was going to do this when  --  when he left ! " Marcia sat in her saddle , vibrant to such a double outrage . " Anybody that would trust a Yankee with  --  anything " The impossibility of compressing her contemptinto words balked her . " I did n't know what , but I knew some terrible thing was going to happen by the water buckets , " said Drusilla . " Water buckets ? " " Yes  --  everywhere . " " Whose water buckets ? " " Papa got them from Colonel Higgenbotham and put them around everywhere . " Marcia stared at this amazing news . She supposed that Mr. Lacefield had foreseen this catastrophe and had borrowedthe Yankee 's own water buckets  --  he had so many . " Well , I 'm glad he understood what snakes they were ... . Oh , listen , Drusilla , can I speak to your father ? " Drusilla looked from the flames to Marcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " Marcia nodded earnestly . " Is it that important ? " asked Drusilla , lowering her tone at Marcia 's manner . " I do n't know how important it is , " said Marcia , glancing about to see that no one overheard her.
