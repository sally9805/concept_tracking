The seven-millionth visitor had his ticket punched at the Paris Exposition of 1937 last week and experts agreed it was rapidly reaching historic rank with the great French expositions of the past . Greatest of these was Paris 1900 , attended by thirty-nine millions before closing day . but a worthy successor was Paris 1931 with thirty-three and a half millions . On May 23 only four pavilions were ready when Paris 1937 was " inaugurated " by sad-eyed , droop-mustached French President Albert Lebrun , but last week 160 pavilions were complete and the Exposition was all but finished . Wiseacres agreed that a solid month of sightseeing would be necessary to make a thorough job of Paris 1937 and that this week the one word for it was " SUCCESS . " <P> Paris hotels were all more nearly full than at any time since 1929 . Best rooms were taken , but rooms of sorts were still available to late comers , and the Government were rigidly keeping prices reasonable . Since Paris is the capital of fashion , females from all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of the great French creators of style are a match for them . Never accustomed hitherto to showing their latest models to the vulgar public , they have created for the Exposition dresses too breathtakingly extreme , fantastic and sumptuous to be worn by one woman in a million , show them mostly on featureless-faced mannequins rough-hewn of pinkish beige plaster , some as disproportioned as surrealism . Barely practical are the clothes shown by Paris conservatives such as Alix , Worth and Lelong . Scorning plaster women , Lanvin has draped two gowns of medieval inspiration and some handsome furs on a gigantic horse and an heraldic lion . Rebel Schiaparelli , outdoing even this , has flung a plaster female stark naked. * bottom down on a beach rug of artificial flowers , tossed the costume on a beach chair . Since such capers by the aristocrats of haute couture are not intended to please everyone , Paris ' great department store Le Louvre is handy at the Exposition , selling French dresses of good ready-to-wear quality and style at moderate prices . Example : at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a striking white Cellophane backless evening dress , the front bodice and hips covered with white sequins applied like fishscales and trailing off into a fishtail train . <P> The Exposition offers no French motor cars , but at 15,000 francs or $560 was offered last week the two-cylinder 32 h. p . Taupin monoseater sport plane , built for safe piloting by amateurs and said to be capable of landing at a speed of only 12 m. p. h . Slightly larger French sport planes , carrying two , yet also geared to private purchasers in the lowest price class are offered at $900 with a ceiling of 18,000 feet , cruising speed of 105 m. p. h.
