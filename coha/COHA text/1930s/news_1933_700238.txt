txt The jury that will decide whether or not Isidor J. Kresel , former counsel and director of the defunct Bank of United States , had abetted the misapplication of funds of the bank , listened yesterday afternoon and last night to the longest charge ever made by a judge in the criminal branch of the Supreme : Court . Supreme Court Justice Taylor 's charge to the jury lasted nine hours , from 1:50 o'clock yesterday afternoon until 10:50 o'clock last night . Justice Taylor 's actual speaking time was eight hours and a half . Three times during the nine-hour period he allowed the jurors to rest for ten-minute intervals . Having gone dinnerless as the hours ticked away , the jurors were allowed to go out to eat at about 11 o'clock , under the guardianship o4 two deputy sheriffs . The jury began its deliberations at 12:15 o'clock this morning , immediately after its return from dinner . At 1:05 A. M. , the jurors sent Justice Taylor a request that the final part of his charge be read to them . This dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money under the law . The jury entered the court room a few minutes later . In answer to another request by the jurymen , Justice Taylor gave them a copy of the charter of the Municipal Safe Deposit Company , the affiliate of the Bank of United States which received the $2,000,000 loan . Harry A. Solomon , an oil dealer , of 310 West 106th Street , foreman of the jury , asked Justice Taylor if a safe deposit company had the right to buy or to invest in stock and what its limitations were in this respect . Justice Taylor said that no safe deposit corporation has a right to invest for non-corporate purposes and any director doing that commits a , felony . The jury returned to its deliberations at 1:40 A. M. Mr. Kresel has been on trial since Sept. 15 , ' on an Indiettnent charg- ? ing him with abetting in the misapplication of about $2 ; 000,000 of the bank 's funds , that amount being part of an ** made by the bank on Jan. 13 , 1930 , to three safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury at 1:50 P. M. , taking up , point by point , the intricate affairs of the bank and its affiliates and the loan transaction which led to the Kresel indictment . His charge lasted throughout the afternoon and continued well into the ' evening . At 9:20 o'clock he recessed for ten minutes . after which he ( took up requests to charge that I had been made earlier both by the defense and by the State . Standing most of the time , Justice Taylor referred frequently to voluminous notes he had made on yellow foolscap paper while the testimony was being taken . At intervals , when he seemed in doubt as to dates , he paused to ask Mr. Kresel as to their correctness . The lawyer-defendant , in turn , made notes of Justice Taylor 's words as the charge proceeded . The court room was well filled 1 when Justice Taylor began his , charge . About 5 P. M. Justice Taylor interrupted his charge to allow a ten-minute recess . Many 1 of the spectators took advantage of the recess to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ! judge would finish his charge soon , remained , and , like the jury , found themselves unable to leave the court room and were - forced to go without - mapper . Mr. Kresel had been indicted with other directors , including Bernard I.C. Marcus , president of the bank , and Saul Singer , a vice president , both of whom are serving terms in Sing Sing- , and Herbert Singer , son of Saul Singer and a law-office assistant of Mr. Kresel . Puts Stress on " Willful . " Justice Taylor told the jury that it must decide whether or not Mr. 1 Kresel willfully aided or abetted in the $2,000,000 transaction or counseled Marcus and Singer to put it through . He declared that if the jury decided that Mr. Kresel had not acted willfully it must find him not guilty . The court pointed out that the failure of the bank in December , 1930 , when its deposits totaled $442,000,000 , had nothing to do with the loan . This also had been agreed by John W. Davis and Theodore Kiendl of defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred B. Unger and Felix Benvenga . Referring to the fact that such prominent men as former Governor Alfred E. Smith , Bainbridge Colby , George W. Wickersham and others had been called as character witnesses , Justice Taylor remarked that the defendant should not ' be acquitted just because his friends had come forward in is. behalf . Cites Evidence on Marcus . One of the points stressed by Justice Taylor excited considerable interest . He told the jury that before deciding whether pr not Mr. Kresel was guilty it must decide whether or not the evidence presented at the trial would prove that Marcus and Singer were guilty . Marcus and Singer had been indicted on the same count and found guilty on the evidence presented at their trial . Justice Taylor said that if the evidence presented at the- Kresel trial appeared to the jury to be inconclusive of the guilt of Marcus and Singer the jury must acquit Kresel . " What happened at that other trial ' is absolutely immaterial here and lids no evidentiary value here , " Justice Taylor said . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have before you , for the defendant is not . bound by that trial in any of the facts . " The testimony had shown that two days before the $8,000,000 had been lent to the three safe deposit affiliates of the Bank of United States the defendant had had a conference with Marcus and Singer . Denied Taking Part in Loan . Mr. Wallace had contended that the plan for making the $8,000,000 loan had been worked out at that conference , but Mr. Kresel denied on the witness stand that he had taken part in any plan for that loan , saying he was at the conference merely in his capacity as counsel for the bank . Justice Taylor said the jury would have to decide whether or not the defendant was there as advisory counsel and whether or not he could divest himself of his responsibility as a director . Before beginning his charge to the jury , Justice Taylor listened for two hours to a discussion by counsel , of 130 requests to charge made by the defense and five by the prosecution .
