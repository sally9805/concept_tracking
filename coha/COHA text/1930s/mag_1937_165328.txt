The average U. S. professional golfer begins his career at the age of 26 , earns $2,800 a year and expects to retire at 55 . This pertinent information was brought to light last week by Fidelity Investment Association of Wheeling , W. Va. , which queried 3,500 professionals . The youngest was 19 , the oldest 66 . The richest has reaped an average of $11,500 yearly , the poorest $1,068 . Less successful as investors than as breadwinners , the golfers reported they had lost $11,000,000 , or over $3,000 per man . Three out of four readily admitted that financial worries hurt their game .
