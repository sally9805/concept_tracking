Mr. and Mrs. Charles Didier spent a pleasant weekend at Diamond Lake , Ill. , swimming , sunning themselves , showing off their three-month-old baby to the neighbors . Then they started for home with little Robert , wrapped snugly in his blankets , tucked in a corner of the back seat . Suddenly the car jolted , the baby fell off the seat . When Mr. Didier stopped the car and picked him up , no wail or whimper came from the tightly wrapped flannel bundle . " He 's suffocated , he 's dead , " cried the father . <P> Pushing the accelerator down to the floor , he sped to the nearest drugstore , tried artificial respiration for ten minutes . The baby began to turn blue . The druggist shook his head . " He 's dead , " said he . But the agonized father would not give up hope . He dashed 14 miles to Wheeling , ran into the hospital , gave the baby to Dr. Edward L. Larson . Dr. Larson put Robert into a hot bath , massaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to constrict the small blood vessels and send a rush of necessary blood to the heart . In half an hour little Robert stirred , whimpered , opened his eyes . Next day he cried , suckled , belched as lustily as ever . Little Robert 's accident last week furnished additional proof for the heartening facts that 1 ) babies are tough , 2 ) superficial signs of death do not always mean what they say . If all fathers were as quick-witted as Charles Didier and rushed their " smothered " babies to a physician , the rate of infant mortality would be lower . A baby 's heart beat is so shallow , so rapid , that often only an expert with a stethoscope can detect it . And in the case of shock , the beat is intermittent , almost inaudible . Even blueness is not so much a sign of approaching death as a warning of oxygen deficiency . <P> Adults who have been struck by lightning ( see p. 18 ) , overcome by carbon monoxide , shocked by an electric current , or submerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often be " brought to life " again . Essential treatment is immediate and continuous artificial respiration . This month 's issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal cites the case of a young lineman who was shocked by 26,000 volts , received immediate treatment by trained fellow-workmen , and after eight hours of unconsciousness began to breathe normally . " The only really safe plan , " said the Journal , " is to continue efforts until rigor mortis has set in. "
