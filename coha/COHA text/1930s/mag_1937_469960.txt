LUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , is a museum piece among American cities . There , as under glass , the curious may see memorials of the " American system " in its purest form , monuments of individualist enterprise . There change came deliberately and when it did come it disguised and hid itself in the forms familiar to a town whose palmy days were during its years of growth beside the falls of the Ohio , when it was a metropolis of the great valley , a rival of Cincinnati , the Queen City of the West , a nerve center of a young country . If you come down Indiana on a warm May morning you will reach the river at last , the muddy Ohio , and there on the other side , all hazy and heaped up , is Louisville . There are some green trees , dusty in the haze , and above are white thunderheads piling up in the blue sky . The train crawls out on the bridge . Down below , on the Indiana shore , are some men and boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city materializes in an old red-brick jumble . There she is on the river bank , Louisville , the city of let-well-enough-alone . Fourth Street begins at the Ohio River . It 's only eight blocks from there to the Brown Hotel ? built during the boom of the 20 's ? but those eight blocks cover almost a hundred and fifty years . The riverside paving shelves down to the water 's edge with iron rings set in the stone at intervals . Before the Civil . War , when traffic glutted the canal round thefalls , when there were packet steamers running on regular schedule between Louisville and Liverpool , and you could buy a passenger ticket for Havana direct , this was a busy place . But not now . In the soft spring night the water slaps against the stone , the lights of Jeffersonville on the Indiana side are blurred , the place is deserted except for a couple of young people necking in a Ford drawn up near the water 's edge . The street climbs , as it recedes from the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here and there a dim light reveals a bar ; in one doorway two old men are smoking in silence . The place is like a tomb . At the first intersection is Main Street , once the great thoroughfare . Those battered columns are the front of what once , ages gone , was a branch of Nicholas Biddle 's United States Bank . " The proportions of this portico are those of the temple of Bacchus at Toes , " says the City Directory of 1832 , " but differs materially in the form of its members . " Now the windows are bleared and there 's a drunk asleep on the crumbling steps . Away off somewhere you can hear a street car banging along in the dark . Many of these buildings are of a great beauty even in decay ? limestone with classic cornices and carved stone balustrades . Where once the tobacco factors had their offices , where the linen-clad planters from the deep South came to do business , there is now storage for plumber 's supplies , warerooms of candy jobbers , coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Bank , in an abandoned store building , is the Socialist reading room ? locked up -- with an old May Day poster still stuck in the window . Socialism has had a slow time in Louisville ? despite or because of the tradition of low wages ? and Communists scarcely exist save in the imagination of the American Legion and the ivoryskulled business and legal lights . As you move up Fourth Street you pass a generation almost with every block , the streets more brightly lighted as you approach the center of the town . Six months ago it was all dark and still with muddy water lapping at the doors of the Brown Hotel . For twenty days after January 15 , 1937 , the town was at the mercy of the Ohio River with half the city under water and thousands fleeing for their lives . But that is over and gone now , the misery is pushed out of sight into the back streets ; it 's the night before the Derby and the street is jammed . In front of the Seelbach Hotel at Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk is littered with paper and dozens of newsboys are screaming racing editions of the Louisville Times . The Cincinnati Enquirer has a boy in special costume , all blue and orange . All the bars are going ; the Seelbach has several . One of these is a small circular room that opens directly on the street . A girl in white organdie , wearing a scarlet jockey cap , is hanging over the bar very drunk . Two men in white duck are bent over a racing sheet , another is anxiously asking the bartender when the Honorable James A. Farley will arrive . The lobby here and at the Brown Hotel is crowded to suffocation with politicians and sporting gentry . On the Seelbach steps is a gray-haired Blue Grass farmer holding a little boy by the hand . There are hundreds of men on the sidewalk , all looking alike , in wrinkled tan or gray Palm Beach suits , bulging at the belly , with tan felt hats , chewed cigars , and rumpled shirts , sweaty at the collar . One of them , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " Yes , sir , I seen ' em . I was upstairs and the door was wide open . Pie-eyed , all three of ' em , and the girl as naked as a jay . " Down the block the Kentucky Colonels have been having a dinner and a crowd of melted stiff shirts are pouring out . Two men from Detroit , mechanics in a ball-bearing works , are watching a girl in a mandarin coat redden her lips . " Yuh , that John L. Lewis is some man , what I mean , and did n't they rip the tar out of them fellers in Flint ? So long , buddy , we 're going to the armory . There 's a fight there to-night . " A solemn-looking youth with high cheekbones and a cowlick says : " You see , this has always been an open-shop town . Labor 's been dead , just no nerve at all , and the craft offices are only places for the old skates to warm their cans . The Amalgamated Clothing Workers are here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have n't got more'n a hundred and fifty members . This year the workers have waked some and what 's been done has mostly been by themselves . None of the organizers from outside have been much good and it 's been a rocky time . But steel 's coming along pretty fair now and you can bet the screws are being put on the men too . The Manufacturers ' Association have had things their own way here always and there 'll be a fight before its over . " Above the crowd and the lights the old brick and limestone buildings look down on the narrow street ; a very rich street it has been and looks so still . Barney Macaulay 's theater , one of the most famous road stands in America , is gone now , but the mansard-towered Post Office building stands as a sentinel of the past . The Brown Hotel with its mirror-ceilinged Blue Grass Room , is the final splendor of local enterprise , for the absentee landlord has appeared in both manufacture and local trade . Tobacco and distilling are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , and local tobacco manufacture is controlled in New York . Seventy per cent of the whiskey distilled in Louisville is controlled by absentees . illirhe old established family businesses with their low wages , and their exploited labor still hold on , but they arc giving place to exploitation from a distance . Where James B. Brown , the resplendent promoter and banker and boss of the State , held court during the boom and in twelve years did not travel farther from Louisville than Cincinnati or French Lick , one Louisville bank is now owned in New York City . Counting hotels and theaters , there are one hundred and seventy-eight retail establishments facing the five principal blocks on Fourth Street and one hundred and six of them are run by chains . Two blocks away from Fourth and Walnut is the Negro center of the town , flanked by an apartment and office building , put up by a colored insurance company , and the Central Drug Store , consolidated clearing house for information . That young man with a dead pan dressed in gray with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local bosses . No more has Louisville a single boss ; it takes at least two to squabble over the gravy . Most of the political fraternity are now celebrating the Derby , and all in good time they will be borne away to a Turkish bath to have the liquor sweated out of them . Times are slowly changing . A few of the Negroes get some of the pickings now ; a Negro sits in the Legislature from Louisville , and the Democrats , at long last , are taking them in . Since North and South meet in Louisville the more intense forms of race conflict are missing ; but the very blurring of the line serves only to make more acid the intolerable injustice put upon a helpless people . To understand Louisville it is necessary to recall a number of factors . Settled originally by English , Irish , Scotch , and African stocks who either trailed in the wake of George Rogers Clarke or came over the Virginia mountains , this population base ? save for an influx of Germans beginning before the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not touchthe region . The position of the town beside the falls was of decisive importance . In the days of river traffic , cargo had to break bulk there and the merchants of Louisville levied toll on shippers , became shippers themselves and suppliers of shippers . Round about lay a rich agricultural country . And it was in the middle ; it lay between the old East and the ' Western wilderness , between the North and South , a city of middlemen , acutely conscious of what transportation meant , taking tithe of every traveler . To Louisville came the Southern planters to buy ? on three hundred and sixty-five days ' time ? cotton gins , sugar mills , pork , hay , and flour . Out of Louisville , northbound , went sugar , molasses , coffee , and cotton . It was a broker 's paradise , a counting-house town where even the naturalist Audubon was pressed into service as a storekeeper and the brother of the poet , John Keats , was the director of a bank . Wealth accumulated and the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-esteem in America . A preoccupation with percentages and an intense interest in factional politics and the minutia : of litigation were characteristics of the town . The ruling-class women leaned heavily upon " charm " ; there was due attention to food and drink . For the rest , let well enough alone . How did this come to pass ? Something may be revealed by a consideration of the lives of three citizens of Louisville . The first is James Guthrie , who was born in 1792 ; the second is Milton Hannibal Smith , who died in 1921 ; the third is James B. Brown , who is still living . The first was a figure of national influence , an astute banker , promoter , and manipulator in the days of westward expansion . The second administered a great corporation that came to exert an overshadowing power and control over the city and the region . The third was the banker and promoter who took Louisville through the long speculative carouse of the decade of the twenties . II James Guthrie was twenty-eight years old when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be Commonwealth Attorney in Louisville , a little river town of four thousand inhabitants . The panic of the year before had somewhat taken the edge off President Mon-roe 's era of good feeling , but despite this the place was booming . Fulton had already built a steamboat at Pittsburgh and sent it down the Ohio to Louisville , and young Henry Shreve , who smashed the Mississippi monopoly granted to Fulton and Livingston , had reached Louisville upstream from New Orleans . The river swarmed with craft of every kind , rafts , flatboats , keelboats , and steamers . The promise of riches was in the air . Guthrie was a curious combination of arrogance and caution . For three years he had been kept in bed by a wound in the leg , the result of a duel , and the fact did not soften his irascibility . He was a lame man all his life . But he was shrewd and a calculator . One result of the panic had been the wreck of a multitude of canal and turnpike stock companies that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a number of these macadam pikes in Kentucky and Tennessee were about completed when the bubble burst . Some of these pikes led straightaway from Louisville to the South and enormously improved the town 's position for trade . This did not escape Guthrie , and as time went on his activity as a lawyer declined and his efforts as a banker and promoter increased . As time went on it would appear that his thinking fell into somewhat these divisions : 1 . With the addition of each artery of communication the prosperity of the town must increase . This automatically will increase the value of real estate . Guthrie with caution invested in Louisville property and laid the basis for a great fortune . 2 . The control of these arteries ? land and water ? is important . Guthrie set himself to achieve such control . 3 . To co-ordinate these enterprises effectively a good bank is essential . Guthrie became a banker . 4 . It costs money to construct these works . Can not government put its money into them ? As an officeholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . For safety 's sake , ought not these utilities to exercise a control over government ? Guthrie undertook to bring this about also . In most ways the ambitions of young Guthrie coincided with those of the rest of the inhabitants of the young country . He and the other Kentucky Democrats were firm supporters of Clay 's ceaseless agitation for federal appropriations for internal improvements . Clay was a compromiser and that was all right too . Sectional differences were troublesome and nobody knew it any better than border-town merchants doing business with all corners and all opinions . There was , of course , the slave . He was n't adapted to farming in Kentucky and he was a drain . In the minds of some persons there was a persistent nightmare . With the natural increase of slaves will the day come when Kentucky will embark in the trade and breed for sale ? The day came , and over the handsome turnpikes ? as well as down the river ? gangs of wailing blacks were driven south to the great markets in New Orleans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , and when the great cotton boom started in the 50 's , with prime field hands bringing one thousand dollars and more apiece , the temptation could not be resisted . It was a desolate thing to hear a slave preacher perform a marriage with the words " until death or distance do you part , " but what was to be done about it ? Business is business and Louisville money went into it . The rattle of the cash box drowned the cries of the wretches hound for the Red River hells and softened the advertisements that dotted the Louisville papers : " I wish to sell a negro woman and four children . The woman is 22 years old , of good character , a good cook and washer . The children are very likely , from 6 years down to 11/2 . I will sell them together or separately to suit purchasers . " * Guthrie did not trouble himself much about this pestilent question . As a member of the State Legislature from 1827 to 1841 , he sat on committees and dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for turnpike companies , got subsidies for river improvement and , most important of all , looked to the incorporation of railway companies . From Indiana he got a charter to put a . bridge across the Ohio at Louisville . The matter of a Kentucky charter had already been attended to . Then there was the canal . Years before it was plain that a canal round the rapids at Louisville would solve another traffic problem in a highly lucrative manner . Work proceeded by fits and starts until , in 1826 , the year before Guthrie went to the legislature , Congress was persuaded to put $100,000 in the enterprise . Guthrie attached himself to the project and by 1837 the stock was selling at $130 a share ; by 1839 it paid a dividend of 17 per cent . Through this bottle neck all boats of any size must pass and the size of the tolls brought the merchants of Cincinnati almost to the verge of apoplexy . True , when the railroads doomed the river business after 1860 canal traffic declined ; but by that time private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and charged no toll whatever . By the time Guthrie retired from the legislature he had accomplished about all he could there . A railroad from Louisville to Frankfort was under way and the Bank of Kentucky was on its feet . In 1834 , within a year after the United States Bank had gone down under Jackson 's attack upon it , Guthrie put a new charter through at Frankfort . For many years he was a director and , for a time , its president . The merchants of Cincinnati may have raged , but they were envious too . " It is for want of a James Guthrie that a reputation for inertness has been fastened upon Cincinnati , " said the Commercial ? Miss . Valley , Hist . Review , Dec. 1934 , pp. 331-342 . There was much entertaining ; Mrs. Pierce Butler lived next door to the bank and gave elegant small parties . By degrees the social structure of the town hardened into cast iron . The vital problem was a direct connection with the South . Calhoun had had a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got farther than a vision . A direct line from Louisville to Nashville and Memphis , opening country that had hitherto been almost inaccessible except overland from the river , could transport all the goods that flowed down from the North into the catch basin at the fall . Guthrie and his associates grasped the situation , a charter was secured from the Legislature , and on the 4th of September , 1851 , the subscription books for the Louisville &; Nashville Railroad were opened in Guthrie 's office . Where was capital to come from ? It was suggested that the city itself invest and it did to the extent of a million dollars . Farmers who wanted to get in on a good thing subscribed for stock and paid for it by doing grading themselves . Having got the thing started , Guthrie went off to Washington in 1853 to become Pierce 's Secretary of the Treasury , and Governor John Helm of Kentucky was elected President of the road . But there were difficulties and delays . Agents went to Europe with satchels full of city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of in Frankforton-Main and the 6 per cent bonds did a little better in Paris ; but the Crimean War had upset the European bankers and the agents came home . Furthermore , there were unmistakable signs that the country was in for hard times . This was the situation when Guthrie came back to Louisville in ' 57 , and grappled with the problem . He was successful . In the face of the panic of ' 59 , with railroads going bankrupt all over the country , he was able to sell a million dollars ' worth of bonds at par and the road was completed . The equipment was meager and so was the rolling stock , but from the start the road was a success . In the process Guthrie had completely consolidated his own position and when , in October , 1860 , he took over the presidency of the road he had made the L. &; N. the great single influence in Louisville and Kentucky . Everything he had done had built up to this point . The whole question of disunion was maddening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is past , " said one worthy ; " to do so would be false to her history , her position and dearest interest . " Louisville may have had Southern feelings but mercantile interest proved a powerful brake on the passions . What would happen to Mr. Guthrie 's Indiana railroad interests if a war got started ? What would happen to Mr. Newcomb 's business ? As for Governor Magolfin , his heart was with the South and he resigned his job , so thorny did it finally become . He died a millionaire , most of the money made in Chicago . Some of these factors must have been understood above the Ohio , for on the 29th of May , 1861 , Kentucky banknotes were being discounted in Northern markets at from 2 to 21A per cent discount , whereas Maryland notes ran from 5 to 10 and Missouri to 15 . In the autumn of the previous year , with the question of secession breaking the country wide open , John Bell , the compromise candidate for the Presidency , had carried Kentucky . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one , the Cotton States began to leave the Union . What was to happen to Kentucky and to Louisville ? What was Guthrie to do ? zu The bombardment of Fort Sumter occurred on April 17th , 1861 ; it was followed by Lincoln 's call for volunteers ; war was a certainty . A week later Guthrie thus addressed his fellow-citizens : " Keep up your relations of trade and good fellowship , . . . and heed the counsels of men who have counselled peace and harmony and attendant prosperity . " Attendant prosperity ? The Confederates were feverishly buying supplies of all sorts in the States north of the Ohio and rushing them south against the evil hour . Prices had skyrocketed and some few in Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois were achieving riches overnight . Speed was essential to the Southerners and there was but one way : over the Louisville &; Nashville . Frantically the road strove to cope with the traffic . Goods were piled in the open air , on sidings , any place . So overpowering was the glut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to accept freight and allow ten days to clear the line . The Louisvillians were accustomed to activity but this was staggering . All through May the inundation continued . " Day and night for weeks past , every avenue of approach to the depot has been blocked with vehicles waiting to discharge their loads , while almost fabulous prices have been paid for hauling and the road has been taxed to its utmost capacity to carry through the enormous quantities of freight delivered to it . " On the 2d of May the federal treasury , which knew well enough what was going on , forbade shipment of provisions or munitions south . This was serious , but the day was saved on the 16th when , less than a month after Bull Run , the Kentucky legislature voted " strict neutrality . " The traffic rolled merrily on , for how could the federal treasury meddle with a neutral State ? On the 12th of June Washington ordered Guthrie to cease shipments and appointed a new collector of customs , with the express provision that a permit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guthrie met this issue with great adroitness . He called a meeting of his board of directors , including those from the Confederate State of Tennessee , and arranged a friendly suit before a federal judge in Louisville ! Meantime the road kept right on doing business . On the 4th of July , Governor Harris of Tennessee decided to force Guthrie 's hand and seized the Nashville end of the line and demanded that the railroad president co-operate with the Confederate military in maintaining train service . But Guthrie was much too wary to be ensnared by this bait . He refused and when , a week later , on the 11 th of July , the Louisville judge upheld the government 's right to intervene , Guthrie acquiesced ? and then kept right on , using forged permits ! All summer long this see-saw was going on . Finally on the 18th of September , Guthrie 's fellow-townsman , General Simon Buckner , C.S.A. , invaded the State and seized the road as far as Bowling Green . ( General Buckner had had his troubles ; he also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on to it , deeded it to his brother-in-law who was in the Union Army . Whereupon the brother-in-law in his will bequeathed the property to Buckner again . ) The General now issued a manifesto addressed to Guthrie , suggesting that the road 's agents and employees continue in their work ? for the protection of the stockholders , of course , but under Buckner 's military control . And this statement was issued at a moment when the traffic was so great as to strain the road 's capacity to the breaking point ! But Guthrie had at last made up his mind and refused . " It would , " he said , " have been giving aid and comfort to the enemy ! " The die was cast ; the months of swaying backward and forward , waiting and watching , were over . Mr. Guthrie 's policy was clear , he was a Union man now . A few days later , in October , 1861 , Mr. Cameron , the Secretary of War ( he had been a railroad man and hanker too ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Guthrie had a conference . As a result of it an invasion of the South from Louisville along the L. g : N. was agreed upon . An encampment was organized at Louisville and a large army was assembled . Money poured into the town . The railroad presidents , meeting in Washington , had decided that a rate of two cents a mile for troops and a discount of 10 per cent on freight would be satisfactory . Not for Guthrie . His road , he said , was too near the seat of war and he needed higher rates . He got them . And when the government determined to administer the railways it fell out that one of Guthrie 's own subordinates , an L. &; N. official , was appointed as Director of Railroads . Everything was as it should be . The great offensive began and when , in ' 63 , Guthric desired to extend a branch line to the Kentucky coal fields , General Burnside put a military engineer in charge and the Negroes along the line were " impressed " to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road was bigger and in better shape than it had been at the start and Guthrie could present a glowing balance sheet . Profits for 1861 were 57 per cent of the gross ! From 1863 on this was the story ; NET INCOME 1862 $1,062,165 1863 $1,803,953 1864 S2,172,515 1865 $1,592,055 At the close of the Civil War , Louisville with a population under 100,000 , was approaching the peak of its importance ? to the rest of the country . Its vitality was near the top . Through the railroad a virtual monopoly of the traffic south had been established . The road , the city government , and business ? represented frequently by the same persons who placed a sculptured locomotive on the City Hall ? had co-operated closely to preserve and to enlarge this monopoly . The destruction of the plantation system in the far South had resulted in the springing up of general stores everywhere . The drummer ? almost unheard of in the South ? appeared , and forth from . Louisville went thousands of traveling salesmen . If you were a Confederate veteran that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ties in Louisville that it was said that " if a hardware drummer could sell a consignment of groceries for a Louisville house , he always took the order and passed it on to the Louisville groceryman . " Louisville wholesalers and jeans makers sent their salesmen as far as Texas , making long circuits on horseback before the railroads had crossed the State . By 1869 , owing to this Southern demand , the exports of Louisville were double the imports . And in the midst of all this activity was the railroad under Guthrie 's presiding genius . " It is the Louisville &; Nashville Railroad with James Guthrie at its head that is putting the iron spokes in the commercial wheel of Louisville , " said the Cincinnati Commercial in 1868 . It was begrudged admiration ; the upriver merchants were full of bile because Louisville was the most direct route south for them and Guthrie was making them pay through the nose . Barely was the war over when the road began pushing southward . In 1872 ? after negotiations that all but ended in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galt House ? it undertook the completion of the road which connected Decatur and Montgomery and made the city of Birmingham a possibility . By 1880 it had acquired various lines to Mobile and New Orleans and had a mileage of almost two thousand miles . In addition it had acquired the control of the Nashville , Chattanooga and St. Louis , and for a generation kept Nashville bottled up , shutting out all competition . The road , by degrees , was growing into the great and overshadowing power of the region , a huge utility that bound the States together . All this was forecast when Guthrie drew a long breath in 1869 , declared a 40 per cent dividend and died , and his friend , Mr. Newcomb , the grocer , took over the reins . IV Long before thechief placesof influence in the town had become the portion of families that were already " old . " There were the directors and the officials of the railroad and the Bank of Kentucky ; ringed about them was a fringe of lawyers , frequently connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and select company occupied the center . Ringed about them in turn were other banks and lesser corporations ; they too had their fringe of lawyers . Lawyers were as thick as blackberries . Wholesale liquor and tobacco had a peculiar dignity ; wholesale drygoods and shoes had not . The bankers and the railroad directors and their legal cousins and brothers-in-law moved easily into government and back again ; the offices and places of administration were passed to and fro ; office was considered almost a family perquisite . Thus , John Helm , a grandson of a Kentucky Indian fighter , was Governor of the State and President of the Louisville and Nashville . Horatio Bruce , member of the Legislature , Commonwealth Attorney , and Circuit Judge , married the Governor 's daughter . At the time of his death , in 1903 , Mr. Bruce was chief of counsel to the railway . James P. Helm , a son of the Governor , was for many years one of the attorneys of the railway . Helm Bruce , who united the two families in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present moment Thomas Kennedy Helm is one of the road 's counsel . Such close and intimate connections could be multiplied in the case of other families . They represent one of the striking influences that have preserved the character of the town . What these families originally acquired they kept , although as time went on and vitality began to decline , more effort went toward keeping what they had than to acquiring more . From the counting houses flowed the money that watered and nourished a society termed " brilliant " ? a brilliancy of elaborate food and drink and entertainment rather than quality of mind . Daughters were brought out with parties at the Galt House ; whether the Chickcring or the Steinway lent more distinction to a parlor was a delicate point . Mr. Kendrick , the jeweller , and after him Mr. Lemon ? who was himself a person of some circumstance ? supplied these families with diamonds , solid silver , and fine glass . The horse show was regarded as the opening of the season in the fall ; in 1875 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at times , suffocating . Mr. Brown , the rich distiller , was a Presbyterian elder and regarded the casual drinking of whiskey with disapproval . It should be taken medicinally or not at all . The Germans ? the only immigrants who ever came to Louisville ? lived by themselves and were not received . " When I was a girl , " said a lady , " there was a German caterer named Klein whose daughter went to the school attended by my sister and myself . We were always very polite to her but it was understood that we were from different worlds . True , her father no longer appeared at the parties for which he did the catering : he sent his waiters . He kept a carriage and had a handsome residence , but that made no difference . " Wedding invitations must be delivered by carriage ? hire a carriage if you do n't own one ? and once the invitations were out , the bride was kept in a dim , gray seclusion until the wedding , lest the passing glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prospective husband alone . That any genuine intellectual life could flourish in such an atmosphere was of course impossible . What there was , for the most part , was drained into politics and the law ; the product was a facile adroitness in the strategies of litigation and an unflagging interest and zeal in the arts of politicking . In the sciences there was a stygian darkness . Poetry was represented by the maunderings of Madison Cawein : the high point in the novel was Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch . Louisville gave to the stage two celebrities : Mary Anderson , beautiful and without fire , and Roland Hayes , the tenor . Both conventional successes in different generations . An active intellect was apt to move away . Ellen Semple , the geographer , was a native of Louisville , but her work was done elsewhere . Louis Brandeis was born there ? and left town . There was left the conventional , an agreeable deliberation of manner and a motheaten , moribund " charm . " A step down from this level of ponderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamblers met the men of the town on tolerably even terms ; in an atmosphere where an idea died early , there was at least no evangelical caterwauling . At intervals a roulette wheel appeared at the Galt House . The aged Buckner , his Chicago real estate hap-pay married to his devotion to the Lost Cause , could be seen there smoking a corn cob . Poker playing and race-track betting were common . Henry Watterson of the Courier-Journal on one occasion sent a relay of messengers to the office for supplies of cash to tide him through the game ; when he had cleaned the office out and there was nothing Ieft but some Mexican money , he commandeered that . Below this level were small tradesmen and the clerks , then the white workers , and at the bottom the Negro who dwelt in that half world to which God had been pleased to call him . Wages were low and labor unions were firmly repressed . Clerks worked for a lifetime in the old business houses for little pay and felt themselves honored . Let well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of Kentucky ruled over all . But presently ? by imperceptible degrees ? a change occurred . The road held a southbound monopoly ; its rates were high , but it gave Louisville trade a distinct advantage . Up to a point this advantage was generally conceded . But about 1870 it dawned on some Louisville people that it was just possible that the hoisting of rates was not so much intended to benefit the local merchants as it was for the road to make money . By the next year the Mayor was forced to take notice of this condition in his annual report . Barely twenty years before any sacrifice had seemed desirable to get a road . Louisville was a city of opportunity ; any man could make a fortune if he would bestir himself ; and so on . The farmers in the region had felt the same way . Mr. Guthrie , to all appearances , had been but the most ambitious , the most able , and the luckiest among his equals . Was it possible that Mr. Guthrie 's creation , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complaints rapidly increased . " The L. &; N.railroad makes us pay just what they please , " said a citizen of Lebanon , and we are bound to submit to it . They run to their own time and we have to submit .

" The cry of the little man was beginning to be heard and at that same moment it was going up throughout the country . Monopoly ! The man with the lumber yard downstate , the little wholesale grocer , the small tobacco grower were falling behind in the race . The people of the Great Meadow were crying for help . What they wanted was better service and a low rate . Plain enough . The bitterness of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce was something different . They could understand that , even if it were only jealousy .

Co. with that soulless characteristic that attaches to most corporations , is prepared to exact its gigantic powers to the injury not only of Cincinnati but of a very large section of Kentucky . " Then the grange movement began its sweep through the country and the Kentucky farmers became infected . By 1880 it was plain that a line was being drawn . Two things happened : the road declared a 100 per cent stock dividend and a Railroad Commission was set up to regulate rates . They did n't regulate very long . Three years later the names of Jay Gould , Thomas Fortune Ryan , Russell Sage , and ? not long after ? Jacob Schiff and August Belmont appeared in the list of directors . It was a formal notice that the age of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1884 , Milton H. Smith was elected president of the L. &; N. Thereafter , for thirty-seven years , he was the boss and operating head of the road . He told the little man what he could do ? and like it . V Like Mr. Guthrie who preceded him and Mr. Brown who came after him , Milton Hannibal Smith was not a native of Louisville . He was born on a farm in rural New York and after a boyhood in Illinois set out for the south in 1858 to make his fortune . He was twenty-two and stubborn . His first job ? selling Appleton 's Encyclopedia from door to door in Mississippi ? was hardly begun when the John Brown raid broke at Harper 's Ferry . It scared the Appletons out of their wits and they wired Smith to quit . Stranded , he got a job teaching school and during a holiday learned telegraphy . So adept did he become ? and he could take a message off the wire to the end of his life ? that he left his school for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " he had talent as a train dispatcher " and was so engaged when the Civil War began . Neither the causes nor the spiritual agonies of that conflict bothered him . He moved troops for the Confederacy and when the Federals got into his neighborhood , he moved troops for them . When the Federal military railroad service was organized he entered it and served all over the South . In August , 1866 , he came to Louisville as local agent of the L. &; N. , Guthrie then being at the height of his influence . Able and efficient , he rose very rapidly ; impatient and short-tempered , in 1878 in a rage he flounced out of the L. &; N. when some order had been countermanded . Four years later , in 1882 , he came back to stay . Between Guthrie and Smith as citizens of Louisville there lay an age . Guthrie Lived and died a Louisvillian ; he was in every way identified with the city which he dominated . His riches and his interests began there and grew outward . Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The railroad was all . The road was no longer an arm of Louisville ; rather Louisville had become but one of many arms of the railroad . It was Smith 's function to serve as the planner , executive , servant , and boss of a great utility that had burst all local bounds , that had risen above government and was in most respects a law unto itself . Smith regarded the region south of the Ohio as a sort of wilderness tract created by the Almighty to provide a field of operation for himself and the L. &; N. This wilderness was peopled with animated dummies who were to be used , conciliated , manipulated , or suppressed to suit the need of the moment and the demands of his road . Completely devoid of social curiosity , vision , or conscience ? he would not have known what the words meant ? he devoted thirty-seven years as an administrator to telling people to get the hell out of the aisle . The financial control was in the East , but Smith exerted an appreciable influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As years went on he grew more and more autocratic and more ruthless in the face of opposition . Fight rather than negotiate was his rule of action . True , in later years , Morgan forced him to take a share of the Monon and it made Smith feel " worse than a spell of sickness " and he had to put up with the devillings of limy Green when that lady had her car backed into the Louisville yards and undertook to lecture him for an extravagant use of brass on his engines . But such interferences were few ; Smith was the road and the road was Smith . A hard bargainer , Smith is said to have refused to own more than enough shares in the road than he needed to act as director ; his salary never rose above twenty-five thousand dollars and he refused , years before his death , to have it doubled on the ground that " no railroad president is worth more than twenty-five thousand a year . " When he died in 1921 he left an estate ? excluding an income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $202,000 . Small takings when compared to those of his pirate friends and contemporaries . He paid as low wages as he could and placidly saw capable engineers , whom he had trained , depart because he would not raise their pay . In a strike he was merciless and without scruple . He was cautious , secretive , and adroit in stratagems . He could act circuitously , as when he secretly subsidized doggerel versifiers during a political campaign . In ' 93 , having learned through means known only to himself , that a conductor named Polly was organizing for Debs 's union , he dispatched a wire to the division superintendent : " Suggest you relieve Polly . " An hour or so later he wired again : " Has Polly been relieved ? " The bewildered superintendent replied that Polly was on his run . Smith wired a third time : " Send a special and relieve Polly . " It was done and Mr. Polly vanished from the L. &; N. forever . In after years football players were recruited from colleges to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have approved . He despised passenger traffic ? " you ca n't make a God damn cent out of it " ? and saw his coaches reach the antique stage without a pang . He cursed Jim Crow laws because it cost money to divide the coaches or build separate ones . He wanted long-haul freight , and to get it he invested the road 's money . He perhaps had more to do with the development of Birmingham , Alabama , than any other single man , for he saw in the coal and iron there a source of traffic for his road . He would build a spur to the door of any man who would open a mine or build a furnace ? and frequently put the road 's money in the venture . The road existed to make money and in order that it should he saw to it that it operated efficiently . The idea that his road might also be a public utility he would have laughed to scorn . When an Interstate Commerce Commissioner suggested to Smith that under the sacred freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to pay whatever Smithdesired to charge , the railroad president denied it . " What could he do ? " asked the Commissioner . " He could walk . " He lived quietly in Louisville at Fourth and Oak , refused to give interviews , took naps frequently , kept a fast horse , and devoted himself to the administration of his road and to the crushing of opposition . " He had no interest in politics save where it touched his railroad , " and there was no point where they did not touch . In the list of those who have emasculated popular government Smith must have an honored place . The debauching of legislatures was in line of duty and it was done . Government was anathema and Smith did not hesitate to say so . In every county seat through which the railroad ran were lawyers hired to watch the road 's interests . Many of them were sent to the legislature as representatives ? or if not ? their relatives or close friends were sent . Sometimes the local banker acted . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in Louisville . Judges , Senators , legislators , and office holders of all brands traveled over the road free of charge and for a purpose . To effect this purpose a corps of lobbyists was maintained ; among them none more distinguished than that eminent citizen of Louisville , General Basil Duke , C.S.A . A Confederate cavalryman under Morgan , Duke had married Morgan 's sister , Henrietta , and had ended up a dashing if not especially able general himself . One of the ruling class , his family was allied to others quite as distinguished . He was high-spirited , his manner considered " chivalrous , " and he had literary talents as well . His onerous legal duties ? in large part ? consisted in occupying strategic positions at Frankfort , the State capital , with " his pockets full of passes . " Frankfort is but a short ride from Louisville over the L. &; N. and you can go back and forth with ease . The General found time to edit the Southern Magazine published in Louisville , and one can imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer of ' 94 , his mind occupied with his editorial which waited to be written . " It can not be too often repeated , " the General told his readers , " that the average negro is yet a savage " and lynch law should not be " suffered to become obsolete . " As for cast European immigration , " we are convinced that it has been of detriment to every part of this country into which it has been introduced and its presence would prove a veritable curse to the South . " Oh , those sunny , sunny days in Louisville , and Mary Anderson , our dear Mary , how charming as Perdital And as Parthenial Sir , her beauty was dazzling . But it was the Debs strike of ' 94 that roused the General to his great effort . His wrath was blistering . " Legislators often make haste to obey and gratify the licentious and utterly selfish spirit which insists that all other interests shall be subordinated to its ( the union 's ) most unreasonable demands . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonable demand when he saw or made one . Beneath all his gallantry and distinction the General was Milton Smith 's hired man . He pitched his case upon a high moral . note . He did not venture into the realism of his boss who could say : " Under our form of government it is permissible to do anything necessary to get another man 's property providing you can keep out of jail . All legislative bodies are a menace . In action they are a calamity . " Not quite , of course , for there were the courts . The Minnesota Rate Case in ' 89 had smashed state regulation of railways and subsequent decisions had crippled the Interstate Commerce Commission . Sometimes Smith desponded : " I think the people of this country .. are going to confiscate the railroads ; they have the power and are going to do it ; it is a matter of time . " But such fits of depression did not happen often . " He saw from the first , " said an admirer " that if a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state , increased traffic must not be its sole idea ; but it must achieve power , influence , and success it self . " And the road 's power , influence , and success by that time spread far beyond Louisville and Kentucky . By 1891 the editor of Birmingham News could say with admiration , " The Louisville and Nashville is now not only Birmingham , but Alabama . " That discouraged remark of Smith 's about " the people " taking the railroads had some show of reason behind it , at least in Kentucky . After years of railroad domination there finally had appeared a man who was capable of putting up a fight . He was younger than Smith , but quite as able and as ruthless . There had been preliminary skirmishes in the legislature and elsewhere , a long drawn-out preparation for battle . Then in May , 1899 the Kentucky Democrats met at Louisville and after eight hectic days and nights nominated this champion for the governorship . Or rather , it would be more proper to say that the champion nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolled by soldiers , the city had been turned upside down , and scores of families broken up , so bitter had feeling become . The champion 's name was William Goebel . VI William Goebel was the son of an immigrant German cabinet maker who had settled in Covington , Kentucky , up the river from Louisville and across from Cincinnati . His family and blood were his first crime ; he was an outlander and a plebeian . There had been no judges nor brigadiers in his family , no bluegrass , julep tradition . Restless , intensely ambitious , and with no money , he studied law in Covington in the office of a former governor and presently became the partner of John G. Carlisle , Cleveland 's Secretary of the Treasury . In 1887 , barely thirty years old , Goebel was elected to the State senate . He was closemouthed , had few friends , and was not given to confidences ; but he had already shown skill as a political strategist and manipulator . LOUISVILLE , The cry of the farmers and the small business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations " was by this time incessant . It was these people that Goebel elected to lead . Opposed by the old families and the reactionaries , he built up in the towns a following that became as blind in its devotion to him as his enemies were blind in their hatred . Such an enemy was Colonel John Sandford of Covington . Colonel Sandford , a Confederate soldier of some distinction and a member of an old Kentucky family , had a bank . Furthermore he was a stockholder in toll roads . Those roads , which Guthrie long before had sedulously nursed , still were doing business ; Kentucky highways still , in 1895 , were controlled by corporations . It appears that before this there had been no love lost between the two men and when young Goebel began his campaign to force down the tolls , and midnight raids to smash toll houses and gates got started , the quarrel became more bitter . The fight reached the newspapers and Sandford was offensively referred to . A day or so later when the two enemies met on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both reached for their guns but Goebel got there first . Sandford fell dead , Goebel had a bullet hole through his coat . The young Senator was held to have acted in self-defense and there was no trial . In 1896 the frightful specter of Bryan appeared ; the railroad crowd regarded him as an incendiary , so did the old families . The State Bankers ' Association demanded the election of McKinley in order to " repudiate the communistic assault on property which these radical demagogues were making . " There was some point to this ; the Railroad Commission had found in 1889 that there was more than twelve million dollars ' worth of railroad property in Kentucky that was exempt from any tax whatever . General Buckner , deserting the cool recesses of the Galt House , consented to run for the Vice-Presidency on the Gold Democrats ticket with Palmer . The Kentucky papers ? even the CourierJournal ? obediently fell into line . And Goebel stuck to Bryan . The result was that McKinley carried Kentucky and for the first time a Republican State administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of the Democrats and by this time Goebel was the controlling force there . He had torn politics wide open . Louisville rested under the rule of John Whallen , " the good boss , " who with his brother had come down the river from Cincinnati to become the proprietors of the Buckingham Burlesque Theater and Saloon . Between Whallen and the railroad was a close connection . But the iniquitous Goebel had got into town and while Whallen was secure in the Democratic organization , the Democratic officeholders in both city and county had been tampered with . With a Republican administration at Frankfort , the railroad was content . The legislature and the city wards were keeping the railroad banking element awake at night . Without rest , Goebel pushed on . A franchise tax on corporations was jammed through the legislature . A railroad commission with increased powers was demanded , a bill to create it was passed and vetoed by the Republican governor . An employers ' liability law roused feeling to a higher pitch than ever . No means , however devious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his fight . Then he was damned outright when he secured the passage in 1898 of the Goebel Election Law . This provided that a commission of three persons , appointed by the legislature , should in turn appoint the election boards throughout the State . And since it was the election boards who counted the ballots , that man who controlled the legislature which appointed the boards was in a fair way to control the State . This was the general situation when , in May , 1899 , the Democratic convention met in Louisville at the Music Hall . Goebel was forty-three years old , Smith was sixty-three . With but a fraction of the delegates at the start , Goebel succeeded in maneuvering the convention into one blind alley after another . Hysterical oratory , brawls and fist fights punctuated the proceedings that dragged their interminable course through eight sweltering days and nights . Goebel 's nerve and self-control completely baffled the opposition . In the end , Whallen 's forces were routed and the railroad allies also ; Goebel was nominated for the governorship . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8c N. Railroad was the main factor , " Goebel had won , after doing " nothing to his competitors ? whatever he did to them ? that they were not ready to do to him . Every man , woman , and child in Kentucky knows this to be the truth . " The campaign that followed was of a sort never seen before in Kentucky ? nor since , for that matter . Goebel pitched his case on the corporations alone and the L. &; N. above all . Scarcely a newspaper supported him . He could rely on the organization which he had built up and the statewide following which accepted him without question , but the brains and the strategy were his alone . Against him the opposition was solid . An independent Democratic ticket was set up to draw support away from him , the real effort and money was put behind the Republican candidate . The forlorn candidate of the Democratic splinter , cartooned as a monkey dancing to the music of General Duke 's handorgan , was represented in a Goebel parade coffined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. &; N. " It was said that the road was going the limit and would spend a million dollars to beat Goebel . Smith kept quiet . An Honest Election League , under the patronage of Boss Whallen , was got up in Louisville , to which all honest men might repair and help defeat the rebel . Among the railroad counsel , Mr. Helm was particularly active . Whenever he spoke in Louisville , Goebel took pains to refer to General Duke as a " professional corruptionist . " To this the General replied cryptically : " I speakwithin due bounds when I say that Goebel has been more frequently suspected of bargaining and using his influence as a legislator than I have been of attempt . ing to so control legislation . " November 7th , 1899 was election day . It was expected that returns from the eastern mountain Republican counties would be delayed ? until perhaps the results downstate were known ? and they were . The State election board ? Goebel 's own ? after days of agonised waiting , announced the returns thus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election in the legislature . In a tense atmosphere Mr. Taylor and his administration took office . On the first of January , 1900 the Democratic Senate , Mr. Goebel among them , caucussed . A Senator arose and told of being offered $4500 by Boss Whallen to stay away from the caucus . The notices of contest , filed by the Democrats , charged that in Louisville and in a number of counties , " more than enough voters who were in the employ of the L. &; N. Railroad Co. to change the result of the election were intimidated by the heads of the company and caused to vote for the contestees " and that " the Republican leaders entered into conspiracy with the chief officers of the L. &; N. Railroad and other corporations by which the latter were to furnish money which was corruptly used . " The Goebel wheels began to turn and Republican Senators found themselves unseated , on the grounds of fraudulent election . There were almost continuous conferences in Louisville . Frankfort , the little capital , was crowded ; it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the fight went on , grudges of every kind boiled over . Two Republicans of Louisville who could n't bury the hatchet and make common cause against Goebel , met in the Capital Hotel lobby , and opened fire on each other . One of them got as far as the steps and pitched over dead . The Postmaster of Shelbyville , down for a little politicking , got a bullet through the heart . Another man was shot in the back and still another in the foot . In addition to all this , " 0 . D. Redpath , a Chicago drummer , was knocked down in the rush for the doors and had his leg broken by someone falling over him . " Meantime , the Republican governor , in a state of jitters watched the unseating process going on in the legislature . Plainly it was only a matter of time before a revised assembly would declare Goebel governor . On the 25th of January , early in the morning , a special train arrived over the L. Sc N. from the mountain region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature for justice , declared the Republicans ; to overawe the legislature , according to the Goehelites . It was freely predicted if the legislature dared to make Goebel governor he would never survive . A killing was certain . Toward noon on the 30th of January , as Goebel was going up the path to the state house , someone from a window of the administration building , shot him with a rifle . Pandemonium broke loose . The militia , under control of the Governor , were sent for on the double and the legislature was refused admission to the Capitol . Goebel was picked up and carried back to the hotel . Surgeons hurriedly looked him over and declared it was no use . But he refused to die . In the midst of all the tumult the Democratic majority was ordered to meet . They could n't . They could n't get into the Capitol and the militia kept them out of the opera house and the diminutive city hall . " The head and front of our present troubles , " said Watterson , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which republican government has been for the time being struck down and a military dictatorship set up in its place is the L. &; N. Railroad Co . . . . One motion of the head of the L. &; N. . . and the whole lawless Taylor fabric falls to the earth . " In the end the Democrats gathered in the hotel and declared Goebel and his ticket elected . With all speed they gathered round the bedside and the dying man was sworn in and his young lieutenant after him . The next day , after some legal moves , he was sworn in again . That was the limit of his strength . On the evening of the 3d he died . " Tell my friends to be brave and fearless and loyal to the great common people " were his last words according to his hysterical followers . The road was immediately blamed for the murder . Even Watterson went so far as to declare : " He was ambitious . . . but there are kinds and degrees of ambition . He wished to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain this end was to represent the interests of the great body of the people against the growing aggression of the great chartered companies . It cost him his life . . . . They could not buy him and they could not bully him . They had to cause him to be killed . " The attacks finally brought the directors of the road into the open . " It would be unreasonable , " they declared , " to expect corporate interests to so disregard the injury inflicted or threatened by constant attacks of political agitators as to be entirely silent as long as the politicians seek office by appeals to the passions and prejudices of the voters and especially by efforts to excite hostile feelings to be followed by hostile legislation ! " Be that as it may . The only man who ever had attempted to buck the powers that be in Louisville , in Kentucky , and in New York ? and succeeded ? had fallen . It has never been tried since . The waters covered him and it was all over . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead they set up his railroad commission ? it was n't as clear then as now that State commissions could be controlled . Goebel never set down his political philosophy . If he had it might perhaps have occurred to him that something was lacking in the measures for which he fought , that it was not only difficult but impossible to " confine " corporations , that the little men whom he represented were at bottom little Milton Smiths . Goebel himself as a lawyer is said to have earned twenty-five thousand a year ; so did Smith . His estate is said to have been about a quarter of a million dollars . Smith 's did not greatly exceed it . VII Smith had twenty-one years yet to go after Goebel 's death . In 1902 , one night in the Pendennis Club , he was astonished to learn that Bet-A-Million Gates had made a stock market raid in New York and had captured the L. &; N. A deal was made by Morgan and presently the control of the road passed to the Atlantic Coast Line where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man " was actually growing old . The great powers that the railroads had once exerted were passing to other aggregations of capital . But government , which he abominated , was still the enemy . He made short work of the Interstate Commerce Commission until finally in 1918 , forced to it by the Supreme Court , he admitted that vouchers in the road 's files were made out ambiguously " because it was not deemed advisable to disclose to anyone not even to the company 's own subordinate officers and employees that it ( the road ) was making political expenditures . " But he was nearly done . The star of James B. Brown was rising in Louisville and the Boom Era was in its first raptures . One day Mr. Brown went out to see Mr. Smith and found the railroad president reading a Times-Picayune editorial headed : " Milton Smith : Dead and Does n't Know It . " " What do you think of that ? " asked Mr. Smith . Mr. Brown read the editorial . " It 's pretty tough , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tough , but true . " With the eye of a connoisseur he had read Ida Tar-bell 's History of the Standard Oil Co . He contemplated writing the story of his life and then gave it up because he knew too much . His political philosophy he summed up thus : " Too many people have the vote . " Finally , on the 7th of February , 1921 , after a sharp request that he be buried quickly and without ceremony , the dinosaur died . The career of James B. Brown , and he is living still , reached its climax in the crash of the National Bank of Kentucky in November , 1930 . Round this old Main Street bank , as round the L. Sc N. , the counting-house traditions of Louisville were built up . Chartered in 1806 as the Old Bank of Kentucky , after various misadventures and the wreck of the United States Bank , it was equipped with a charter in 1834 secured by James Guthrie . It was one of the leading money fortresses south of the Ohio , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation to generation members of the leading capitalist and merchant families of Louisville sat on its board . By slow accretion its resources grew , sedimentary deposits laid down year by year . General Duke , almost upon his knees , wrote a reverent history of it ; its stock paid 16 per cent and more . Originally the State was represented in the directorship , but by the 70 's this right was surrendered and the bank became entirely a private institution , the bulwark and pride , the dearest possession of those families which , through sheer survival , looked upon themselves as the anointed of God . It was this institution which James Brown brought to its final glory before the disaster of 1929 . When the World War broke Louisville was approaching an ossified dotage . In 1910 the tobacco market started to move to the loose-leaf floors near the growing centers . The Kentucky Wagon Manufacturing Company , once the rival of Studebaker , was in decline . In distilling , the tying up of local capital in whiskey aging made money still more inert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees took their small wages and said nothing . The specters of Populism and William Goebel were laid at rest and , caught in a sort of amber , the town lay upon the river bank awaiting the last trump of a Presbyterian God . Suddenly all this was changed by the War . Camp Zachary Taylor was established at Louisville , the town was overrun with soldiers , contractors , and all the camp followers that fatten upon a war boom . The movement south of industry touched Louisville and population jumped . Presently the ranks of the old families wavered , their control was weakened , the social barriers began to cave , A new era was at hand and Jim Brown , as he was known , ushered it in . James B. Brown was born in rural Kentucky , without benefit of Blue Grass aristocracy , in 1872 . His father is said to have sold sewing machines and Jim himself believed that a salesman could accomplish anything . When he was fifteen he came to Louisville to work for the Southern News Company and after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss of Louisville . Whallen was then in his prime , presiding over his burlesque theater in top hat , frock coat and diamond studs . The boss found a job for Jim in a bank and from then on the salesman 's progress was continuous . By 1908 he was president of the bank and then quit it to enter the National Bank of Commerce , sometimes known as the L. N. bank . Before long he was president of this bank also , but where Louisville bankers in the past were suffocating in their dignity , moving glacially and watching both the right hand and the left , Mr. Brown was alert and expansive . No Galt **25;1508;TOOLONG Club tradition benumbed his vigor . Interested in the turf and adroit in politics , he was forty-five and ready for bigger things when the United States entered the War in 1917 . The War not only provided an opportunity for Mr. Brown 's zeal as promoter in Liberty Loans and Red Cross drives ; it took him to Washington as a member of the Capital Issues Committee and there he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . All of these years and experiences prepared him for the great merger of 1919 when the National Bank of Kentucky absorbed three other Louisville banks and Jim emerged as president of the consolidation . The year before he had been active in the organization of the Kentucky Jockey Club , a corporation which took over the control of Churchill Downs and other tracks . Whallen was dead now and Milton Smith was near it . Who would succeed to the power they had held ? Jim had the bank , THE bank of the South , he was thoroughly acquainted with all the traditions of Kentucky politics and had been schooled by Whallen , a master at the trade . Let others pursue their ambitions to New York ; better to be first in Louisville than second in Rome , and the neighbors were now to watch the financial and political control of Kentucky united in one person . With characteristic Kentucky markings and coloration , Jim became a tradition himself , the borderland money master of the Harding-Coolidge-Hoover era . There is another figure in the landscape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in the late 90 's when Jim was studying political science with Mr. Whallen . Mr. Bingham , whose father had had a school in North Carolina , went into politics also . On the surface the men were dissimilar . Regarded by many as a handsome man with distinguished manners and an interest in the finer things , Mr. Bingham had a deep and abiding appreciation of British culture , deeper possibly than that of Walter Hines Page . Jim , on the other hand , was not concerned with the beauty of the English countryside ; he could not tell whether an earl beat a marquess and he did not bother with the mystical significance of the Crown . While he was busy with his politics and his banks , Mr. Bingham did his lawing and served for a time as mayor and local judge . The careers of the two men moved steadily along and the world never heard of either . But in 1916 Mr. Bingham married the widow of Henry Flagler ; eight months later she died suddenly and left her husband five million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courier-Journal and Louisville Times . At almost the same time the Jockey Club was being organized with both Mr. Brown and Mr. Bingham on the board , and shortly after , in February , 1919 Jim became president of the National Bank of Kentucky . Central Kentucky is one of the principal districts for the culture of Burley tobacco from which American cigarettes are made . By 1921 , following the inflated prices of the War and increased acreage , the tobacco farmers were in trouble and leaf had fallen as low as a cent a pound . Mr. Bingham promoted the Burley Tobacco Growers Co-operative , but they could get no money . The Louisville banks were not inclined to help and this offered Mr. Brown a great opportunity . In January , 1922 a meeting of tobacco farmers was held in Lexington and at this meeting Mr. Bingham announced that the War Finance Corporation would lend ten million dollars if necessary , that he himself would pledge a million , and that Mr. Brown 's National Bank of Kentucky would not only lend the bank 's limit but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country bank paper as well . This piece of business not only forced the other Louisville bankers into line and to acknowledge Jim 's preeminence ; it made his name in rural Kentucky . When the co-operative presently fell on evil days its misfortunes never touched Jim . Round him gathered a group of fervent admirers . Though Mr. Brown 's was distinctly not one of those old Louisville families , gravelled in dignity and dullness , those families were interested in him , for it seemed as though he were going to make money for everybody . His mergers and his deals spouted dollars ; he was , in fact , the works . Not only did he become a great man , but a man of mystery as well . He was known as the nocturnal banker . Rising late at his Cherokee Park home , he would " go to town in the evening to a branch of his National Bank . There he would sit at the desk of a vice-president and with barely the scratch of a pen direct his myriad affairs , political , financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later , his business associates would have to go if they wanted to talk with him . " He did not go to New York or Washington ; people had to come to him . Repro . sentatives of New York banks would cool their heels for hours , until Mr. Brown signified that he was ready to see them . Farther than Cincinnati or French Lick he would not go . It was at French Lick that he did his splendid entertaining at the Gorge Inn ? there would sometimes be as many as fifty or sixty in his party ? and Mr. Brown would generously pay the gambling losses of them all . Before long Mr. Bingham and Mr. Brown fell out ; Mr. Bingham 's name disappeared from the board of the Jockey Club . The reasons for the falling out were hazy . It was said that Mr. Bingham yearned to be governor and that Mr. Brown would n't have it . Other rumors had it that Mr. Bingham did n't find the tone of the Jockey Club exactly as he wanted it . At all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed with all their might but never managed to back a winner until the crash brought down Mr. Brown . The Jockey Club was a power not only in Louisville but in the State . One legislature had thirty members openly in the employ of the Jockey Club and the Racing Commission . In 1928 ? the year in which Harry Sinclair 's Zev won the Derby ? a traveling salesman turned Congressman became governor , despite the blasts of the Courier-Journal . As a counter-blast Mr. Brown in 1924 bought the Louisville Herald and then the Post and merged them . He was at last banker , publisher , and boss . The career of Mr. Brown 's newspaper ? like the Bank of Kentucky , it is gone now ? was startling . There were fantastic circulation drives , alley fights between the minions of Mr. Bingham and Mr. Brown ; the Herald-Post 's city room is recalled as a madhouse . The paper imported an Indian brave , Chief Thunder-water , who was received by a police band , addressed the school children , and inducted the ex-traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunderwater and showed him a fraud . At once the chief sued for half a million dollars , claiming that the disgrace had caused him " to cry and bellow as if held in pinchers ( sic ) . " At the trial , the Bingham people hotly denied any intention of discrediting Mr. Brown 's paper . Their sole intention , said one , was to " always try in a decent journalistic way to do what we can honestly to promote our own business . " But all to no purpose , Mr. Brown may have been no success as a publisher , his papers may have swallowed up millions with nothing to show for it , but Mr. Bing-ham 's candidates did n't get elected . The outcry against betting and the Jockey Club continued with no result . In 1928 it was dissolved and the tracks taken over by a holding company , the American Turf Association , with which Mr. Brown was connected . Meantime Mr. Brown 's mergers were going on . Sometime before April , 1927 it was determined to unify the ownership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another revered local institution . A majority of the stockholders approved and the stock of both banks was turned over to six voting trustees . In January , 1929 the Trust Company , under Mr. Brown 's eagle eye , absorbed two more local houses . Nothing like it had ever been heard of before in Louisville . In Nashville a Mr. Rogers Caldwell had erected a hierarchy of holding companies , banks , and insurance companies . It was going on all over the country . Then came Mr. Brown 's master stroke . In July , 1929 , three months before the crash , there was set up a Delaware corporation , the BancoKentucky Corporation , which became in effect a huge holding company controlling the Bank of Kentucky , the Louisville Trust Company and.various other banks in Kentucky and Ohio . This was the crown of Jim 's work . He had ? or so it seemed ? made a blend of Milton Smith and James Guthrie . He had become the greatest man in Louisville beyond a doubt . The amen corners in the Seelbach and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so were his deals . Bellhops reported that he took pleasure in seeing a revolving door go round and would even pay a doorman just to turn it . Despite the attacks of the Bingham papers and the bilious envy of numerous persons , there was a host of Louisvillians who , having profited already at Mr. Brown 's hands , firmly believed that he would shower down more gold upon them . There was in Louisville a brokerage house presided over by a lady ; she was Mr. Brown 's agent in many of his private transactions . She borrowed money from the Bank of Kentucky . She figured later at his trial . October , 1929 , brought the crash and , unknown to the public , the Bank of Kentucky was in trouble . Over a period of years the Comptroller of the Currency had been writing agitated letters about various loans ; these letters , it was later charged , were " tucked away in an out-of-the-way corner of the bank . " It must have been embarrassing for the Comptroller to catechize a banker who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was plain that something would have to be done and in May . 1930 a curious deal took place whereby an exchange of stocks was to be made between BancoKentucky and Rogers Caldwell 's investment house in Nashville . This combination , it was announced , would strengthen the two institutions ? no appraisal was made of Mr. CaldweIl 's assets ? and make it possible for them to serve their patrons more zealously . No use . Toward the autumn of 1930 there were rumors ; then came the crash of Caldwell and Company which rocked the entire South . In Louisville the rumors were acted upon . The bank " suffered a quiet run during the last week it was open . " Its deposits at the close of business on November 8th , 1930 were more than thirty-four million dollars . More than seven million dollars were withdrawn during the next seven days and about 80 per cent of the withdrawals were from 250 accounts On the 13th of November a receiver was appointed in Nashville for Mr. Caldwell , and the jig was up . Desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect one last merger . From Louisville Banco had moved out into Kentucky , then Ohio , and at last it had combined with Tennessee . There remained New York and at the last minute Mr. Brown tried to merge with the Transamerica Company , the creation of Mr. Amadeo Giannini , who had reached from California to New York to Milan with his banks . But it was too late . No more in the dark watches would Mr. Brown be able to leave the Gorge Inn and ? if he were so moved ? watch the constellations wheeling over French Lick and murmur the words of the director 's brother : " Bright star , would I were steadfast as thou art . " No . On the I6th of November , 1930 the National Bank of Kentucky closed its doors and went to join Nicholas Biddle and James Guthrie in the shades . The reign of James B. Brown , the last of the three kings of Louisville , was over . But where the carcass is ? Banco stock was quoted in Chicago at thirteen cents ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like mushrooms . Suits , countersuits , petitions , and Grand Juries multiplied . Within thirty days Mr. Brown had declared himself a bankrupt and presently was discharged . He was indicted by the County for embezzlement and by the Government for various deeds ? including some transactions with the lady broker ? " against the peace and dignity of the United States of America . " Yet despite the storm of obloquy and hatred loosed against Mr. Brown , his nerve remained unshaken . He had his followers still . Though rooming house landladies might refer to " Jim Brown , that owdacious man , " there were cab drivers who stood up for him . Mr. Brown himself , at his bankruptcy proceedings did not hesitate to say that " there was certainly a very determined effort on the part of someone or some interest to damage the Bank of Kentucky and the Louisville Trust Company and to destroy as they did the BancoKentucky Company . " Mr. Brown 's appearances in court were little short of personal triumphs and were plain evidence of the extraordinary hold which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arraignment on the Commonwealth charge they were early . A director of the Louisville Railway Company ( serving on another case ) left the jury box to shake hands . They " held a sort of informal levee until their names were called . . . Deputy sheriffs , court attaches and members of the jury hastened up to greet them and to chat informally . . . . The defendants also shook hands with Asst . Commonwealth 's Attorney Charles W. Logan . . and ' Bull ' Riley , Republican wheeIhorse and former Police Court Bondsman . " The embezzlement trial came on with the lady broker present " in her customary black and trailed by a Negro porter carrying an imposing stack of books and records . " One day 's session " proved to be a procession of social and financial leaders in and out of the witness box , none of whom failed to stop at the office of the Commissioner of Claims to collect their seventy-five cents witness fee . " Mr. Brown was acquitted . Slowly the judicial wheels revolved , with lawyers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banker 's Trust Company had twin receivers , one a Democrat and the other a Republican . Within a year the cost of making photostat records in a single suit had reached $35,000 ; another bank receiver had in eighteen months used up $42,656 in expenses against $45,689 in receipts . At one juncture counsel had dolefully " called the court 's attention to the fact that litigation over the Jones National Bank of Nebraska had lasted twenty-three years . " Finally the Jarndyce of all the Jarndyces , the suit of the receiver of the Bank of Kentucky against the directors was called . That there should be no doubt of the Court 's detachment in the case , a Federal judge was imported from Grand Rapids . The preliminary hearing was conducted with great pomp . " In judicial robes Judge Denison entered the chamber before forty to fifty of Louisville 's outstanding attorneys . He was preceded by a portly Negro servant who stood as the jurist took his seat and then poured him a glass of water . When he had taken the bench Judge Denison in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of ceremonies ? ' " A decree was eventually handed down against the directors and after six years has at last reached the Supreme Court . Presumably it will he argued in the autumn of 1937 . Sixty-seven per cent of the deposits of the National Bank of Kentucky were paid after strenuous negotiation and the Louisville Trust Company was reorganized . Mr. Brown was tried upon his indictments and acquitted . It was all over . But the paper castles were gone and so was the Bank , a body blow had been dealt the old families who had held the fortalice in Louisville from the days when James Guthrie led them to riches . The darkness of the depression rested on the land and in the storm of local rage and hatred Jim Brown 's power and glory vanished . Mr. Brown did n't vanish ; he stayed . People who had admired and worshipped him , who had taken favors in the boom days , looked the other way ; but the promoter 's nerve did not desert him . Presently he became a banker again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relic of a bygone day , which has been furbished up with new paint , ornamental lamps and Venetian blinds . This is the People 's Bank and there in a little office with a mulberry carpet and mahogany-tinted walls sits the president , James B. Brown , spectacles on nose , sardonically chewing a cigar . The R.F.C. which shrived so many reputations came too late for him . It is reported that Charles G. Dawes , whose Central Republic Bank and Trust Company of Chicago was lent ninety million dollars in June 1932 , said : " Mr. Brown , whenever I think of what happened to you , my blood runs cold . " The Herald-Post is gone and Mr. Bingham 's Courier-Journal and Times now enjoy a complete monopoly in Louisville . Mr. Bingham , said to be the richest man in town , has become ambassador to Great Britain , whose culture he so much admires . But the old self-sufficient days of Louisville are gone . The absentee landlords are coming , a dead Louisville boy is among those who have fallen in defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard at last . On the 3d of June , 1937 the Federal Labor Board held its first election in Louisville and while the president of the company swore that he would see his business in the river before anyone told him what to do , the Regional Director gave out the returns : Two to one for the union . All these changes perhaps occur to Mr. Brown as he sits in his office and looks out toward the muddy river flowing by . And the Ohio rolls to meet the Mississippi . . . and the Mississippi to meet the sea .
