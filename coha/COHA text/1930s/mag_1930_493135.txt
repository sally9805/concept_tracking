Two American Boys in the U. S. S. R. THE TRAIN stopped at the last Polish station and some soldiers came through and examined our passports , while others with bayonets walked up and down on each side of the train . Soon after the train started up it stopped again and some Russian soldiers got on . That was our first taste of Russia , these two soldiers with their long coats , strolling through the ' train , looking mildly around , in contrast to the Polish ones who marched through and glared fiercely at you . Then we came to the Russian border and a lot of big fellows came in and got hold of our baggage and carried it into the customs room . I looked around for the big red arch that is there , but could n't see it on account of the darkness . They made no trouble about anything that we had , and 1,10 , while waiting for train time , we went into the buffet and had a sandwich and a bottle of beer , Which cost us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a bit this way ; until you get settled and used to things you have to hand out n ' ? neY on every side . We had to pay five dollars extra fare on the big Russian train , but for that We got a bench apiece to sleep on . We could have had a mattress and pillow for a dollar apiece extra , but our funds were too low . I Our first real touch of Russia was in the station . t Was made of natural colored wood , the kind you ? tan pictures , and had red propaganda flags and plet lib tires of Lenin , Marx , Stalin and others hanging 0 out . Red soldiers were everywhere . I asked vvne of them , as best I could , what they had in the and 1 of pipe I obaascco here , and he misunderstood thought wtrying to borrow a load . He offered me some mahorka , which is terrible stuff made from a weed similar to tobacco and smells like burning cloth . Dave and I sat there eating our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By God , we 're in Russia I " In the matter of hotels in Moscow , we could n't find a single place to stay . The first night we wanted to bunk on the floor of P ? ' s apartment because he has so much room , but the hotel said No . Then we went around to several hotels and phoned a lot more , but they did n't have even a single room . Finally , at eleven o'clock at night , at the Grand , we told the man that we were going to spend the night sitting in the lobby and he did give us a room then . We are there now and have stayed here two nights at the rate of nine rubles a night . Our room is swell but of course we have to get out of here in a hurry because of the price . We visit a lot of small hotels ( there are only about twenty hotels altogether in the town , so space in them is scarce ) every day , but so far nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quakers , or Society of Friends , and met two women there . They know of a room just vacated by an American professor which they think they can get for us in two days . It costs ninety rubles a month , and we are lucky to get it for that . We arrived at the border with about forty dollars , and now we have about twenty left , with hotel bill paid to date . Moscow is the most unusual place that I have ever struck , and certainly is different from anything I have ever seen before . It is going to be hard , or certainly is now , for us to stay here . But we are determined to stick the winter out , no matter what happens . Then , if we have to leave , we shall have had that experience , and nobody can take it away from us . We feel rather unsettled but we figure that we can manage once we get going . R. K. It is bad enough to arrive in a strange , cold city , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a time to find a place to lay our heads at night is much worse . Miss E at the Quakers cheered us up a bit . She not only gave us hope that there might be one room in the whole city that we might get hold of if we are lucky , but she seems to be in the know as regards English teaching and says that although this is the worst time of the year to get a grip on things , there really is a demand for English teachers and that in a little while we may be able to get going on something . As for me , I am sure that there must be something for a couple of willing Americans to do in this big city and I intend un , earthing it sooner or later . D. K. This is Christmas Day , although it does n't seem a bit like it because the Russians do n't observe it , as it is a religious holiday . Also , with the five-day week in effect , as it is now , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . The snow on everything is beautiful and although the temperature has stuck down around four degrees above zero ( Fahrenheit ) , we do not suffer from the cold . My nose , chin and hands get a bit cold now and then , but thanks to nice woolen underwear and a marvelous high-collared coat , my body has not been cold yet . It will have to get a lot colder before it can bother either of us . We eat only one real meal a day , in the Russian style . So far we have taken this meal in the Grand Hotel , once P paying , and once the American Babbitt tractor man whom we met at P ' s the first night we were here . We eat breakfast in restaurants called stolovayas . They are poor . The one this morning would n't give us any bread . It seems that bread is on a ration . They are n't short of it , and they do n't want to be , hence this measure . They have ration cards for sugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most people eat at home , and so will we , once we get a room . We have a swell room in this hotel . I wish the government would decide we were valuable persons and give it to us free . But I did n't come to Moscow for comfort and do n't expect it . It 's good not to have it , for a change . It teaches the real values of life . Berlin for comfort . I shall spend a week there some day . But I have n't known any discomfort yet to compare with that we had on our two ships , working our way over . Our procedure in the stolovaya , when hunger drives us into one , is to walk up to a sort of cashier 's desk and mumble out what we want as best we can . The cashier gives us tickets for the price of our food and we pay her . Then we go over to the food counter and hand the tickets to the waiters behind them and they give us our food . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or standing up as we choose . Because of our small knowledge of the language , we sometimes get something entirely different from what we think we are getting . The other morning we made a dreadful mistake and got an enormous plateful of tripe . We generally get a glass of tea , bread and some sort of hot dish like buckwheat . Two bits is about as high as we like to pay for this . We are getting started now , and before long may be on our own feet . Last night we went to see 0 ? and he had another fellow there who teaches English , a Russian . They knew a lot of possible jobs for us and are working on them now . We may start some classes in a couple of days , and at any rate we shall start on the first of the year . They send some engineering groups to America to study every year and they are anxious that thesegroups have American English teachers , so that they may be able to understand them . This is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the minute we have a public class we can get into a trade union . They have several lines they are working on for us now , and assure us that it is only a matter of a short time until we get started , because there is plenty of demand for English teachers . They also said there are a lot of private people who want lessons and that we can fill in our time with these after we have public classes . We are moving out of the Grand today , thank God . D is going to put us up for the night and his young Russian friend has a mother in the hospital , so one of us will stay in her room . I hope we can get settled down some place and unpack our stuff . I went up with Ishi this morning to see where I am going to stay tonight . It is up by the station and is not an attractive spot , but we are saving what we should have to pay them at the hotel . After inspecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a plate of shchi soup , some tea and bread . I am gradually learning the names of the Russian dishes they serve in these places so that soon I shall be able to order what I want . We live a very simple life as regards food , and somehow you do n't mind it here . I would never put up with it at home . I suppose it is because you realize that there is n't anything else . Coming back here to the hotel I took a bus for the first time . They are English buses and they go like hell over the frozen streets . It 's a wonder more people are n't killed by them . R. K. I have my first job Five times a week I g ? out to the AMO Motor Works and teach a class of about four or five , from twelve-thirty to one-thirty . My students are bright and eager . They are all about thirty . They want conversation , so all I do is to sit and gossip with them for an hour a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ' After the lesson I go into the big factory dining room and have lunch . The dining room is an enormous place , with long tables running across the room , an aisle in the center . At one end is 3 cashier 's box , where food tickets are purchased . At the other end is the kitchen , where you hand 111 . your tickets in exchange for food . The food is rough and very good , better than is served in the restaurants and cheaper . The helpings are about twice the size of the restaurant servings . I have given just two lessons so far . Both tunes I had a large dish of excellent cabbage soup with a large piece of meat and sour cream in it . An enormous piece of black bread goes with it . After devouring that I felt full . It costs about eight cents . D. K. My pupils put me through a thorough quiz 9 ? how and why I came here and what are the exact i conditions of workers in America . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to the workers ' conditions I had to tell them that they were different in different industries and in the various parts of the country . They love to ask personal questions , but on the whole it is fun . I have also a private pupil . He reads English well and wants practice in conversation . He is intelligent and wide-awake and is now studying the methods of the Bell Telephone Company in America . For each lesson he will pick some phase of the telephone business and give me a lecture on it . This makes an interesting and instructive hour for me and he pays me three rubles for it . I have my eye on several more group classes and several more private lessons . It is a slow job to get anything started here , but we hope to be well under way soon . I like Moscow better hour by hour . It has the nicest , quaintest , little winding streets of any city I have seen so far . This morning I went into a market place . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is much larger . Inside , under the towering roof , are a lot of little stores or booths . It is almost like a little town in one building . They have every sort of store imaginable . I walked back through some little curving streets and entered the market by the back way . These streets are narrow , and twist around , and every now and then go under an archway . There are a lot of interesting-looking magazines in the little magazine shops around the streets . They have excellent pictures in them . As soon as we have a better command of this Russian language we shall buy a lot of them . We spend almost as much money on stamps as we do on food ? It costs fourteen kopecks to send a letter to the States , and it mounts up . , We have to work a month on some public thing before we can join a union and get our food tickets so that we may buy food in the markets and eat a t home . But we are getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt insecure in the town , in the restaurants and on the street cars . But n ? 11T we are old hands and do n't care who stares at us . We order food in the restaurants , jump on Street cars , bump people on the street , mangle them W In the tram crowds , just like the other inhabitants . e are continually astounding people with our ki ilftledge of the winding streets of the town . The 1 ? tiger we are here , the better we like it . D. K. I notice a bourgeois tendency among the people to dress up in ties , suits and white shirts . The Pe. ? Ple at the theaters look like a poor version of a middle-class theater crowd in America . Of course , athere are a lot who still dress the way they please ti vcl there are the uniforms , but I fear that the b oth Predominate . I wear what I please . We are uoth happy , healthy and in excellent spirits . la ' ell , we have our little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " b is the cause of our getting it . Our hst , B , happened to drop in on him and D asked him if he knew of a room , with the result that we are installed here , paying sixty rubles a month . It is about the size of a small garage . For furniture we have one three-quarter bed , a big desk , two chairs and a wardrobe . Our bedclothes consist of one blanket and a sheet . When we throw our nice heavy overcoats on top of us we are warm and comfy as can be , so comfortable that it is hard to get up in the morning . It is only temporary , we hope , as we have to pass through the room of our host and his wife to enter our den , and this makes it unhandy . Friend host is a fellow of my age and he has been married four years . He was a Count before the revolution . His family emerged from obscurity when one of his ancestors became a lover of Catherine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seems happy , although God knows what . kind of work he can do in this country , considering his ancestry . They never give that kind of person a job with any trust attached to it . They are very nice to us and feed us tea every chance they get . R. K. My pupils are all crazy to go to America . They say they have nothing to learn from us economically , but a lot scientifically . They told me today about the pensions and arrangements made for mothers in the factories of the U. S. S. R. I knew it already , but it was interesting to hear it first hand . I tell them about graft , bootlegging , roads , buildings , colleges and other things in America . We have received copies of X ? ' s articles about Russia in The S Magazine . Almost every statement in them was an out and out lie , and those that were not actually flat lies were very misleading . I 've been in Moscow three weeks now and I have n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare foot . I read these articles to my class to show them what people read about them in America . They laughed and held their sides . If someone told you that droves of wild buffalo were continually stampeding through the streets of San Francisco , you would feel about as they did when I read them that cock-and-bull story of X ' s . You would think a reputable periodical would be ashamed to print it . D. K. We have now been here one day over three weeks . I feel like an old resident . I have started in on my newspaper job with Y . I can see that it is going to be an interesting job . Today Y ? took me over to meet one of the censors . He asked about some kind of correspondents ' card for me and the man said he thought it could be arranged . Every news cable that goes out has to be passed by the censor , so it is important to know them . R. K.
