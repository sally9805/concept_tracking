AN ADMIRAL NEVER FORGETS-Vice-Admiral Humphrey Hugh Smith , D.S.O. <P> - Lippincott ( $5 ) . <P> Admiral Humphrey Hugh Smith , D.S.O. , spent 37 years in the British Navy , but never polished up the handle of any big front door . Now retired , with bluff British candor he admits : " I spend my time on meditating on my utterly misspent but thoroughly enjoyable past . " Though he served all through the War , he never mentions that he ever saw action , is mum 's self on the subject of his D.S.O. <P> What he can not get out of his delighted memory are the japes , pranks , hearty horseplay and lurching humor that apparently ballasted every ship he ever served on . <P> How he ever got to be an admiral of anything but the horse marines is a mystery which his unrepentant-schoolboy reminiscences do not help to solve . <P> The Admiral 's sense of humor is more Minsky than Gilbertian : the gunrooms and wardrooms that housed him and his mates were no places for sisters , cousins or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : sometimes the sea made him sick , but never thoughts of home . He has not forgotten the name of a single one of his ships , or where they took him-the Mediterranean , the Pacific , the Bering-Sea , the South Seas-and every ship , cruise and station gave him an anecdote-souvenir to tuck away in his sea chest . <P> He once heard an old salt settle an argument about the extent of the Admiralty 's legal authority : ' ' I tells you all that the Admiralty can do what they like with us . They can hang us , they can shoot us , and they can drown us . There 's only two things they ca n't do to us : they ca n't boil us in the coppers and they ca n't put us in the family way . " He is equally delighted to remember the disdain of one Chawbags Bayly for the microscopic difference between senior and junior mid- shipmen . Said Chawbags : " I can never see that there is any more difference between a senior midshipman and a junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cowpat . " Occasionally the force of his anecdotes is somewhat weakened by the necessity of bowdlerizing ' navy lingo into such terms as " simian-faced son of a spinster , " or " blood-stained Bulgarians . " Sailor Smith spent the War in " Trousers Pulling Down Contests " ( " the officer whose brace buttons first touched the deck lost the contest " ) with his brother officers in the wardroom . Between times he commanded armed merchant cruisers , aircraft carriers . The War over , he hitched up his trousers and went ashore to preside over the Royal Naval College at Greenwich . <P> Even here his affinity for anecdotes pursued him . His voluble housekeeper ( whose father had worked in a gasworks and naturally died of a gastric ulcer ) complained that her niece insisted on becoming a nurse , so " I always tells her that 's just the job for her , as she has got a heart like a flint , and she loves the sight of blood .
