txt Since announcing that it proposed to build a kraft plant in Florida , financed through the sale of new securities , Container Corp . of America has been approached with a number of proposals which may obviate the necessity of new financing on Its part . Theac proposals include offers to furnish the bulk of the capital needed to build the new plant , with Container 's Investment in the property restricted to an amount it could finance out of treasury cash . Others have offered to build a southern kraft plant if Container would enter into a long-term contract to take a substantial part of the kraft pulp output on a cost-plus basis . Any of the proposals would give Container the kraft source it Is seeking without the necessity of new financing on its part and therefore without affecting the position of Its capital stock .
