THE GREAT MAN A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIST BY JULIAN RUTLEDGE C LATTER , bang , clang ! The creak of the tram rounding the corner ; bells , horns . Beneath his mound of cerise quilted satin , in the corner bed of the Swiss hotel bedroom de luxe , Felix opened one eye unwillingly , and quickly shut it again . Lord , how comfortable it was , this early morning beatitude  --  dark , warm , the penetrating fingers of the Geneva fog serving only to make one revel in the ecstasy of burrowing deeper into the delicious eiderdown . Something more penetrating than the fog filtered through his drowsy bliss : Manchuria ! For a blessed six hours he 'd forgotten it , and everything . Now  --  must see Cecil , the Czech delegate too , before the Drafting Committee meeting at nine-thirty . Nine thirhe gave the scarlet duvet a rebellious jerk . Adela 's blond head was completely hidden under hers . Would n't stir for another hour , thank God . He coughed cautiously . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his throat .. . months of meetings ahead . He 'd talked from nine yesterday morning till almost two of this one . What a life ! And this was success , this was being Foreign Minister . Wonder if Sternoff had seen the Czech man . Sternoff was intelligent , could handle these snappy modern diplomatists and the old-school courtier type as well . What a party old Boner had given them last night ! Glorious old boy  --  brains , magnetism , oratory . Must see him , too , before they " went in " this morning . Could n't take chances on that Resolution . Carstairs , the Tientsin financial expert , was too tricky . Cold as Mt . Blanc , that gentleman , and about as approachable . Mrs. Minturn seemed to know how to manage him though . How people had any vitality left for women-1 He groaned and dived deeper into the pillows . The travelling watch on the night-table tinkled smartly . Eight o'clock . Adela sighed slightly . Must n't wake Adela . There 'd he enough of that later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shivered across to the bath , closing the bedroom door carefully behind him . The smell of faded roses was in the unaired sitting room . His desk was littered with invitations . The early post had been discreetly poked under the door  --  a small whirlpool of letters , official documents , the Agenda for the Day , the Journal de Geneve . He grasped the newspaper , turned at once to his speech of the day before , and read it from end to end . Not bad . He 'd done better . Still , not bad . Nor the editorial comment either . " The youngest and most magnetic of the Foreign Ministers . . compelling personality . . . athletic figure . . . tall good looks " . . . He turned to the long mirror , regarded himself in his somewhat tousled mauve pajamas , and turned away again . No  --  eight o'clock in the morning , and before shaving  --  decidedly it was n't fair . He bathed , shaved , rang for tea . Then , before tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It began the moment one 's eyes opened and continued all day  --  all night too , till one 's eyes exhaustedly closed , round two A.M. Would he receive the Ladies ' Committee on Moral Disarmament at three that afternoon ? Would he address the International Relations luncheon on Thursday at one ? Young Mr. Meacham reminding him about his radio address this evening  --  a world-wide hook-up --  " oh , anything er  --  broad , and cheerful , do n't you know ; perhaps not too trenchant under present rather depressing conditions . " The commissionaire from the Secretariat  --  Sir Eric Drummond 's compliments , and might he see the Minister for a few moments before the morning session . . . had the Minister received the latest Japanese communiques ? Messenger on the way . . . " Qui , m'sieu le Ministre , merci m'sieu , au ' voir , m'sieu . " He poured his tea . He was tired to death already . Sternoff came in with a bunch of telegrams . He dictated replies . They talked for a quarter of an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , in sky-blue peignoir , meticulously made up , hair intricately correct even at this early hour ; smiling indulgently at young Sterna . ( " One 's husband 's secretary is so important , my dear ; so very useful , or so devastating . He can simply make or mar one 's plans . " ) In one hand she held a letter , in another a red engagement book  --  the bane of Felix 's existence . " Good morning , Felix  --  do n't forget we 're lunching the French delegation to-day , dear , and dining with the Spaniards . You 'll have just time to dash back and change after your radio talk . And the Press men are coming at three-thirty . I 'll send the car back for you . I 'm having bridge at the Club and going on to the Contessa 's for cocktails . And , Felix , I had a letter from your sister Irene , and she says the children simply wo n't bear it unless we bring them out here for the holidays . Bennie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very saucy to the Sisters , and Irene thinks she 's outgrown the convent anyway , and Irene simply must have some more money . Do remember to tell Sternoff , wo n't you , dear ? " Oh , by the way , Felix , I think we must do something for the Boriersthat was a very grand dinner , you know . We could take them up to St. Cergues for lunch on Sunday , and Mrs. Minturn  --  she 's making a dead set at you , but she 's a very influential woman ? I 'd be nice to her , dear , if I were you . Are you free on Sunday ? Oh , well ( consulting the red book ) , just three or four little things . Do n't worry , I 'll fix it . " And with another bright , all too competent smile , Adela and her blue fishtail vanished into the bedroom . Whew ! He mopped his brow , raced through half a dozen letters , grinned affectionately over Bennie 's , frowned over the bank statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? now perhaps he could read his paper and look through those communiques . Sternoff popped in again . " Some more telegrams , just arrived , sir . And the young lady from the Excelsior is here to interview you , and the Minister of Marine will be waiting downstairs in twenty minutes . " " Thanks . Wire another thousand to my sister 's account , will you , Boris , and send these cables , and get me the THE GREAT MAN 3S1 Paris embassy on the telephone  --  I want to speak to the Ambassador before we take the vote this morning . Oh , and what 's this about poor old Gregory ? I just had a message saying his wife 's been hurt . Motor accident ? dying ? Poor old chap ! Taking the afternoon train , eh ? Well , fix him up , Boris . If it 's something expensive use my personal account  --  mind he has everything . And now send in the Excelsior girl . . . by George , it 's five to nine ! " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip into his dressing room and look at himself again . Better this time . Lean , tall , a bit haggard ? still , that was rather becoming . Plenty of hair , thank God  --  thick and black , " going a bit gray round the temples " in the true statesmanlike manner . That war scar did n't show so much any more . Mouth close , a bit grim ; contradictorily contemplative gray eyes ; the bold aquiline nose of the ruler . A knock . He gave a hasty brush to his hair , and returned to the sitting room . There , instead of the pert Gallic Margot or Suzanne he 'd expected , he found an English girl with blue eyes and brown hair , and something vaguely familiar about her . " Good morning , " he said pleasantly ; " have n't we . JP " Met before ? Yes  --  do n't you remember ? At the Peace Conference . My father was Edward Darcy . " " Of course ! " Darcy , the biggest journalist of war-time . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix had known him in a dozen capitals . Killed in an airplane , on his way to South America . And this was his daughter  --  used to be a tall kid with freckles . He turned to her with none of the gallant jocularity he usually reserved for lady reporters . " Your father was a remarkable man , " he said bluntly . " What can I do for you ? " " Give me an impressive interview . " She smiled at him out of her attractive dark blue eyes . " I 'm only doing bits now , but I 'm to have a good post in a month or two , if I make good . " They covered a good deal of ground during the next swift three minutes . Life in Geneva had always to be swift , tense , hurrying on to the next crowded quarter of an hour . Rapidly they dashed from one topic to another of the European political scene . She asked him the usual stock questions ; he returned the expected ambiguous answers . Then , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down her note-book , leaned towards him with her hands on her knees , like an impulsive boy , " Now ! " she said , " that 's enough of that . Now tell me what you really think  --  what 's really important . What would you have thought worth talking about with father , if he were here ? " He laughed , relieved . " Lim . . well , let me see . . . " " Felix " ? Adela opened the door and looked in ? " Madame Casablanca has telephoned to know if you will meet the women 's peace societies here instead of ? oh , good-morning , mademoiselle . " " My dear , " Felix interrupted decisively , " this is Miss Darcy . Edward Darcy 's daughter . " " Delighted . " Her Excellency extended a gracious hand . The press was important , as she was always telling Felix . Madame Casablanca was disposed of ; Adela withdrew . The Minister looked at his watch . Telephone ! " Yes , speaking . No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home office within thirty-eight hours ? ! I 'm coming along now , wait for me . " I 'm so sorry " ? he turned to the waiting girl apologetically . " We must have another talk  --  after this rush lets up a little . " Miss Darcy rose . " You 've been awfully nice to me , " she said in her forthright frank way . " It 's good to see that success has n't spoiled you . I suppose no big man has ever had such a phenomenally quick rise  --  no one so young . " " Nonsense " ? he heard it all day , yet somehow , being human , it rather pleased him ? " bit of luck , that 's all . " Felix stuffed the Journal de Geneve into his pocket , caught up his coat and despatch case . They went out into the corridor together . At the lift he met Bonier . The old fellow looked him over shrewdly , then beyond , at the disappearing girl . " I see your first interview of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You old reprobate ! Ride with me . " On their way to II the Secretariat they discussed foreign loans , Manchuria , and the American Congress . It was a cold , glistening December day , with the sun seeping bleakly through the mists over the Lake , and the young secretaries hurrying along the Quai Wilson , stamping their feet and blowing on their hands to keep warm . Then , arriving at the Palais des Nations  --  the shabby gray-green building that always gave Felix a sneaking thrill ? " brave , battered , but still standing ! " He knew he would never like the grand new one on the hill half so well . Other cars rolling up . . . the moving-picture men . . . he and Bonier resignedly consenting to pose . . . . They went in out of the clear , cold morning air , into the hot stuffy corridors filled with smoke , papers , and chatting men . Men of fifty countries  --  swarthy men , pale men , yellow men , brown men , white , coffee-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-shaking -- Lord , how they did hand-shake in diplomacy ! Half an hour of final argument in his office with the Drafting Committee . Bonier and Cecil backed him up handsomely . That was all right . In the corridor again , other people waiting for him  --  Phelan , Benes , Rappard. " lion jour , mon cher .. . morning , Darrow .. h'llo , Tommy  --  oh , Dr. Yen , just a moment . " Through the cordial groups and into the historic room at the end of the hall ? the Glass Room  --  where at ten o'clock Felix was to preside over a public session of the Council . It was already full : the Press ; women ; tourists ; sturdy , intelligent looking Genevese . The famous Horse-Shoe Table . . . . The long windows looking onto the windswept Lake . . . . People streaming in . More smoke , more handshakes . Drummond . . . final documents , telegrams . The fourteen delegates taking their places ; behind them , the various groups of experts , juniors , Labor Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid his watch on the table ? " La seance est ouverie  --  the session is open , " the interpreter repeated . " The Council will listen to the delegates from Japan and China , and to the reading of the Resolution . " The little Japanese began to drone through his usual histoire about bandits , " protecting our nationals , the tremendous investments of Japanese capital and energy , et cetera , et cetera . " Felix looked gravely attentive . Damn those wing collars . His chin hurt where he had cut it this morning . He glanced round the Council Table at thirteen other grave attentive faces . What was going through their minds ? His own ( never missing a word of the Japanese symphony ) , like an expert skater 's , skirted the edges of a score of things . THE GREAT MAN 3S3 President of the Council of the League of Nations ! Who would have thought , seven years ago , when he had come an obscure but eager " junior , " aide to the Minister  --  that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old Minister died , the new one lasted only two months , the Socialists went out , Felix 's party came in , and Felix himself , who knew more about international relations than any man in his country , Felix became Foreign Minister , and Adela could behold " H.E . " in front of her already quite august name . Maybe in another two months he 'd be out , too . No , that was n't likely . His country had few first-rate political men . His post was there as long as he wanted it . " The delegate from China , " he announced impressively . The dignified Chinese gentleman rose , amid a buzz of interested anticipation . How long would he want it ? God , how tired he was . No holiday since July a year ago . Meetings , dinners , and Adela . All that thick food , and the eternal sauces flavored with a sticky wine . He smiled wryly at the diplomatic tradition of gorgeous banquets and a gay and dazzling existence . " A day laborer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eight-hour day indeed ! Lucky if one got six hours off for sleep , any night . As for the rest of the twenty-four .. . His tired but active mind raced on . Must try to get home for two days next week . . . fix up the commercial treaty with Italy . . . see the Prime Minister . Letters and wires were no good after a certain time . Three days en route  --  that would be his sixth journey in two months . He must go to England soon again , too . Planes , Pullmans , Channel steamers . Fortunately he could sleep anywhere . But the perpetual swaying motion  --  and all the different kinds of motion  --  didsomething to one 's head after a while , to one 's general equilibrium . And all the different sets of " problems " and ideas ! He remembered poor old Norlin who 'd cracked up last winter , Norlin standing outside one of the Quai d'Orsay buildings and saying , " Let 's see , what is it we discuss here ? Reparations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? " Reparations , the Corridor , Mandates , Manchuria . . . World Politics ! How grand it sounds  --  and it is grand , thought Felix , but terrific too . " The Council will now listen to the reading of the Resolution . " Must n't let one 's mind run along those lines . His alert gray eyes roved among the visitors  --  Wells , Steed , Madame da Gara , Mrs. Minturnexquisitely serious in sables ; ugly and attractive Frau Schroeder ; and there was Adela , smart and brisk in her correct dark red trotteur , priming up for intelligent conversation at luncheon . " So well informed , so clever , the ideal diplomat 's wife . What a lucky man ! " Incense was as necessary to Adela as manicures and linger-waves . She lived for the respectful plaudits of the young secretaries , the admiring murmurs of their wives . Oh , well , plenty of acolytes always in diplomacy . How lucky to be able to get what one wanted , so easily . What did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Montesquieu . To write a modern comedy . A really good modern comedy  --  three acts of racy dialogue , biting comment , wellworked-out patchwork of ironic events , astutely pieced together . He remembered a talk he had had with Loring years ago , in their early days as young secretaries at Stockholm . He and Loring had had almost the same history : old families , in their respective countries ; longing to write , but popped into diplomacy by their fathers as a matter of course , directly after the university ; married early , to a " nice girl " of the proper caste , with plenty of money and who would produce the requisite number of heirs  --  all the paraphernalia of the " old regime , " into which one was born , and against which no correctly brought-up young nobleman of prewar days had much chance of rebelling . Well , his children would know nothing about all that . Bennie had already announced that be was going to be an automobile salesman ; Lola , a decorator . They would probably marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family seal absently round his finger . Tradition  --  modern people said there was nothing to it . Bennie and Lola already made " cute " modern jokes about it , " to tease father . " For a moment he saw the somber battered crest of his family , over the fireplace in the huge old feudal hall , the tattered flags , his own father , with whom he would be standing there in a week or two  --  eighty , white , gnarled , somehow very splendid . He could hear that stern voice as it had rung out with implacable dignity once years ago : " No , sir , you shall not marry her , sir ! I ca n't help what you have promised  --  you have other duties . The 27 men of our tribe . . . There had been a girl . A girl with a beautiful bead and quiet ways , whose people had been as long in the region as theirs , only farmers , not the nobility . Felix had loved her . One night during the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and be married . But an intercepted letter brought discovery , scenes , anger . The affair was quickly hushed up . The girl had been wonderful ; Felix shamed and miserable . But he was not allowed to utter a word . His career was speeded up , Adela quickly brought upon the scene ; promotion , new places , the children . Great heavens ! the Chinese had stopped . Dead silence . Everybody was waiting , looking at him . He came back sharply to Manchukuo and the Nine-Power Treaty , and for the next fifteen minutes " summed up " furiously . He administered a tart rebuke to the Japanese , snubbed Cecil , refused the floor to Motta ( whom he liked tremendously ) , raked over a dozen legal findings and precedents . At exactly one minute to one he adjourned the session , with a crisp reminder of recall for the vote at four . And when he 'd finished the comedy , Felix decided , stalking out of the Council Chamber grandly , he 'd write a really good volume on Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old dodos who 'd looked at him so superiorly ! III The car again  --  gazing out into the bright noon sunlight , enviously . If only one might walk to the hotel ! Several of the younger men were striding off  --  lucky devils . But this eternal scourge of no time , whisked from hotel to Assembly , from Assembly to hotel , from hotel to dinner or supper at some delegation apartment . He ran up the steps to his room , two at a time . A hasty wash , ten minutes for the noon mail ; down again to the lounge and the amiable sophisticated faces of the Frenchmen . Bonier , Girand , De nret  --  all his friends ; and the youngsters , a nice lot , just the right " note " with him , half rallying , half homage . Adela , now in ultra chic dull black , with her black pearls , was already dispensing aperitifs . A buzz of amusing friendly greeting , witty comment on the morning 's " tapi.sserie Orientale " ; just the right subtle compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often in politics ; but in the round of daily life , what a godsend ! Why could n't the rest of the world take life as sanely ? Why could n't he ? He scowled into a passing perambulator piled with oily hors d'auvres . The mere sight of another sardine or Russian salad . . . " consomme and cold beef for me , Louis , " he ordered briefly , " and a bit of Cheddar to top off with . " " Oui , Monsieur le Ministre . " They sat down . Giraud began a spirited discussion of Japanese psychology , then to dissect Stravinsky , Litvinoff , and the Russian complex . This was the best hour of Felix 's day , his payment for the other hours and hours of boredom and drudgery : sharp , pungent talk , the seasoned talk of good minds  --  the best in Europe , perhaps in the world . MacDonald , the Indian Round Table , the Spanish Syndicalists , the London Economic Conference  --  all the easy intimacies of a group who met constantly , knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sufficiently , anyhow . He loved the logical French mind , the clear , beautifully enunciated French language . How that language lent itself to comedy ! He would write his first comedy in French . Slyly he led the conversation round to the classic perfections of the Comedic Francaise . Boxier and De FOret joined in . The divine French vocables rolled on . Adela at her end was admirable . Food and drink proceeded smoothly at the proper intervals . Now she was signalling him . In the lounge he saw anxious peering female faces : the ladies of the Moral Disarmament Committee ? bon dieu , already ? Chairs were scraped back , coffee-cups abandoned . Agreeable adieux from the French ; Adela vanishing upstairs . Now he was round another table , in the chaste sails de lecture of the second floor . The robust Madame Casablanca , sentimental Made-moiselle Morio , Frau Schroeder of the black cigars were bombarding him with plans , suggestions , complaints , programs  --  especially complaints . " We bear petitions from six million women of the world , monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ignored . " He thought the entire six million must be there . And they all wanted to be first  --  to lead . After three quarters of an hour of it his head buzzed intolerably . " Ladies , " he said finally , " let us take three days to make peace among ourselves . Then perhaps we can see about attending to the peace of the world . " He bowed and made his exit . Maybe now he could get five minutes in the sun on the terrace before the newspaper men . . . No , there was Streit already , waiting for him . Sternoff interrupted first with some messages . Disturbing late news from Tokio . They 'd changed the calendar ? secret session of the Council this evening , Public Session this afternoon , Disarmament to-morrow . That meant writing another speech after he 'd get home to-night , after his radio talk , after his delegation meeting , after .. . He turned from Sternoff abruptly and went into the smoking room with the press men . This was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine astute faces represented several hundred millions of people  --  ears , votes , action  --  that all-powerful ogre , Public Opinion . For a tense twenty minutes he talked , weighing every word , shooting hard every point that he wanted to drive home . Nine men , smoking , listening , considering ; polite , but unenthusiastic ? " the real powers of the world , " he thought , " ten times more powerful than nine Foreign Ministers . " His headache grew worse . Two calls came through  --  one from his Premier at home , one from Curtius in Berlin . The press men departed , a young man from the Roumanian Legation came . As he went up in the lift to his own sitting room , the concierge told him , " The President of the French Republic has been shot . " Another funeral ! This meant going to Paris , of course  --  in the midst of everything , Council , Assembly , Disarmament Bureau , his Commission  --  and now this ! He went into the bedroom , dropped into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " Like a woman , " he thought disgustedly . But he could n't help it . It was too much  --  life simply was n't worth living . He could n't go on . Adela opened the door , panoplied for the afternoon fray  --  silver fox , orchids , osprey , ten-guinea perfume . " Why , Felix dear , " she exclaimed , " whatever is the matter ? Do n't you know it 's almost four ? Hurry , darling , you 'll he late for the Council . How did the press interview go ? " Felix did n't budge . He looked at her with a wintry smile . " And what if I were ? " he queried . " What if I were late for everything ? What if I never appeared at anything again ? What 's all this hurry and scurry and race and tension for ? I 'm tired to death . I 've no sleep . I sit in thick heavy rooms all day , breathing filthy air . I get no exercise , no proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see my children . " " Felix , my dear  --  is it really as bad as that ? " " It 's awful . So awful that I " ? in his utter desperation , he took a chance : spoke to her as a friend , another human being . " Five years ago , " he said , " I started spinning . If ever I should stop spinning I should probably die . " Adcla patted him on the shoulder kindly . Poor darling , worn out  --  a bundle of nerves . " Well , dear , " she said cheerily , " then one must help you to keep on spinning , must n't one ? And that 's my job . But we must get you out to the country more ? $t . Cergues on Sundays . We might take a little lodge up there , it would be nice to invite people . . .. Now Felix dear , I must hurry ; there 's a bridge at the Club for the asylum for borderland cases  --  not really crazy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix , I 'd better have some money . " He handed her a thousand francs , without a word . The closing of a door , the click of a purse  --  or was it the crack of a whip he heard ? " Gregory 's waiting to say good-by , sir . " Gregory  --  oh , yes , to be sure  --  Gregory . Wife dying , motor accident , going home . He got up and walked mechanically into the sitting room . Gregory was standing by the window ? a great hulk of a man , homely , intelligent , kind . He 'd been with Felix since the early days ; helped him through many a hard spot , with his careful , thorough knowledge and methodical ways . " Well , Gregory , " he said , awkwardly . Gregory clutched his hand . " My wife , sir , my wife ! " he cried , the tears that he had so valiantly controlled all day streaming down his face . " She 's dying , they ca n't save her , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . Oh , God ! Excellency , do something , find a doctor who can save her ! Oh forgive me , Excellency , I know I have no right to talk to you like this , but I 'm crazy , I 'm in hell  --  she 's my all , Iadore her . I 'm the most wretched man on earth ! " Felix pushed him down into a chair , stood with his hand on the heaving shoulders . " I think , " he said distinctly , " you 're the luckiest man on earth . Yes ! " ? as Gregory flung his head up ? " did it ever occur to you what it means to have a wife like that , to have known a woman whom you can feel about like that ? " Gregory 's shoulders grew quieter . " And now my dear old chap , " he said abruptly , " I must be getting back to the Council . Good-by , my dear Gregory . God bless you . Wire if you need anything  --  promise me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I 'll never forget  --  never . And God bless you , Excellency . " " I hope He will . I need it , " said Felix . The door closed behind Gregory . How did men stand this sort of thing ? year after year , day after day ? Think of all the agony going on round the whole world , tugging at one 's mind and heartstrings . . . the twisted face of a universe in agony . . . every conceivable kind of torture . . Must n't run on like this . Dangerous , he reminded himself again . He looked longingly at his bed . If he could have just ten minutes .. I Sternoff poked his head in . " Almost four , sir . " " Coming ! " IV A taut two hours between the coldly furious Orientals . Not so much dignity now , less velvet sheathing of actual feeling . " Did the Chinese nation realize the serious consequences of this hour if . . . " " The hour is not so serious for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . Four hundred million people .. . China can become the most powerful militaristic nation on earth . It rests with you , what you do here in this room during these next few minutes . . The packed Council Chamber was tensely quiet . Other delegates spoke , Colban , Gori , De Madariaga . A last desperate effort to bring the parties together , to recall the solemn promises , the Covenant , the Kellogg Pact , the lessons of the past . They went over and over it . And always the smoke grew thicker , the air worse . Finally Felix reread the Resolution and demanded the roll-call . " L'Allemagne , l'Anglelerre , la Belge , le Czechoslovakia l'Espagne . " Quick and terse came the replies , " Oui , oui , yes , yes , oui ! " Every State voted solidly for the Resolution , the interested parties alone abstaining . It was a dramatic and impressive proceeding . In the midst of it Felix caught sight of the lovely profile of Mrs. Minturn , turned towards him earnestly . When at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impatiently hunting for his car , there she was again . " Oh , let me drive you , may n't I ? I 've wanted so much to finish our talk of last night , and now these desperately grave events . I know bow weary you must be . Let me take you home with me and give you some refresh-ment . " Some refreshment ! He gazed into the beautiful golden eyes . Just at that moment Miss Darcy came out onto the steps . She gave him a friendly nod . At that moment also Adela and their own car appeared . " Felix darling , I 'm so sorry . Sternoff said you 'd probably not be adjourning for hours , and the Contessa and I had to stop at the Bergues to arrange for  --  oh , Mrs. Minturn , will you take him ? So kind ! I 'm simply deluged to-day . " Felix looked from one to the other of the two beautiful and very chic women , smiling amiably at each other . " Thank you .. . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll allow me , " he announced with sudden decision , as his eyes rested on the clean-cut tweed shoulders of the girl just passing . She turned . " I 'd love it , " she said simply . Leaving the two amazed ladies and their limousines , they swung off together round the corner and down to the Quai . " I hope you do n't mind , " Felix apologized . " My head  --  that session ? I felt I could n't stand being shut up in a car . I 'm only going to the radio " You 're very tired , " said Eve Darcy , with a soft abruptness that he found very attractive . " And no wonder , the pace they put you through . Tell me  --  all the meetings , the discussions , the energy spent in drafting these eternal documents and things that never seem to get anywhere  --  is there anything that makes it worth while ? After months and months of it , when you go away from Geneva , do you feel that there 's anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course  --  the League itself , " Felix returned immediately . " Just the fact that it exists , that we 're working for it to go on existing , and some day to be a full-fledged efficient organ of government , instead of the feeble struggling baby trying to crawl , against great odds . " His tired face lighted up . He forgot his despairing protest to Adela , a few hours ago , in the strength of the major idea . " But everybody 's saying the League has failed , " said Edward Darcy 's daughter , a worried line between her young eyes , as they strode along companionably . " All this Manchurian business , and the Disarmament stalemate , and . . . " " 1 know  --  that 's one of the most encouraging signs . In 1920 people expected nothing whatever from an international peace machinery  --  the very idea was thought fantastic . Today they expect everything , and sayexasperatedly the thing has failed ' . " " I 'd never thought of it like that . " " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished , not realizing how amazing it is that anything 's been accomplished at all . After worts of war institutions , they 've grown to believe in a peace institution in twelve years , and to be highly annoyed if it does n't function perfectly and at once ! Is n't that rather sublime ? " " I suppose  --  it all looked so different at the Peace Conference . We thought . . . " " Yes , we were pretty naive . Because people had suffered so much , we expected a sort of cosmic change of heart overnight . But things do n't happen that way . It takes time to build great institutions . " Why when I was a young man , " continued Felix , warming to his subject , " if anybody had told me that I should live to see the day when European statesmen would gather round a table even to try to talk over their affairs .. . " " They do n't actually do much , though , do they ? " " They 're doing the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of trying to work together , instead of as bitter rivals . Every time I stand there and look out over the Assembly Hall , at those brown and black and white and yellow faces , smiling and nodding to one another  --  just the fact that they 're there seems to me a miracle . " They had reached the radio building before they knew it . The girl held out her hand . " Thank you , " she said . " You 've given me a lot  --  you put things in a different perspective . I 'm glad we 've got you ! " He gripped the firm hand . " Thank you too , You have given me my radio talk , " he said smiling . " I was wondering what on earth I was going to THE GREAT MAN SSD say . Now I 've got it the undefeatable idea ! " He went into the radio hall almost buoyantly ; gave a very simple talk and a very good one . Later , at the secret session , he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coquetry , no mincing  --  how weird the effect human beings had on one another ; how this person imprisoned you , that person set you free . The secret session dragged on for two hours . At half-past nine , returning to the hotel , he snatched some dinner and went on to his delegation meeting . He was to deliver his country 's address to the Disarmament Conference to-morrow , and now he had to hear the delegation comments . He had handed them a memorandum of his chief points that afternoon . They were waiting for him in his sitting room , ten or twelve of them . He could n't help smiling at that parliamentary expression on the bland well-fed faces of his fellow-countrymen , who took the international game as they took their horses and women  --  intelligently , but not too seriously -- with the sportsmen 's desire to acquit themselves well . He knew just how they regarded him ? a rather mad , rather brilliant elder brother . They came to him for everything , smiled indulgently behind his back at what they called his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MacDonald to the delegates of other nations , and devoutly hoped he would n't wreck them by outlandish promises in the Assembly that nobody could possibly expect the people at home to live up to . " Now , my dear fellow , be sensible . After all , we want a loan from France . " " You know , old chap , if that commercial treaty with Italy did n't go through . .. we must n't put their backs up , must we ? " " Are you delegates to a Disarmament Conference or a Munitions Manufacturers ' Meeting ? " he asked tersely . " The only thing that will stop war is to make the manufacture of arms illegal . If we do n't put that in our speech we might as well go home . " Patiently again he went over it with them . Animated argument , some minor concessions on both sides  --  chiefly as to language . At one o'clock they broke up , weary and yawning . Felix and Sternoff worked for another half hour , reassembling , changing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adela looked in , drooping with fatigue after her evening at the Bergues Charity Ball . " No , very boring .. . you were lucky to escape . Are n't you coming to bed , dear ? You look a wreck . " " Pretty soon . My speech , you know . .. I 'll have some coffee . " He rang the bell . Adela said goodnight and disappeared . Felix drank his coffee , leaned his head against the high-backed armchair behind his writing table . They were all gone  --  finally . He was alone . The clock on the Place struck two . Steps along the corridor ceased . Adela 's brief movements in the bedroom also . No more motor horns or clang of trams along the quai . Silence settled down upon the city . What an eternity since that blissful silence of one 's early waking . What a day ! ? though no different from countless other days . He wondered what the Chinese Minister was thinking  --  wager he was n't in bed . And all the other anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment , drinking coffee and chewing their pencils , and wondering what in God 's name to do about this , that , and the other . He could see them as they sat , night after night , in a succession of libraries round the world  --  Paris , Rome , Washington , Vienna . . . many of them friends of his , men still alive , and men now gone . Presences he had known and loved  --  Balfour , Briand , Stresemann , Haldane . God , the relief of being alone ! Undiluted , unpressed , for a blessed few minutes . His mind uncluttered by the minutiae of the day , unattacked by masses of people clamoring , crying to be saved , but afraid to do the only things that would save them . Leadership ! Funny word . Was n't such a thing really . Only dogged go-ahead , one step at a time ; standing as stubbornly as one could . Adding here a little , and there a little  --  and how pitifully brief , how soon the journey run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . Felix watched it , musingly , out of half-closed eyes . Again that sense of being companioned . Faces . . . strong sturdy presences . . . encouraging , comprehending . . . He drew a block of paper toward him and began to write . THE FLAMINGOES BY FREDER/C PROKOSCH O VER the sand I saw their shadows blowing , And in the water 's gleam I saw them , like the water flowing , flowing From stream to secret stream , And looking up , arrows of sun , of snow , I saw them , heard them screaming Wildly afar . Aflame I saw them go Beyond the water , streaming Claw-swept fragments of cloud , as if a gleam Of billowed sun were blowing Across the marshes of the secret stream , Flowing , forever flowing . What could it be that broke upon my dreaming On wings ? I do not know What wings forsook me , what wild hearts , what gleaming Arrows of sun or snow .               @ @ @ @ @ @
