A happy day was November 3 , 1936 for a ruddy , 71-year-old Manchester , N. H. retired shoe manufacturer named Arthur Byron Jenks . That day Republican Jenks. running for his first political office , thought that he had beaten Democrat Alphonse Roy for Congress in New Hampshire 's ist District by 550 votes . Less happy were many succeeding days as the Jenks-Roy contest shuttled back and forth in a tantalizing series of recounts ( TIME , Dec. 7. 1936. et seq . ) . One count came out 51,679-to-51,679 , first tie in a Congressional race in no years . Another gave Contestee Roy an edge of 17 votes , which a third upped to 24 . When Mr. Jenks claimed that 34 Jenks ballots cast in the town of Newton had been lost in counting , New Hampshire 's Republican Secretary of State certificated his victory . Congress seated him with other members-elect at the beginning of the session . <P> No sooner had Congressman Jenks spread his papers on his desk , than relentless Alphonse Roy carried his case to a House Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They voted 6-to-3 in favor of seating Democrat Roy . Unsatisfied , the House gave the committee $5.000 for further hearings , the unprecedented task of interviewing all of Newton 's voters to see whether there had been 458 , as Mr. Jenks maintained , or 424 , as claimed by Mr. Roy . After interviewing all they could find- nine had died-the committee reported that 458 votes had been cast ( but only 424 ballots were available ) , still voted in " favor of Mr. Roy . Last week their findings were again brought to the House floor . Republicans stormed that Mr. Jenks was being sacrificed because Mr. Roy is French-Canadian and New Hampshire 's Democratic Senator Fred H. Brown this year badly needs his State 's big French-Canadian vote . The Democratic majority overrode their protest , unseated Member Jenks 214 votes to 122 . <P> One by one 84 Republican Representatives left their seats and stalked huffily out of the chamber until only Minority Leader Bertrand Snell and Mr. Jenks remained . Then Mr. Jenks jumped up from the place he had occupied for 17 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strode out of the House to loud Democratic applause . He will keep the $14,361.11 salary he has collected plus $8,046.12 expenses . Mr. Roy was to get another $14,361.11 for services he was unable to perform , plus $5,638.89 for the balance of his term , plus $3,118.30 for expenses . Both will be paid the expenses incurred in their tug-of-war ( but not more than $2,000 apiece ) . In the cloakroom afterward , undaunted Arthur Byron Jenks announced that five months hence he would run again for Congress against Alphonse Roy .
