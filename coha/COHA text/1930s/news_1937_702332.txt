txt Retribution moved swiftly yesterday upon Major Green , 33-year-old Negro porter . Less than twelve hours after signing a fourteen-page confession he was indicted for murder , first degree , pleaded not guilty and was remanded to Queens County jail for trial on Feb. 1 . The indictment charged that the porter " willfully , feloniously and with malice aforethought did choke , suffocate and strangle Mary Harriet Case , " the 25-year-old bride of Frank W. Case , hotel executive , in her apartment at 37-06 Eightieth Street , Jackson Heights , Queens , last Monday afternoon . As Green was led through the dusk from the county court to the jail a noisy crowd of some seventy or eighty persons  --  most of them women  --  surged upon him and his police guards , screaming imprecations . They flailed at his head with umbrellas and sticks , spat on him , and pummeled him with their fists . " Lynch him* " they shrieked . Green , handcuffed to Patrolman John Conlon of the District Attorney 's staff , tried to cover his head with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This hampered Conlon as he tried to force the women back . In their mad thrusts they thumped the policeman 's head almost as often as they did the prisoner 's . Patrolman Anthony Le Ban , court guard , and Daniel Maher of the District Attorney 's staff , came out of the building when they heard the uproar and , joined by Detective John Werle , hurled the vituperative men and women back . Finally they made a path for Conlon and the porter , and the two ran for the prison gate . Neither was injured . There were no arrests . Robbery Was the Motive Green 's confession , made public , in part , by District Attorney Charles P. Sullivan about 6 A. M. , established definitely that robbery was the motive behind the murder . The document , signed on each of the fourteen pages , was the fruit , according to Assistant District Attorney J. Irwin Shapiro , " of psychological approach . " Proof that the confession was not obtained through brutal third-degree methods was established earlier in the day , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prior to the handing up or the indictment . Green , it was learned yesterday , was subjected to a test under a lie detector invented by the Rev. Walter G. Summers of the Fordham University staff . The examination took place in the Woolworth Building on Wednesday , with District Attorney Sullivan looking on . It is understood that the device showed clearly that Green was lying , but the graph made during the test was withheld . The District Attorney refused to discuss the matter . Green 's Confession The parts of the confession made public by the District Attorney read as follows : " I saw Mrs. Case Monday morning in the hallway of the apartment house . She asked me to come up to her apartment and clean the windows . I then met Hines and we decided to go up together and rob the apartment . The man referred to by Green , authorities said , is Robert Hines of 206 West 121st Street , a Negro porter who worked in Jackson Heights . The District Attorney indicated his belief that Hines was in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the murder had been accounted for . There were intimations that his name was dragged in by Green in a desperate attempt to establish that the guilt was not his alone . Hines was held as a material witness in the case , but at his own request . " We made up our minds to go into the apartment and steal . We were not going to take anything special . When we got in , we closed the front door and turned the knob , but I did not lock it . She was in the kitchen . We struck her over the head with the hammer . I had the hammer with me . " She fell to the floor . I went to the bathroom and turned on the faucet in " the tub . I went back to the kitchen . We grabbed.b.er hands and dragged her across the floor into the bathroom . " As we were lifting her into the tub , she began to struggle . She kicked at me with her feet and broke a pane of glass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . We hit her again and again . We grabbed a bedsheet and strangled her with it . We lifted her up and put her into the tub . " I took one of Mr. Case 's suits and some cuff links and some studs in a box on the dresser , and left the apartment . I went up to Apartment 5-G , where I had some clothes . It is a vacant apartment . " I took off my trousers . They were all bloody . I put on some other trousers . I dropped the bloody trousers , the cuff links box and the hammer down the incinerator . I threw them down the incinerator because I figured they would be burned and nobody would find them . " I hung the suit that I took from the apartment in the closet of apartment 5-G . When it came time to go home , at 5 P. M. , I took the suit around the corner to a tailor . There was only a boy in the shop . " I told him I wanted the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him it was Johnson . He asked me where I lived and I gave him my right adIdress . He asked me if -I would call for it and I said I 'd have some one else call for it . He asked me when I wanted it , and I told him tomorrow . I left the shop and went home . " The confession was not made in narrative form , but was brought I out by questions and answers . There was a great deal more detail in it , the District Attorney said , but that will be secret until the trial . " It is an important part of the prosecution 's case , " he declared . Mr. Sullivan said that in addition to making the confession , Green identified himself as the man who had taken the stolen suit into Lazare Ayvazian 's tailor shop at 37-62 Eightieth Street . The counter boy in the store , Joseph Smith , 17 years old , had failed to identify Green on Wednesday night , but Green recalled to him certain things that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . How Confession Was Obtained Mr. Shapiro described how the confession was obtained . He said that detectives had worked on Green from his arrest at midnight on Tuesday until about 11 P. M. on Wednesday . He kept repeating , " Not me ; not me , " in the face of all the circumstantial evidence piled against him . Then James J. Conroy , chief Assistant District Attorney , decided to change the tactics a bit and employed what Mr. .. hapiro called the " psychological ' approach . " . Green had expressed a wish to see his . wife , Juanita Green , and Mrs. Annie Johnson , his motherin-law . Subtle references to them had seemed to soften him a bit , when nothing else had moved him . " You can see them , Major , when you decide to tell the truth , " he was told . He pondered that a while , in his slow way , but shook his head . A hot chicken dinner , bought for $1 , was brought in , and as its odor permeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light . The meal was placed before him and he began to eat . Then he began to talk . When he had unburdened himself of his first version of the murder , his wife and the tottering old mother-in-law were brought in . They pleaded with him to tell the truth  --  all of it  --  and then he began to talk even more freely . At 2:30 A. M. the District Attorney called for a stenographer and the final version of the confession was taken , in question and answer form . " Are you satisfied there was only one man ? " Mr. Shapiro was asked , after the document was made public . " So far as we have been able to ascertain , " was the answer , " we are . " " From your observation of the man , do you believe Green knew ' Mrs. Case was in that apartment when he went in ? " " No . " Time Definitely Fixed Mr. Shapiro said the authorities had definitely fixed the time of the murder as 2:30 P. M. on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building at the precise time the thing happened , " he said . He would not tell what this witness heard , or saw , nor would he reveal who the witness is . It was about 7 A. M. when the prisoner reached police headquarters in Manhattan . He was fingerprinted and photographed and his measurements were taken . Then he was led to a cell downstairs  --  a cell where the corridor light throws its full illumination  --  and a patrolman was assigned to guard him . It seemed an unnecessary precaution . Green threw his five feet six inches on the cot and fell fast asleep . When an attendant came back with coffee and sandwiches for him his slumber was so sound that nudging did not wake him . Just before 9 A. M. he was led from the cell to the line-up room . Waiting his turn , he was put in a detention pen with several other prisoners . They had been talking to one another , but as he entered they stopped . They turned their backs on him and huddled together in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought an empty corner and waited there . When he was brought onto the platform he stared out into the darkness beyond , his face completely in repose . Watching him were more than 200 detectives , a contingent of police rookies , a group of Junior League members who were the guests of the department for the day ; a number of police officials and Bill Robinson , the Negro dancer , who frequently attends the morning line-ups . Green did not fidget as he faced the almost invisible audience . He was clad in a long brown overcoat , open in front so that his undershirt was disclosed . The shirt he wore when he was arrested was one that had been stolen from the Case apartment and the police had taken it from him . He held in his strong fingers a soft gray hat . Beside him stood four of the de'tectives who had enmeshed him in a web of circumstantial evidence . Acting Captain John G. Stein. read the charge and question Green .

A short affidavit accusing him of murder , first degree , signed by Detective James Sullivan , arresting officer , was read to him . He listened with characteristic calm and pleaded not guilty . He was advised by the magistrate that he was entitled to have counsel and that he was entitled to an adjournment . " How long do you want , Mr. Green ? " asked the court . The prisoner 's eyes rolled upward for a brief second . " One week . " The magistrate turned to Detective Sullivan , who , though he has been in plain clothes only two and one-half months , gets credit for breaking the Case murder mystery . " I understand , " said the magistrate , " that you have something to say for the record . " " Yes , Your Honor . I asked this defendant downstairs in the detention cell if anybody hit him or touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratches on the left shoulder  --  from a detective . " Magistrate Wieboldt looked at the prisoner . " Is that right ? " he asked . Green nodded . He was ordered to remove the brown overcoat , and the magistrate recited for the record : " A few scratches on the left shoulder . No other marks visible at this time . " Green spoke up suddenly . " On the leg , " he said . At the court 's command Green lifted his left leg to the table before the bench , and showed a superficial scratch . This , too , was noted for the record . Green was taken back to the jail . Grand Jury Acts District Attorney Sullivan went before the grand jury at 3:20 P. M. He had twenty-five or thirty witnesses ready , but called only eleven . It seemed apparent that he had depended a great deal on all the material evidence dug up by the police . They brought in big bundles of it . It was understood , though not verified , that among the exhibits " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you want this court to assign a lawyer ? " " Yes . " Mr. Shapiro spoke up : " In view of the nature of this case , Your Honor , we would like an expeditious trial . We ask the court to set Feb. 1 , in Part Two . " Judge Colden nodded , riffling the papers in his hand . " I will assign counsel tomorrow , " he said . The porter was led away and a few minutes later came the attack in the street .

Her husband , Frank W. Case , was on the verge of collapse . He leaned heavily on the arms of friends as he was escorted to his automobile after the burial in Greenwood Cemetery .
