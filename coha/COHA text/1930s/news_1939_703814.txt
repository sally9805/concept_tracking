txt Increased burden of taxation and special charges of various kinds levied upon utilities by local , state , and federal governments , was given yesterday by the New York State Public Service Commission as the reason for fewer rate reductions in 1938 than in each of the three preceding years . The commission , In its annual report to the Governor and Legislature , stated that although rate reductions for 1982 and 1939 amounted to about $260,000.000 , the tax burden on utilities In the same period continued to mount . " It has been the experience of the Commission in recent years , " the report said , " that the heavier the tax burden becomes upon the utilities , the more difficult it is to obtain rate reductions . It is a simple axiom that the public can not have both increased taxes and lower rates . " In recent years , " the report continued , " it has been repeatedly shown that if taxes were no heavier than they had been even five years before , utility rates could be reduced far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The commission 's report stated that attention was being given to effecting improved rate structures for commercial and industrial customers , in line with simplification of residential service charges .

New York state utility consumers ' bills were reduced $3,333.000 a year under new rates which became effective in 1938 , the report stated . Reductions effective in 1987 amounted to 310,866,000 , and In 1938 and 1935 they were 37,068,000 and 314,460,000 respectively .
