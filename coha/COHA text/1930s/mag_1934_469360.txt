IF WE are asked the meaning of a word we can answer in other words . We can translate one language into another . Much may be lost in the process , but a great part can be carried over which we call the meaning . If you look up the word " pibroch " in your dictionary , you find it is derived from a Gaelic word meaning piper ; and that it means , itself , " wild warlike music performed on the Scotch bagpipes , " or the bagpipes themselves . In another book , however , you may find the word pibroch paraphrased as " the classical music of the bagpipes " ; and in still another you will read of a collection of pibrochs in a volume called Ceol Mor , a Gaelic term which means Great Music . The word , then , has several meanings . If you want to know what the music is , the most direct way is to hear it . Your first pibroch sounds utterly strange . As music it is unintelligible to you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones and patterns of German or Italian music . It is absurd to call music a universal language . There are as many musics as there are languages ; but no one can be translated into the terms of another . May we say , on this account , that music has no " meaning " ? If we say that how shall we explain the fact that what in the pibroch is unintelligible sound , even noise , to you means music to the Scotsman ? You are listening to the same sounds . Obviously the musical meaning is not in the sounds themselves , but in the habit of hearing them . It would be almost impossible to analyze our own habit of hearing which attributes profound significance to the music of the masters we revere . We are too wholly involved in it to extricate ourselves and attain a detached point of view . But the approach to a strange music sometimes affords a view , in cross-section as it were , of a musical habit in which we can see how several elements are combined to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musical experience in Scotland last summer , I realize that it was significant in such a revelation ; and it is the purpose of my paper to reproduce so far as I can that particular revelation by describing the stages through which I approached my first hearing of the Great Music of the Scotch bagpipes . There is a saying in Scotland that it takes seven years to learn to play the pipes and seven generations to make a piper . The high ideal of performance thus attested will come as a surprise to those who know no more about the bagpipes than I knew to start with . Had I gone to the Wagner cycle at Bayreuth instead of to the Highland Games at Bridge of Allan , I should not have expected , and doubtless should not have found , an art of such high lineage . And it is no less surprising at the outset to hear the term " great " applied to music for the bagpipes ; yet in the end I discovered that the people to whom the pibrochs belong put them on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ivory and silver , but with cracked and blackened bone and tarnished metal . Not wishing to exact a tune in return for the lunch , we only hinted at one . This confused him ; but when he understood what we wished his face brightened . " Aye , gladly , " he said . " I 'm used to that . " With the slow stride of the Highlander and followed by his wife , swaying the baby a little lest he cry , the man went from the road into a glade of the forest at hand . He set the drones upright against his shoulder and inflated the bag . At once the shadowy stillness of the forest and the sunny silence lying over the loch were harshly broken . The piercing scream of the drones , splintered in its own discord , shattered the air in every direction ; while , stiff as sticks and jointed only at the palm , the piper 's fingers , beating swiftly on the holes of the chanter , let loose flight after flight of shrill fragments of tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raucous unison of the drones whereto they were pegged . But meanwhile , flinging an arm to the tops of the drone pipes higher than his head above his shoulder , the piper screwed them this way and that to bring them into perfect accord with each other ; and as he did this , the splinters of sound , as it were , drew mute and more closely together into a smooth shaft , into an unwavering beam of sound that settled into direction and aim . The chanter 's fragments took a smoother though no less rapid flight , slipping out of the unison without rasping and gliding back into it again . Thus were the pipes tuned and the bass drone brought in with them , profoundiy humming like the spheres . Under the piper 's elbow the air he blew into the bag was kept at an even pressure . The sound of the droneswas so steady , so without the slightest quavering in pitch or in volume , that it seemed to stretch unbroken beyond the limits of time and to be the evenness of eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but appeared ; that it might disappear , but never end . Now the piper walked up and down the glade . My eyes watched his feet in their nailed bouts , widely turned out from the ankle , printing with the heel his slow stride across the grass ; and watching thus , my eyes told me the measure of a true tune started on its way from the chanter . Even the tune had not begun , but had grown out from the eternal drone to take shape in the patterns and the lilt my ear had failed to hear till my eye saw them marked by the piper 's feet . Our ears are not accustomed to this escape of music , this jet out of the primal flow of sound . Our music begins out of silence . The piper 's wife was leaning against a mossy trunk , her baby still asleep in the shawl slung from her shoulder . She was smiling . Presently I noticed that the piper 's feet had changed their measure , and listening , I felt the pull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the drone and started on its way before my ear could fall in with it . Even at the finish the pipes played my ear false . With a last dip of his baton the conductor neatly snips off the completed piece of music . But the piper 's final tune sinks into the elemental drone without ceasing to be ; and as air slackens in the bag , silence falls down with a clatter and music is blotted out . The piper stopped his walk . His cheeks still red from blowing , his blue eyes still shining with the music he had made , he shook hands with us and bade us good-by ; and after a word of goodwill to him and his wife , we got in the car and went on . He doubtless belonged , we heard later , to the vagrant company locally known as tinkers ; and band , " I replied . " Does he never play with them ? " " No , " said the Scot . " He was for years pipe-major in the regiments , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays only the great music . There 's none can play a pibroch like him . " Pibroch ! Scott 's stanza stirred in my memory . Pibroch of Donnuil Dhu Pibroch of Donnuil Wake thy wild voice anew Summon Clan Connuil . With only the vaguest idea of what the word might mean , I felt in the stanza the thrill of the tumultuous music of the band . But here , in a wellworn suit of tweed , with the pace of cheerful men who go about their business , a great piper , master of the pibroch , cut athwart the splendor of the band and went off alone through a neighboring street . I wondered of what sort of music he possessed the secret . The corner round which he disappeared hid a mystery from me , which haunted me even weeks later in London . It drew me back to Scotland . In a compartment of the Glasgow express I found myself with a Scottish business man and his wife . I asked them about the pibroch . It was , they said , an extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who was not initiated into the fine details of piping stood little chance of making head or tail of it . Only the most skillful pipers attempted the pibrochs and only the greatest could really play them . We had in large measure a common vocabulary . I should have explained the Bach Chaconne , let us say , to him in the terms he used of the pibroch to me . The analogy is not far-fetched ; for I began to suspect and he now told me that the pibroch is a series of variations . Arrived in Glasgow , they went out into the driving rain to put me on a tram ; and as we parted they wished meluck in my search for the pibroch . It was striking to find as time went on that every Scot to whom I spoke of music , man or woman , laborer in the docks or shepherd guide across the moorlands , attached a deep meaning to the pibroch , and indefinably more importance to a stranger 's desire to hear one than to any other wish in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel I consulted the head porter about trains and traveling . He was a powerfully built man of precise but flowing speech in which there was little trace of the Scottish brogue . I knew thus he was a Highlander . Across the breast of his porter 's uniform , to which his broad shoulders and his upright carriage gave dignity , were pinned the ribbons of medals won in the War . He had very blue eyes and a small rimless pair of glasses which he pinched with some trouble on his nose in order to read . When we had settled about trains and luggage , I asked if he happened to know where I could hear some good piping . " Are you a piper yourself ? " he asked . " No . But I want more than anything else in Scotland to hear a pibroch . " " A pibroch ! Ah , you must be a musician . " Yes ; I taught music in my own country . 1 stood aside while a number of people came to him with questions . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Highland Games at Bridge of Allan next week , " he said . " The cream of Scotch pipers will he there . " " At the games ? " I cried . " Will there be pibrochs at the athletic games ? " " Aye , hours of them ? in the competition . " A gleam came in his eye . " Are you a piper ? " I asked . " They said you might be willing to play for me . " " Aye . " Not a muscle moved in his face ; his look was more distant than ever . So , after a pause , I began again : " Will you play a pibroch for me ? " He suddenly fixed me with a bright , direct gaze , and color rose in his face . " I can not do that , " he said . " I 'm not skillful enough , not yet . " " Could you not give me an idea of one ? " " Not of the pibroch , not of the real music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play you the " ? his eyebrows lifted in perplexity and he glanced at the clerk ? " the floor of one , " he completed . The word " floor " suggested something strange in music ; but as a matter of fact , Colin was translating from the Gaelic vocabulary in which alone , almost without exception , pipets still refer to the several parts of the pibroch and their execution . Had he known English better , he would have used the word " ground , " familiar among us for centuries in a musical sense . It was agreed that after dinner that night Colin would play for me in the loft of an old barn , where in his free moments he was accustomed to practice . A young English forester arrived that evening , and after dinner we went together through the foggy twilight to meet Colin , with a few of his friends , waiting by the door of the shop . They led us up an outer stairway to the loft over the barn . It was harshly lighted by an electric light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pushed to the side and the floor was neatly swept . There was a rickety table with a gramophone and a pile of records . Before playing , Colin showed me a practice chanter , a fife with a bone mouthpiece , on which all young pipers must spend hours exercising their fingets . He unscrewed the drone pipes and showed me how the reeds are fixed in sockets , explained how weather conditions affect their tone . Attentive to what he said , I began to understand how , for the piper with his trained ear , bagpipes are as variable and as sensitive as violins for the violinist . But when he withdrew to an end of the loft and began tuning , I thought the scream of the drones , enclosed within four walls , would deafen me . Nevertheless , the dissonance was smoothed out , and when we all sat down on the lumber to heat Colin play , the music pressed evenly and solidly about us . He had not space to walk the measures ; but I could follow the changing patterns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rhythmical slight spring of his knee . A young constable had come in with bright buttons on his uniform , and in the silence which fell with a clatter on Colin 's playing , he laughed cheerfully and cried : " Come , Rob , give us a dance . " Rob took off his heavy boots and tied slippers on his feet . Colin blew up his pipes to a reel , and Rob danced in the midst of us , with upflung arm and feet so nimble they seemed to spin a lace on the board . Then , in lieu of two swords , he crossed two lathes on the floor , and to the new tuneColin played , he danced in the angles like a beam of light on a crystal . This being done , I recalled the piper 's promise to play the ground of a pibroch . Colin made no ado . In the quiet which seized us all , he took special care with tuning . My ear was still too unaccustomed . The melody of the pibroch spread from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rhythmical advance pulled my ear into the music ; here was no leap into tow like that of the dinghy behind the ship which takes her course . There was a lifting from the earth on THE GREAT MUSIC Now the first racers and jumpers , clad in sleeveless shirts and satin shorts , came through the passage beside me to the field . At the same time three men strolled out from the shadow of the grandstand to the piper 's platform , and thence sauntered chatting to the three chairs , now in the hot sun , where they sat down . I recognized Pipe-Major Frazier of the hotel . He wore kilt and hose and bonnet , but an ordinary jacket too ; and I could see the trouble he had to pinch his glasses on his nose . He sat between the other two and opened a volume of music on his knee . Suddenly the medley of piping behind the scenes stopped . Under the broad sky one heard the low chattering of the crowd , the crack of a starter 's pistol , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With rapid and nervous stride , the first piper went forth to play . He was superbly dressed in kilt and tartan and dark-green jacket . The sun glinted on the great silver buckle at his shoulder with its jewel , on the silver mountings of the drones , on the silver broach in his bonnet . As he strode toward the platform , the folds of his blue and red tartan spread long and fanwise behind him and filled and curled in the breeze of his progress . Before the three judges in their commonplace chairs on the turf he stopped , brought his heels together , saluted ; then went a little farther to perfect the tuning of his pipes . Meanwhile on a blackboard to one side a lad chalked the name of the piper and the pibroch he was to play . Once the splendid piper had blown into the bag , the sound of his pipes continued without interruption ; so that when he mounted the steps to the platform he bore with him , not a dumb instrument out of which music might be evoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual my ear failed to catch the moment when this living sound came under the musician 's will to play ; but presently , spreading and folding its intervals , the broad melody of the pibroch lifted above the earth , above the first racers and jumpers , above all the crowd , and buoyantly rose and fell . Being on the platform , the piper had no other background than the clear blue of the sky above the distant blue Highlands . Arid now he walked the square of the platform , his kilt swinging gently from side to side , his tartan flowing and spreading from his shoulder . His shining walk was slow and flexible , his step settled with weightless softness on the boards . When his walk took him away , the sun was on his back and the cool blue of the sky was clear between the drone pipes standing stiffly above his shoulder ; when he came toward us , the sun glinted from the silver buttons and clasps of his uniform and his sporran and from the beads of sweat gathering on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and went away again , you could almost see the sweet clear tone of his pipes trace the melody against the blue of the sky above the blue of the Highlands whither it soared ; and again when he came towards you , his glittering blinded you and the sound came stinging against you in immaterial arrows . I listened with all my ears to this music let loose in the air above the tumult of the games . At the beginning , through the spacious intervals of the melody , it was as if I heard through and beyond the music . In the many successive repetitions , the art of the musician filled in these intervals with an ever more detailed weaving of gracenotes . They spun the finest mesh of sound that absorbed the hearing as veil upon veil of gauze might absorb the sight . They became a warbling and a twittering , an iridescent mist of sound such as I had never met before . I did not time this first pibroch . It hear one of the grandest of all pipers . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rarely heard anything more beautiful than his playing of the ' Lament for the Children . ' There was no flaw in it . You should have heard the wonderful line of his music . Here PipeMajor Frazier waved his hand in the infinitely graceful curve by which the great Benedictine , Dom Mocquereau , used to indicate the curve of Gregorian song to his choir in the monastery of Solesmes . And , " he concluded , " Reid has the fire and poetry of music in him . " As to what the fire and poetry of music are , as to how they can glow through an instrument so mechanically restricted in expressive means as the bagpipes , I can not myself explain . Nor could Frazier . He opened a book of pibrochs to one called , if I remember rightly , " The Mother Croons to Her Children . " " There , " he said , " is the simplest of our pibrochs . I think it is the most beautiful . I 'll tell you , sir , a man may be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piped before him , but if he has not this music in his heart he 'll never be able to play it . And to have it in his heart his mother must have sung the tune to him in his cradle . " I have not written to persuade anyone to the pibroch , or to account for the pibroch as a piece of music . Later , in the musty silence of the British Museum , I looked over some of the pibroths in the scholarly edition of the Inverness Piobeareachd Society . But though as they were fixed soundless on the page it was easy to see what they were , it was vain to seek their meaning there . That lies in the emotion of the great people who created them , in the hearts of the pipers and of the men and women who respond . On my way home to America I ran into a student of music and the arts . " I find the bagpipes detestable , " he said . " I shall never believe there is any music in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the address given by the Very Reverend Norman MacLean at the unveiling of a memorial tablet to the MacCrimmons , for generations hereditary pipers to the MacLeods and the most eminent of Scottish musicians , I read : When in 1928 Scotland brought home the greatest of all her warriors , dead , and three thousard people thronged St. Giles , and that Sunday morning when his body lay there , it was not the organ surging through the arches dim that expressed for them their sorrow , their gratitude , and their pride . It was only when the piper came down the nave ? pouring forth the strains of that lament which enshrines the woes of Floddcn and all the dead on all the Floddens of history , only then did the eyes grow dim with tears and the sob rise in the throat . . . . To-day is the product of all our yesterdays . If to-day the bagpipes commit to the winds of heaven the deepest emotion of the Scotsman 's heart in joy and sorrow , in war and peace , so it was yesterday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves wash the feet of MacLeod 's Maidens standing sentinel in the Minch.
