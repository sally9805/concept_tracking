txt The disappearance of 21-monthold Robert Connor from a road near his father 's home in Hartsdale Manor , Westchester County , continued to mystify the police and the Department of Justice yesterday . I At 6 o'clock last night , fortyeight hours had passed since the child vanished during a ten-minute period in which he was unwatched , without the discovery ? f a single clue to the infant 's whereabouts , or the receipt of any communication from kidnappers . It was still impossible for the investigators to do anything more than speculate as to whether the little boy had been kidnapped , had been killed by a hit-and-run driver who had made off with his body , or had wandered away by himself . Four Theories Suggested . The four chief possibilities , in the order in which official investigators weighed them , were : That the child had been taken away by some demented or abnormal person . That he had been seized by . a childless woman with an overpowering impulse toward motherhood . That he had been the victim of a hit-and-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hidden the body in panic . Philip J. , police chief of the town of Greenburgh , in which Hartsdale Manor is located , announced yesterday afternoon that he expected to have in custody within a few hours the eccentric itinerant peddler who canvassed the houses of Hartsdale Manor , including the Connor home , in an Pffort to sell toilet articles on Thursday afternoon . This is the middle-aged coatless man with the scar on the left side of his neck , who frightened the housewives of the community with his incoherent mutterings about " castles in France and Spain , " with his dismal talk about his misfortunes , his strange offers of " ether pills " which would put one to sleep " in a minute , " of " cure-all pills , " and his extravagant gestures of despair when they declined to purchase his wares . The police made it plain that suspicion attached to the peddler only because of his presence in the community the - day of the disappearance , and because of his unusual behavior . It was believed that the peddler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was observed on Thursday night in Ardsley , four miles from Hartsdale Manor , and on Friday morning on the Tarrytown road near Ardsley . A man who resembled the peddler was detained in Seabright , N. J. , on Friday , but was released after convincing a Department of Justice agent that he was not in New York on Thursday . Report Hunt Turns Here . It was reported last night that Chief had come to New York City to question a Harlem man in connection with the search for the peddler . This was not confirmed either here or in Hartsdale Manor . John J. Sullivan , acting chief in spector of the New York police , said that the department stood ready to offer full cooperation to the Westchester authorities , but had not been asked for any aid . Meantime , he added , a policewoman of the Missing Persons Bureau had been assigned to familiarize herself with the missing child 's picture and description and to check any reports of the finding of stray children in this city . The Lynbrook , L. I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found the Connor boy . They picked up a baby of about the same age , and ' whose description was like that of the missing child , on a street in Lynbrook , and notified the Westchester authorities . Within a few minutes , . however , Mr. and Mrs. Guy Turrell of Lynbrook went to the police station and claimed the boy as their ' own . A woman peddler who also spent part of Thursday afternoon canvassing the houses in Hartsdale Manor was questioned on Friday night , and was exonerated of all connection with the case . A reported " ransom " letter which had been received at the Connor home was the work of a crank , according to Chief . The letter demanded 850 in 81 notes , but failed to name a place for the delivery of the money or a method of transfer . It was rambling and illogical and might have been written by a boy with a perverted sense of humor , the police said . Chief said that other letters regarding the case had been received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most were obviously the work of cranks and that none appeared to have any significance . Handkerchief Clue Scouted . The police also minimized the importance of two handkerchiefs found on Emerson Road , Hartsdale Manor , near the place where the child was last seen . One handkerchief was found yesterday morning on the side of the road about 100 feet from where Bobby disappeared . This was a man 's white handkerchief bearing the initial " D. " It was soiled , and bore a few brown spots which might or might- not have been bloodstains . A clean handkerchief of the same type , also bearing the initial " D , " was found near by . Both handkerchiefs were found by a newspaper photographer . It was pointed out that the places where they were found had been searched carefully on Thursday night and Friday by several hundred persons , who had seen nothing of the kind there . Frank X. Fay , Department of Justice agent in charge of the investigation , established headquar- ? ters at the Connor home and attempted to dissuade the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early yesterday Department of Justice agents searched the woods near the house in connection with a rumor that a band of gypsies had been camping there . They found nothing to support the story . The agents also went to Crane 's Pond in response to a telephone call from a woman in the vicinity who thought she had heard a child crying there . They found two sheep making the noise she had heard . It was said that the agents might dig up a trench near Emerson Road on the chance that the child might have fallen into , it and have been covered with dirt . In a statement last night Mr. Connor said : " I believe the baby is all right . I can not believe anything else . My wife is standing up splendidly under the circumstances . We are sure that the baby could not have been lost in the woods , at least anywhere within his walking distance . I myself have covered every Inch of ground in a large radius , and have found no trace of him . I searched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it was partly filled in , and he was not there . " We are absolutely satisfied that the Department of Justice is doing everything that can be done . They leave nothing uninvestigated . I feel we are being served by the finest police agency there is . If they , ca n't I find him , nobody can . " New Description Sent On &; Mrs. Charles H. Connor , the missing boy 's mother , requested the police to send out a new and more detailed description of the child on the police teletype system . This was done . The mother 's description of the child follows : " Robert Anthony Connor . Born Oct. 15 , 1932 . Twenty-two to twenty-four pounds , 232 feet tall , slim build , blond hair , curly when combed ; large , dark blue eyes , heavy and long black eyebrows , light skin , tan where exposed ; has strawberry birthmark , circular , one-eight to three-sixteenths of an inch , on left shoulder ; red mark on nose where scab had fallen off ; pink rompers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , size 4Y2 ; white sox , figured on top ; no underwear or diapers . " " I 'm sure he is all right , " said Mrs. Connor last night . " I 'm still hopeful that he 'll be brought back to me . " Mr .. and Mrs. Connor and their daughter , Julie , 7 months- old , spent Friday night at home of a neighbor , returning to their home yesterday morning . They have three other children  --  Claire , 9 years old ; Richard , 7 , and Joan , 4 ? who are visiting their maternal grandmother , Mrs. Richard H. Murphy , in Bridgeport , Conn . They were to have returned home on Friday , but their visit was prolonged becasuse of Bobby 's disappearance . Mr. Connor is a graduate of Yolk , class of ' 24 , and is an engineer in the maintenance department of the Bond and Mortgage Guarantee Corporation , New York City , which is in process of rehabilitation under supervision of the State Department of Insurance . His father , Charles P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Arlingtotn , Mass . The Connors have lived at Hartsdale Manor for about four years . Mr. Connor had been unemployed during the depression , until he obtained his present job about a year ago . Before living in Hartsdale Manor , he told reporters , he occupied an apartment for about two years , about five years ago , at 21 Fountain Place , New Rochelle . At the 48-family apartment house at that address yesterday , Dennis Shea , the superintendent , who said he had been there for seven years , did not recall the Connors , and could not find their name on the records of previous tenants . Two bird dogs owned by a White Plains man were used yesterday afternoon in an effort to trace the scent of the missing boy from the place where he was last seen . They ' were no more successful than the , police dog used Thursday night . After running about 100 feet they ' returned to the place where they started . The spot to which they ' ran bore a small pile of ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foodstuffs near by , as some one had made a fire .
