" They still shoot a lot but they do n't bring us more than eight or nine corpses a day now . We do n't need to burn them in piles any more . I guess today we 'll have time to wait and bury these in the cool of the evening . " <P> This homely comment by the morgue keeper at Colon Cemetery summed up the less important , the bloody side of conditions in Havana last week as neat little <P> Provisional President Carlos Manuel de Cespedes worked like a nailer to entrench his new Government ( TIME , Aug. 21 ) . Most of Havana was gay and businesslike again , even though shots were heard every few hours as long-oppressed Cubans continued their man hunt to kill every member of ousted Tyrant Machado 's detested terrorist squads , the Porra , blamed by all Cuba for countless political murders and ghastly torture of prisoners . Meanwhile the big white Cuban problem which most worried Provisional President de Cespedes , U.S. Ambassador Welles and President Roosevelt was-and seems likely to remain-sugar.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
