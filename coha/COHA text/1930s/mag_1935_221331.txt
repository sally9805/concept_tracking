Drunks swept up off the streets by police and carted to hospitals usually need sleep more than anything else , hence get little active treatment . But an occasional alcoholic may be so thoroughly saturated that he will sink from deep coma into paralysis and death . Taking an interest in such deplorable guzzlers , last year two interns at Boston 's City Hospital , Drs . Leon J. Robinson and Sydney Selesnick , began experimenting on specimens in their hospital 's alcoholic ward . Their aim was to develop a gas which would oxidize alcohol in the blood , help throw it off in the breath , restore the patient to a normal state of intoxication . <P> Last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association the young researchers announced excellent results with a combination of 10% carbon dioxide and 90% oxygen , administered through an ordinary ether mask . Not for plain disagreeable drunks is their treatment , emphasized the doctors , but only for desperate drunks with slow , jerky breath , faint pulse , dilated pupils , cold bluish skin .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
