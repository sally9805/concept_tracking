JIMMIE ALDEN 'S laundry on a side street in New York City . This set stands throughout the play . Up stage at left is a door to the hall ; in the hall we see the foot of a staircase and part of the street door . At back center a large window facing she avenue . This window is lettered " Laundry , " and in it there is a display of neatly washed and ironed shirts , etc . There is a door at the right , well down stage , to a work room . A balcony extends out at the back . A short flight of steps at the right leads up to this balcony which is about eight feet high . At the right on the balcony a door opens off to a work room . At stage right , downstairs , below the stairs to the balcony , is a counter and a bookkeeper 's desk and chair , back of this counter are shelves now quite empty , but in the second act reasonably well filled with laundry packages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new schoolhouse , now almost finished , and through a practical window above on the balcony we see a flag pole on which , as yet , there is no flag . This school building , and the flag pole are very important and the distance must be carefully figured so that the top of the flag pole could naturally be in good line of sight through this comparatively low window . The show window should be so placed that the necessity of constantly passing street traffic may be avoided . If necessary nicely laundered sash curtains could cover the lower part of window , but part of the window itself must be of real glass . At rise of curtain JIMMIE is in the center of the stage ; DORIS by the desk ; NETTIE at the right ; JENNIE , MISS FALLEN and JOHN , a Chinaman , are at their ironing boards on the balcony above . DICK and IRMA TANNER , a young married couple , are at the left . JIMMIE It used to be an art gallery , you can see where the pictures were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 3 DORIS Do n't listen to him ! He does n't know what he 's talking about ! The sun faded the paint except where the pictures were . You wo n't find any dirt around this place  --  will they , Nettie ? You should have seen it when we first moved in ! But it 's clean now , we 've scrubbed it till we most scrubbed our arms off . DICK It 's a swell place for a laundry ! IRMA You 'll get along , Jimmie , I always said you would ! DICK I 'd put a bet on it . DORIS Of course he 'll get along ! JIMMIE Well , we do n't know that yet , but it 's the big chance I 've been waiting for . NETTIE We 're all of us terribly excited , being the first day and everything . IRMA Looking at balcony . I see you 've got Jennie and Miss Fallen up there . I guess you believe in old friends sticking together . JIMMIE John , too ,  --  all the old crowd I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to be any shirking around here , every one of us is going to put all we 've got into it ! JIMMIE And then some ! Believe me , we 've got to  --  I did n't have any too much cash and no credit rating at all  --  and the machines and everything just about sunk me ! MRS . ROBINS , a fat , smiling , elderly woman enters from the street. p. 4 MRS . ROBINS Well , here I am , Jimmie ! JIMMIE Hello , ma ! DORIS Glad to see you , Mrs. Robins . IRMA Hello ! MRS . ROBINS Looking at IRMA . How 's the bride take to married life ? IRMA Smiles . Fine ! I guess I can stand it if Dick can . DICK Laughs . I guess it 's too late now to do any kicking . IRMA Oh ! She flares into a sudden anger . Is that so ! I 'd like to know what you mean by that ! DICK Why  --  er  --  nothing ! IRMA Nothing ! DICK I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh ! Dick 's real funny sometimes ! Then sometimes he is n't quite so funny as he thinks he is . MRS . ROBINS Soothingly . Why , of course we knew he was only making a little joke . IRMA Bitterly . Some folks always think they are making a fool of somebody , when all they are doing is making a fool of themselves ! p. 5 DICK Surprised . Well  --  my God ! MRS . ROBINS Sure  --  do n't I know it ! Look , Jimmie ! She goes over to him with the bunch of flowers she has brought in with her . I brought you these for luck on your opening day ! JIMMIE Swell . You 've always been a good friend to me , Mrs. Robins . DORIS I 'll take them . She takes the flowers . They 're lovely ! NETTIE Let me have them , Doris , and I 'll put them in the window where everybody can see them . DORIS We worked hard on that show window and these will just about make it perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the show window as BEN FAIRCHILD , a young fellow of thirty , enters . BEN Hello , Jimmie ! JIMMIE Eagerly . Hello , Ben , any news ? BEN Not yet , but I 'd say no news was good news . JIMMIE This is Ben Fairchild , folks , an old pal of mine in the Seventh Regiment  --  Miss Sabin , Ben  --  Mrs. Robins , Dick and Irma Tanner  --  meet Ben Fairchild. p. 6 ALL Hello  --  how are you  --  glad to meet you  --  etc . BEN Jimmie and I are old pals , but I have n't seen him until yesterday , for a couple of years or so  --  I 'm new to this side of town . JIMMIE Ben 's just been made manager of Scott and Clayton 's West Side branch . I went in there yesterday , trying to land a contract for their laundry work . I did n't think I had a chance . I asked to see the manager and the first I know , they run me in on old Ben here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of work ! Are you going to get it , Jimmie ? BEN I 'll have an answer for you , Jimmie , any minute now  --  I put it up to Mr. Clayton myself and I made it good and strong . MRS . ROBINS Why would n't they give it to him ? I gave him all my work ! To BEN . It 's only a little boarding house . IRMA Dick and I are the first customers . They 're running our stuff through special , just for fun , so 's we can be first ! DICK That 's right ! John up there is ironing it now . BEN I 'll have the big news , Jimmie , most any time now . Shall I call you up , or will you come on over and get the dope ? p. 7 JIMMIE I 'll be over right away . BEN Right ! He starts for door . JIMMIE And , Ben  --  make it yes ! BEN Sure , it will be yes ! It 's got to be ! If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a Chinaman . He laughs and looks up at balcony . How about it , John ? JOHN Calmly , from balcony . It 's all light by me ! There is a loud general laugh in which BEN joins as he exits to street . MRS . ROBINS It 's just wonderful , Jimmie , to see you like this , running a nice little business of your own and all . DICK He 's the best man in our old crowd , got the most guts , I always said so ! DORIS Smiling . I do n't know , but what he owes it all to you , Mrs. Robins , because you took such good care of him and fed him so well all the years he lived with you . MRS . ROBINS Jimmie was always my favorite boarder and I guess by this time I 'd ought to know what he likes  --  just you come to me any time after you 're married for any little tips you need ! When is the wedding to be , Doris ? What 's the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORIS It 's up to the business , I guess . JIMMIE Sure it is ! If it clicks , it wo n't be long before we 're asking you to a wedding . How about it , Doris ? DORIS Oh , I guess so . I do n't know . NETTIE Laughs . She knows , all right , do n't let her kid you ! IRMA Starts to go . Do n't forget ours is the very first laundry package that goes out . JIMMIE The very first , because you 're our oldest friends . DORIS You 'll get your laundry to-night , Irma . DORIS and JIMMIE go up to door with IRMA and DICK . IRMA Help him put the laundry over , Doris , because I know you 're going to be happy when you 're married . Just the same as Dick and I are ! She turns coldly on DICK at door . And you know what you 'll get if you make any crack about that ! DICK Why would I ? IRMA Sharply . Well  --  do n't ! DICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get bitchy ! DICK and IRMA exit. p. 9 JIMMIE To DORIS . What did she mean , riding him that way ? MRS . ROBINS She turns to DORIS . Jimmie keeps his eyes glued so fast onto the thing he wants to do , that he do n't ever see much of anything else . I gave up long ago , tryin ' to change him . DORIS Gayly . But I do n't want him changed ! MRS . ROBINS No use arguing with folks in love . Coming to dinner to-night , Jimmie ? JIMMIE No , Doris and I are going to work late . We 'll eat at the cafeteria next door . MRS . ROBINS I 'll put a cold bite in your room  --  DORIS Good-by ! MRS . ROBINS Good-by ! Exits . DORIS She 's nice ! JIMMIE She 's been nice to me , all right ! NETTIE comes down the stairs . NETTIE The crowd 's gone and we can really do something ! JIMMIE I got to run over and see Ben , he 'll have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make Ben call him up . I 'm anxious ! p. 10 DORIS If you get that order , we 're set ! JIMMIE Do n't I know it ! Here ! Give us a kiss for luck ! DORIS Kisses him . Oh , Jimmie ! I 'm so happy . JIMMIE Who is n't ? I guess you wo n't see me bust out crying ! He exits . DORIS To NETTIE . It means a lot to him ! He 's worked hard to start this little business . NETTIE I guess it was you he was thinking the most about . DORIS In a way ! But he 's the sort that 's bound to get up in the world , he 's got ambition . She calls up to the workers on the balcony . All right up there ? JENNIE Oh , we can do nice work , I guess , that is , if there 's any work to do . MISS FALLEN These new irons heat up awful fast . JENNIE Gloomily . Well , I been out of work now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope this job lasts . NETTIE And I hope Jimmie Alden makes a lot of money . JENNIE Sure , I hope so too , but mostly I hope the job lasts . She keeps steadily on with her ironing. p. 11 NETTIE It ought to  --  Jimmie 's got a lot of good ideas . JENNIE Times are pretty hard , lots of folks who used to put on a clean shirt every day are getting sort of absent-minded . MISS FALLEN Mr. Alden 's a real nice man and we 're all of us going to help put this new laundry over for him  --  DORIS Yes  --  and if Jimmie does come in with one of those big orders , let 's show him he 's got the help that can turn it out . NETTIE Going up the steps to the balcony . Sure we will . JENNIE On the balcony with her ironing . We 're figuring on getting this batch all ironed up nice by six o'clock . MISS FALLEN I do n't care how hard we work . I do n't guess any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to her ironing board and starts to work . NETTIE Sighs . It 's nice here , new and clean , and all of us being old friends and all , it 's a real swell job ! JENNIE I used to do a lot of thinkin ' about how much I wanted " a real swell job . " Nowadays I 'm thinkin ' any job is swell ! JUDGE HIGGINS , a white-haired , well-dressed and rather pompous man , enters . Under his arm he has a small package rather badly done up in a newspaper . He comes forward with a bland smile and a rather patronizing manner. p. 12 JUDGE Good afternoon . DORIS Pleasantly . Good afternoon . You are Judge Higgins , are n't you ? JUDGE Yes . DORIS My folks have lived in this ward ever since I was born . I 've often heard my father speak of you . JUDGE What 's the name ? DORIS Sabin , Doris Sabin . My father is auditor for the American Express Company . JUDGE Willie Sabin , of course ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first saw her  --  you look a lot like her if you do n't mind an old fellow saying so . DORIS Laughs . I like it . JUDGE Yes , sir , mighty pretty girl your mother was . She 's well , I hope ? DORIS Mother died about three years ago . JUDGE That 's bad  --  sorry to hear that  --  but that 's the way it goes . DORIS Yes , sir . Is that your laundry you 're bringing us ? JUDGE Yes , just a few things . I live right next door , you know . Glad to see a new business starting up here in the ward , and of course you can count on my trade , such as it is  --  JIMMIE ALDEN enters from the street in high spirits. p. 13 JIMMIE Say , Doris ! I got it ! DORIS Jimmie ! JIMMIE Look ! He holds up a folded paper . All the Scott and Clayton business for six months ! Ben was waiting for me with the contract . DORIS It means such a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're careful it will carry us until the neighborhood trade comes in ! DORIS This is Mr. Alden , Judge Higgins . She smiles at JIMMIE . The Judge is going to give us his laundry . JIMMIE That 's fine ! Glad to meet you , Judge ! They shake hands . Excuse our talking business in front of you but to tell you the truth I started this business on a shoe string and this big contract means a lot to me ! JUDGE Smiles . And to the young lady too , I 'd say by looking at her . JIMMIE I do n't mind telling you how much it means ! Getting married , and everything ! DORIS And we 're happy about your coming in here this way  --  it 's good luck  --  we know what a lot of influence you have around here . p. 14 JUDGE Oh , I do n't know  --  a little , maybe . I 've lived in this ward a good many years . I do n't know but what I 'm rather  --  " one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from Park Avenue , you know  --  I was a working boy like you , young fellar , and I 'm not ashamed of it , any more than I 'm ashamed to be seen bringing my own laundry down to you in my hand  --  I 'm friendly , that 's why I dropped in here to wish you luck . JIMMIE I looked around a long time before I settled on this place , making good or not making good makes a terrible lot of difference to me ! I sure appreciate your kindness , Judge . JUDGE Not at all . Just send this up as soon as it 's ready . I told you I lived right next door , did n't I ? DORIS Saturday 's the Fourth of July , I 'm afraid we ca n't give it to you before Monday , unless you 're in a hurry . JUDGE As a matter of fact I happened to remember that I must get myself all dressed up on Saturday and I seem to be a little shy on white shirts  --  queer how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughs . I 'm afraid if you do n't get that for me by to-morrow night I wo n't be able to dedicate that new schoolhouse across the street on the Fourth . JIMMIE We 'll have it for you , of course . p. 15 DORIS Are you going to make a speech at the dedication , Judge ? JUDGE Well , not a speech , exactly . I thought I 'd read that thing of Abraham Lincoln 's , you know , the Gettysburg Address . I always liked the sound of it and as a rule folks seems to like it about as well as anything I can make up myself . JIMMIE You go on and read it , Judge , and we 'll see to it that you do n't have to do any worrying about your shirt . JUDGE You two will get on all right , I can see that . Everybody in the world goes along with a couple of clean kids that want to get married and settle down and lead a decent sort of life  --  ! Hell  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty swell old world , at least that 's how it looks to me ! I 'm going up and get the wash ready for the machines , so we 'll be all clear for to-morrow . She goes toward the stairs to the balcony . Thanks , Judge ! JUDGE For what ? DORIS On the stairs , with a laugh . Oh , I do n't know  --  maybe for what you said  --  for being human ! She goes to the balcony and speaks gayly to the workers . Come on , let 's get busy ! p. 16 NETTIE Sure . DORIS and the workers exit through the door at the right on the balcony . JUDGE You 're rather a lucky young man , I 'd say ! JIMMIE And do n't I know it ! AUSTIN JONES enters from the door to the hall . He is a friendly , smiling fellow , fairly well-dressed . JONES Oh , yes  --  I beg your pardon . As he sees the JUDGE . How are you , Judge ? JUDGE To JIMMIE . Much obliged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . JUDGE Sure . He goes toward the door . JONES Repeats . How are you , Judge ? JUDGE Coldly . Oh , yes  --  Jones  --  how are you , Jones , how are you . He exits . JONES looks after the JUDGE , then goes toward the counter back of which JIMMIE is standing . JONES Fine man  --  the Judge ! JIMMIE Swell  --  what can I do for you ? p. 17 JONES Why , I do n't know as there 's anything . JIMMIE If you have any laundry for us we 're perfectly willing to call for it . JONES No , I do n't know as I have  --  Nice place you 've got . JIMMIE I like it . JONES The laundry business is all right . JIMMIE Suits me . JONES Pretty good money in it too  --  anyhow there is if a guy do n't get in bad , but of course you know what I mean . JIMMIE No , I do n't . JONES It 's pretty rough , some of the things that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to get protection , but it 's not so hot for the little guys . JIMMIE I 'm one of ' em . JONES Yes , that 's what I was thinking . JIMMIE I do n't get you , mister , what 's it all about ? JONES Nothing , maybe  --  unless of course I could sort of do you a friendly turn . JIMMIE I do n't need it . JONES That 's great ! Only maybe you 're kidding yourself . p. 18 JIMMIE Me ! Kidding myself about a business that means what this does to me  --  maybe you just blew in here to hand me a laugh . JONES No  --  I did n't  --  JIMMIE Maybe you know more about the laundry business than I do ! JONES Maybe I do at that . JIMMIE If you came in here on business let 's have it ! JONES No , I just happened in  --  that 's all I do mostly , just happen in places and maybe do a favor once in a while for the right sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for any favors . JONES Mostly the birds that get along good are the sort that 's got sense enough to ask a favor once in a while  --  and other times to do a favor  --  you know  --  JIMMIE Coldly . No , I do n't know . JONES There 's a lot of rough birds running around this town  --  I guess you know that anyway ? JIMMIE Sure , I know that . JONES It would be mighty easy for a crowd of gorillas , suppose they happened to get down on you , to put a little laundry like this on the bum , would n't it ? p. 19 JIMMIE Why would they ? JONES They 've done a plenty of it , a fat plenty ! Clothes spoiled , washing machines wrecked , delivery wagons put on the fritz  --  lots of trouble  --  at least there was up to a few months ago  --  there ai n't been any trouble lately . JIMMIE The police stopped it , I suppose . JONES No , the police did n't stop nothin ' around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty hard thing for a cop to stop , you know , but things ai n't so bad now . At least there are ways of fixing the trouble . JIMMIE What ways ? JONES It 's just a question of getting in right with the right crowd , that 's all there is to it . Say ! I know a wise guy right here in this neighborhood that 's got an awful lot on the ball  --  if you say so I 'll ask him to keep his eye on this little place of yours . JIMMIE What for ? JONES Protection . JIMMIE Smiles . Protect me ! Listen ! All I 've got in the world right now is eighty dollars . I guess nobody 's going to bother much to take that away from me . JONES No , I guess that 's right , not eighty dollars . p. 20 JIMMIE So you need n't bother this wise guy friend of yours . JONES He 's in pretty strong , all he 'd have to do is just pass the word along  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . JIMMIE He must be a wise guy ! JONES He is . JIMMIE But suppose this friend of yours passed the word to " lay off " and somebody did n't lay off ? JONES It 's been tried  --  but nobody 's doin ' it any more . JIMMIE Big as that ? JONES Yes  --  JIMMIE Firmly . I do n't need him . JONES You need him bad . JIMMIE What is this , a shakedown ? JONES Nothin ' like that  --  this guy I 'm talkin ' about is sort of a friend of mine and if I was to ask him as a favor I think he 'd take care of you for about  --  He looks about the place , sizing it up. say  --  one hundred a month . JIMMIE And me with eighty bucks ! JONES He 'd start collecting it , say , about the fifteenth . p. 21 JIMMIE This wise guy friend of yours sent you here , of course ? JONES No , I just happened in , the way I do . JIMMIE Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've a pretty damned good idea you will , there 's something I wish you 'd say to him for me . JONES Sure  --  glad to . JIMMIE You tell him I said I was a piker , just eighty dollars strong ! Tell him there 's a girl I want to marry  --  that 's why I sunk my roll on this gamble , because she needs me  --  JONES I 'll tell him . JIMMIE I have n't got a hundred dollars a month . JONES I 'll tell him . JIMMIE Do that little thing , and after that there 's only one other favor you can do me . JONES I 'd do most anything . JIMMIE Get out of that little habit of yours of " just happening in , " at least as far as this laundry of mine is concerned . JONES Sure  --  only here 's a card with my telephone number written on it . He takes a rather soiled card from his pocket and puts it on the counter . I 'm mostly there if you should want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't there , somebody would take a message . p. 22 JIMMIE I think you 're just a bum . I do n't know and I do n't give a damn . Suppose we just let it go at that . JONES Sure  --  I guess that 's as good a way as any . JONES shuffles to the door and exits . Before he leaves the room DORIS and NETTIE enter on the balcony . DORIS On the balcony rail . Where 's the starch , Jimmie ? I thought you opened one of the big boxes ? JIMMIE I was just going to when the bunch started coming in . Anyhow I figured you had enough for to-day . DORIS Comes down . We only had a little and we got out Irma and Dick 's things and a big pile of stuff for Mrs. Robins . I guess she 's been saving her soiled linens for us for a month . JIMMIE Goes back of counter . I 've got a box here , I 'll open up the crate as soon as I get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the counter . Where do you want it ? NETTIE Comes downstairs . Let me take it up . JIMMIE It 's heavy . NETTIE Do n't be silly ! She takes the box and starts upstairs and exits. p. 23 DORIS If you 're going to be in here a little while I 'd like to check over the stuff in the storeroom . JIMMIE Goes back of the counter . If you do n't go trying to lift those heavy cases around or break your back working too hard . It would n't be so much of a joke , you know , if you killed yourself before we got what we started out after . DORIS Nobody ever died yet from being too happy , Jimmie  --  at least I never heard about it . Just call me if you want anything . She exits . JIMMIE works at desk as NETTIE enters and leans over the rail of the balcony . NETTIE We started up the new machine , Jimmie . It 's just wonderful . JIMMIE It ought to be ! You 'd think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . NETTIE You 'll get it back all right . She turns to go . JIMMIE Say , Nettie ? NETTIE Yes ? JIMMIE Did you see Eddie Mason before you come around this morning ? NETTIE No , I did n't . Eddie 's out a lot lately . p. 24 JIMMIE I was thinking it was sort of funny his not showing up to wish us luck  --  most of the old gang did . NETTIE It is sort of hard on him , you know  --  you and Doris . JIMMIE I know , that 's what was worrying me a little . NETTIE He 's a terrible sap  --  yesterday I told him  --  The door opens and DAVE MORRIS enters . Oh  --  I 'll be getting back . She exits . MORRIS How are you ? NETTIE , on the balcony , exits to the room at the right . JIMMIE Back of counter . Good afternoon . MORRIS You 're Alden ? JIMMIE Sure ! Glad to see you . MORRIS Thanks . I want to have a little talk . JIMMIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks steadily at JIMMIE . You look like a wise guy , Alden , a lad that 's been around a little . JIMMIE Laughs . If you mean around New York , I 've never been anywhere else . p. 25 MORRIS Some of the boys wanted me to drop over and ask you what you were willing to do for them ? JIMMIE Not understanding . Some of the boys ? MORRIS Yes . JIMMIE I do n't get you ? MORRIS You would n't kid me , Alden ? JIMMIE No , honest  --  say ! Wait ! You have n't got anything to do with this Austin Jones ? MORRIS I saw him , but get this right ! Jones is a bum ! Sort of a " legman " who runs errands once in a while for a case note to buy a shot of hop . What he was saying to some of the fellars was getting you in bad , so I thought I 'd drop in and fix things up  --  we do n't want any trouble , and I guess you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want any trouble , but I do n't get this at all ! Of course I 've read the papers and heard a lot of talk , but  --  but  --  MORRIS We think you 're going to work up a nice trade here , and I 'm in a position to fix things so you wo n't have any trouble at all . JIMMIE I told you I did n't want any trouble , and of course I don't. p. 26 MORRIS We wo n't press you , we 're in no hurry , but we want to get things set  --  a hundred a month starting the fifteenth if you 've got it ; if you have n't , and we 'll know about that , it will be all right to wait a little while . JIMMIE I 'm figuring on getting married . If I get a few dollars I 'll need ' em bad ! MORRIS I 'd like to get this settled . He waits a moment . Well ? JIMMIE What 's your name ? I 'd like to know who I 'm doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for you most any time , or somebody else that 's wise . JIMMIE Yeah ? MORRIS I want to get it settled ; you heard my proposition , all you 've got to do is say yes or no . JIMMIE Quietly . I 'm saying no . MORRIS Pleasantly . Think you 'd better ? JIMMIE I ca n't help it , part because I have n't the dough and part because all my life I 've been figuring on getting a business of my own , and running it myself  --  well  --  now I 've got it and there is n't any grafter this side of hell who 's going to run it for me ! p. 27 MORRIS You 're young , and green as hell  --  I 'm wondering if you  --  JIMMIE No ! Wait ! Of course you 've got your line and you want to spring it , but do n't ! MORRIS No ? JIMMIE No  --  I said what I had to say and my " say so " is law in this lousy little dump  --  ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're all right , Alden , no hard feeling , and do n't go twisting anything I said into any holdup racket , because it was n't ! I 'm acting for a private detective agency that makes a specialty of taking care of laundries , that 's all I am . JIMMIE It 's a swell business . Do n't trip on the " welcome " mat as you 're going out . MORRIS Looks about the room . Nice little place , all right , and you 're a good , straight-on-the-level sort of a guy . it would be too bad I  --  but what 's the use ! I guess I 'll be going along . As he turns to exit EDDIE MASON enters from the street . EDDIE is about twenty , rather too flashily dressed , but with a merry , lovable personality . He enters smiling and looks about . MORRIS To EDDIE . Hello , Kid . p. 28 EDDIE Oh ! He sees MORRIS and is evidently a little shocked . Hello ! MORRIS exits  --  EDDIE turns to JIMMIE a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , nothing  --  who is he , Eddie ? EDDIE Slowly . I met him to-day with a crowd of fellars , I did n't get the name . He 's some guy from out of town , I guess . JIMMIE Morris , Dave Morris . EDDIE I just met him in a crowd , the name do n't mean anything to me . JIMMIE He seemed to know you , all right . EDDIE Oh , sure ! You know how those things are . JIMMIE You go around a lot more than I do , Eddie . Ever run into a guy by the name of Austin Jones ? EDDIE Reluctantly . I 've seen him around . JIMMIE A couple of sweet little kidders , just trying to work a little bluff on me or something . EDDIE Nervously . Yes ? JIMMIE If Doris had n't just been lecturing me on catching flies with molasses I 'd about have taken a sock at those birds ! p. 29 EDDIE Gravely . I would n't do anything like that , Jimmie . You 've been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing perhaps a lot of things a guy hears that knocks around a little more than you do . It 's not so good right now  --  taking a sock at certain people  --  not if they should happen to be in good with the right crowd . JIMMIE This Jones is just a crummy old bum who blew in here and tried to hold me up for a hundred dollars a month . The other one was just a faker ! EDDIE Soberly . I do n't like it , Jimmie . It 's bad ! JIMMIE Like hell it 's bad , it 's a joke . EDDIE Doubtfully . Well  --  maybe  --  JIMMIE Sure it 's a joke  --  nobody going to get blood out of a stone , are they ? EDDIE No , I guess not , but of course somebody might be figuring that this business of yours would get to going good . JIMMIE Well , if it does , I 'll know what to do with the money all right . EDDIE Yes , I suppose so . JIMMIE Doris has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's got a lot coming to her . p. 30 EDDIE I guess she rates it all right . JIMMIE Sure , have a smoke . He helps himself to a cigarette from a package and offers it to EDDIE . EDDIE Thanks . He takes one . JIMMIE strikes a match and they both light their cigarettes . JIMMIE No hard feelings , Eddie ? EDDIE I do n't get you . JIMMIE About Doris . EDDIE That 's all right . JIMMIE You 're only a kid . EDDIE Sure  --  not old enough to know my own mind . JIMMIE I did n't mean that . EDDIE It 's all right , you 're a good guy , steady and sensible , you 're the kind she ought to hook up with . DORIS enters through door at right . DORIS Hello , Eddie ! EDDIE Hello ! JIMMIE She 's been getting things right in the storeroom , we 're expecting a big order in the morning . p. 31 DORIS Has n't Jimmie told you about it , Scott and Clayton ? EDDIE No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and holds out her hand . It was sweet of you to come over our very first day . EDDIE Why would n't I ? You 're pals of mine , both of you . JIMMIE I 'll say we are  --  everything all right , Doris ? DORIS It 's wonderful . EDDIE I guess it was coming to you . DORIS It 's like about a thousand kinds of fairyland all rolled into one !  --  Yesterday we were grubbing along at mean little jobs  --  now look at us  --  ! Nothing is going to happen to make me wake up , is there , Jimmie ? JIMMIE Not a thing  --  it ca n't . This is the chance I 've been waiting for  --  I 've got my hands right on it now . DORIS Maybe I 'd better be getting back to them ! JIMMIE I 'll go  --  you have a talk with Eddie . DORIS All right . JIMMIE Goes to the foot of the stairs . Maybe you can tell him better than I can that even if we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him around just the same as when we were all of us broke together . p. 32 EDDIE Maybe some folks would n't , but I know you two ! JIMMIE exits up the stairs and out at door to the work room on the balcony . DORIS It 's nice to see you doing so well , Eddie . EDDIE Coldly . Oh , I 've been lucky . DORIS You look it . Still with the same firm ? EDDIE Sure . I 'm getting on all right . DORIS Funny how little I know about your job . Just what do you do , Eddie ? EDDIE Oh , lots of things  --  that difference does it make ? DORIS You seem to be making plenty . EDDIE Sure , it 's swell . DORIS You look worried somehow ; you have the last two or three times I 've seen you  --  I 've been anxious . EDDIE I do n't know as you 've any reason to be  --  my job 's all right . Of course , I do n't say I would n't rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted to do  --  like Jimmie . DORIS I guess Jimmie 's lucky . EDDIE I know damned well he is  --  p. 33 DORIS I suppose so . EDDIE Directly to her . He 's got you ! DORIS I wish you would n't say things like that . EDDIE I suppose you do . DORIS Of course I do n't really mean that , Eddie ; what I really mean is I wish you would n't think things like that . EDDIE That makes it tougher  --  I need n't say anything , of course . I 'm not going to any more , but I ca n't promise not to think . DORIS You 've been sweet , and I like you a lot . EDDIE Yeah  --  I know . DORIS But I 'm almost four years older than you and  --  and I 've been crazy about Jimmie since along about the time you were in the fourth grade . EDDIE I know that , too . DORIS You 're going to be a good sport about it ? EDDIE Sure I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do n't see how any girl could help being after what he 's done . EDDIE What ? p. 34 DORIS He took a big chance and went into this business just for me . EDDIE Quietly . Well  --  as far as that goes I took a few chances myself , and I went into the business I 'm in  --  just for you . DORIS Surprised . Do n't be silly . EDDIE It did n't look to me that Jimmie was getting anywhere , and I thought I could  --  and I was sap enough to think if I did it might make a difference . DORIS No . If Jimmie went broke to-morrow it would n't matter to me , not a bit . The only reason I 'm so excited about all this making good is because I know it 's making him happy . EDDIE I see . DORIS Earnestly . I want you to see , Eddie . EDDIE Sure  --  DORIS And anyway you 're a silly boy . Nettie Pierce just worships the ground you walk on . EDDIE Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the ears . DORIS Being young is about the easiest thing in the world for a woman to get cured of . p. 35 EDDIE I guess so , you tell her some time I 've got a little brother at home and maybe he 'll grow up too . DORIS I wo n't butt in . She laughs . I guess I 'll have enough to do to take care of Jimmie . EDDIE Grimly . Believe me , you 'll have plenty ! DORIS Alarmed at his manner . What do you mean  --  you meant something , Eddie ! EDDIE He 's a good guy , but I would n't go so far as to say his eyes were mates  --  lots of things get past him . DORIS Angry . Is that so ! EDDIE I 'm not knocking . I keep tellin ' you I 'm strong for him , but he 's a " one track guy " and maybe some time he 'll find the switches set against him . DORIS He 's obstinate , I know  --  but I think a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away with it  --  listen , Doris , there 's a guy named Austin Jones that was in here , and he 's apt to come here again . DORIS What for ? EDDIE I think if it got right down to cases , Doris , I 'd go to hell for you most any time , but all I can say about this is that Jimmie must n't have any trouble with this Jones , or any of the crowd he runs with . p. 36 DORIS But why ? EDDIE Jones do n't amount to much , but he 's got friends . DORIS I guess Jimmie can take care of himself ! EDDIE If guys stopped thinkin ' that , there would n't be many hospitals . I 'm just tellin ' you , I ca n't do any more . DORIS Jimmie is hot tempered and of course he should n't have any trouble with anybody right now . I 'll speak to him . EDDIE Do that , then forget about it . What I mean is do n't do any gabbing about what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , why should I ? JENNIE and NETTIE enter to the balcony from the work room above . JENNIE goes at once to her ironing board , but NETTIE sees EDDIE as he stands below and bends over the rail of the balcony and calls to him . NETTIE Hello , Eddie . EDDIE Hello , pest . NETTIE Do you know what those new clothes you 've got on make you look like ? EDDIE As far as I know they 're all right . NETTIE Sure , they 're wonderful ! All you need now is some burnt cork and a banjo and you 'd be all set for a minstrel first part . p. 37 DORIS Do n't you mind a thing she says , she does n't mean a word of it . EDDIE Honest  --  ? Well , that helps a lot  --  just thinkin ' she did n't like this rig of mine damned near broke my heart . NETTIE Wait a minute ! I 'm coming down ! EDDIE Well , not if it 's any trouble to you . DORIS As NETTIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDDIE To NETTIE . She thinks you 've got feelings , pest ! What do you know about that ? NETTIE I was born with them the same as most other people , but living next door to you all my life has toughened me up considerable . She looks at him . I do n't like that tie ! EDDIE That 's tough luck ! NETTIE And those shoes are awful ! EDDIE I 'll throw the damned things away . As JIMMIE enters above . NETTIE You took your time coming around , did n't you ? Jimmie was feeling kind of bad about it . JIMMIE On the stairs . I was asking her a while ago if she 'd seen you to-day . He smiles . I would n't say I was worrying myself much . p. 38 NETTIE You and Doris have known him longer than you have any of the crowd , and he is the very last one to show up to wish you good luck . EDDIE I knew a guy once that was in such a hell of a hurry to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of trouble ! NETTIE How did he ? EDDIE He went into a shop to buy the feller a floral piece and he was in such a rush he could n't wait to have it delivered . NETTIE Well ? What about it ? EDDIE He started down the street with a big good luck horseshoe of roses in his arms and he stumbled over the God damned thing and broke his neck . NETTIE Even if a person with a good reputation told me that I would n't believe it . DORIS Laughs . Neither would I , Nettie . EDDIE Well , let it go  --  of course the poor slob is dead now or I 'd get him to come around and tell you all about it . How 's business ? NETTIE Fine ! DORIS It 's going to be ! JIMMIE We 're starting out all right . p. 39 EDDIE Swell ! NETTIE Jimmie has n't got a thing to worry about ! EDDIE Not so long as you 're around to help him . DORIS Nettie helps a lot ! EDDIE Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIMMIE Maybe I will at that ! NETTIE Angrily . I guess what I 'm getting is plenty for me and anyway I 'm getting mine honest . EDDIE Coldly . What do you mean by that ! NETTIE Nothing  --  only it gets me sore when anybody has n't got sense enough to see that this is going to be a swell business . EDDIE Maybe , but I 've been here quite a while and I would n't say there was much of a rush . DORIS Defiantly . It 's our first day  --  we knew it would take a little time to get going . EDDIE I was only kidding , Doris ; you 're all set , you ca n't go wrong . NETTIE Kidding is all right if you do n't go and hurt people 's feelings . p. 40 EDDIE Why do n't you send me that book on " How to Behave in Good Society "  --  the one your father caught you reading the other night ? NETTIE I do n't know what you 're talking about ! JIMMIE What book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know  --  how to keep your feet out of the finger bowls and never drop brown soup on a white vest . DORIS Laughs . What in the world were you doing with that , Nettie ? EDDIE Her old man was tickled pink . He ' most died laughing when he told me how she was working over it . NETTIE Angry . So he 's been tellin ' you that , has he ? EDDIE Yes ! He turns with a grin to DORIS . Her old man told me he caught her practicing how to write letters out of it  --  grand ones  --  " How to Write a Letter of Thanks Upon the Receipt of Wedding Gifts . " That 's a hot one ! NETTIE I suppose you two bums were in some speakeasy when he told you that ? EDDIE No , just sitting on the fire escape . p. 41 NETTIE Since you was so thick it 's a wonder he did n't say something about where do you get those swell clothes you 've been springing on us lately , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you a pocket full of money but ai n't good enough for you to tell anybody what it is ! DORIS Do n't , Nettie ! EDDIE Quietly . No , your old man did n't say anything like that  --  and I 'm glad he did n't , I would n't want to have any trouble with him , he 's always been my favorite in your family . NETTIE Please , Eddie  --  I did n't mean to talk like that ! EDDIE Oh , that 's all right . NETTIE Honest , I did n't ! You wo n't be sore ? EDDIE It do n't matter enough . Well  --  I 've got to be running along . DORIS Good-by , Eddie . EDDIE Good luck . DORIS Thank you . EDDIE goes toward the door . NETTIE Eddie ! EDDIE Stops at the door . Well ? p. 42 EDDIE Nothing  --  EDDIE That 's what I thought . He turns to go . NETTIE But , Eddie ! He turns back . EDDIE Well ? NETTIE A man gave father a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good ! EDDIE Coldly . Well ? NETTIE I  --  I was just wondering if  --  if anybody over at your place would want to go with me ? EDDIE Well , I do n't know . I 'll ask Mother , but I 'm afraid she 'll say my little brother is too young to go out nights . He exits . DORIS Kindly . I would n't take what he says too seriously . NETTIE Angrily . Anybody would think he was a thousand years old ! DORIS Jimmie thought that when he was twenty-one  --  boys are funny ! NETTIE If you ask me , I do n't think they 're so damned funny ! I 'll murder Father to-night for telling him about those letters . p. 43 JIMMIE Eddie 's always kidding you  --  he does n't mean a thing . NETTIE And do n't I know it ? JIMMIE Well , what more do you want ? NETTIE Maybe you know a lot about the laundry business , but if I was you I would n't worry too much about anything else . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb  --  or I am . I wonder which ? DORIS Laughs . I do n't know , but I 'd say you were a lot alike , both of you know what you want in this world  --  only it does n't happen to be the same thing . NETTIE On the balcony . Do you want a light lit down there ? JIMMIE Not yet , I guess . Throw them on up there if you need them . NETTIE To JENNIE . How is everything ? JENNIE Well , I would n't like to say . Nothing awful has happened yet , but I 'm on the lookout for it . JIMMIE Push things along and we can be all cleaned up by closing time . p. 44 NETTIE Easy . She exits . Downstairs DORIS is standing at her high bookkeeper 's desk back of the counter . During the following scene , on the balcony above the workers work at their ironing boards and exit and enter from time to time as they finish their work , and carry piles of freshly ironed laundry into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf at the back on which laundry slips and empty boxes , etc. , are stored . DORIS looks up from her work . DORIS Jimmie ? JIMMIE Yes . He is working with his back to her and does not turn . DORIS Who 's Austin Jones ? JIMMIE Jones ? DORIS A man who came in here to see you ? JIMMIE Oh  --  him  --  he 's nobody . DORIS Come over here , I want to talk to you . JIMMIE I got to get these shelves straight . DORIS Come over here , Jimmie . JIMMIE Oh , all right . He crosses slowly over . What is it now ? p. 45 DORIS Who 's Austin Jones ? JIMMIE What do you know about him ? DORIS Eddie Mason says he 's a man you ca n't afford to have any trouble with . JIMMIE Eddie 's just a kid  --  I guess he 's been going to the movies or something . DORIS He seemed worried about it  --  I do n't know why . JIMMIE This Jones just drifted in here and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORIS Surprised . How could he ? JIMMIE He could n't , of course , he 's just a bluffer . DORIS What did he want a hundred a month for doing ? JIMMIE I told you he was just a bluff , did n't I ? DORIS Even at that he must have told you what he was offering for that kind of money . JIMMIE Protection , he said , and another guy came in later and tried to put over the same bluff . DORIS Startled . Protection ? JIMMIE Talked about some mysterious friend they had , said he was a " wise guy " who 'd see to it that nobody pulled any rough stuff around this laundry . p. 46 DORIS Anxious . You think he was just bluffing ? JIMMIE Sure ! DORIS You think it does n't amount to anything ? JIMMIE Of course . DORIS Gravely . Eddie did n't think so . JIMMIE To hell with Eddie . DORIS He 's a good kid ! JIMMIE Sure . DORIS Anxiously . Do you know , Jimmie , that when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my books every month  --  rather a big one  --  Mr. MacDonald never told me what it was for  --  JIMMIE What of it ? DORIS But I 'm sure it was something like that  --  graft  --  protection money  --  I never knew who really got it . JIMMIE That was a big company , and MacDonald was mixed up in politics and all sorts of things  --  we do n't want anything from anybody , kid , it 's just you and me . DORIS I suppose it 's all right ? p. 47 JIMMIE Sure  --  not that we 're always going to be just a little one horse affair like this . I 've got a lot of plans ! DORIS I know you have , Jimmie  --  that 's why we 've got such a swell chance . JIMMIE You would n't kid me ? You honestly believe in me ? DORIS Of course I do  --  spring the latest big idea ! JIMMIE Business is lousy  --  everywhere  --  all kinds of business . DORIS Of course . JIMMIE To get any trade at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure we can do just as good work as anybody . JIMMIE We 've got to do more than that . Good work , of course , and lots of little extras thrown in . I 'm going to make a special play for the men . I lay awake last night thinking about it . Every soft shirt that goes out of this place , and all the underclothes , will have every button sewed on ' em , and every pair of socks that had a hole in it when it came here is going back ready to put right on a fellow 's foot . I was thinking out a slogan for it  --  " Sometimes your wife sews a button on your shirt , Alden 's Laundry always does . " p. 48 DORIS And we could send out a " throw away " to the college boys and young fellows , get a snappy phrase for them too . JIMMIE Sure  --  wait  --  " You do n't need a wife if you go to Alden 's Laundry . " DORIS Coldly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How 's this ? " Get the Alden 's Laundry habit  --  cheaper than getting married and a damned sight safer . " DORIS Offended . Oh , is that so ! JIMMIE Catches her hand . Say , Doris  --  I 'm so happy it scares me sick ! DORIS Tenderly . Jimmie , dear ! She puts one arm about him as they stand in the fading sunlight at the right , hidden by the overhanging balcony from the workers above . JIMMIE It 's been so damned long ! DORIS I always knew you 'd do it ! I trusted you every minute ! JIMMIE I 'd have been a poor sort of fish if I could n't have made the grade with you waiting for me . DORIS And now we do n't have to wait very much more . p. 49 JIMMIE That 's what I want to fix with you right now .  --  To-night I want you to tell your mother  --  As he speaks a small , round black object is thrown with a crash through the glass of the window at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show window . DORIS and JIMMIE turn at the sound and there is a fairly loud explosion among the laundered goods in the window  --  shirts and laundered goods are thrown in the air , the shelves at the back where JIMMIE was working are wrecked , the breaking window falls in and the front door is torn from its hinges . The workers above run to the edge of the balcony and look over . NETTIE screams . DORIS What is it ? JIMMIE The bastards ! NETTIE Jimmie ! Jimmie ! She runs down the stairs . JIMMIE Wait ! He goes to the counter and works the dial phone . NETTIE But , Jimmie ! JIMMIE Sternly . Wait , I say ! DORIS Sternly . Be quiet , Nettie ! JIMMIE To phone . Hello ! This is James Alden . I 've got a laundry , 210 West 52nd Street . I just opened to-day and a man came in and tried to hold me up for a hundred a month  --  I gave him the air and just now the front of my place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk  --  I know this man  --  I 've got his name  --  I want you to send a man over  --  As he talks theCURTAIN FALLS. @x The set is the same . It is late afternoon of the next day . The damage caused by the explosion the evening before has been largely repaired and the broken window at the back has been boarded up with unpainted boards nailed across the opening . Now the only opening for daylight is the window on the balcony above . The light is now dim under the balcony when the electric lights are not on . When the curtain rises NETTIE and JENNIE are at work sweeping up the sawdust , ends of boards and general litter left by the carpenters when they finished their job . Above on the balcony JOHN , the Chinaman , and MISS FALLEN are working on great piles of sheets and pillow cases . NETTIE I do n't know what more we can do . Just clean this mess up and wait until we get a new window put in before we open up the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busted windows must be a good business  --  the only thing in this world that 's sure to happen is accidents . NETTIE Accidents ! I guess there was n't much accident about this ! Whoever did this thing knew what they were doing  --  it would n't have surprised me any if we 'd all of us been murdered where we stood ! JENNIE Me either  --  I 've always been sort of expecting it . Where 's the dustpan  --  Oh , yes  --  here it is  --  She sweeps the pile up into the dustpan. p. 52 NETTIE Mother said this morning she did n't see much sense in being worried . She says lightning never strikes twice in the same place . JENNIE As a rule it ai n't necessary . MISS FALLEN From the balcony . There 's something awful monotonous about keepin ' on ironing just sheets and pillow cases . Do n't it sort of get you exasperated , John ? JOHN Calmly . It 's all light by me . MISS FALLEN I suppose so . Seems to me there ai n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pillow cases . NETTIE From below . It 's a good thing for us we got that Scott and Clayton job . It will carry us until Jimmie gets the place opened up again . Maybe after all we 're luckier than we think we are . JENNIE As she sweeeps . If I ai n't luckier than I think I am all I can say is I hope I never find it out . Nobody in my family was ever lucky  --  Mother always says it started the day she met Father for the first time  --  seems it was the wrong month or something . Jupiter and Mars were  --  I do n't just remember what they was doing  --  but something they ought n't to  --  There is a sharp knock at the closed door at the back. p. 53 NETTIE Looks at the door . Do you suppose that 's a customer ? JENNIE Grimly . I doubt it . NETTIE It might be . JENNIE Of course it might ! Or it might be more bad news . NETTIE Do n't be silly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . IRMA and DICK TANNER enter , as DORIS enters from store room Right DORIS Hello , Irma ! NETTIE Come in ! DICK and IRMA enter , IRMA very cold and angry . DICK follows her , a little upset and carrying a package . IRMA Where 's Jimmie ? DORIS In there . IRMA Coldly . I want him . DORIS What for ! IRMA Never mind ! I just want to see him ! DORIS Goes to the door of the storeroom at the right and calls . Dick and Irma are here , Jimmie ! p. 54 JIMMIE Oke ! NETTIE To IRMA . I guess you heard about what happened here ? JIMMIE enters . JIMMIE Hello ! DICK Embarrassed . Sorry about the trouble , Jimmie ! JIMMIE Thanks . IRMA Coldly . So am I , of course , only you 're not the only one in trouble . JIMMIE Struck by the cold fury in her voice . What is it ? IRMA Show him , Dick ! DICK Embarrassed . Well , you see , Jimmie  --  IRMA You show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the paper off , showing a cardboard laundry box . DICK Hesitates . You see , Jimmie  --  IRMA Oh , shut up ! She pulls the cover off the laundry box . Look ! DORIS What is it ? p. 55 IRMA Me sendin ' you my very best wedding underclothes , so 's the first laundry you sent out would be something classy ! Look ! Just ruined !  --  JIMMIE Say ! He holds up some articles of laundry covered with great blotches of ink . DICK It 's ink ! See ! There 's a hole in the bottom of the box , you can see where somebody poured a bottle of ink right into it ! NETTIE Buy why ? IRMA I 'd have thought after Dick and I bein ' such good friends to you and Doris you might have been a little careful about sending our things back to us ! JIMMIE I took it myself , last night . You and Dick were out to a movie  --  I left the package with the hall man , he said it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he says you left it just like it is right now . JIMMIE No . IRMA What do you suppose it would get the hall man to ruin my things ? JIMMIE Patiently . Well , Irma , if it comes to that what do you think it 's getting me ? IRMA Maybe talk is going to take those ink stains off ! p. 56 DORIS Please , Irma ! DICK That 's what I say ! JIMMIE I 'll make it good ! DICK No ! IRMA Turns on DICK fiercely . Will you be quiet ? DICK All right . Settle it among yourselves ! Thank God I 've got some work to do ! He exits . IRMA The only really nice things I ever had  --  and Dick 's salary 's been cut  --  DORIS Leave these things here , Irma . What we ca n't fix will be replaced . I 'll see to it myself ! IRMA I do n't care what Dick says ! You 've got to do it ! JIMMIE You heard what Doris told you . IRMA We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but anybody could see I could n't stand for a thing like this ! How could I ! DORIS It 's all right . I 'm sorry , Irma . She puts the box on the shelf under the counter . IRMA I suppose you 're sore , and I know Dick is  --  but they 're the only really swell things I ever had in my life ! p. 57 DORIS I 'm sorry ! IRMA Almost crying as she exits . And a lot of good that 's going to do me ! DORIS Amazed , turns to Jimmie . What is it , Jimmie ? JIMMIE Slowly . I do n't kknow  --  I 'm beginning to think  --  DORIS Think what , Jimmie ? JIMMIE I do n't know  --  DORIS There 's something queer about it ! JIMMIE Yes  --  maybe  --  something damned queer . NETTIE You do n't think it was my fault ! JIMMIE No  --  I do n't think it was your fault  --  maybe I wish I did  --  DORIS What do you mean ? JIMMIE Never mind right now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exits . JENNIE What do you think , Doris ? DORIS That ink could n't have got on it here . At least , I do n't see how ! Exits to the room at the right. p. 58 NETTIE TO JENNIE . It did n't ! I made up the box myself ! EDDIE enters through the door at the back . EDDIE I just heard about the trouble here last night ! Where 's Jimmie ? NETTIE In there ! EDDIE Anxiously . Doris all right ? NETTIE Why would n't she be ? I 'd have told you all about it last night only you did n't come home  --  I watched for a light in your window until  --  I do n't know  --  long after midnight ! EDDIE Scornfully . I was at Thursday night prayer meeting , the sermon was maybe a little longer than usual . I wish you 'd tell Jimmie I want to see him . JENNIE I 'll tell him . She starts out right . EDDIE I do n't want to trouble you . JENNIE Maybe if you 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you call trouble ! She exits . NETTIE I went over to your place last night about nine o'clock and asked your mother where you were  --  and she started crying . p. 59 EDDIE Hurt . Mother did ? NETTIE She thinks an awful lot of you . EDDIE Yeah ! NETTIE Gently . I 'm sorry I said those mean things to you when you were here yesterday . I wo n't ever say anything like that again . EDDIE Say , Nettie ? NETTIE Well ? EDDIE She did n't say anything to you about what she was crying for , did she ? NETTIE No  --  but I guess I knew well enough . EDDIE About me ? NETTIE About the swell clothes you 're wearing all of a sudden , and the money you 've got in your pocket all the time , and the sort of people she sees you with on the street . EDDIE Yeah  --  I know . NETTIE Of course I 'm just a friend of yours but it 's worried me  --  a lot  --  an awful lot  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NETTIE Father says he could get you a job driving one of the delivery wagons  --  it 's only thirty a week  --  but I wish you 'd take it . p. 60 EDDIE Coldly . I 'd like to  --  but I ca n't  --  not right now . NETTIE I know it is n't much ! EDDIE Desperately . Oh , Jesus ! If I only could ! NETTIE Joyfully . Eddie ! Really would you ! EDDIE I 'm telling you I ca n't ! There 's some jobs you get into easy  --  then you ca n't get out ! NETTIE Awed . Not ever ? EDDIE Some way  --  you 'll see  --  it 's going to be all right . Do n't say anything to mother but maybe I can tell her something that will make everything all right in just a couple more days . DORIS enters with JIMMIE . DORIS Hello , Eddie . EDDIE I just heard about it and I came right over . DORIS I do n't know what to do . Jimmie says everything is all right  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDDIE Sure , I know . JIMMIE Well , Eddie ? p. 61 EDDIE Looks at the window . A lousy trick ! JIMMIE Did Doris tell you all about it ? EDDIE No , but I guess I heard it all . JIMMIE The police were here ,  --  went over the place and asked a lot of questions  --  but that wo n't pay for the damage . EDDIE It 's a big town , Jimmie , most anybody could bounce a pill through that window and just keep on walking  --  I do n't know as I 'd blame the police for that . JIMMIE Fiercely . I 'm in the laundry business , I 'm not here to blame anybody or to praise them  --  all I 'm asking for is a break  --  and by God , I 'm going to have it ! EDDIE Sure . JIMMIE It was this Dave Morris or some of his gang  --  I been trying to locate this Morris all last night and to-day , but nobody ever heard of him  --  you ca n't help me , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jimmie . JIMMIE You know this Austin Jones ! EDDIE Reluctantly . Yes . p. 62 JIMMIE I raised hell last night until they arrested him . EDDIE What ! He steps forward in horror . JIMMIE Why not ? EDDIE They locked him up ! JIMMIE No , they did n't lock him up . He had n't been ten minutes at the station house when they sprung him on a bail bond ! EDDIE Oh  --  I see ! He is shocked . JIMMIE A cat would have laughted at the story he told ! He 's got nothing to worry about  --  at least not from the police . JIMMIE says this with so much hate in his tone that DORIS looks at him in alarm . NETTIE It just makes me furious to see him get away with it . JIMMIE Sternly . The law wo n't get him but maybe I can . EDDIE What do you mean ? JIMMIE I mean I 'll break his damned jaw for him ! DORIS No , Jimmie ! JIMMIE You know how long I worked for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order we 're working on now I wo n't have even enough cash to pay for a new show window  --  every dollar , every dime , meant just so many more minutes I could have to get started in  --  some bastard blew up this place last night  --  do you know the time they picked for it  --  the very minute I was starting to tell Doris that after all these years I could ask her to let me take care of her . A shrill scream , high and startling , comes from the room at the right on the balcony . They all turn. p. 63 NETTIE What is it ? DORIS It 's Jennie ! As the men start for the stairs , JENNIE runs in on the balcony with a wet sheet in her hands . JENNIE Look ! Jimmie ! She holds the sheet up and we see that there are great holes in it . Look ! JIMMIE Wait ! He runs upstairs . JENNIE Look , Jimmie ! JIMMIE Here ! By now he is on the balcony by her side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of ' em are like that ! Every sheet and pillow case in the big machine ! JIMMIE To those below . Here ! Look at this damned thing ! He throws the wet sheet over the rail and goes quickly out the door to the work room followed by JENNIE , JOHN and MISS FALLEN . DORIS picks up the sheet . DORIS It 's ruined ! What is it ? Look ! She pulls gently at the sheet and the rotted fabric parts in her hand. p. 64 EDDIE The water has been doped ! DORIS Doped ? EDDIE With acid ! See ! He rips the cloth . The cloth has been rotted away ! NETTIE But what does it mean , Eddie ? EDDIE Earnestly . You said just a while ago that all you cared about was Jimmie ! For God 's sake remember that and try to make him stop fighting . You 've got to ! DORIS How can I ?  --  and how can you expect him not to fight ? JIMMIE enters on the balcony above , followed by the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The workers look at him over the balcony and those on the floor below watch him anxiously . JIMMIE The whole wash  --  like that . He points to the sheet that DORIS still holds . Hundreds of dollars worth of linen is ruined  --  and so am I. He sits down heavily . DORIS Goes to him . Some way we can make it good ! EDDIE Sure you can ! All you need is a break ! JIMMIE Quietly . I 'm going to get a break , you watch me ! He rises . He goes and takes up the telephone book and hunts for a number. p. 65 EDDIE Anxiously . I 'd take it easy , old man , if I were you ! JIMMIE Yeah ? DORIS Why do n't you talk to Eddie , Jimmie dear , before you do anything ? JIMMIE has found his number and starts to work the dial phone . Eddie 's smart , he goes around a lot , maybe he could tell you what to do . JIMMIE To phone . This is James Alden . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the man he got a letter from this morning , maybe he 'll remember it . Alden 's the name ! EDDIE Quietly . Stop him , Doris . DORIS Jimmie ! JIMMIE To phone . Yes , sir  --  yes  --  I wrote you last night about the trouble I had here in my laundry on Fifty-second Street . Just now I found out some one has put acid in my washing machine and ruined a lot of linen  --  I want to be nice about this , sir  --  I do n't want to make any trouble , I 'm nobody  --  I have n't any drag or any influence or any money  --  but either I 've got a right to make a living here in this city or I have n't  --  I want to know ! I 'm putting it right up to you !  --  Yes  --  Yes , sir  --  210 West 52nd Street  --  yes  --  any  --  time  --  thanks . He turns to the others . He 's sending a man up right away . p. 66 EDDIE Alarmed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIMMIE Yes . EDDIE I see . He is evidently troubled by this . DORIS Anxiously . You look worried , Eddie ! Should n't he have done that ? JIMMIE I went straight to Headquarters ! Can you tell me any reason I should n't ? EDDIE I have n't said anything , have I ? JIMMIE That Scott and Clayton job was my chance  --  now I 'm ditched . DORIS You can tell them about it , maybe they will give you a little time to make good . JIMMIE I ca n't fight ' em without a dime ! I guess they 've licked me ! NETTIE You do n't lick easy ! JIMMIE I figured I 'd played everything safe  --  God knows I thought enough about it . NETTIE Is n't there anything they can do , Eddie ? EDDIE There 's only one way I know , and you might get sore , Jimmie , if I told you . p. 67 NETTIE Why should he ? DORIS He would n't , of course ! JIMMIE Mostly when you shove a drowning man a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been doing well lately . I 've got some money here , not an awful lot . He takes a roll of bills out of his pocket . JIMMIE I could n't take your money ! NETTIE I do n't see why not , if he wants you to . EDDIE When Austin Jones was here yesterday he told you if you 'd come across with a hundred a month he 'd fix everything so 's it would be all right . JIMMIE Yes . EDDIE Separates some bills and holds a large number out to JIMMIE . Send for him and hand him this . JIMMIE No . EDDIE In a month you might be all right , if you were n't maybe I could let you have another hundred  --  I do n't know . JIMMIE I 'd go hungry before I 'd do a thing like that ! EDDIE Quietly . Would you let her ? He looks at DORIS. p. 68 JIMMIE Put your roll away . I 'm out to run an honest business , and I 'm going to run it on the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . Maybe you know best . I hope you do . JIMMIE You heard me put it straight up to the Commissioner . EDDIE Yeah . JIMMIE Do you mean to say you do n't think he can take care of me as well as this Jones could , or this Dave Morris ! EDDIE I was n't saying anything , Jimmie , only just that if you and Doris were up against it I 'd stake you to a hundred if you wanted it . JIMMIE Not for that , we do n't . DORIS But thank you , Eddie , for offering just the same . EDDIE That 's all right  --  well  --  I 'll be going along now , see you to-night , maybe . NETTIE I 'll see you anyway , Eddie ! EDDIE Swell  --  He goes to the door . DORIS Thanks , Eddie ! EDDIE I guess I did n't do much . He exits. p. 69 JIMMIE Queer  --  Eddie offering to lend me money for a thing like that , but I guess he meant it all right . NETTIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and if you ask me I think you ought to listen to him . She goes to the stairs . Maybe we can save some of those things upstairs , I guess I 'll go up and help the others . She goes upstairs and out to the right , where the other workers are now gathered . JIMMIE They wo n't save anything , not a chance . DORIS We 've got the laundry open , Jimmie , that 's what we always wanted ! We 've had terrible luck but we can win out and we 're going to !  --  JIMMIE I do n't know . DORIS Jimmie  --  dearest  --  you must n't lose your nerve ! JIMMIE No , I have n't  --  I 'll do what I can to square that ruined linen upstairs , I 'll get the police to protect us and I 'll open this place up again on Monday morning . I 'll keep it open as long as I can . DORIS Sadly . But now it 's different ? JIMMIE I 've been thinking  --  about things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . p. 70 DORIS What things , Jimmie ? JIMMIE Maybe the thing I 'm beginning to think I 'm up against other people here in this city , and in other cities , are up against , too , I 'm going to find out all about this thing , Doris  --  all about it ! DORIS All you have to do is be patient , in just a little while everybody in this neighborhood will be fighting your battles for you . JIMMIE Smiles . If they 'd just let me alone , I do n't know but I 'd be pretty well satisfied . There is a knock at the door . DORIS Somebody 's there ! The door opens and JUDGE HIGGINS enters . JUDGE I beg your pardon , I saw the sign " Closed , " but I heard somebody talking . DORIS Eagerly . It 's Judge Higgins , Jimmie  --  maybe he could help you ! JUDGE Well , maybe I could ! Nothing in the world I like better than to lend a hand to young people when I can  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what happened here yesterday afternoon ? JUDGE Yes  --  it was an outrage , of course , some young ruffian in the neighborhood threw some explosive through your window . p. 71 JIMMIE You know why , do n't you ? JUDGE Just some kid trying to be funny  --  started celebrating the Fourth a little early . JIMMIE Earnestly . It 's part of a hold-up game , Judge . JUDGE Now , my boy , I would n't exaggerate this thing if I were you . JIMMIE Coldly . No ? DORIS But he was threatened just before it happened ! A man tried to get protection money out of him . JUDGE I do n't think I would say that if I were you  --  I am speaking merely as a well wisher of you youngsters  --  these sort of stories do n't do a neighborhood any good . DORIS But Mr. Alden found the man last night and had him arrested . JUDGE I am wondering if that was wise ? It 's very important the impression a newcomer makes  --  good fellowship , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you I almost think I 'd let the matter drop and not think any more about it . What do you say ? JIMMIE I say no . JUDGE I would n't be hasty about a thing like this . p. 72 JIMMIE He 's out on bail , but I 'm going to get him ! You watch me ! JUDGE You 'll do as you please , of course  --  but really I do n't think what you are doing is wise  --  natural , of course , but not wise ! JIMMIE What would you have me do ? JUDGE Make friends with everybody  --  not enemies  --  go more than half way to meet the conditions and the customs of a new neighborhood  --  at least that 's always been my motto , and I have n't suffered from it . JIMMIE Are you asking me to make friends with a bunch of grafters ! JUDGE Coldly . I ? Why should I ? What you do is your own affair , of course . I merely dropped in here to get my laundry . DORIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes package from shelf . I had it run through special . I would n't want you to think we were n't always ready to do a service . JUDGE Coldly . How much do I owe you ? DORIS It 's sixty-five cents , but please do n't pay cash , Judge . See  --  She opens a ledger on her desk . I 've opened an account with you here in my book  --  outside of the little trade we brought here with us you are our very first customer . p. 73 JUDGE Here 's the sixty-five cents . He drops coins on the counter and takes up the package . I do n't want you to open any account with me . After this I 'm going to take my things to the Chinaman on the next block . JIMMIE smiles sadly . DORIS But why ? JIMMIE Coldly . There 's no reason Judge Higgins should n't take his trade to any one he wants to . DORIS But he has n't so much as opened the package ! How does he know that our work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting along in years ; I could be the father of either one of you two , and maybe I 've learned a few things you have n't . You ca n't get along in this world high-hatting everybody . It 's give and take , just as I told you yesterday , my trade may not amount to much but it goes to regular fellows , Alden . DORIS I do n't know what you 're talking about . JUDGE Mostly the folks that have trouble around here are the ones that are looking for trouble . It 's so easy to get along in this world that it makes an old man like me laugh to see an obstinate young fellow breaking his neck butting his head against stone walls . p. 74 JIMMIE Just a minute , Judge ! Do you know a man named Dave Morris ? JUDGE Dave Morris ? No , never heard of him . JIMMIE Do you know a man named Austin Jones ? JUDGE Jones ? Oh , yes  --  yes , what about it ? JIMMIE Sort of a politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd call a very important one . JIMMIE But useful sometimes , along about election time ? JUDGE He 's a good worker , yes  --  a good party man . JIMMIE And maybe you would n't take your laundry away from me if Austin Jones and I got to be good pals ? JUDGE Pleased . I guess you 're going to turn into a regular after all , Alden . He picks up the sixty-five cents from the counter and puts his package of laundry down . What I like about a neighborhood like this is it 's so easy for all of us to get along together , like I said , give and take . JIMMIE Grimly . But you see , Judge , Austin Jones and I are not going to be pals . p. 75 JUDGE Coldly . No ? JIMMIE No . JUDGE I see . He puts the sixty-five cents back on the counter and takes up the package . JIMMIE Jones is out after me  --  well  --  I 'm out after him  --  do you get that , Judge ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your laundry to the Chinaman on the next block it 's all right with me . JUDGE I will . In a way I suppose it 's a sort of a duty  --  After all he 's been in business in this ward for some time ; you have n't , and if I was asked I 'd say I do n't think you ever will be . Nice summer afternoon , looks promising for a clear day for the Fourth of July . He exits . DORIS Afraid . Could you afford to do that ? JIMMIE I could n't afford not to . DORIS He 's a big man . JIMMIE The law is bigger . DORIS I hope so . JIMMIE This is n't a game I 'm playing , I 'm fighting for my life and I 've got to know where I stand ! p. 76 DORIS If we could only just run this little business and not pay any attention to anything else . JIMMIE About all I know about business I learned from my father . He did n't leave any money , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good man and he always said a business could n't live that was n't founded on honesty and fair play . DORIS I guess maybe the automobiles killed more than the harness business ! The door at the back opens and AUSTIN JONES slouches in in his peculiar crab-like manner . JONES The sign on the door says you 'll be opening up again Monday ? JIMMIE Sternly . What do you mean ? JONES Me ? Why , nothing  --  I just happened to drift in  --  JIMMIE It 's a wonder it does n't get you in trouble sometimes . JONES Why no , no  --  I would n't say it did . Of course once in a while people make mistakes , like you did when you had me arrested last night . JIMMIE You know what you did , and so do I ! JONES No , you do n't  --  I do n't know a thing about what happened last night , and neither do you . p. 77 JIMMIE Somebody threw some sort of a bomb through that window , I know that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what I 'm wondering is why should anybody do a thing like that ? JIMMIE I do n't know if you do n't . JONES No , I do n't  --  unless of course , it was just to remind you . JIMMIE Just to remind me ? JONES Something like that . JIMMIE Of what I 'd get if I did n't come across ? JONES I 'd think so , only of course I do n't know anything about it . JIMMIE You go back to the gang that sent you here and tell ' em there 's absolutely nothing doing  --  make ' em understand that ! JONES There did n't nobody send me  --  I just sort of drifted in . JIMMIE Tell ' em they can blow my place up again , they can put more acid in my wash , they can burn this joint down if they think they can get away with it  --  but they ca n't scare me , not any more  --  make that clear  --  give ' em that message for me  --  He steps up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lousy pimp ! He swings a wicked upper-cut to JONES ' jaw that sends him crashing to the floor . At this moment the outside door opens and DAN COSTIGAN enters . COSTIGAN is a pleasant young fellow from the Central Office , a detective from Police Headquarters in plain clothes. p. 78 DORIS Afraid . Jimmie ! Do n't ! COSTIGAN Hello ! He looks at JONES , who gets up unsteadily . Oh , it 's you , Jones ? JONES I 'm glad you 're here , Mr. Costigan  --  I want you to arrest that guy for assault ! COSTIGAN Who on ? JONES On me ! You was just coming in that door when he socked me ! COSTIGAN Was I ? I did n't notice . I was thinking about something else . JONES I want you to arrest him . COSTIGAN Go get a warrant . JONES Snarls . Oh ! Just like that ? COSTIGAN Just like that ! And Jones , do n't get started telling me about some friend of yours that 's going to have me broke , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just going to sock you on the other side of your jaw ! Now beat it ! JONES This is getting to be a hell of a town ! He exits . COSTIGAN To JIMMIE . My name 's Costigan , Dan Costigan . I 'm from Police Headquarters . How about us two sitting down and you tellin ' me all about your troubles ? p. 79 JIMMIE Let 's do that . This is Miss Sabin , Mr. Costigan . COSTIGAN Glad to meet you . DORIS You 're going to help us , are n't you ? COSTIGAN I do n't know why I would n't  --  that is , if I can . JIMMIE I think you can  --  Sit here . DORIS Do you want me to stay , Jimmie ? JIMMIE Of course . Sit down . He sits on the counter , facing COSTIGAN , who is in a chair . COSTIGAN Well , I do n't know  --  To DORIS . How would it be if you ran away and left this young fellow and me to get acquainted ? DORIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I guess from the looks of you , we 're going to get that . COSTIGAN Sabin ? That 's no Irish name , but some one in your family has heard about the blarney stone . DORIS I 'll be upstairs if you want me . She exits up the stairs and out at the right . COSTIGAN takes a notebook out of his pocket and glances at it . JIMMIE Well ? p. 80 COSTIGAN Some fellow came into this place yesterday and tried to hold you up for a hundred a month ? JIMMIE This Jones ! The bird I socked in the jaw just as you came in . COSTIGAN I did n't notice , I was thinking about something else . JIMMIE Yeah ? COSTIGAN This Jones is a grafter , but he 's slick , nobody has ever pinned anything on him . JIMMIE But you know he 's a crook ? COSTIGAN Sure . JIMMIE But when I had him arrested last night he was out on bail in ten minutes . COSTIGAN That 's the law , if his bail bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and put a proposition straight up to me , put it into words . COSTIGAN Coldly . Have him pinched ? JIMMIE Nobody seems to know him  --  he might be a ghost  --  COSTIGAN More likely to be an outside man , from Detroit or Toledo or somewhere  --  he did his job and got out , that 's the way they mostly work it . p. 81 JIMMIE You think he , or some one he represents , wrecked this place last night ? COSTIGAN Sure . JIMMIE What are you going to do about it ? COSTIGAN You could get out a " John Doe " warrant for this Morris . JIMMIE I did , but nobody seems to know where to look for him . COSTIGAN What did Jones say at the station house ? JIMMIE Said he came in here looking for a job as night watchman . COSTIGAN Yes ? JIMMIE Said he told me there were a lot of tough guys in this neighborhood and he 'd take the job of watching this place nights for a hundred a month . COSTIGAN Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? COSTIGAN You 've got to prove there was more to it than that . JIMMIE Do n't you think my place being blown up right after , rather goes to prove that ? COSTIGAN Any kid in the neighborhood might have thrown a pill through your window just to get a kick out of it . p. 82 JIMMIE You know better than that ! COSTIGAN No  --  Kids are different from what they used to be in one way , and a hell of a lot alike in another . Mostly kids do the thing they think it 's smart to do  --  anything  --  sometimes when the bands are playing they 'll go out and get shot for their country  --  right now , they think it 's smart to go out and hold up a truck . JIMMIE No kid did a thing like that ! COSTIGAN You do n't know that ! At the line up at headquarters this morning we took loaded guns off of eleven boys , not one of ' em sixteen years old . JIMMIE Then it 's time you did something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you ! I mean the whole country . COSTIGAN I 'd say there were two or three jobs it was time somebody did  --  but maybe you 've noticed that these jobs that " Mr. Somebody " ought to attend to are a hell of a long time getting done . JIMMIE And while we 're waiting , what 's going to become of me ? COSTIGAN I 'll do what I can , that 's what I came up here for . JIMMIE Wait ! He picks up the ruined sheet from where it has been thrown and opens it up . Take a look . p. 83 COSTIGAN Yeah  --  I 've seen jobs like that before . JIMMIE Scornfully . Maybe some kid did that ! COSTIGAN No , I guess not , but that is n't saying we know who did it ! JIMMIE We 've got to know ! COSTIGAN I 'd say this gang meant business , Mr. Alden . JIMMIE That 's how it looks to me ! COSTIGAN We 'll do what we can , but it 's no cinch . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIMMIE You saw that girl who just went upstairs ? COSTIGAN Yes , nice-looking girl . JIMMIE We were just going to be married , when this broke . COSTIGAN That 's tough . JIMMIE There must be something I can do ! COSTIGAN Are you talkin ' to me as a cop or just a couple of fellows together ? JIMMIE My cards are on the table ! I 've got to beat this or I 'm sunk , and I 've got to beat it quick ! COSTIGAN Got any money ? p. 84 JIMMIE No . COSTIGAN Looks about . You might work up quite a nice little trade here . JIMMIE I know I could . COSTIGAN Ever think about having a little talk with this Jones , not the kind you were having when I came in ? JIMMIE Fall for his graft , you mean ? COSTIGAN I do n't know but this business could stand a hundred a month and have enough left over to take care of a nice girl and maybe a kid or two . JIMMIE I wo n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . Forget we mentioned it , I was just feeling a little sorry for you  --  and the girl . JIMMIE You mean you do n't think I can fight them ? COSTIGAN Sure you can , only it 's harder than you know . JIMMIE The police have got to help me ! COSTIGAN That 's our business , only we ca n't make the town over , not alone , we ca n't . JIMMIE Do you know Judge Higgins ? COSTIGAN Yes . p. 85 JIMMIE I 've good reason to think he 's protecting Jones , and Morris and this gang of theirs . COSTIGAN Maybe . JIMMIE And you ca n't do anything about that ? COSTIGAN What do you think I could do ? JIMMIE If he 's a crook , and a pal of these gangsters ? COSTIGAN But he is n't . He needs to control a good bunch of votes to keep him where he is . God knows an old four flush like that would never be where he is without them  --  he may do certain favors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he knows a lot that 's going on and does n't stop it  --  helps it in a way , but not directly  --  that 's all he does  --  No rough stuff for that old bird , he has n't got the guts ! JIMMIE I do n't know much about things like this . COSTIGAN I know a whole lot about them , but I do n't know the answer . JIMMIE I 'm no socialist ! I do n't know the theories . Maybe it 's prohibition , I do n't know . Some people always drank too much , maybe the government ought to protect them from themselves  --  I tell you I do n't know , but I 'm damned sure the government ought to protect those of us who know how to behave ourselves , and it is n't doing it . p. 86 COSTIGAN You see , Alden , the trouble is that in the wash up , no government has any more principle or any more guts than the people themselves have  --  JIMMIE I suppose so . COSTIGAN A fellow gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody on the level any more ? COSTIGAN I do n't know , maybe not , and as far as that goes , maybe these sort of things were always rotten  --  I do n't know . JIMMIE Not like now ! COSTIGAN More bunk maybe , and not so many folks wondering about things . JIMMIE I do n't believe it ! COSTIGAN I wonder about it a lot  --  they brought the kids up different  --  but they brought ' em up on fairy stories . JIMMIE Maybe ! COSTIGAN Everybody used to have to stand for a lot of hot air  --  big sentiments and all that , maybe we all got fed so much of it that it turned sour on us . JIMMIE Maybe . COSTIGAN And then we got so hard-boiled we laughed at all the things the story books used to tell us were the cat 's whiskers. p. 87 JIMMIE Everything that was ever real is real right now ! COSTIGAN Sure  --  but what 's real ? Being a sap , going to church every Sunday ! Turning the other cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and seemed to think they was n't getting anywhere . JIMMIE Where are they getting now ? COSTIGAN There was too much horse feathers about it ! Preaching about equality when there was n't any ! Talking about brotherly love when there was n't any love at all ! Fat guys chewing the rag and waving the flag for freedom  --  to guys in handcuffs ! JIMMIE Sure it was horse feathers , most of it , but lately I 've been wondering if maybe some of the old bologny was n't part of it on the level . COSTIGAN Well , since I 've been a cop I 've had to work at most everything , from wiping a baby 's nose to trying to tell fat women how to reduce their bellies without tryin ' putting less in ' em , but up to now I have n't had a try at running the country . JIMMIE All I want to run is this laundry and you 've got to help me do it ! COSTIGAN Rises . Get your hat . I 'm going to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same earful you gave me . Come on . p. 88 JIMMIE In spite of the way the cards are stacked against me right now , do you think I 've got a chance ? COSTIGAN You never know , some day some guy in a jam is like you 're in is going to holler loud enough so the right guys hear him  --  that fellow would have a chance . JIMMIE Who are the right guys ? COSTIGAN The little fellows out there in the streets walking up and down and minding their own business . They 're pretty dumb , most of ' em , pretty hard to get started , but let me tell you , boy , if they ever got woke up to what 's going on right here in this man 's town , they 'd start something  --  I expect to live to see it if some cheap crook do n't bump me off first  --  JIMMIE You 're a swell guy . I 'll be with you in a minute . He goes to the foot of the stairs and calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balcony . Yes , Jimmie . She enters on the balcony . JIMMIE We 're going down town . DORIS Goes down to the stage . I think you 're going to help him . COSTIGAN I am going to take him to somebody who could  --  maybe  --  I do n't know . He turns to JIMMIE . Ready ? p. 89 JIMMIE All set . If I 'm late , I 'll see you at your place . DORIS I 'm going to stay here until you get back . Of course the help know to-morrow is a holiday but I 'll tell them to be here early Monday . JIMMIE Right . Come on , Mr. Costigan . COSTIGAN See you again , Miss Sabin . DORIS Smiles . I 'm sure I hope so . COSTIGAN and JIMMIE exit to the street ; just before the exit , NETTIE has come out on the balcony above and now speaks over the rail . NETTIE Any news ? DORIS Jimmie was looking more like his old self  --  and when Jimmie is right , nobody is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down . I 'll say they ca n't  --  DORIS There was a plain clothes man here named Costigan . I liked him a lot . NETTIE He 'll fix things , all right . DORIS Of course . NETTIE Only I 'm kind of worried about what Eddie said  --  you know  --  he said " for God 's sake make Jimmie stop fighting ! " p. 90 DORIS I 'm worried , too  --  terribly  --  Jimmie 's queer  --  he thinks a lot of me , but there are some things he does n't like to have anybody butt in on . I 'm worried sick ! NETTIE Jimmie 's game . He 'll find a way out of it . DORIS Of course he will ! She speaks happily and goes and turns on an electric light over her desk , and is about to start work on her books as JOHN , the Chinaman , MISS FALLEN and JENNIE , come down the stairs from the balcony in their street clothes . JENNIE Well , we did the best we could . Of course what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's just human nature , after all . DORIS Everything will be all right , and Jennie will have the place opened up the first thing Monday morning . JOHN Goes to DORIS at the desk . Not come back . DORIS What is it , John ? JOHN Not come back , want money , please . DORIS Shocked . Oh ! I see !  --  Sure ! She opens her pocketbook and counts out some money to JOHN. p. 91 JOHN Much oblige . DORIS That 's all right . NETTIE Angrily to JOHN . Do you know , I think you 're a rat ! JOHN Calmly . All light by me ! He exits to the street . DORIS looks rather sadly after him . NETTIE As JOHN goes . Jimmie will feel bad about this  --  one of his old gang walking out on him ! MISS FALLEN Well , if you was to ask me I 'm glad he 's gone ! DORIS Why are you ? MISS FALLEN That acid did n't get into the washing machine by itself , did it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DORIS Shocked . Jimmie 's done a lot for him , helping him when he was sick and everything ; there must be some gratitude left in the world ! JENNIE Oh , there 's some , all right  --  I did hear they was keepin ' a sample of it in the Metropolitan Museum . DORIS Why did you say that about John , Miss Fallen ? Surely , you must have had some reason ! p. 92 MISS FALLEN There 's been a couple of fellows hanging around outside there , ever since yesterday afternoon . I saw them talking to John  --  and they stopped Jennie and me this morning and offered us a job with better money if we 'd quit Jimmie and walk out . DORIS Proudly . And you refused it ? MISS FALLEN I did  --  all Jennie done was to throw that old hand bag of hers right in the biggest man 's face ! DORIS Gratefully . Thank you , Jennie . JENNIE I only got one regret , and that is there did n't happen to be a brick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DORIS Thanks  --  I 'm sure in the end you wo n't regret it . JENNIE Maybe not  --  but if I do n't it will be about the first thing I ever did in my life I did n't regret . They exit . DORIS To NETTIE . I 've got a little saved up . I can take care of their first week 's pay without bothering Jimmie . You run along home , I 'm going to wait for him . NETTIE Yes , I 'll have to . Mother did n't want me to be late to-night . We 've got folks coming in . NETTIE takes her hat from a shelf and is standing in front of a small mirror on the wall , putting the hat on , as the door opens and EDDIE enters p. 93 DORIS Why , Eddie ! NETTIE Turns . I 'm glad I waited a minute , now we can ride home on the bus together . EDDIE Gravely . You run along , I want to see Jimmie . NETTIE But he 's out . EDDIE Doris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDDIE Run on home ! NETTIE Hurt . Oh ! EDDIE Gently . I did n't mean it like that , but I 'm not eating at home to-night , I ca n't ! NETTIE Oh , all right . She goes to the door , then turns . I 'll see your mother , of course . Got any message for her ? EDDIE No  --  NETTIE Oh . She turns . EDDIE Wait ! She stops . He hesitates for a moment and then speaks slowly . You might just tell her , Nettie  --  tell her  --  He stops. p. 94 NETTIE Yes , Eddie ? EDDIE Tell her to take good care of herself . NETTIE Sure  --  I 'll tell her . NETTIE exits and the boy turns quickly to DORIS . EDDIE Get Jimmie ! Quick ! DORIS I ca n't . He went down town with a man  --  a detective . EDDIE To Police Headquarters ? DORIS Yes . EDDIE It 's true , then . DORIS Afraid . What is it ? EDDIE Nothing  --  I  --  I guess I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She comes out from back of counter to him . It is something and you 've got to tell me . EDDIE I ca n't ! DORIS You wo n't run out on me ! EDDIE Desperately . I 've got to go ! DORIS I thought you cared something about me , Eddie ! p. 95 EDDIE I love you  --  I 'm no good  --  maybe I could have been , but not now . DORIS What is it ? EDDIE I tried to warn you  --  and I tried to warn him  --  two or three times  --  but you would n't listen  --  now the only chance we 've got is to get out of New York , if we can . DORIS Jimmie would n't go ! EDDIE Maybe not  --  and maybe he could n't go  --  and it 's a ten to one shot , I could n't  --  I 'd planned , Doris , to fix everything so 's Mother would stop worrying about things , that 's the reason I did n't want to come here , I was followed , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard something  --  and I 've got to tell you  --  it 's my finish and maybe it wo n't do any good  --  they are going to kill Jimmie . DORIS In terror . No ! EDDIE They 're out now to get him , and anybody that tries to stop ' em is as good as croaked ! They 've got to do it ! DORIS Kill Jimmie ! EDDIE Jimmie got out a " John Doe " warrant last night for a man named Dave Morris . The cops picked him up at the station in Buffalo this morning . He 's important ! It 's big business and it 's got to be fixed . They ca n't let Jimmie into Court against him . It 's all set , maybe to-night or at the latest some time tomorrow ! Here 's the dope , get it straight and do n't forget it ! A bunch from out of town will handle it , three of them  --  He stops suddenly as the door at the back opens and two rather well dressed boys of about twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no threat at all in their manner , although one of them , TONY , keeps his right hand in his pocket . DORIS , at least , senses no peril , although as EDDIE sees them , he draws himself up sharply for a moment and then forces a half smile . Oh , hello , boys ! p. 96 TONY In the light from the hall . Pleasantly . They want you , Eddie ! EDDIE Yeah ? TONY Yeah . EDDIE Tell ' em I 'll be over as soon as I get something to eat . TONY They want you now . EDDIE Oh ? TONY Yeah . DORIS Anxiously . What is it ? EDDIE It 's all right . DORIS But you ca n't go now , not until you finish  --  EDDIE Breaks in . The story I was tellin ' you ? He smiles . I guess maybe you can work the rest of it out for yourself  --  you might try tellin ' it to Jimmie to-night to see if it would give him a laugh . He turns to the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DORIS But , Eddie ! EDDIE Everything is all right , it 's swell . DORIS I 'll see you to-night , Eddie ! p. 97 EDDIE Yeah  --  maybe ! He exits at the back between the two gangsters . DORIS looks after him , troubled and trying to understand. @x The same . It is early afternoon of the next day . At rise of curtain , NETTIE is discovered reading a morning paper . It is the Fourth of July and in the street outside a band is playing . In a moment DORIS enters and looks about in alarm . DORIS Where 's Jimmie ? He has n't gone out ! NETTIE Just across the street to the cafeteria , he said he 'd only be ten minutes ! DORIS Anxiously . But I did n't want him to go out at all ! I told you so ! You should n't have let him ! NETTIE I 've got a photograph of myself keepin ' Jimmie from doing anything he wants to do . Where were you ? DORIS I 've just come from Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care ! I could n't get Mr. Costigan on the phone and I had to talk to some one ! NETTIE What did they say down there ? DORIS The same as Jimmie , they said they 'd send for Eddie and question him , but they did n't think Jimmie was in any danger . They say the newspapers have been featuring this " gang rule " stuff and that most of it is exaggerated . p. 99 NETTIE I guess that 's right . Anyway , I do n't see what Eddie would know about it . DORIS He spoke as though he knew . NETTIE To-night I 'm going to make him tell me every single thing he heard . The door opens and COSTIGAN enters . COSTIGAN Sorry I missed you down town , Miss Sabin . I hurried right up as soon as I got in . DORIS I 'm glad you 're here ! COSTIGAN They 've just brought this Dave Morris in from Buffalo ! He 's at headquarters ! If Alden can identify him as the man who came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start something real . DORIS If it 's the man , Jimmie will identify him ; he wo n't be afraid . COSTIGAN And that 's where we come in , you and I  --  to be afraid for him  --  the boys say this Morris is a big shot , if we get him we 've got somebody  --  but there will be plenty who do n't want us to get him  --  we 've got to play it awful safe ! DORIS Then you do n't agree with the rest of them ! You do n't say there 's no reason why I should worry about Jimmie ? COSTIGAN That 's what my boss says , but the trouble is , those fellows that sit all day at their desks do n't get quite the same slant on things as some of us who go poking around a little  --  I want to talk to this Eddie Mason . Where is he ? p. 100 DORIS Mr. Alden sent for him , we expect him to drop in any minute . COSTIGAN Where 's Alden ? DORIS Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step over there . DORIS You mean he should n't be out in the streets alone ! COSTIGAN He is n't going to be after this . I 've got some men here . I did n't like to march in on you like an army , did n't want to startle you , but I 'd like to have them in . DORIS Of course ! COSTIGAN goes to the door and calls . COSTIGAN Nolan . Outside . All right , Dan . NOLAN , MACK and BILL , three policemen in uniform , enter . COSTIGAN Keep your eye on the door , Bill . BILL Sure . He exits . COSTIGAN Miss Sabin and I are going across the street . Wait here until we get back  --  if a young fellow called Eddie Mason drops in , keep him ! NOLAN What does he look like ? p. 101 NETTIE I 'll tell you if he comes . COSTIGAN The place is closed and it 's a holiday , so nobody else has any business in here  --  unless it 's some friend of these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at NETTIE . NETTIE I guess I know everybody that 's got any business here . DORIS Mr. Alden wo n't like you bringing them here ! He thinks I 'm being silly about it ! NOLAN I guess it 's natural for women to get upset . We see a plenty of that in our business . COSTIGAN We see a lot in our business , Nolan , only sometimes we let just a few little things get past us . He turns to DORIS . Shall we go along , Miss Sabin ? DORIS As they go . Yes . COSTIGAN A cop at the door will probably be enough to show we mean business , but we 're not going to take any chances . DORIS No , we must n't . COSTIGAN and DORIS exit . BILL Better call up the station , had n't you ? NOLAN Sure , I was just going to . He starts to work the dial phone . Like old times being on a job with Dan Costigan again ! p. 102 MACK If you 'd call this a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like him . He speaks into phone . Hello ! I Hello , Daly  --  Nolan speaking  --  we 're at Alden 's Laundry on Fifty-second Street , the place where there 's been a little trouble the last two days . Dan Costigan from down town is here . What ? I ca n't hear you . It 's the band from the damned parade ! I ca n't hear you  --  what ?  --  No  --  Not so far as we can see , nobody 's hanging around and no reason why they should ! Mack and I have doped it out that these people here just got the jumps or something  --  you know what I mean , Lieutenant  --  What ?  --  Sure  --  We 'll all stick around . NETTIE Scornfully . Maybe you 'd have the jumps or something if people were blowing up your place and putting acid in your wash ! MACK Nobody 's going to pull anything to-day , anyhow , unless they do it before the crowd gets here . NOLAN Dedicating a new schoolhouse ai n't going to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different if the Mayor was going to speak . BILL and MRS . ROBINS enter . BILL Is Mrs. Robins all right ? p. 103 NOLAN Heartily . All right with me , she always was ! How are you , Mrs. Robins ? BILL exits . MRS . ROBINS I 'm well , thank you , Mr. Nolan . NOLAN Mrs. Robins ' husband was on the force , before your time I guess , Mack . He was a pal of mine . I was with him the night he  --  He hesitates . MRS . ROBINS Grimly . The night they killed him . NOLAN Yes . MRS . ROBINS It was nine years ago . They did n't talk about " takin ' people for a ride " in those days , or about " putting them on the spot , " but they killed him all the same . NOLAN It was tough . MRS . ROBINS Quietly . And nobody ever did anything about it . NOLAN Well  --  MRS . ROBINS I know  --  only if I was you I 'd see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN Oh , I do n't look for any trouble here , neither does Bill . MACK You see nobody would take a chance on starting anything with a big crowd on the street out there , not anyway until after that schoolhouse is dedicated . p. 104 NETTIE I 'd like to get up there in that window . She points to the window high up on the balcony at back . And the minute that Judge Higgins gets up on that platform and starts his speech , I 'd like to dump a big bucket of soft soap on his head . NOLAN If you 'd ever heard that old bird makin ' a Fourth of July speech , you 'd know he did n't need any soft soap . JENNIE opens the door at the back and enters . JENNIE Well ! I must say I 'm discouraged ! NETTIE What 's the matter ? JENNIE Yesterday there was crooks in here  --  now it 's the police ! NETTIE They sent ' em around so there would n't be any more trouble . I thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Doris would be here , so I thought I 'd come around and do a little work . NETTIE There is n't anything to do . JENNIE Oh , I guess we can find something . I know we 're in a time of depression but there 's still plenty of work for folks that 's willing to do it for nothing . Where 's Doris and Jimmie ? NETTIE Over at the cafeteria with Mr. Costigan . He 's a policeman ! p. 105 JENNIE I do n't know as I 'd want to walk along the street with a policeman . It would get me all nervous ! I 'd have to be stopping all the time explainin ' to strangers I was n't bein ' arrested . Sound from the hall of a door being closed . MACK I guess this is them . JIMMIE and DORIS enter . NOLAN Where 's Dan Costigan ? JIMMIE He 's gone to get Eddie Mason . He said we were all of us to wait here for him . Hello , Mrs. Robins . MRS . ROBINS Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting along . JIMMIE Not so good so far , but things might be worse . JENNIE That 's what I say ! I always try not to mind what happens to-day because I know something worse will happen to-morrow . DORIS Well , no matter what happens , Jimmie and I are going to share it . We 're going down to City Hall the first thing Monday morning and get married . NETTIE Not really ! JIMMIE She says she wants it that way . God knows why ! It 's a terrible chance for her to take with things going the way they are  --  p. 106 MRS . ROBINS Married at last ! That 's fine ! Good luck to you both ! NETTIE It 's just wonderful ! JENNIE I guess you two know what I wish you . She shakes hands warmly with JIMMIE . All 's I can say is I hope neither of you live long enough to regret it ! NETTIE Kisses DORIS . I 'm terribly glad ! DORIS Jimmie wanted to wait , but I would n't let him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting enough . JENNIE If I was ever to see a man I thought I could get along with , I 'd marry him the very first time I ever met him ! JIMMIE To NOLAN . I suppose you fellows are n't getting much of a kick out of this , but these two here are old friends . He smiles at NETTIE and JENNIE . NOLAN To JIMMIE . Looks at DORIS . I 'd say you were playing in pretty good luck at that , would n't you , Mack ? MACK Smiles . I sure would ! He laughs . DORIS takes off her hat and goes back of the counter to put it on the shelf. p. 107 MRS . ROBINS I 've only got a minute but I had to see you , Jimmie . JIMMIE Private ? He looks at NOLAN and MACK . MRS . ROBINS They can hear it . JIMMIE More trouble ? MRS . ROBINS A couple of men came around to my house this morning and tried to bluff me out of sending any more of my linen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROBINS No . They did n't say anything you could stick a pin into , but they 're working to keep trade away from you and I thought you ought to know it . JIMMIE I know it all right . DORIS But what are we going to do ? JIMMIE Keep going as long as we can  --  that 's all we can do . MRS . ROBINS You can count on all my linen , but , of course , you know that , and all the trade I can drum up for you in the neighborhood . JIMMIE That 's like you ! MRS . ROBINS I 've got to go now , Jimmie . JIMMIE Thank you for coming , ma. p. 108 MRS . ROBINS I wish there was really something I could do . NOLAN We 'll do what we can , Mrs. Robins . MRS . ROBINS You did n't do so much though  --  that night  --  for my husband ? NOLAN No  --  I did n't . MRS . ROBINS Well  --  it was a long time ago . Good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN Pete Robins ! He was shot one night down in Mott Street , I was right beside him  --  Nine years , she said  --  it 's a long time . DORIS But I do n't see why things like this should happen to us ! JENNIE As phone rings . Well , I ca n't say I 'm much surprised ! Ever since Jimmie first  --  DORIS ' voice breaks in . DORIS At phone . Hello  --  Alden 's Laundry  --  who  --  oh , yes  --  She looks up . Your mother 's on the phone , Nettie . NETTIE Mother 's so silly ! Just because we had that trouble here , she thinks  --  She breaks off in the middle of her sentence and speaks through the phone . Hello ! Hello , Mother ! What  --  Suddenly she slumps forward , clinging to the counter for support with one hand while she holds the phone to her ear with the other . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God  --  no  --  oh , no ! Mother ! Oh , my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her heart with both hands. p. 109 DORIS What is it ? NETTIE Quietly . Eddie 's dead ! JIMMIE Eddie ! NETTIE They just brought him home Just now  --  for a long time nobody even knew who he was  --  they found him this morning on a dump over by the river  --  he 'd been shot , he 's  --  he 's  --  dead ! DORIS Jimmie ! She turns to him . NETTIE He 's dead ! Eddie is  --  and I loved him ! NOLAN Eddie ? What 's this ? JIMMIE Eddie Mason  --  he was  --  was a friend of ours ! NETTIE I do n't know who it was that shot him  --  I do n't suppose any one ever will know now , but I know why they did it . She turns fiercely on DORIS . And so do you ! DORIS How could I know ? NETTIE Because he loved you , that 's all he could think about , he never paid any attention to anybody else at all  --  and all you could think about was Jimmie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything he did was for you ! He thought if he could get a lot of money maybe you 'd think more of him , and so he got money . I do n't know how and his mother did n't know , but he did it for you ! You know he did ! DORIS Poor Eddie ! NETTIE Yes , poor Eddie ! He told me once he loved you so much he 'd die for you , well  --  that 's what he did ! Maybe you 're satisfied now ! JIMMIE Sternly . Nettie ! NETTIE Do n't you suppose I knew he was doing something that was n't right ; and why he was doing it  --  so 's you 'd think he was making good ! Do n't you suppose his mother and I laid awake nights afraid something like this would happen to him  --  but you did n't care  --  it was loving you that killed him and he did n't mean anything to you at all ! JIMMIE Stop that ! DORIS Gently . It 's all right , Jimmie  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have said that to you , Doris  --  maybe Eddie would n't have wanted me to talk to you like that . DORIS It does n't matter , dear . p. 111 NETTIE No  --  he 's dead  --  Eddie ! Well  --  I  --  I 'll go home now . DORIS Go with her , Jennie . NETTIE I do n't need anybody , I 'm all right . JENNIE Gently . I was goin ' that way anyhow . NETTIE Were you ? All right  --  maybe  --  maybe we might as well be going along . She turns and exits quietly , followed by JENNIE . JIMMIE They got him ! He tried to warn me about what they were going to do to me , and they got him ! NOLAN Forewarning you , you think . JIMMIE Yes . NOLAN If that 's right , Bill , we 're up against the real thing here ! JIMMIE Real enough  --  ask Eddie 's mother how real it is or ask that poor kid who just went out of here  --  NOLAN Sure , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN . Maybe we 'd better call up the station ! NOLAN What for ? They 'll be on the job by now . p. 112 JIMMIE Bitterly . Yes  --  now he 's dead . NOLAN Angry . To hell with that kind of talk , do you think we 're mind readers , we police ? JIMMIE Coldly . I would n't think so . DAN COSTIGAN enters quickly at door . COSTIGAN Alden ! JIMMIE Well ? COSTIGAN I 've got tough news for you . JIMMIE They got Eddie  --  COSTIGAN Yes . NOLAN We got it from a girl , a friend of his . Seems the kid 's mother phoned her here . JIMMIE He was a pal , and he was trying to help us  --  He sits down . COSTIGAN Knew him pretty well , of course ? JIMMIE I guess you heard me . COSTIGAN Know what he was working at ? JIMMIE No . COSTIGAN Did you , Miss Sabin ? p. 113 DORIS No . COSTIGAN Did n't even know he was a gangster ? DORIS Schocked . No. ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COSTIGAN Some of his own mob killed him . I guess there is n't any doubt about that . JIMMIE That 's how he knew ! COSTIGAN They thought he was trying to cross them , and maybe he was at that ! JIMMIE Some of them followed him here yesterday when he came to give Doris that tip . DORIS Nettie was right then ! JIMMIE Sure  --  in a way , but it was n't any fault of yours . DORIS I knew he was afraid about something when these two young men came in here , and I knew there was something going on that I could n't understand . Now I blame myself terribly for letting him go ! COSTIGAN You need n't . They would have got him anyway , if his number was up . JIMMIE In the chair . Mine 's up . Are they going to get me ? p. 114 COSTIGAN No , Jimmie , they wo n't get you . I guess this is as good a time as any to find out where we stand , all of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line-up with me downtown , late this afternoon , Miss Sabin . I 'm counting on you being able to pick out the two kids that were here yesterday , if they 're in the room when we get there . DORIS I 'll know them if they 're there . COSTIGAN I 'll get ' em there . Keeping them there is something else . JIMMIE Why is it ? They came here and got Eddie and took him away ! You know they were mixed up in it ! COSTIGAN I know a hell of a lot of things , so do plenty of others , and what good does it do us ? Arresting a man is one thing , getting a magistrate to hold him is another  --  and getting him convicted is something else  --  and suppose I do land these two lousy kids , do you think they 're really responsible for that boy 's death  --  what about the big guys that sit back safe and pull the strings  --  nobody 's going to get them . They 've taken damned good care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to pay . COSTIGAN Oh , somebody will pay , some fall guy ! He turns sharply to NOLAN and MACK . You boys comb this place , go all over it , then get back on the job  --  while I 'm gone nobody is to come near Alden ! p. 115 MACK Right ! COSTIGAN I want to get things started ! I wo n't be long ! DORIS Please do n't ! COSTIGAN No . And , Alden  --  JIMMIE Yes ? COSTIGAN Know how to use one of these ? He takes a police gun from his pocket and holds it out . JIMMIE I 'm in the Seventh Regiment . COSTIGAN Slip this in your pocket and do n't take it out unless you have to , but if you do take it out , take it out smoking  --  see you soon . Exits . NOLAN Dan 's sore . This gang business always gets his goat ! He 's a good guy , but he 's got too much Irish in him for nowadays . MACK You know it ! NOLAN Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACK Might as well . NOLAN What 's that door ? He points to the door at the right . JIMMIE Storeroom . NOLAN Any way into it outside of this door here ? p. 116 JIMMIE No . DORIS There 's a door in there that opens to the cellar stairs . NOLAN Let 's take a look . DORIS I 'll go with you . There 's an electric switch at the head of the stairs . NOLAN All right  --  wait  --  He goes to the door at the back and calls into the hall . Hello  --  Bill ! BILL Outside . Yeah ? BILL , a policeman , shows himself . NOLAN Keep an eye on this door . We 're going to take a look at the cellar . BILL Outside . Right . BILL exits . NOLAN To JIMMIE . Dan 's giving you that gun kind of got me nervous , but I guess it 's just as well to be on the safe side . Come on . DORIS , MACK and NOLAN exit to the door at the right , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the door opens and a moment after they exit an electric light is turned on in there . JIMMIE stands for a moment looking at the police revolver in his hand , then slips it in his pocket and takes out a cigarette and lights it . A passing band plays loudly and we hear scattered handclapping and the murmur of a growing crowd from the street at the back , as JIMMIE looks toward the still boarded-up store window . The policemen , BILL , opens the door at the back. p. 117 BILL Young fellow here by the name of Fairchild says you know him . JIMMIE Sure , let him in ! BILL All right . BEN FAIRCHILD enters and BILL exits . JIMMIE Hello , Ben , come in . BEN I thought you might be in to-day ! JIMMIE Why not  --  the way business is going with me , I have n't so much to celebrate . BEN I 'm sorry about that . I like you , Jimmie , but I 'm working for Scott and Clayton . JIMMIE Sure . BEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We want to cancel it . JIMMIE We ? BEN Mr. Clayton does . JIMMIE Firmly . No . BEN A lot of our linen was ruined in your washing machine yesterday . JIMMIE I 'll make it good ! BEN Can you ? JIMMIE Some way . BEN We ca n't go along with you , Jimmie. p. 118 JIMMIE You do n't mean that , Ben ! BEN I 'm sorry as hell and so is Mr. Clayton  --  but we ca n't do it ! JIMMIE I guess you know how much I 've counted on that work of yours . BEN I know , Jimmie , and I came through for you , but Scott and Clayton run a big business  --  we send out a lot of laundry and we ca n't afford to have it all chewed up . JIMMIE But it would n't be ! BEN We think it would . JIMMIE But I 've got police protection now . BEN They 'll get you , Jimmie ! Unless you settle with them on their terms you have n't got a chance  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a fight ! God damn it , Ben , your firm 's got money . and I have n't  --  Ca n't you see it 's your battle I 'm fighting as well as my own ! Ca n't you help me fight it ? BEN We figure it 's better business to keep out of trouble , and maybe we know more about what 's going on than you do . JIMMIE That 's just why these rackets are running , Ben , and they 'll keep on running until big firms like yours have guts enough to turn these propositions down ! p. 119 BEN We think we know how to run our own business , Jimmie . JIMMIE Is that so ? Well , I think I know how to run mine ! I 've got a contract to handle your linen for six months and I 'm going to hold you to it . BEN After our property has been destroyed we do n't think you can , but we wo n't argue about it ! You do n't get any more of our linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JIMMIE You mean that ? BEN Yes . I 've got authority to offer you two hundred dollars for your contract . This comes straight from Mr. Clayton . JIMMIE They 've got a long reach , these guys  --  so they got to him , too ! BEN I do n't know what you 're talking about ! JIMMIE I think you do ! BEN I 'm doing my job ! JIMMIE Ben , how 's a man going to fight a thing like this ! A game where nobody stands up against you that you can take a sock at ! Nothing you can get a grip on ! Christ , man , ca n't you see where we 're going if we 've got to stand for things like this ? BEN I 've got my orders , Jimmie ! JIMMIE Yes  --  so have plenty more  --  how many men have got their orders , Ben , to go out after a mean little business like this  --  and to break the fellow who 's slaved his life out to start it ! p. 120 BEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? JIMMIE You 'll do as you 're told , Ben , just like the leg men and the pimps and the gangsters and the bum heelers and the rotten political crooks and the yellow-bellied business men who are afraid to say no , and the big guys who stand by to protect the little guys and the big money lawyers who would n't know what it meant to defend an honest man  --  all the way up , Ben ! All the way ! An army with money behind them  --  with police and law and courts behind ' em  --  against one poor sap like me ! BEN Do you want the two hundred ? JIMMIE No , Ben , I do n't want the two hundred and right now it looks like a lot of dough . BEN Scott and Clayton are big people . I would n't start anything . JIMMIE I was n't trying to start anything  --  all I was out to do was just to make a living  --  but I 'm not going to turn yellow now , Ben  --  you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back opens and JUDGE HIGGINS enters . The JUDGE is dressed for his coming speech in silk hat , black coat , white shirt , etc . JUDGE Oh , I want to see you , Alden. p. 121 JIMMIE You 'd better go now , Ben . BEN I 'm sorry . I thought we were friends . JIMMIE You never know . BEN turns and exits , passing the JUDGE on his way over to JIMMIE , who stands looking at him quietly . JUDGE I hear you 've been passing remarks about me ! JIMMIE Yeah ? JUDGE I 'm warning you , you ca n't get away with a thing like that ! JIMMIE Yeah ? JUDGE I 'm here to remind you , young man , that there 's such a thing in this city as law . JIMMIE Yeah ? JUDGE You slander me and you 'll pay for it ! JIMMIE Yeah ? JUDGE Do n't think I care what a rat like you says about me , not personally , but I 'm holding an office given me by my fellow citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then why make a joke of it ? He steps toward the JUDGE . JUDGE Angry . Just a minute ! p. 122 JIMMIE Quietly . No  --  you came in here ! I did n't send for you  --  now you 'll listen to me ! JUDGE You 're a trouble maker ! We 've no room in this ward for men like you . JIMMIE I came here to make a living ! I took a crazy chance with no money , with nothing , and I lost out because I would n't stand for a shake down ! JUDGE Loose talk ! That 's all ! I do n't even know what you mean . JIMMIE Try guessing , Judge . JUDGE When I was a youngster , I used to play poker with the boys  --  and the loser always bellyached ! JIMMIE Maybe you stacked the deck against them , too ! JUDGE Are you stark , staring crazy ? Or are you seriously questioning the honesty of the public servants of this city ? JIMMIE Not all of them , Judge . Right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean by that ? JIMMIE Did you know Eddie Mason ? JUDGE Mason ? JIMMIE Yes . p. 123 JUDGE Oh  --  that 's the boy that was killed in a gang feud last night ! JIMMIE Yes . JUDGE I read about it . JIMMIE Did you know him ? JUDGE I 'd seen him around . JIMMIE He was a pal of mine . JUDGE Well ? JIMMIE He 's dead . JUDGE Well ? JIMMIE It was n't a couple of gorillas who were to blame for killing Eddie . They fired the shots  --  but Eddie was murdered by a system , a bloody chain of crooks and grafters , little and big  --  that starts in the gutter and the cheap speakeasy and leads way up to  --  JUDGE Lock out ! JIMMIE Lets himself go . I think you 're part of that system , Judge  --  I think so  --  the system that killed this poor kid ! I know it 's a terrible thing to say  --  if I am wrong , may God forgive me  --  but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may God damn your soul ! From the street at the back there is a loud burst of music as a brass band starts to play and the door is thrown open by BILL , the officer , who is on guard in the hall. p. 124 BILL Judge ! Say , Judge ! The crowd 's waiting for you . JUDGE To JIMMIE , as DORIS , MACK and NOLAN enter from the room at the right , leaving the door partly open . I 'll have something to say to you later , young man ! Just now that crowd out there is waiting for me to speak to them  --  not anarchists , not socialists  --  but friends of mine and fellow citizens , honest people  --  loyal people who know enough to trust the men who have the privilege of serving them ! BILL Impatiently , at the door . Come on , Judge ! JUDGE Yes  --  yes  --  of course . I am quite ready . He exits at the back and the door is shut . DORIS Jimmie , what did he want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it . NOLAN Everything 's all right down cellar there . MACK Maybe there ought to be a better bolt to these windows to the alley or we could nail ' em down . NOLAN That 's so  --  do n't let me forget to do it , Mack . MACK All right , let 's take a look upstairs . p. 125 NOLAN Is Bill out there ? MACK Sure ! He would n't leave the door . DORIS You do n't need me ? NOLAN No , we 'll just take a look around . NOLAN and MACK go upstairs and off to the room at the right . The door down stage is left half-open . Before DORIS enters , she turns the light off and the room is dark . DORIS You had trouble with the Judge ? JIMMIE It does n't matter . DORIS Monday is our wedding day , Jimmie . Are n't we going to have anything but trouble ? JIMMIE I 've got you . That 's a lot ! After all , it was n't a laundry I was looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DORIS You 'll have to forgive me if I ca n't be very happy on my wedding day , on account of Eddie . JIMMIE I know . DORIS But being  --  being your wife is something bigger  --  even than happiness  --  JIMMIE Awkwardly . I 'm just a rough guy  --  not really in your class at all  --  but I 'm going to be good to you and make you happy  --  I do n't care what the breaks are , I 'm going to do that anyway ! p. 126 DORIS Do n't be silly ! The breaks do n't matter ! JIMMIE Sometimes you 've kidded me about being obstinate . Well , that 's out now ! All that matters now is you . Pride does n't matter . DORIS Pride ? JIMMIE You 're worrying about me ? DORIS Slowly . A little . JIMMIE These birds are n't after me now for a hundred a month . They do n't kill a man for that kind of money . DORIS But Eddie told me they were going to ! JIMMIE Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scrapper and were afraid I 'd pin somethin on them . It was my going downtown and starting a real holler . Costigan has been telling me about these racketeers . They 've got down to a business footing . Murder , it seems , is expensive . It costs important money . I was n't worth the price until I got to be a danger , then money does n't count at all . DORIS Can you fight them ? JIMMIE That 's up to you . DORIS Why ? JIMMIE If it will make you any happier , I 'll get Jones . I 'll pay ' em the hundred a month , if they 'll me a little time  --  and I 'll promise them I 'll keep my mouth shut so 's they need n't be afraid I 'll get ' em into any trouble . p. 127 DORIS Thoughtfully . I see . JIMMIE I 'll do it to-day if you want me to . DORIS Slowly . I do n't know , Jimmie  --  what do you think ? JIMMIE I 'm tellin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thinking , Jimmie , that these people could n't be as strong as they are unless a lot of people paid them . JIMMIE No  --  they could n't . DORIS We could pay them and manage to get along . JIMMIE Yes . DORIS I am so afraid for you and  --  and we 've waited so long  --  and we could be so happy . JIMMIE Sure . DORIS Well , then  --  JIMMIE Rises slowly . I 'll see this Jones right now . He turns up stage . DORIS Just a minute , Jimmie . JIMMIE Well ? He turns back . DORIS Let me look at you . p. 128 JIMMIE Well ? He faces her . DORIS You do n't want to pay that graft , do you ? He is silent for a moment . Do you ? JIMMIE Quietly . No . DORIS Why ? Put it into words . JIMMIE Slowly . I do n't know  --  partly it 's Eddie . They killed him . DORIS Yes . JIMMIE I do n't want to talk big  --  but do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out , sometime ! DORIS But must it be you ? JIMMIE A guy is yellow or he is n't , Doris . DORIS You 're not ! JIMMIE I do n't want to be . DORIS You would n't be happy ? JIMMIE No . DORIS Quietly . Then let 's go through . JIMMIE As it is now ? DORIS Yes . p. 129 JIMMIE Tenderly . It will be swell to have a wife like you . DORIS You see it  --  it would make me feel so funny if  --  if I could n't be proud of you ! NOLAN and MACK enter on the balcony from the room at the right . NOLAN Quite a sight from the window in there . The Judge is just starting to make his speech . JIMMIE Well , I 've got some luck left after all ! I do n't have to listen to it . I 'm going to write another letter to the Commissioner downtown . Doris , do you want to help me cook it up ? DORIS Of course ! They go over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen and paper and they stand at the desk together . MACK On the balcony . Nothing wrong in there , only that acid did n't do your washing machine any good . JIMMIE No , it did n't ! On the balcony , NOLAN and MACK cross to the window , below JIMMIE starts to write . He was swell to me down there , to-day , told me to let him know just how I was getting on . He sounded like he meant business . DORIS Of course , he did . Be careful what you say to him , dear . p. 130 JIMMIE Sure . He writes . NOLAN At the window above . There 's the Judge now He 's starting . He opens the window and MACK joins him and they look out . We hear applause from the crowd and then the voice of the JUDGE , clear and rather loud as he speaks the words of Abraham Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . JUDGE " Four score and seven years ago our fathers broght forth on this continent , a new nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men are created equal  --  " NOLAN Nuts ! He shuts the window . Got a cigarette ? MACK I guess so . He hunts in his pocket and finds a cigarette and gives one to NOLAN and takes one himself . When the window is closed the sound of the JUDGE 's voice is not heard . JIMMIE To DORIS , who stands looking over his shoulder as he writes . How is it ? DORIS Doubtful . It 's all right  --  but the writing might be a little better . p. 131 JIMMIE Maybe I 'll copy it . DORIS I 'll say you 'll copy it , and you might try spelling it a little better , too  --  you could n't expect anybody to help a man who spells " appreciate " like that ! JIMMIE As soon as we get a little coin I 'll buy a typewriter and you can be my stenographer  --  any damned fool can spell his own name ! NOLAN , now that the cigarettes are lighted , throws up the window again and we hear the JUDGE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion  --  that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain  --  " JIMMIE There ! He goes over to the right , reading his letter , DORIS follows him . JUDGE "  --  that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom  --  and that government of the people , by the people , and for the people shall not perish from the earth . " As JIMMIE stands at the right , there is a flash from the darkness of the half-open door to the storeroom at the right , and we hear a metallic click . JIMMIE gives a cry and drops his letter and staggers . DORIS cries out and tries to catch him at he falls . Crowd outside is applauding the JUDGE 's speech. p. 132 DORIS Screams . Jimmie ! NOLAN What is it ? He turns and runs down the stairs , followed by MACK . BILL , the third policeman , opens the door to the hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . They got him with a silencer on their gun ! He draws his revolver . Stay here , Bill ! Come on , Mack ! He and MACK exit quickly as DAN COSTIGAN enters the door at the back . DORIS On her knees by JIMMIE . Jimmie ! My dear  --  my dear ! COSTIGAN Alden , old man ! God ! It 's tough ! We did the best we could ! JIMMIE Sure  --  only  --  only  --  it was n't good enough ! He dies . On the naked flag pole at the back , a large American flag is run up with a long roll of a drum . The flag breaks out and as the wind catches it , it flutters proudly . We hear , loud and clear , the high childish voices of a class of young school children as they sing.                                        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
