Letter of Introduction ( Universal ) . Presumably on the theory that the proper study of mankind is man , Hollywood long ago assumed that the proper study of the cinema is the entertainment business . Cycles in Hollywood flare and fade , but the history of the young girl who goes to Manhattan to become an actress , falls in love with a hoofer and brings down the house on opening night remains as rooted as Narcissus . To the standard ingredients of the backstage formula , Letter of Introduction adds two interesting variants : the show in which Katherine Mannering ( Andrea Leeds ) makes her gala debut turns out to be a calamitous flop ; and the hero of the story is not her erratic young fiance but an aging , bibulous matinee idol to whose portrayal Adolphe Menjou lends the Barrymore mannerisms that have become traditional for such roles since The Royal Family . These , and Director John Stahl 's watchful , vivid treatment of situations which would have been threadbare with less careful handling , give the picture exactly that air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to its own intense egocentricity , Hollywood 's concern with show business is obviously prompted by the necessity for showing off personalities who have made a hit on other stages . Letter of Introduction thus serves as a vehicle for Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy , who function simply as themselves . Ventriloquist Bergen introduces a rival to Charlie in the person of a dummy named Mortimer . Minute effigy of a country bumpkin , as hideous , crude and amiable as Charlie is tart , slick and natty , Mortimer chatters for only one sequence , after Charlie has taxed Edgar Bergen with ingratitude , but this is enough to enrage his predecessor . Says Charlie McCarthy : " This is the meanest trick you ever played on me . . . . I 'll mow him down . . . . " <P> Love Finds Andy Hardy ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . Fourth item in MGM 's lively series on the homely , 100% American problems of the Hardy Family , Love Finds Andy Hardy rises above the standard not only of its predecessors but also of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults-the assiduous overacting of Master Mickey Rooney , frequent instances in which bread- &-butter; comedy falls butter side down , a misbegotten musical number for a climax-serve mainly to emphasize its cardinal virtue , of preserving intact the mood and flavor of ordinary life in an ordinary U. S. town . Humor of the Hardy family chronicles is based principally on the pleasures of recognition . By the time Andy ( Mickey Rooney ) leads the grand march at the Christmas Eve dance , the vast majority of U. S. audiences will have found in his troubles , his family and his friends the prototypes of their own . Such cinema families as the Hardys and Twentieth Century-Fox 's Joneses are well on their way to developing for modern cinemaddicts the kind of cumulative box office appeal once exercised by old time serials . Good shot : Judge Hardy ( Lewis Stone ) settling a quarrel between his daughter and the cook , who joins the menage halfway through the picture in a manner calculated not to offend cinemaddicts who can not afford such luxuries .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
