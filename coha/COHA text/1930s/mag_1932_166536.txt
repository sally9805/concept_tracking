It promised to burn by Jan. 1 , 1933 a total of 18 million sacks each containing 132 Ib. of coffee . At approximately $6.50 per sack , $117,000,000 worth of coffee will have been turned to smoke and ash . <P> Never before have men burned so much that is good to drink .

" By this they mean that Brazilian coffee prices have risen in New York about 40% since the coffee bonfires were lighted last year . Other commodity prices have not kept pace , remain tragically down , thus strengthening Brazilians in their will to bean destruction . <P> Autocratic in word &; deed , the Coffee Council cabled last week that they have " definitely and irrevocably " abandoned a plan to pay premiums to U. S. coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
