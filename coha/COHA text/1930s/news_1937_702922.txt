txt Herbert Hoover declared tonight that the Republican party must see to it that justice was done to " the great economic middle class , " which now embraced the truly " forgotten men . " He appeared at a dinner of the Republican Club of Massachusetts , and his speech went out over a network of the National Broadcasting Company . But because of repeated interruptions of applause from the crowd of over 3,000 that packed a hall in Mechanics Building , he was able to complete scarcely three-quarters of his speech when he was notified that his radio time had expired . " Your generous reception has upset my calculations as to time . Those who have been listening on the radio will have to read their newspapers , " he told the crowd . The audience applauded long and hard when , during a series of questions on integrity of the administration , he asked : " Is it moral for a government to collect hundreds of millions from the wages of workmen under the promise that they are kept in a fund for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extravagances ? " Doubts New Deal Integrity In these questions , imputing a lack of moral uprightness to governing officials , he- asked further : " Can your government broadcast half truths and expect the citizen to tell the whole truth ? " Can the Treasury deliberately manipulate the market in government bonds and expect the citizen not to do the same thing in stocks ? " Do you think you can let down intellectual honesty in high officials and hold up conscience in. citizens ? " Is it moral for high government officials to stir hate of group against group , of workman against workman ? " What does the common expression ? You can not beat Santa Claus ' mean in public morals ? " A nation is great not through dams in its rivers or its ships on the sea or the deposits in its banks , " he continued . " It is great by the moral fiber and character of its citizens . Nations die when these weaken . " Not Seeking Public Office Mr. Hoover made occasion early in his speech to " clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . " Let me repeat once again that do not want any public office , " he said . A stir ran through the audience , which broke into long applause as he added that he would " keep on fighting for those things vital to the American people . " The time has come , Mr. Hoover asserted , when the Republican party should be " reoriented " to five fundamental issues , which /14 listed as moral integrity in government , personal liberty and its safeguards , financial and economic policies which affect the standard of living of the whole people , security and relief , and foreign relations . If the party has " read history , " it knows , he said , that it " must produce principles and program besides being against and joyriding on mistakes . " It must emancipate the people from " creeping collectivism " and restore " true liberalism . " For Anti-New Deal Fusion Fusion or coalition of anti-New Dealers was " devoutly to be wished for , " he asserted , but warned that people " fuse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stratagems . " I " If the Republican party meets the needs and aspirations of the people who are opposed to the New Deal they will fuse and coalesce and not before , " he added . As for humanitarian and social problems , Mr. Hoover hoped to see the day when no one who would work would be " underclad , underfed or underhoused , " but Americans must also think of " the great economic middle class . " " I am not thinking of the drones , either rich or poor , " he added . " The skilled workers , the farmers , the professional people , the small merchants and manufacturers ? they need to be remembered . Why should they be the forgotten men ? They have worked and saved to secure the homes , farms , insurance policies , and savings , which build and . sustain the productivity of this country . " He asserted that government policies that " tax , harry and demoralize " the middle class constituted the greatest danger to the " underclad , underhoused and underfed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued , by preserving the middle class and not dragging it down . " Santa Claus never increased the standard of living of a nation , " he added . As to government fiscal policies conser4atism as expressed by the Republican party was needed in dealing with the people 's money . " The Republican party , " he said , " can declare the principles of economy which will lift a burden from all who toil . It can declare principles of taxation that will not choke enterprise and destroy men ' Mr. Hoover declared that publican party must hay faces and new blood .

" It should be remembered that a national convention is busy chiefly with selecting a candidate . You can not send forty-eight men and women into a room at 9:30 at night and tell them to draft a. platform before 9:30 in the morning , and still expect to obtain a satisfactory result . Particularly is this so when the platform-drafters are besieged by lobbyists from the corridors outside . What I want is an intellectual session of the party . " Praises Landon 's " Contribution " Praising former Governor Landon 's recent address as " a notable contribution " to the discussion , he went on : " Nothing could be more helpful than the formulation of constructive convictions and positive purposes by our State and local organizations and our Republican clubs and the press . The ideas of the Democratic party are made by one man . We want to develop Republican ideas from the party .

" Instead of true liberalism , he went on , he would prefer to use the term Americanism . " The term liberal has now become the fashionable clothing of all collectivists , " he explained , " whether they be New Dealers with creeping collectivism , or frank and open Socialists , or the unconscious Fascists . Its folds can apparently even be entered through the Ku Klux Klan .
