txt The British conscription measure is resented in Rome , judging from reaction in official circles . Unofficially one hears talk of counter-measures . The move is recognized as one of the most important steps in postwar history . Although the Italian press will certainly loose a storm of abuse and ridicule , one may feel sure that full weight is being given behind the scenes to all that the move implies . Just as with President Roosevelt 's message , the reaction might be good or bad . Some feel it will force the Axis to slow down ; others feel it may bring on war by making Chancellor Adolf Hitler feel that he must move quickly before that conscript army is trained or the United States has a chance to throw any more weight on the side of Great Britain and France . Despite the impression given In London that the measure is aimed against Germany rather than Italy , Rome will not accept such an interpretation , it , is asserted , since any move aimed at either end of the Axis goes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's foreign policies and must feel menaced when her partner is threatened . Military Alliance Possible Consequently Rome must be expected to react , and perhaps finally the world is going to see an open military alliance between Germany and Italy , in which Japan would be included . That would make more difference than might be evidenced on the surface . The peace protestations that have come from Premier Benito Mussolini , Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano and King Victor Emmanuel in recent weeks can be taken at their face value . It is true that the Italian Government and people do not want war and will go to great lengths to keep out of one . There was no binding open military alliance with Germany last September that would have forced Premier Mussolini to join Chancellor Hitler in a war . It is being said that perhaps such an alliance may be made now . Some even think Field Marshal Hermann , Goering and Signor Mussolini talked about this on the former 's visit to Rome last week . If so , it might irrevocably commit Italy to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided making any such commitment , one must suppose he has considerable reluctance to do so . He has always been able to maintain a certain diplomatic manoeuvrability . This the pressure of events  --  chiefly Herr Hitler 's swift absorption of Austria and Czecho-Slovakia  --  had been steadily circumscribing . Now it is feared that Herr Hitler in this emergency will request some tangible evidence of support . Such an eventuality might be regretted here , but it is claimed there would be no hesitancy in complying . Another effect might be intensification of the rearmament program , which would in a way be an answer to Britain 's increased budget . There might have to be another capital levy or extraordinary taxation of some sort to raise money , but if the emergency is deemed acute enough this will be done . Financial circles already give signs of fearing such a development . Stock Exchanges today were weak throughout the country . Fascist economy , with its emphasis on autarchy , does not allow borrowing abroad , even if it could be done , so the State 's needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being emphasized above all here is the question of time . There is a strong feeling in some quarters that it must be now or never . Newspapers , for instance , point out that the practical effect of British conscription at the moment is negligible , , since it would take four to six months to give green youths any sort of training , and there is no such military spirit in Britain as the fascist States foster from childhood . However , the corollary to this next Autumn will be another story . In short , as one Italian put it today , " This British conscription does not create a good atmosphere for peace . " Signor Mussolini is still at Rocca della Camminate , but he will return Friday for a Cabinet meeting Saturday morning . This now promises to be of prime importance . Meanwhile it was Count Ciano who received from the British Charg ? d'Affaires , Noel Charles , official notification of Britain 's historic move .                  @ @ @
