txt Puerto Rico Is a Park . A dispatch to THE TIMES from Sari Juan , P. R .. , stathd that representatives of the United States National Park Service were there for the purpose of inspecting possible sites for a national park and would also visit the Virgin Islands on a similar mission . It will be most difficult to determine location for such a park in Puerto Rico , for the entire island is a beautiful park of itself and is called " The Island of Enchantment . " Distances are short from any point of the island to another ; man can not do more for Puerto Rico than nature has done . Would it not be better to recommend expending any money in Puerto Rico on hundreds of things the country needs instead of on national park sites ? The Virgin Islands and , in fact , all West Indian islands , - are each one a park by itself . Why spend money on national parks when they have them already and , lack so much of the actual necessaries of life ? L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934.
