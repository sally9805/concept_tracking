txt And so I am off  --  off to Fly all the way aiound the world , act oss tuo oceans and four continents , " They say " I will be the first woman to complete the entire nip in commercial enplanes . " They say " that since I was the first uoman to fly the aline South American route tnat I will be the first woman passenger to " do " all five continents in passenger airplanes . " They say " it is a dating 1/tidiness. what do I say ? Well , first , that the nip does not require any exceptional amount of courage . That is , sinless you think that it is Baling to cross the streets of any large city , or to drive by automobile over Rocky Mountain trails . Second , that this is no stunt . I am going because all that good offers , all that progress promises , all that to which achievement beckons remain Intangible visions until they have been grasped and used , dreams turned into facts . I an going opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  and you  --  and you . I am going as the symbol of the passengers who will follow me , as the representative of an international newspaper which delves behind the news wherever it happens in the world and interprets for its Readers the meaning of events , their signifi- Through the Clouds Above 4 Continents The accompanying article opens the series entitled " Around the World by Air " by Miss Shuler , who , as representative of The Christian Science Monitor , is undertaking the first all-airplane world flight by a woman reporter . The series will continue three times a week for three months . cance , what they presage for the future . I am going because all that human invention has made possible for mankind will be of little avail until it is accepted as part of the daily pattern of human living . I once stood with Glenn Mat tin in his enplane factory near Cleveland , Ohio , and heard him declare that it had been proven that nonstop overnight flights between New York City and San Francisco even then were practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I showed astonishment , he added that " airplane development could proceed rapidly if only the nubile would believe it and utilize it . The slowness of people generally to accept what already has been clone will put off accomplishment for at least 10 ) ears . " His words were prophetic . Mr. Martin said , too , that fear is the great enemy of aeronautics as it is of all progress , that machinery is not perfect , that emergencies happen in the air as over the kitchen stove , but that if one only remains calm that intelligence can find a way out of any difficulty . No Speed Record I am out for no speed record on this trip . To go around the world in a mere handful of days may be dramatic . It serves to focus attention on the achievements of air traffic and to push the industry to new achievement . But such deeds ale for pilots . To those who just go along for the tide like you  --  and you  --  and you  --  and me  --  the emphasis should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and human efficiency which reduces the number of accidents . One should study changes taking place in world history , what the airplane means in building tolerance and understanding among peoples and nations , in widening individual horizons , in increasing the sum total of human knowledge and capacities What matters to us Is that which we can see with our own eyes in the short span of time of an airplane trip . I have no patience with the clich ? that you see little from the air . It requires prodigious effort , long toilsome climbing to arrive at one peak in the Andes for a view of the surrounding peaks and valleys , But from the air the whole vista of mountains and plateaus is spread out for miles and miles . And as for over-water flying there are few things more beautiful In the world , than the everchanging play of light on the sea , the fascinating , endless variety of pictures . A passenger from Honolulu to San Francisco once told me that he watched not only all day but all night lest he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air because that means within a few weeks I can stand on the Acropolis , walk through the streets of Cairo , hear the lions roar near Nairobi and watch the Taj Mahal in the moonlight , learn whether Singapore and Bangkok and Rangoon are as picturesque as their names , drop in on faraway Australia for a few days , get a glimpse of China from Hong Kong , and above all span the Pacific Ocean . The crossing of the Atlantic by passenger airplanes will he a tilumph but even that will not equal the 11,500-mile trip across the Pacific from Hong Kong to San Francisco . If an airplane starts from Long Island and proceeds eastward it is more or less bound to reach some coast , whether it be Ireland or Africa . But on the wide reaches of the Pacific it means something to have a course charted which brings the ship unfailingly to a tiny mile-wide Island . I am grateful that I can remember on this flight what I was told In London before my first air trip across the channel . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't chain yourself to the earth by watching it too closely . ' Take your place in the clouds . Make them your home . That will give you freedom from anything that might bother . " In 22,000 miles around South America the promise of those words never failed . All the world loves a flier , it would seem . The tailor devising a oncpound lace traveling suit mumbles , ' I pray you come back safely . " Hunireds of messages come by letter , iy telegram , by cable . That champion friend of newspaper women , Vim . Eleanor Roosevelt , wires from , ho White House ' good luck and best wishes for a very interesting and successful trip . " A carefully-traced letter informs me that a teacher whom I have never seen has told her classes about the trip and that the fourth and fifth grades of the demonstration school in Glassboro , N. J. , will go with me " on the map " and that they wish Inc " safe return to the United States . " All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsterdam plows steadily towaid England for my start with Imperial Airways on a trip which will not be finished until I have done rings around the world and again crossed the Atlantic by air with Pan American Airways on its first passenger flight , the only representative of a single newspaper who will be taken on the trip . There is no room for regret even in the canceling of the Zeppelin so that I can not girdle the world completely by air before the Atlantic crossing with Pan American . As I approach the flight , which will begin and end in England on the maiden eastward voyage of " the ship of tomorrow , " I remember that the great superliner on which I am a passenger was built by a tiny nation , the Netherlands , whose population is practically the same as that of London , but which nevertheless has created the third largest colonial empire In the world . And I welcome this additional proof that " all things are possible . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
