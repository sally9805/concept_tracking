Worthy of record in Europe last week were : 1 ) an exhibition that proved a point ; 2 ) a burst of indignation ; 3 ) an extraordinary stroke of intolerance . <P> &gt; At Paris ' tiny* Galerie Henriette on the fashionable Avenue Matigon , a set of drawings and water colors by Paul Czanne was exhibited to clinch an argument : that Czanne , contrary to deep-rooted popular suspicion , knew how to draw . The exhibitor : Adrien Chappuis , owner of one of the best , least-seen collections of Czanne drawings . Taken largely from notebooks , many of the great painter 's slight , spontaneous pencilings were evidence enough that he had regarded drawing as note-taking , not as an art in itself . Exceptional , however , was an early , penciled male nude , so accurate and superbly finished as to settle the artist 's drawing ability once for all . <P> &gt; Too much for the tempers of hardworking Paris artists , tired of tales of their amorality , was publication in Paris-Soir of a lurid Life &; Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tosspot reputation in his youth , produced , nevertheless , many serious and hauntingly gifted paintings , and for at least ten years has been sober as a church . The Life &; Love was accordingly branded " A tissue of lies , calumnies and erroneous or tendentious information " in a manifesto issued by 54 furious artists and critics , including such noted names as Derain , Picasso , Kisling . <P> &gt; President Goebbels of the Reichskultur-kammer , apparently interpreting the Carnegie International jury 's award of first prize to German Artist Karl Hofer as a deliberate insult* to the Third Reich , vented his bile on Artist Hofer by forbidding him to paint at all . Heretofore merely prevented from exhibiting in Germany , Artist Hofer may now be packed away to a concentration camp if some household spy catches him laying brush to canvas in his own studio . <P> *Two rooms , each about ten feet square , one above the other . * Artist Hofer is on the German black list ( TIME , Oct. 24 ) .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
