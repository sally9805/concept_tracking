txt QUALIFICATIONS OF JUDGES . Consideration of Mental Attitude of Candidate Is Important . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES editorial " Passing Upon Judges , " while criticizing Senator Borah 's argument against the confirmation of Judge Parker , admits that the Senate is entirely within its rights to scrutinize judicial nominations , but fails to point out why the mental outlook of the . candidate is so important . Judge Cardozo , in " The Growth of the Law " ( p. 85 ) , makes a suggestive statement on that phase of the situation . He says : " In the present state of our knowledge , the estimate of the comparative value of one social interest and another , when they . come , two or more of them , into collision , will be shaped for the judge , as it is for the legislator , in accordance with an act of judgment in which many elements cooperate . It will be shaped by his experience of life ; his understanding of the prevailing canons of justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , in the end , by his intuitions , his guesses , even his ignorance or prejudice . " * Justice itself , which we , are wont to appeal to as a test as well as an ideal , may mean different things to different minds and at different times . " From the foregoing it is evident that the qualities of mind and heart of the judge are of such importance as to determine the kind of justice which the court will dispense . Under these conditions the Senate can hardly fail to give heed to every manifestation of the candidate 's bias of interest . GEORGE BOOCHEVER . New York , April 30 , 1930.
