txt For nearly six and one-half hours last night and this morning , a giant Douglas liner of the Eastern Air Lines , with five men aboard , was lost in rain and gale swept skies . At times the wind reached a velocity of 70 miles an hour . During its dramatic and fearsome wanderings the ship roamed as far south as Philadelphia and as far north as Martha 's Vineyard , off the Massachusetts coast , and flew helplessly over Delmar , Del. ; Camden and Newark , N. J. , and other cities , its pilots vainly groping for a landing field that they seemed unable to see or find . Fuel Supply Runs Short . All the while its precious fuel supply dwindled at the rate of a gallon a minute . But just as ground crews in half a dozen cities who had scoured the ether with radio messages and beams were despairingly giving up hope the airliner landed at Hartford ? safe , hut nearly 300 miles from its destination , Washington , D. C. The landing was made at 3:03 a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . This thrilling drama of the skies , which almost half the eastern seaboard followed by means of radio , began at 8:32 o'clock last night when the plane took off at Newark for Washington . Aboard were Fred Jones , veteran pilot ; James Carrigan , copilot ; G. C. Bane of Bethesda , Md. , and P. King of Washington , passengers , and a steward named La Mieux . Rain was already pelting down , and winds were high , but 11 was expected he flight would he made in scheduled time of one hour and twenty minutes . Runs Into Fierce Storm . Pilot Jones soon ran into unexpected difficulties , winds that roared at gale proportions of - 70 miles an hour . He attempted to buck the elements for an hour hut found his plane being pushed hack . Visibility was almost zero from rain that blackened further the black night . Jones turned back , intending to land at Newark . He soon became lost . The fault was due to the failure of the apparatus for following radio beams to function properly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to ground crews at Washington and Newark until he failed to arrive at the capital on schedule . Then radio messages were sent him , but here again mechanical mis ? fortune joined with the elements to threaten the ship . Static made Jones ' radio virtually useless for ten and fifteen minute periods and one full hour period . Not until 12:20 a. m. was the ship heard , and then eve/ . Bear mountain . At 1:05 a. m . Jones sent out his first radio message saying , I can see lights below , " but could not identify them . At 1:15 he reported . Some one has turned a searchlight on us , " but again he could not tell whence the light came . Newark inquired how much gasoline he had left . One hundred twenty gallons , " came the answer . This meant that many minutes aloft . Appeals to Radio Listeners . Newark appealed to all short wave listeners to listen for the plane 's engines to help them locate the wandering ship . A few minutes later Jones reported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again he could not identify the place . " We 're trying to circle it , " was his added word . Then he radioed , ' " There are quite a few towns here in a row ; we 're flying at 1,700 feet . " Once Ise reported he believed he was southwest of Newark . During the morning , however , his plane was noticed as far away as South Philadelphia , then later near Camden and other towns . Around 2 a , m ; Camden airport watchers saw a flare drop out of the inky night . The drama continued for another hour . In that time , the ship , far off its course , proceeded still farther , to a point near Martha 's Vineyard . Then , somehow , Jones found true bearings . He - bucked the gale and saw lights in this city . Just before 3 a. m. his plane was heard here . A few minutes later the ship landed .                   @ @
