Several quiet games for the highest stakes possible on Europe 's political board gripped and absorbed her statesmen last week . Most of them figured that Adolf Hitler 's next move , since he has now won every victory he can at home , must be outside Germany 's boundaries . Where ? Meanwhile , the strategy of Benito Mussolini , now that he has won Ethiopia , is to smash the League of Nations ' Sanctions and obtain recognition of his conquest by the Great Powers . How ? In searching for the answers to these tremendous questions many a European statesman packed his bag , began to travel fast and frantically . <P> Not since 1923 had Czechoslovakia seen her President go abroad . Last week President Eduard Benes ( " Europe 's Smartest Little Statesman " ) sped to Bucharest . There he was welcomed by King Carol of Rumania . To join them the Regent of Yugoslavia , Prince Paul , hurriedly arrived from Belgrade . President , King and Regent each heads a country accustomed to look to Paris for every sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries owe their present territorial status to the post-War Treaty of Versailles , which gave them the lands of Imperial Germany , Austria-Hungary , Russia and Bulgaria . Together they form the " Little Entente . " Last week they saw France , paralyzed by workers ' strikes , with a new Premier who is a Socialist reliant upon Communists ( see p. 24 ) . Most decidedly here was a situation to make President Benes , King Carol and Regent Paul wonder if the rock on which their countries had been building since the World War was not at last turning into sand . <P> Under French dominance , the Little Entente has let Europe know time &; again that it would meet either armed German encroachment or a restoration of the Habsburg Empire in Austria with mobilization ( i.e. , with war ) , France being sure to fight on their side . Last week who knew whether a German move to seize the tip of Czechoslovakia ( in which live a " minority " of some 3,500,000 Germans ) could be successfully countered by President Benes , smartest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France of Premier Leon Blum either could or would resist-as France has stoutly resisted since the War-any tampering with the status of Austria ? Until recently the Little Entente could have relied not only on France but also upon the League of Nations and on Britain . Last week the uncertainties of British policy were among the greatest worries of President , King and Regent . Even the London Times last week found it necessary in a leading editorial to beseech Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to state publicly what are the main lines of British foreign policy and thus clear up the greatest mystery of 1936.
