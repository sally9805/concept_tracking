txt Three days of erratic movement in international money markets left Washington officials Saturday with the feeling that sonic definite arrangements which will bring a measure of international currency stabilization are on the way . At the moment , however , this appears to be based on deduction and hope , rather than on any definite knowledge of what foreign nation 's are thinking and doing . Denials to the contrary , there seem to have been some preliminary approaches relative to a currency understanding , but it does not appear that these approaches have developed anything of a definite nature at this time . Apparently Washington would like to see other nations of the world revalue their currencies and enter into some temporary agreement for keeping the currencies within a fixed ratio . There could hardly be objection if the foreign nations made the same reservations as the ' United States as to their future discretion to change their Vralue . There is some indication from Londost , the British would-not-be-entirety averse However , the French have a pOlitical situation which would make franc devaluation a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises the question as to how London could move with Paris holding back . The opinion here remains that France either must enter into some international agreement or put restrictions on gold exports . Gold to Increase Idle Reserves Meantime , the flood of gold coming to this country will have the effect of increasing already idle excess reserves and further enlarging the base of a huge credit expansion and perhaps a swift rise in prices when conditions become ripe for the employment of the reserves . If money were tight , the imports of gold would have the effect of expanding credit and increasing prices immediately . With a dollar admittedly undervalued . the natural course would be for increased purchases by foreign nations of American exports , which would be an instrument of lifting prices . But it is not plain that such a movement is under way and if it should get under way in large volume , foreign nations might put up restrictions . Meanwhile , the daily statement of the Treasury on February 1 showed an increment of 52.805,512,061 from the reduction in the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 the value of Treasury gold stocks was given as 54,034,867.781 and on February 1 the value was $7,018,263,926 . The gain was made up of 52,805,512,061 profit and $177 , - S84,084 additional gold , most of which represented the RFC holdings taken by the Treasury . This additional gold was purchased at a total price of about 5132,000,000 , so the dollar profit to the government on the RFC transactions was about 546,000,000 . Net balance in the general fund of the Treasury on February 1 was set at 54,434,713,155 , against net balance of $1,537,201,112 the day previous . Of the more than 57,000,000,000 total gold , $3,132,484,053 was given as gold in the general fund , compared with 5140,728,518 for January 31 . Wipes Out Deficit The dollar devaluation transaction completely wiped out the deficit for the fiscal year to date , which on January 31 stood at 51,922,598 , - 173 , and resulted in a surplus of 5973,716,937 as of February 1 . The Treasury stated total receipts for February 1 were $2,815,273,008 , against expenditures of $81,042,102 , or an excess of receipts over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approximately $2,800,000 , - 000 gold profit is for the use of the equalization fund set up in the money bill . The remainder goes into the Treasury general fund . However , this does not mean that it will be spent for ordinary governmental or emergency expenditures . Secretary Morgenthau has declared his intention of continuing to meet those expenditures in the usual way , that is , from receipts and by borrowing .
