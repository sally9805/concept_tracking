One night last week Secretary of the Interior Harold LeClair Ickes , most vociferous U. S. critic of the U. S. press , rose to tell the New York Newspaper Guild and a radio audience what he thought of " calumnists " ( columnists ) . He prefaced his remarks with one of his own ventures in prosody : <P> Wouldst know what 's right and what is wrong ? <P> Why birdies sing at break of dawn ? <P> Ask the columnists . . . . <P> W'ho run the earth and sun and moon ? <P> Just Thompson , Lawrence , Franklin , Broun . . . . <P> When F. D. R. you want to sock , Page Lippmann , Johnson , Kent or Krock . . . . <P> Mr. Ickes , who is as tough as anyone in handing out verbal socks , though a little tender on the receiving end , proceeded to tag individual columnists with some typical Ickes ' characterizations . Walter Lippmann " would never even break his wooden sword unless he should trip over it in a minuet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnists*. . . a sincere and earnest lady who is trying to cover too much ground . " Mark Sullivan " would be missed . . . even if the world would still manage nicely without the pontifications that waddle through his worried columns . " Frank R. Kent " delights in cruel jibes and acidulous comment that he will direct at a straw man . " Boake Carter " could enter any intellectual goldfish swallowing contest . " Arthur Krock " sometimes permits himself , without abating a whit of his stately authoritativeness , to ' hit too closely to the belt . " Heywood Broun " is a genial philosopher who declines to take himself too seriously . " Raymond Clapper " is one of the fairest , most objective and most intelligent of them all . . . . By the way , whatever became of Henry L. Mencken ? " <P> Next , Mr. Ickes got down to the cases of the " snipers and guttersnipers . " Snipers were General Hugh Johnson and Westbrook Pegler . " While Johnson is against only those numerous public officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pegler is against everything and everybody according to his whim . " Chief guttersniper in Mr. Ickes ' category was " Mr. Munchausen , " identified in advance copies of the speech as Paul Mallon , although CBS induced Mr. Ickes not to call names over the air . Several of Columnist Mallon 's items about Mr. Ickes , Mr. Ickes bluntly charged , were lies . On the other hand , Columnists Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen ( who heave many a mean brick , but rarely at Mr. Ickes ) " write a lively and on the whole interesting column of dependable news and legitimate comment . . . . " <P> Ickes conclusions on columnists : 1 ) " As quasi-public figures themselves , it is their duty to be factual and truthful " ; 2 ) " A grave responsibility rests upon publishers and editors to deny the use of their columns to writers who take liberties with the truth . "
