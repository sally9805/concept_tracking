Taking the Blue Train to Nice , they were up until dawn , dancing in the streets at a city fete . Next day His Majesty , 42 , motored out to the villa of famed Dr. Serge Voronoff , monkey-gland rejuvenator . <P> " King Carol is much too young to need rejuvenation , " explained the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bull . My monkey-gland experiments interest him greatly , however , and he inspected my monkeys during his visit , which was prompted chiefly by his desire to see an old friend . He does n't need my services yet . " <P> Almost a family friend of 65-year-old Dr. Voronoff is King Carol . Pretty , vivacious Mme Voronoff the 21-year-old first cousin of Magda Lupescu.
