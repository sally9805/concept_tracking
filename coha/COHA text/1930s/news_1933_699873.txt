txt Science 's latest hunt for " big game " in the impenetrable " jungle " of the interior of the atom , the nucleus , was described here today by Professor Arthur Compton of the University of Chicago , himself a leading " hunter " in the " darkest Africa of matter . " An interview given by the Nobel Prize winner in physics was in the nature of an introduction to the opening here tomorrow of the largest scientific convention of its kind ever held . The Summer meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science is to be held during the next two weeks in connection with the Century of Progress Exposition . Fifty-five scientific groups , comprising all the leading societies in pure and applied science in the United States , will participate . Modern science , Dr. Compton said , was now practically lost in the nucleus , and the more it learned about it , the vaster and more impenetrable it seemed ta . become . Not satisfied with recently having found the neutron , and still more lately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units of matter , building bricks of our physical world . The finding of the positron , a positively charged particle of the same mass as the negatively charged electron , led us to suspect , said Dr. Compton , that ther existed a negatively charged particle of the same mass as the proton , that is , 1,842 times the mass of the electron , or of the 3ositron . We were now looking for such a particle , he said . Dr. Compton painted the latest model of the atom and traced the development of the concept of the atom 's constitution during the last fifty years , Science now knew all there was to know about the outer shell of the atom , having gone so far as to make photographs of it by means of X-rays. and had devised means with which we could practically " see " the outer parts of the atom , means practically similar to a highly magnifying microscope . But the nucleus , the inner core of the atom , had proved so far to be a sort of " No Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so intricate that every glimpse gained revealed further mysteries , and any new light *thrown seemed to reveal more impenetrable darkness . Instead of consisting only of electrons and protons , as had been believed , Dr. Compton said , it now seemed that the nucleus was composed of a multiplicity of elemental units of matter . It is believed now that it consists , in addition to electrons and protons , also of neutrons , ilpositrons and alpha particles . Then there is the nucleus of the recently discovered hydrogen 2 , weighing twice as much as ordinary hydrogen 1 . The nucleus of this hydrogen 2 was recently named the " deuton , " and it may consist of two protons , or of a proton and a neutron , or of something else again . The Atom of Forty Tears Ago . Whatever it may be , this " deuton " , must now be taken in consideration in our study of what the nucleus is made of . That makes six possible elements . Then there is the looked-for negatively charged particle of the same mass as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of photons , units of radiation , regarded also as particles , but even smaller than electrons and carrying no electric charge . There have been so many different models of the atom during the last twenty years and the field has been so confusing for the ordinary layman interested in the developments of modern science that Dr. Compton was asked for an authoritative r  --  sum ? of the various " models " and a , word on the up-to-date model . At the time of the last World 's Fair in Chicago , in 1893 , Dr. Compton replied , the atom consisted of a hard , indivisible , indestructible unit of matter , the ultimate unit of each chemical unit . Each of the ninety-two chemical elements had its own individual atom , different from the atoms of the other elements . Lord Kelvin had an idea that the atom was a vortex in the ether , a sort of a smoke ring . Lord Rutherford 's Studies . Then , toward the end of the century , came the discovery of radioactivity , which indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electricity . J. J. Thomson , in 1900 , conceived the atom to consist of a negative electron , vibrating in a sort of a jelly-like positive mass of electricity . Next came Lord Rutherford 's experiments on the scattering of the positively charged alpha-particles ( helium nuclei , composed of two electrons and ? four protons ) by latoms , which showed for the first time that the atom had an impentrable positive nucleus , about which there was an atmosphere of negative electrons . It was Lord Rutherford who originated the idea of the so-called " planetary atom , " in which electrons revolved about a nucleus as the planets revolve about the sun . In 1913 Niels Bohr , of the University of Copenhagen , one of the scientists who will participate at the meeting here , developed Rutherford 's planetary electron theory ; with the help of the Quantum ; Theory , originally announced by 1 Professor Max Planck of the University of Berlin and later developed further by Einstein . The Quantum Theory has someBohr-Sommerfeld Advance . In Bohr 's atom we had , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around which negatively-charged particles , the electrons , revolved in definite orbits , just as the planets revolve in definite , never-changing orbits around the sun . In this connection the name of Professor Arnold Sommerfeld of Munich is mentioned quite correctly , Dr. Compton stated . Both Bohr and Sommerfeld worked out the electrical orbits arranged in the relatively vast space around the atomic nuclei . The principle merits of the BohrSommerfeld model of the atom , Dr. Compton said , was its ability to account for a very large number of wave-lengths of spectrum lines of the various elements , both light and X-ray spectra . It also accounted for the chief difference between the various chemical elements . " The Bohr-Sommerfeld atom , " said Dr. Compton , " was a very big step in advance . The changes that ' have been made since , have been merely refinements , not an abandonment . " H. G. J. Moseley of the University of Cambridge was the first to show that the atomic number in the periodic table of the elements , running from one to ninety-two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleus of the atom . The atomic number , he showed , corresponded to the number of electric charges in the nucleus . Thus , hydrogen of atomic No. 1 . has one electric charge in the nucleus . Uranium , atomic No. 92 , has ninetytwo electric charges in the nucleus . The identity of an element depends on its units of electric charge . Thus , while there are two isotopes of hydrogen , one weighing twice as much as the other , both kinds nave but one electric charge , hence hydrogen 2 is still hydrogen and not a different element , Dr. Compton explained . " Within the last few years , " he added , " we have come to see that the picture presented by the Bohr atom is not quite the exact picture and it has , therefore , been refined to include the so-Called ' wave-atom ' as distinguished from the ' particleatom . ' Wave " Refinements " Added . " After Bohr 's theory of the atom had been rather completely developed it was shown definitely , first by Einstein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these atoms partook of the nature of particles . " Then de Broglie of Paris suggested the corollary to this phenomenon , namely , that electrons and atoms which were of the nature of particles should also have the nature of waves . " This was proved to be so in 1927 by Davisson and Gerner of the Bell Telephone Laboratories . Thas was established the duality of all matter , partaking at the same time of both the nature of particles and the nature of waves . " No Boundary to Wave-Atom . " " This discovery , to my mind , was the most important revolution in physics since the days of Newton , for it brought about the breakdown of t he law of causality in the physical universe . But that is another story . " The discovery of the wave characteristics of the atom showed that the atom may be interpreted in a different manner , and so Heisenberg of the University of Leipzig and Bchroedinger of the University of Berlin developed the latest model of the ' wave-atom . ' " According to this picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more diffuse than in the Bohr atom . Instead of the electron being found in a fixed orbit , it can be found at any place within that atmosphere , but with a greater probability that it will be found more likely in one place than in another . This ' place of greater probability ' is the orbits dlterrnined by Bohr . ' The wave-atom has no definite boundary . It is like the atmosphere of the earth . It extends indefinitely , but with less density . Electrons Static in Number . " Nevertheless , the number of electrons in each element remains the same as before . The diffusion refers only to the position of the electron but not to its charge . " The reason for preferring the wave-atom is because it explains all that the Bohr atom did , and has , in addition , given a more complete explanation of the light and X-ray spectra of the observed energy of the atom . " One of the most decisive tests comes from the use of X-rays in observing electrons in the atom . where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light is with a. microscope , 1 . e. , the Study of the scattering of X-rays by gases and crystals . " Such a study made it possible to get as definite information about the picture of the atom as though we were looking at it through a high-power microscope , and what we ' see ' is an atom of the wave type , not the fixed-orbit Bohr type . " This work in devising means for " seeing " the atom with an X-ray " microscope " was developed by Dr. P. Debye of Leipzig , Dr. W. L. Bragg of Manchester , England , and by Dr. Compton himself . Dr. Bragg actually made photograhps of the atom . Sees End to Light Dispute . " This method , " said Dr. Comp- I ton , " gives a very direct test of the atom . It makes you think that the atom is a. wave , not of matter , but of probability . " The electron is still a particle . Its wave nature , that which is diffused , is the probability as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my opinion , settles the age-old controversy as to the nature of light , whether it is a particle or a wave . When light does something , such as affecting chemical changes on a photographic plate , it is a .. , particle . But its propagation is due to its wave character . " The proton , positively charged particle with a mass 1,842 times that of the electron , the negatively charged particle , was first discovered by Lord - Rutherford in 1917 , when he found that by using alpha particles from radium one could drive out a mass of a definite weight , Dr. Compton continued , On this discovery , F. W. Aston of the University of Cambridge based the proposal that the nucleus of the atom consisted not of protons alone , but of a combination of electrons and protons , Dr. Compton said . However , he added , Professor W. D. Harkins of the University of Chicago antedated Aston in this theory . Findings of Dr. Harkins . It was Dr. Harkins , Professor Compton said , who proposed the widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom 's outer atmosphere and the number of electrons and protons in the nucleus of the atom in relation to thoir atomic number and atomic weight . Thus uranium , for example , is atomic No. 92 and has an atomic weight of 238 . According to Dr. Harkins 's theory , uranium has 92 orbital electrons , corresponding to the atomic number , and 238 protons in the nucleus , corresponding to the atomic weight . In addition . the nucleus has 146 electrons , thus making a total of 238 electrons and 238 protons . The same is true with all the other elements . Each has a number of protons corresponding to its atomic weight , a number of orbital electrons corresponding to its " tomic. number , and in addition enough electrons in the nucleus to make the total number of electrons equal the total number of protons . This theory , Dr. Compton said , had been recently modified by the discovery of neutrons and positrons. and also by the introduction by Dr. Harkins of alpha-particles in I the nucleus . But how the picture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of modern atomic physics , Mr. Compton added .
