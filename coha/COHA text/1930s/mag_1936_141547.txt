No MEAN CITY-Alexander McArthur &; H. Kingsley Long-Longmans , Green ( $2.50 ) . <P> Good collaborations in fiction are rare . <P> Collaborators are somewhat in the position of two men trying to see the same object through a single pair of binoculars : when it is in focus for one , it is blurred and out of perspective to the other . Two years ago two British writers , one a Glasgow slum dweller , the other a London journalist , turned their imaginative spyglass on the squalid , violent Gorbols section of Glasgow , on the south bank of the Clyde . Last week they reported on what they had seen , in a strange uneven book that suggested they could not quite agree on their findings . They saw horrors galore , filth , brutality , misshapen creatures of an unknown kind , a few recognizable human beings . <P> The story back of No Mean City is almost more significant than the one it tells . Alexander McArthur had lost his job in Glasgow in 1929 , spent the next five years writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The books that he submitted to Longmans , Green were considered unpublishable by that staid publishing firm , which hired H. Kingsley Long ( Limey : an Englishman Joins the Gangs ) to read the manuscripts and check on the accuracy of McArthur 's grim accounts . The resulting collaboration plainly shows the joints and seams of each author 's contribution , with McArthur presumably providing the harsh dialog , the accounts of Gorbols ' uncivilized ways , with Long interspersing pompous , horrified comments as the story unwinds . <P> The tale revolves around Johnnie Stark , a petty gangster who fought with razors , picked up one girl after another , married , led his gang against the gangs of other slum districts , was eventually killed when hoodlums caught him without his weapons . His story is paralleled by that of his brother , Peter , who was driven by a fierce determination to get out of the slums , became a white-collar worker , married a good , respectable girl , but landed in trouble when he was forced to lead a strike . Aside from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , who married beneath her station , became obsessed with her husband 's fighting ability , egged him into one fight after another , provided him with girls when his passion for her ended . Although these figures are sometimes vividly seen , they tend to disappear or grow cloudy as the descriptions of the customs and habits of mind of the " slummies " interrupt the narrative . <P> For U. S. readers the most unpleasant aspect of No Mean City is likely to be a note of hypocritical horror that runs through it . Writing as if the poverty-stricken masses they describe belonged to some savage tribe heretofore unknown , the authors solemnly state that " their novel deals only with one seam in the crowded life of the Empire 's second city . " They add that Glasgow is making a determined effort " to rehouse and to help its poorer citizens . " After picturing stables that would tax the strength of a dozen Hercules , they end their book with a vague reference to " preachers and social workers " who entered the wilderness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stark could no longer flourish there .
