Last week the Administration 's lustiest legal aides , Solicitor General Robert Houghwout Jackson and Assistant Attorney General Thurman Wesley Arnold , joined a defense committee for their fellow-member of the liberal National Lawyers Guild , C.I.O. Attorney Edward Lamb of Toledo . Mr. Lamb faces disbarment proceedings because of allegedly unprofessional remarks in court in opposing an injunction against the United Shoe Workers of America . According to the committee : " Mr. Lamb 's remarks may call for an expression of apology to the court . They must not be made the excuse for an attempt to invade fundamental liberties . "
