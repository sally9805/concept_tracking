txt Captain Wolfgang von Gronau set his seaplane down safely in the crowded traffic of . New York Harbor yesterday afternoon , completing his ? flight from Germany to the United States and fulfilling the ambition of years . All through his long career as a pilot he had dreamed of alighting on the waters of this harbor , he confessed after he had come ashore , and . ' he beamed with satisfaction at his success . ? But he had done more than realize this dream . He had made aviation . history by being the first to end a transaththtic flight in this harbor and within the limits of NeW York City . He had done it , furthermore , in. an unheralded and partly extemporaneous flight , in a five-yearold plane which had once served . Captain Roald Amundsen in the Arctic and which drifted in mid . Atlantic for four days two years age after Captain Frank T. Courtney .. English aviator , was forced down in. it when it took fire near the Azores. , Flying Time Forty-seven Hours .

M. yesterday after an unexpectedly fast run from Halifax . Captain von Gronau estimated the distance covered at 4,000 sea miles , about 4,670 land miles . The total flying time was forty-seven hours . At the end of the journey the old . Dornier-Wal plane looked capable of another flight just as long , and . all the members of the crew also looked fit and fresh . The flight from Halifax , the last leg of the voyage , was made with such speed that Captain von Gronait and his companions came sailing over the harbor ahead of schedule , disrupting the plans of the welcomers and depriving themselves of part of the honors which had been planned . for their arrival . The welcoming boat Macom , bear . ing the welcoming delegation , had hardly got under way when a shout went up from 5,000 watchers sta. tioned along the Battery sea-wall , and in the northeast , dipping down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plane Salutes Liberty Statue . It hummed across the tip of Man . hattan and headed out over the water as straight as a dragon-fly and , except for its drab color , looking not unlike one with its single long wing and its long boat-like body . It shot out over Governors Island and cir. cled the Statue of Liberty in salute , the sun touching its wings with MI. ver as the plane banked . Then Captain von Gronau sent his craft toward land once more , veered over the watchers at the Battery and flew around the Statue of Liberty again . Three police planes swooped about in the sky as an escort and one of them headed downward to a landing near the Battery . Captain von . Gronau took it as a guide and fol. lowed it in . Landing Tests the Pilot . Then came a final test of the vet . eran German flier 's ability . The her . bor was crowded with river craft . and near where he meant to come down were two car floats pushed by tugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated on the surface with other debris in the harbor . Captain von Gronau aimed his craft straight at the Aquarium and nosed it gradually down . He came in fast ? at perhaps sixty-five miles an hour as he neared the water  --  and dropped it on to the smooth surface so gently that it raised only a mild ripple . Just as he was setting it down , however , the pilot saw a plank in his way and , pulling his stick back , hurdled it safely and then let the plane enter the water . It taxied toward the sea wall so swiftly that policemen stationed there thought it would crash , but Caiptain von Gronau set the tail of his ship down in the water hard and it stopped with a flurry of waves fifty yards from the Aquarium . The police launch Gypsy raced up to it and made it fast with a line and other police launches hurried in and hovered around to protect the plane . Meanwhile the welcoming group on the municipal steamer Macom were trying unsuccessfully to make their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of George F. Mand , chairman of the Mayor 's committee on reception to distinguished visitors . Others on the Macom were Dr. Gustave Heuser , Acting German Consul General ; Frank Cordt , acting chairman of the German-American Conference , composed of more than 100 clubs ; C. Ermelhauer , representing the Board . of Trade for German-American Commerce ; J. N. Schoonmaker , president of the General Aviation Corporation and the Fokker company ; Miss Hertha Mirow of , the Hamburg-American line , a personal friend of the aviators , and Louis C. Huck , vice president of the Dornier Company of America . Hitch in City 's Welcome . The landing of the German aviators so close to the Battery had not been expected and the Macom was half way to Bedloe 's Island when Captain von Gronau brought his plane down near the shore . The Macc:n put about and approached as close as it could to the bobbing sea plane but could not take off the aviators for fear of damaging the plane . Mr. Mand , however , was transferred to a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the others who had gone out to meet them looked down on the scene from the deck of the Macom . Then , before the aviators could come ashore , they were visited by Immigration Inspector John Olding , who swiftly got them through the technicalities of entering this country . Captain von Gronau 's age was recorded in the immigration record as 36 . The other members of the crew and their ages were as follows : Edward Zimmer , student aviator , 26 ; Franz Hack , mechanic , 25 , and Fritz Albrecht , wireless operator , 33 . It was more than a half hour from the time the Dornier-Wal came to rest in the harbor before the aviators were able to leave it and get their feet on land . Meanwhile they stood up in the cockpit of their craft and surveyed the skyscrapers and smiled at the shouts and wavings of welcome from the shore and from motorboats which chugged around them .

Hack , redheaded and genial ; Zimmer , trim and slender , and Albrecht , stocky and rosy-cheeked , listened and smiled . Pays Tribute to Our Airmen . He paid a tribute to the American aviators who had spanned the Atlantic , obviously referring particularly to Lieut . Commander Reade of the United States Navy , who flew to Europe in 1919 , and the army roundthe-world fliers of 1924 , who flew over much the same route that von Gronau and his associates had taken . " We had a hard struggle , " he said . " We had storm , heavy rain and fog for almost the entire trip . It is not usual for an aviator to fly over vast areas of icy seas . The only part of the voyage in which we have enjoyed good weather was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours of fog . " Besides the obstacles of storm and fog , which sometimes forced the plane down to within ten feet of the sea , the flight was in peril once as a result of a mechanical failure , the leader of the flight disclosed . Just after taking off from Greenland , Captain von Gronau said , the propellor of the wind-driven generator of the radio apparatus broke off and the pieces narrowly missed tearing a large rent or being caught in the tail surfaces of the plane . The flying fragments missed the rudder by inches , however , and the fliers were thankful , even though they had to resort to a smaller generator which reduced their use of the radio . " It was a difficult voyage , " said Captain von Gronau , " but I think it was worth the task . We are happy ' ? yery happy  --  to be here , We are glad that we can see this country , which has done so much for the progress of aviation . " " We hope it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " before a seaplane is landing every day in New York , coming from old Eli. rope . " Such service would call for broad organization , he asserted . He indicated that he did not expect to fly back to Europe and spoke almost apologetically of his plane , which already had had so much adventure even before he set out on the journey just completed . " This flight was not for a record , " he said . " This is an old plane . It was used by Amundsen in his Arctic explorations . We installed new motors in it . There are better planes for our purpose now , but I had no other at my disposal . " He said he would have to see how the engines had behaved and get permission of the authorities of his flying school , The Deutscher Verkehrs Flieger Schule , before embarking on another ambitious flight . He hopes , however , to attend the air races now going on in Chicago , flying there in the Dornier Wal if possible , and to fly to Washington also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . Captain von Gronau hardly touched in his interview on the last leg of his flight because it had been so simple in comparison with the other . six stages of the trip . After the interview , the four German fliers were taken out in a police launch to their plane again , and with Sergeant van Hagen , a police aviator , as guide , took off in the midst of moving barges and Sound liners to North Beach , Queens , near Bikers Island , to moor their plane . Arthur N. Chamberlin , Police Department aviation secretary , took the controls of a police plane and headed the police escort . The German aviators took off up the Hudson , while the escort flew up the . East River , but Mr. Chamberlin attracted their attention , and they followed him across the upper part of AIanhattan and to a safe landing in Bowery Bay . From there the party was taken . by police launch , after a short delay because of the boat 's grounding , to the New York Airways Dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there by automobile to quarters reserved for them in the Hotel Roosevelt . It had originally been planned for . Captain von Gronau and his companions to go to the City Hall soon after their arrival for the official reception by Mayor Walker . This was abandoned because the arrival was so late in the day . Mr. Mend said last night that the Mayor probably would receive the fliers tomorrow . Captain von Gronau expects to get in touch with Mr. Walker at 11 o'clock this morning to learn the time at which he and his comrades will he received . At 10 A. M. today Captain von Gronau , as master of his ship , will clear its papers through the Custom House . The further activities of the fliers have not been determined ,
