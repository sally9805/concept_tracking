txt Mr. Rogers Is Terribly Upset By What Happened to the Atom To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , May 3 . ? Let 's give a great big hand to those two Governors , Rolph of California and Balzar of Nevada , for making the flight clear across our country in a day . Too many wo n't fly because of their regard for their country and the shape it would be left in , in case of accident . See where tW6 English scientists were able to , the headline said , " Split the Atom . " The world was not bad enough off as it was ; now they go and split the atom . That 's the last straw . We expect the Democrats to split and the- country to split over prohibition , but we always felt that the old atom would remain intact . It was certainly a big disappointment to me . Come on , boys , let 's up and atom ! Yours , WILL ROGERS .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
