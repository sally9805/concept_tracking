txt 6o SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS molecules have , until lately , been beyond the powers of observation . The arrangement of the atoms in the molecule is not so well determined by the older methods as we could wish . It has , for example , been shown by chemical methods that the very important molecule of benzene consists of a ring of six carbon atoms , one hydrogen atom being attached to each carbon atom . But these methods do not give the dimensions of the ring , nor indeed do they tell us whether all the atoms lie in a plane . Nor do they tell us how the molecules are arranged when the benzene is frozen and solid , and that is a serious matter , because the relations between the behaviour of solid bodies and their structure interests us very greatly . Let us remember that in all those constructions and destructions , arrangements and re-arrangements which constitute our changing world , two opposing principles are always at war . There is a constant tendency to aggregation because molecules draw together under the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant tendency to disruption because the continuous movements and vibrations due to heat would keep the molecules from settling down into definite places or positions . Thus , for example , the molecules of water , though always trying to associate , and indeed often succeeding temporarily , are prevented from forming any permanent structure because their heat keeps them on the THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 6r move . If the heat is sufficiently reduced the water freezes . Now this freezing is a most remarkable phenomenon . If water molecules merely settled down together like mud at the bottom of a pond there would be little of interest in it . But the actual fact is one of great beauty . The molecules link themselves together in a simple pattern of extreme regularity : the unit of pattern contains very few atoms , and is repeated exactly through the whole body of the ice-crystal . The pattern is based on a hexagonal or six-pointed star arrangement ; and the ice crystals often reveal in their external form the characteristics which were present in the single unit . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitudes ; even , in less perfect fashion , in the frost figures on the window-pane ( Fig . Io , opposite p . S7 ) . Even the ordinary commercial ice can be made to show its elements of construction , but only by special treatment . begins to break the ice-links and set the water molecules free , the cavities which are formed have the outlines of six-pointed stars ; the process of undoing repeats that of construction in reverse order . The experiment is one of the most beautiful that the laboratory can show ( Fig . I I , opposite p . S7 ) . Underlying , then , the beautiful external form of the crystal , and actually the cause of it , is a // minute unit of pattern , and the hexagonal form of this unit is repeated and manifested in the hexagonal characteristics of the crystal . This was suspected before its actual demonstration in recent times , but as long as the argument had to be based on what the eye could see , no great progress was made . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other substance could be seen to indicate a regular addition of unit to unit , extending the crystal in all directions . Inferences as to the form of the unit could be drawn from observations of the whole crystal . Just so a pavement of tiles , each rectangular in form , would naturally be bounded by faces at right angles to one another ; if the single tile were triangular or hexagonal angles of 1200 would be more likely . The perfection of the crystal shows that the plan of the compilation is followed strictly . A good crystal is bounded by faces of great regularity and smoothness , and the faces meet at angles which are always the same , no matter how , when , or where the crystal was formed . The faces are often large enough to behave like little mirrors . We know now that our familiar crystals are exceptional only in their size . All solid substances tend to the perfect arrangement of the crystal , though in the vast majority of cases with only partial success . They may form , not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumble ( of tiny cry ? tals that escape the naked eye , and // may be invisible even under the microscope . Even further the number of molecules in a single group may be so small that the term crystalline is barely deserved . The whole of this wonderful design is on far too fine a scale to be perceived by the eye , even when helped by the microscope . The radiation which we call light , by means of which our eyes function , is too gross in texture to be of any use . One might as well use a yard measure to plan the details of the scales on a butterfly 's wing . Here the X-rays come to our aid , being radiation of the same character as visible light , but thousands of times finer in construction . They can detect the fine structure of the crystal . They are affected by the single minute unit of pattern which generally consists of a very few molecules . Ordinary light takes , so to speak , no notice of so small a body . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , but there are so many units in the crystal , all exactly alike and pointing exactly in the same way , that on the whole there is a result which we can observe . It is unnecessary , and indeed it would be impossible in the time at my disposal , to describe the technique of these experiments . I refer to them only because I am anxious to show you a single molecule , just as I have tried to make evident a single atom , a single electron , and a single energy quantum . The result of the examination of any molecule can be shown as a // shadow picture ; as if the molecule were made to cast its shadow upon a screen . Yet it is more than a silhouette . The shadow is graded , the denser parts being cast by the thicker parts of the molecule . In the picture of the durene molecule here given , the variations of density are indicated by contour lines . The shadows are cast by the electron clouds that surround the nucleus of each atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must pass over , the X-rays are not affected by it . But we may clearly put each nucleus at the centre of its electron cloud . These shadow pictures are very exact . The most important of the contour lines are accurate to their own width in the drawing . The positions of the atoms in each molecule are clearly seen , and the relative positions of the molecules in the crystal . We may say correctly that we now see the single molecule clearly , and can measure its dimensions and dispositions . We have now seen what we may call samples of those units which go to the ' making of the world . The single atom in the fog picture stands for the myriads of others , of ninety-two different kinds . The differences depend on the electric charge upon the nucleus , a positive charge which is balanced by the negative electrons that surround it . Hydrogen is a one-electron atom , carbon six , nitrogen seven , oxygen eight ; uranium is the heaviest , and also contains the largest number of electrons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an antiquity into which we can not penetrate , sometimes they commemorate the authors or the conditions of their discovery . But Nature is in this respect less picturesque . She knows them by number only , thus affording yet another example of the tendency to order and // regularity . The nuclear charge determines the power of entering into or withdrawing from combination with other atoms , and is therefore of first importance . The " atomic weight " is of less importance , but of great interest because it half displays and half conceals another of Nature 's regularities . Thus the atomic weight of chlorine is 35 ' 46 , taking hydrogen as unity . It has recently been shown that there are two kinds of chlorine ? so-called isotopes of chlorine ? both acting in the same way because the nuclear charge is seventeen ( positive ) , and seventeen electrons surround it . One is thirty-five times as heavy as hydrogen and the other thirty-seven , and the fractional 35 ' 46 really indicates a mixture in certain proportions . We have seen the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electron is of the sense that we have been accustomed to call negative . The positive electron or positron has recently been brought to light , but as it differs from the other in sign only and not in quantity , there is only the one magnitude of electric charge . We have at least seen where energy-quanta have gone by . The energy-content of the quantum emitted or absorbed in the form of radiation depends on the quality of that radiation . In blue light it is twice as great as in red light . In the case of X-rays it is far higher ; and radioactive substances emit others which are more energetic still . I have shown you pictures which give the // details of the sizes and forms and relative dispositions of the atoms in single molecules . They show also how the molecules are arranged in the solid body , with an order which , if persisted in to a sufficient extent , gives the body the regular form of the crystal . You have observed two steps in the execution of Nature 's designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , of which we also are formed , so that all that we do , all even that we think and say , and all our relations to the world and to one another depend upon the composition and arrangement of certain elements , limited in number , precisely defined , related to one another by curiously simple numerical laws . And we are just learning how to observe the first associations of those elements into units of pattern which contain within them the characteristics of the final assembly . It is especially interesting to observe that somewhere in the region which we can now study life itself enters in . The life principle can become active at a point in the assembly of which we know nothing at present . We have , indeed , vague ideas of limits set by dimensions and numbers of atoms involved , but we have no knowledge of the nature of the great change . It must be observed that even if we learn the details of the mechanism of life 's processes it does not follow that we can see it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come gradually to understand and appreciate Nature 's plans , and try ourselves to think and act in accordance with them , our science must grow , and the powers which science gives us . Physics and chemistry have already made great strides , largely on account of their acceptance of the principle of the " particulate " in the case of matter . As this principle has recently been extended to electricity and energy , we may be sure that the pace of our advance will not be diminished . More and more do the sciences , and the applications of the sciences , depend upon reasonings and experiments based on the elemen-tary details of the construction of the world . It can not often happen that the discovery of the form and characteristics of a molecule will explain a biological observation or start a new industry . What does happen , and this is fundamental and vastly important , is that the more closely our thoughts are in accord with Nature 's way of acting the more quickly we realize the significance of every suggestive observation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attitude of mind is what matters most of all . It is this awareness that has led and is leading to all the extraordinarily effective applications of physics and chemistry and the other sciences . As I said at the beginning of this lecture , it has been suggested to me that I should say some-thing of the progress of the applications of physical science . Obviously it is impossible for // me to enter fully into an account of so wide a subject : and surely it is in some respects unnecessary . Sir James Jeans told you two days ago , in the first lecture of this series , of the marvellous excursions into astronomical space and time to which recent physical research has largely contributed . It is not too much to say that all the other sciences have been stirred by the same impulse . The philosopher has been deeply interested . Anyone can see for himself , or can read what has been told by others of the extent to which our industries , especially our modern industries , depend upon our scientific knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the immense developments of electrical engineering , or of the chemical industries , or of the means of transport , or of means of inter-communication , or of the prevention and cure of disease , or of the use of materials such as rubber , alloy steels , cellulose , and so on . If one were to set to work to compile an estimate of the extent to which our various businesses now depend on science , whole volumes would be needed . It is not too much to say that the successful industries of to-day are based directly upon the science laboratory , and maintain a close connection therewith . I shall not , therefore , attempt a survey of established facts . It would , I think , be more useful , and I hope more interesting , to my audience if I spoke of a few cases in which the connection between pure science and its application is just // in the making : cases in which a way seems to be opening up between the things with which we are familiar , and the secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not too well marked , and trodden only by a few , but it may be that before long it will be broadened to a high way . Recent determinations of the form of the protein molecule supply a good example . Proteins are bodies of complicated composition and structure which play a fundamental part in animal life . They are essential constituents of muscle and nerve , skin and hair and wool : the values of our foods are related to protein-content , since the body 's store must be continually replenished . We have long known that carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen , sulphur , and other atoms are elements of the protein molecule , and that its molecular structure must in some ways be very variable , whence the name . Only recently we have acquired new information about the general plan , mainly from our X-ray studies , and it is extremely curious and interesting . Every protein molecule has a backbone or central framework , consisting of an atomic chain in which carbon and nitrogen atoms recur with perfect regularity , two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The chain can not be pulled into a straight line because the two links that join each atom to its neighbours in the chain make with each other an invariable angle . This angle , which can be measured with great exactTHE // ness , as can also the distance between each pair of atoms , is rather more than a right angle . Although there is this element of rigidity the chain as a whole can be crumpled up because any // part of the chain can turn round the link that connects it to the remainder , as if the link were an axle . It is the shortening of the protein chains in this way which constitutes the contraction of our muscles , or the shrinkage of a textile fabric , All animal movements are produced by the contraction and extension of muscular fibre , and directed by way of nerves , in which also the protein is the important constituent . The great variety of protein is due to variety in the nature of pendant atoms or groups of atoms which are attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of natural silk ; sometimes very complicated and variable , as in the many types and conditions of hair and wool . There is a certain pendant called cystine , which contains sulphur , and is found in hair but not in muscle : it would appear that this constituent gives to hair its relatively imperishable character . Knowledge of this kind throws light on the work of the biochemist and physiologist who try to understand the behaviour of the living body and pass on their knowledge to those whose business it is to care for animal life in any form , or , again , to others who are concerned with the supply of the nation 's food . Any business which deals with animal products is necessarily interested . It is possible , for example , to cite cases where such fundamental knowledge has been of value in the textile trade . Yet specific instances // do not satisfactorily illustrate the main point , which is , that understanding of Nature 's ways renders observation suggestive . It is curious that vegetable life runs parallel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain molecule is Nature 's favourite element of construction . In this case , however , the separate links are rings formed of five atoms of carbon and one of oxygen ( Fig. 14 ) . We call the structure cellulose . It enters prominently into the structure of all things that are rooted in the ground . We have , in this case , also learnt much in recent years of the molecular plan . The preference for the long chain where life and growth are to be fostered is a very interesting phenomenon . The chain may be increased in length by the addition of new links ; it is flexible ; it can be extended or contracted ; it has special values in one direction , endowing it with directive purpose . All these , to various degrees , are essential to that in which life is to exist , and growth is to take place . These subjects to which I have specially referred have been respectively of the animal and the vegetable world . Let me finally refer to the mineral . I would take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired knowledge of atomic arrangement in the metals and their alloys has been exceptionally full and accurate . No knowledge could have been more welcome to the metallurgist on whom demands // are now made for the supply of materials of new and extraordinary qualities . Every variety in the behaviour of an alloy can be traced to the arrange ment of the atoms in the unit of pattern of its crystals . Of possible combinations to form alloys // there is no end ; and it can be readily understood that knowledge of structure is of the highest value in planning the course of research . Such knowledge is growing rapidly . We in this country have compelling reasons for developing to the utmost our knowledge and practice of metallurgy . Lastly , the bulk of the earth 's crust is composed of the silicates , whose molecules are formed mainly of oxygen , the most frequent of the atoms in the world , and of silicon , which is next in order of frequency . The great variety of the silicates has been a perplexing question . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxygen and silicon which in one form or another are never departed from , and we know the exact form of those rules . The great variety is due to the fact that all sorts of strange atoms can be added to the main structure in many ways . The clearer view of the highly important silicate class is important to the geologist and the mineralogist . The diagram of Fig. 15 will serve as an illustration of the arrangement of the atoms in the molecules of certain well-known minerals . Sir James Jeans has told you that the study of astronomical events can not be used as an argument for a mechanistic theory of the universe . Nor can the knowledge of Nature 's constructions , of which I have tried to draw a rough picture this afternoon . It is true that Nature 's operations move with machine-like precision , and that all // her processes , whenever we are able to repeat them , follow the rules of the experimental laboratory . But it is also true that we have another // and actions . We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may act selfishly or unselfishly . If the lessons of the two laboratories seem to contradict each other , the clash is not even so definite as that which in the physics world may set the wave theory and the particle theory in apparent contradiction , if we confuse the uses to which the two theories may be put . We know that in such a case the deficiency must be in our own minds , which are unable , at present , to interpret in full what we observe . Do not let us therefore be oppressed by unnecessary fears that we are but helpless cogs in a machine , but let us throw ourselves eagerly into the task of trying to interpret and live in the world in which we find ourselves . laboratory , wherever we meet our fellow men and that there also we learn by experience , and make observations on which we base thoughts CHAPTER I I I THE ELECTRICITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE previous two lectures have dealt with the progress of theoretical and atomic physics , and so have been largely concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations of the laboratory . As a change , I invite you this evening to consider the physics of the open air , for I have taken as the subject on which I am to report progress , " Electricity in the Atmosphere . " The subject is relatively an old one , and yet some of the problems connected with it have only recently been satisfactorily solved . I shall deal first with the electricity in the lower atmosphere , which can be investigated directly , and afterwards with the upper atmosphere , which is out of human reach , and which must be explored by indirect means . Electricity in the Lower A'tmosphere. ? We are all familiar enough with the thunderstorm , which is the most striking manifestation of the electricity in the lower atmosphere , but even on a day free from storminess there is a good deal of electricity about . In fine weather both the surface of the earth and the air itself are electrified , and it is the maintenance of this fine weather electricity which has been one of the chief mysteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface has a 8z SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS negative charge , while the lower atmosphere possesses , on the whole , a positive charge . Because of the attraction between opposite charges there is a transport of positive electricity from the atmosphere into the ground ; and , although this downward current is so small as to require delicate instruments for its detection when we consider , say , one square yard of the ground , the total influx of positive electricity for the whole of the earth 's surface is of the order of one thousand amperes . Observation shows that the downward positive current into the ground is sufficient to neutralize the earth 's surface charge in a few minutes , but no such neutralization is found to take place . The earth 's negative surface charge persists . Evidently it must be replenished in some way , but the persistence is at first puzzling . The situation is somewhat similar to that of a man who can go on cashing cheques without reducing his bank balance . Clearly , in such a case , one must suppose that other cheques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches , even though the accountee does not know his benefactor . Many suggestions have been put forward concerning the manner of compensation in the electrical problem , but only recently has the real benefactor been identified . Hourly Variation of the Earth 's Electric Charge . ? For further insight into the problem we must consider first how the earth 's surface charge // varies throughout the day . Measurements of this quantity have been made now for many years . One method used is to isolate a portion of the ground and measure the charge on it , but that most commonly used is to calculate the magni-tude of the charge by the electric force it exerts in the immediate neighbourhood of the ground . In the first diagram , which is due to Dr. F. J. W. Whipple , you will see the results of a long // series of measurements of this electric force , or the potential gradient , as it is termed , at different times of the day . The graph in the upper half of the diagram shows how the charge ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hour of the day . You will notice an early morning maximum and an evening maximum also . The question to be decided is whether these effects are characteristic of the earth as a whole , or are merely local phenomena . The lower diagram suggests plainly that these variations are connected with the effects of smoke and dust in the atmosphere , and we now believe that these effects mask the natural one we are trying to discover . This striking parallelism between potential gradient and atmospheric pollution was first recognized by Chree and Watson in 1923 . The top diagram shows also how the earth 's charge was influenced by the introduction of summer time in 1916 . You will see that the effect of the smoke is noticed one hour earlier than previously , meaning , I suppose , that people lit their fires one hour earlier . I think we may say that it was due to the fact that so much attention was directed to measurements of the earth 's charge on land that the real nature of the problem was for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made near cities are vitiated by the influence of smoke and dust , so that the correct variation of the earth 's charge as a whole is not shown . // The first measurements which showed the natural variation of the earth 's charge throughout the day were those carried out over the oceans by workers in the American ship Carnegie . This vessel was made of non-magnetic material , and between 1909 and 1929 made several worldwide cruises , in which surveys of the earth 's electric and magnetic properties were conducted . You will probably remember that she was unfortunately destroyed by an explosion and fire in Apia Harbour in 1929 . As a result of one of these expeditions it was found by Dr. S. J. Maunchley that the variations of electric charge on the earth at sites in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were quite different when each was studied with reference to local time , but that when the results were all referred to Greenwich mean time there was a very marked correspondence . I should add that this does not , of course , imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but it does mean that the charges over the greater part of the world increase and decrease in the same way at the same universal time . By going away from smoke and dust we have eliminated local influences , and can see how the earth 's charge as a whole behaves . Maunchley 's results showed that the earth 's charge increases throughout the day , reaching a maximum at about 7 p.m . G.M.T. , and that it is at its minimum in the early morning . Any theory put forward to explain the mystery of the replenishment of the // earth 's electric charge should , to be satisfactory , explain why the charge varies in this simple fashion . The Influence of Thunderstorms. ? I need not trouble you with an account of the early theories of the maintenance of the earth 's charge . They all appeared plausible at first , but one by one they have had to be discarded because of advances in our knowledge . I will proceed straight to an account of the theory which , to my mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are still a few workers in this field who do not yet accept it . This theory was put forward by Professor C. T. R. Wilson , of Cambridge , the most eminent of all workers on atmospheric electricity . His theory is , in brief , that thunderstorms are responsible for the maintenance of the earth 's negative charge in spite of the dissipative influence of the air-to-earth current . You will readily see that we must apply two tests in the examination of any theory of this kind . First , it must be clear that the agency suggested should cause the return of electricity of the correct sign , that is to say , negative electricity , to the ground . Secondly , it must be demonstrated that the agency is potent enough to supply the charge for the whole earth . I will take these two points in order . It has been known for a long time that a thundercloud must consist of two oppositely charged regions of electricity , one positive and // one negative . But not till recently has it been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the negative charge is below the positive charge it will tend to send negative electricity into the ground , whereas if the positive charge were underneath , the reverse effect would take place . In testing the thunderstorm theory it is therefore important to know how the two charges are situated . Now experiments carried out in this country and also in South Africa ( where there is plenty of observational material in the way of thunderstorms ) have proved very definitely that thundercloud formation usually results in the elevation of a positive charge above a negative one . This is shown diagrammatically in the second figure , from which it will be seen that the lower charge tends to send negative electricity into the ground . It was pointed out by Professor Wilson that // the entry of negative charge to the earth under a thunderstorm was likely to be specially marked at the tips of all pointed bodies , such as the leaves of trees and blades of grass . In order to test this matter , Dr. T. W. Wormell in Cambridge and Dr. B. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign and magnitude of the charges passing into pointed conductors in thundery weather . Dr. Schonland used a thorn bush as his electrical collector . The bush was insulated electrically and the current passing into it measured . This current was found to be chiefly negative in thundery weather , and it was possible to show that it was sufficiently intense to compensate for the ordinary air-earth current over quite a considerable tract of fine-weather area . Both Wormell and Schonland , in fact , after making a kind of profit and loss account for the earth 's electric charge in the area each has studied , are of opinion that the thunderstorm agency is sufficient to cause the maintenance of the earth 's negative charge . There are really far more thunderstorms occurring at any given time than we ordinarily imagine . Dr. C. E. P. Brooks , from an analysis of the world 's weather records , estimates that there are over one thousand thunderstorms in action at any given time , so that if each thunderstorm area sends an ampere of negative current into the ground , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand amperes // of positive current which I said had been estimated as passing into the ground in fine weather regions . But we must still bear in mind the result of Maunchley , which showed us that the earth 's negative charge increased steadily during the day and decreased during the night . Can this fact be explained in terms of the thunderstorm theory ? It is well known that thunderstorms occur most frequently over land areas , being comparatively rare over the sea . It is also known that thunderstorms are most frequent at any given place in the afternoon about 4.0 p.m . Now there are three very thundery regions on the earth 's surface , namely , Dutch East India , South Africa , and South America . While it is 4.0 p.m. local time over these regions we should expect the earth 's negative charge to be increasing . A simple examination of a map of the world shows that this period corresponds roughly from 4.0 in the morning to 8. o p.m. at Greenwich , which is just about the period when Maunchley 's observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore good correspondence . The earth 's charge increases while the sun is passing over the thundery land areas , and decreases while it is passing over the Pacific Ocean . I think that this is one of the most striking results favouring the theory of Wilson . As I mentioned earlier , the atmosphere immediately above the ground possesses in fine weather a resultant positive charge , although there are // really present elementary electric particles , or ions as they are called , of both signs . We know that the splitting up of air molecules into these elementary charges is effected by two agencies . First there is the influence of small quantities of radium and thorium , percolating from the ground into the lower atmosphere , and secondly there is the effect of those mysterious particles known as cosmic rays , which enter the earth 's atmosphere from outside . Electricity in the Higher lltmosphere. ? I now turn to consider the second half of my subject , the electricity in the upper atmosphere . Here it is impossible to make experiments in situ , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed on the ground , together with the methods of exploration by radio waves . For example , we have , in polar regions , the aurorae or northern lights , which clearly must be electrical discharges , so similar are they to the discharges observed at low pressure in the laboratory . The study of terrestrial magnetism quite early showed that intense electric currents must flow in the upper atmosphere , especially during periods of magnetic storminess . But the most direct evidence that the higher atmosphere is electrically conducting has come from experiments with wireless waves . The chief reason for this is that a radio exploration of the upper atmosphere can be made at any time , and it is not necessary to wait for natural sequences and irregularities . ELECTRICITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE 9 ' Wireless methods of investigating the electrified regions of the upper atmosphere , or the ionosphere , as it is now commonly called , are really very simple . Brief radio signals are sent out by a station , travel upwards to the ionosphere , where they are reflected , and are afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , very quickly , for the waves travel with the speed of light , but the timing of the up and down journey presents no technical difficulties , even though it is necessary to estimate the time to 1oo10oo of a second . The earlier experiments of this kind showed that the density of the electricity at levels of over sixty miles above the ground was about a thousand times that near ground-level , and it seemed clear that it could not be due to the same causes . The Reflection of Radio Waves. ? I ought here to interpolate that the existence of this reflecting ceiling in the atmosphere has important consequences in practical radio communication , for it is by way of it that wireless waves are constrained to travel to the Antipodes . Without it they would fly off wastefully into space . But the echoes which are returned from it are sometimes a nuisance especially in short-distance communication , for it means that you get your signals all doubled . You receive them via the direct path along the ground , and also via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the upper atmosphere . Some time ago the B.B.C. sent out // television signals by the Baird process , using wave-lengths which gave pronounced echoes at about one hundred miles from London , and it seemed to me that the echo-effect should be shown up as a kind of ghost-image . Through the kind offices of the Wireless World I was able to ask amateurs receiving these television signals to look out for ghost-images . The first response I obtained was from an amateur in Bristol , Mr. W. B. Weber , who had been very successful in receiving the Baird transmissions. / He sent me a most interesting communication , saying : 1 . That he had received echo images by night and not by day . 2 . That the echo image was always above the main one . 3 . That so far as he could measure , the shift upwards was about one-seventh of the whole picture . From Mr. Weber 's observations it was possible to calculate that the echo , or ghost-image , must have been received 3,0 o S second after the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometry one can show that the echo must have been reflected at a level of about sixty miles , which is just the height of the Kennelly-Heaviside layer . Echoes are sometimes troublesome in the case of transmission over longer distances . The Marconi Company have developed a very efficient system of transmission by means of which line // drawings can be transmitted by wireless over the Atlantic . Here the influence of multiple echoes is sometimes to be noted . The first signal to arrive is that which has been once reflected by the ionosphere , but this is often followed by waves which have been reflected twice or three times . They make longer journeys and so arrive late . The result of this is that the transmitted typescript or picture appears doubled or trebled at the receiving station . Measurements of Density of Upper-atmosphere Electrification. ? But to-night I want to stress neither the advantages nor disadvantages of the ionosphere in radio communication . I want us to consider the results which have accrued from the use of radio waves in the investigation of the ionosphere itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experiment , the waves being projected vertically upwards at the sender , and the echoes examined at ' a receiving station quite close . For example , daily experiments of this type are carried out between the Strand and Hampstead , the sender being an aerial on the roof of King 's College and the receiver being situated at the Halley-Stewart Laboratory . Now the most productive method of using radio waves for exploring the ionosphere is that involving the use of a number of wave-lengths . Short waves are more penetrating than long waves , and if , in any experiment , the wave-length // is gradually shortened it is found that a value is reached where reflection ceases and the waves break through . We call this the penetration wave-length . This penetration wave-length is all-important , for it gives us a measure of the density of the electricity in the region penetrated . Measurements designed to test how the electric density varies with the hour of the day and with the season of the year have now been in progress for some years , both here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penetration wave-length . Since there are two main regions in the ionosphere , there is a penetration wave-length for each , from the determination of which we can obtain a value for the appropriate electron density . In the third figure the variations of the noon values of the electron densities for both regions throughout the year are shown . It will be seen that the lower region , which we term Region E , or the Kennelly-Heaviside layer , behaves much as we should expect , being denser on a summer noon than on a winter noon . This is due , of course , to the more direct action of the sun . But when we consider the densest region of the ionosphere , we find a curious seasonal relation . The maximum effect is not found to occur in summer , but in October and November . There is also a subsidiary maximum in early spring . This curious behaviour of the top layer of the ionosphere has been much discussed . // Either the measurements must be wrong , or there must be a pronounced difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think it is sound to assume that the ionizing rays from the sun differ in quality or strength from summer to winter . // Some workers ( for example , in America ) have concluded that the measurements are spurious , and that the electric density of the upper region is really greater in summer than in winter , the annual variation being similar to that for Region E. In this country we believe the experi-mental results to be sound , and to indicate that the higher atmosphere is much hotter in summer than in winter . We think that in summer the atmosphere at high levels is heated and so expands . As a result of the expansion the density of the electricity is reduced . Putting these ideas in quantitative form , it appears necessary to assume that the temperature at a level of one hundred and fifty to two hundred miles reaches a temperature of about 2,000 ? F. on a summer noon . The marked seasonal variation we have just been discussing and the way in which the ioniza-tion builds up every morning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form of radiation from the sun . Moreover , it is clear that the radiation must travel in straight lines . Now such radiation might consist of electromagnetic waves ( such as , for example , ultra-violet light ) , or it might consist of uncharged atoms travelling with high speeds . To decide between these two possible agencies was not easy , and it was necessary to make special ob-servations on the occasion of a solar eclipse to test the matter decisively . The result , however , // demonstrated conclusively that the normal ionizing agency for both of the main regions is ultra-violet light from the sun , and that the effect of neutral atoms , if present , can only be small . Abnormal Radio Transmission. ? So far I have been concerned with what we may call the normal behaviour of the ionosphere . But it sometimes occurs that conditions are abnormal , when , for example , long-distance signalling is difficult because the intensity of the received waves is weak . At such times it is clear that the structure of the ionosphere must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that such periods when communication is difficult are connected in some way with magnetic storms . This connection was studied in greater detail by the British Radio Expedition to Tromso during the Second International Polar Year , 1932-3 . As Tromso lies in latitude 700 , well within the Arctic Circle , and close to the zone of maximum auroral activity , it was a particularly suitable station for work of this kind , since the magnetic storms experienced there are of a much greater severity than those which occur in our latitude . The work of the Tromso expedition showed that the normal density of electrification in the ionosphere in high latitudes is less than in temperate latitudes , which is just what we should expect according to the ultra-violet light theory of ionospheric origin . But on the days of pronounced magnetic and auroral activity a most remarkable result was // obtained , for it was found that there were no wireless echoes at all , the ionosphere ceasing to reflect . I do not think we can attribute the lack of echoes to a low density of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these abnormal periods there must be intense ionization . It seems as if there is ionization produced , shall we say , in the wrong place ; that is , below the normal level . Such ionization might be expected to produce absorption , and cause the echoes to be so low in intensity as to be undetectable . Many years ago a theory was put forward by Birkeland to explain the nature of auroral displays and magnetic storms , and in particular to explain why these phenomena are most intense in high latitudes near the poles . Birkeland 's theory , put briefly , is that these disturbances are caused by the incidence of charged particles or atoms , originating in the sun , on the upper atmosphere . Birkeland 's theory has been worked out in great mathematical detail by Stormer , and is accepted by most geophysicists . It has been shown that the influence of the earth 's magnetic field is such as to cause the charged solar particles to converge towards the two polar regions , leaving the equatorial regions unaffected . The Solar Cycle. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the occurrence of abnormal radio phenomena are all connected and according to the theory of BirkeELECTRICITY // land they are all to be attributed to the influence of charged particles from the sun . Now it is known that magnetic storms are connected in some ways with sun-spots , for , in a year of marked sun-spot activity , magnetic- storms are found to be both frequent and severe . The last sun-spot maximum occurred in the year 1928 , and about the latter half of 1933 there occurred the minimum . We are thus , at present , approaching another maximum in 1939 , and both the magnetic and radio evidence already tell us that this is the case . We must therefore expect abnormalities to grow more frequent and troublesome . But there is another question of great interest which will be examined with care during the next few years . Will the normal ionization in the ionosphere follow the sun-spot cycle ? Or , in other words , does the intensity of the ultra-violet light from the sun alter in sympathy with the sun-spot cycle ? Measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variation , but it is clear that the work in progress must be continued till 1939 before the exact magnitude of any such variation can be estimated with anything like accuracy . Any such steady variation of the normal ionization would have an important effect for the practical radio-worker , for it would mean that each year he would have to alter slightly the wave-lengths used in order to secure optimum transmission results . I00 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS It is fitting , I think , that I should conclude this lecture at this point , showing you that the subject of atmospheric electricity still supplies us with unsolved problems and interesting work for the future . A certain amount of progress has been made , you will , I think , agree , by the radio exploration of regions which are inaccessible in any other way , but much yet remains to be done . We are told that the mythical /nymph , Echo , because of her incessant chattering , was deprived of speech to the extent that she could only repeat the question put to her . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , however , that we can claim for our wireless echoes a little more than that . They repeat their original , it is true , but , as I have tried to show you to-night , they sometimes do it with sufficient lack of exactitude and at such significant intervals as to give away some of Nature 's secrets . IV EDWARD MELLANBY M.D. , F.R.C.P. , F.R.S . C H A P T E R I V PROGRESS IN MEDICAL SCIENCE IN this lecture I propose to give an outline of progress made in medicine and medical science through the centuries . I have chosen this subject partly because most of my working life has been spent in studying scientific problems associated with medicine and partly because it seemed to me that , by surveying an aspect of a subject which touches the lives of all of us , better appreciation could be had of the great strides that have been made in the acquisition of biological knowledge in modern times , and especially in the present century . It is an interesting fact that , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its eradication greatly interested mankind . This being so , it is strange that until about a hundred years ago there had been relatively little advance in real knowledge of disease or its control . Now why is this ? Is it because mankind possessed less intelligence up to a hundred years ago ? I should say certainly not , for there is every reason to believe that people in the olden days were as intelligent as we are to-day . There are , I think , three main reasons for this long latent period : the first is that mankind had the wrong way , or what appears now to be the 1o4 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS wrong way , of looking at the problem of health and disease : the second reason is that it took man a very long time to appreciate the fact that he could not get much useful knowledge of the human body unless he actually made it a subject of close and direct study both in a healthy and diseased condition : the third reason is that , until comparatively modern times , man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had first to learn the value of observation : then he had to realize that observation is not enough , but that it must be associated with experiment . Throughout all ages , speculation has been the great will-o ' - the- wisp , and by contenting men 's minds has prevented serious and profitable observation and investigation . Let me illustrate the detrimental effects exerted on medical advance by these various factors . First , as regards the wrong attitude towards health and disease : we know that the Egyptians , the Assyrians , and the Babylonians , although they were interested in disease , regarded it as supernatural , and due to some sort of magic influence ? an invasion of the body by some evil spirit . Disease could not be controlled unless this malignant spirit was first cast out from the body . Its entrance could be hindered or prevented by amulets and charms , but to drive it out of the body of a sick man prayers and incantations were necessary . When once driven out , the ravages it // had made to the organs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemlock , squills , castor oil , etc . In those days astrology had a great vogue ; also the art of divination flourished . In connection with the latter art , it is interesting to remember that the liver was the main object used for such purposes . The blood supply , the size and form of every portion of the liver of sacrificial animals were noted , and by this means the future was prognosticated . It is strange that hepatoscopy , which led to such careful examination of one internal organ and which held sway in the lives of these ancient people for thousands of years , should not have stimulated in them an interest in the form and structure of other organs , or impressed them with the fact that disease was a process belonging to the natural world . It is obvious that the view of disease as a supernatural phenomenon is incompatible with any advance in knowledge of its real nature . It is an interesting fact that even in those early days the profession of medicine was in some way organized , although clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much must have remained in the hands of the priests . We have evidence of the ethical basis of medical practice in the Code Hamnurabi , found on a monolith in Babylonia and dating from about 2000 E.C . This deals with the laws controlling religious , legal , and medical procedure , and contains a io6 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS number of instructions to medical practitioners . Two of these may be quoted : " If a doctor has treated a gentleman for a severe wound with a bronze lancet and has cured the man , or has opened an abscess of the eye for a gentleman with a bronze lancet and has cured the gentleman , he shall take ten shekels of silver . " " If the doctor has treated a gentleman for a severe wound with a lancet of bronze and has caused the gentleman to die , or has opened an abscess of the eye of a gentleman and has caused the loss of the gentleman 's eye , one shall cut off his hands . " Medical work in those days must have been at least exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to a wrong attitude towards the human body , was during the Middle Ages , extending from the fifth to the sixteenth centuries . It followed the almost complete extermination of the Greeks and Romans . This obliteration of a civilization was due largely to the barbarian invasion , but partly to a series of devastating plague epidemics . Since all knowledge and culture throughout the Middle Ages remained in the hands of the Church , the outlook of men 's minds was controlled by the clerical influence . It was considered that nothing in life was of any importance except those things bearing upon death , judgment , Heaven , and Hell . Man 's soul was everything , his body nothing . So far , then , as health and disease were concerned , since they // were conditions affecting the body they were of no account . The whole attitude of the civilized world was dominated by the particular Christian tenets of that time ; this can be seen in the writings of distinguished men of the period . For instance , Tertullian said , " Investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two long sterile periods , namely , that of the Assyrians , Babylonians , and Egyptians , and the Medieval Ages , there had passed the great period of Greek and Roman culture . As in all other intellectual and practical pursuits , this culture left its mark on medicine and medical science , and , after becoming moribund and being revived on several occasions from the time of its highest development to the present day , still exerts an influence on the outlook of medical men . Everyone is aware of the greatness of Hippocrates and his school , of Aristotle , and of Galen . The Greeks were the first to introduce real sanity into medicine . They attempted to shed the long-established teaching that disease was due to the invasion of the body by malignant spirits . For the first time in history disease was regarded as a natural process , to be studied and observed directly before there could be any hope of obtaining knowledge . They regarded a healthy mind in a healthy body as the most desirable thing in the world , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the best and most natural conditions . The curative to8 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS value of Nature herself was prominently taught . The ethical ideals applicable to medical prac-1 titioners as taught by Hippocrates represent even to-day one of the finest codes of behaviour that can be followed . It can at least be claimed for the Greek attitude towards the human body that it was the first in the history of man compatible with advance in medical knowledge either by observation or by investigation . Even Greek teachings were unfortunately cluttered up with speculation , which encumbered the wheels of progress . It will be remembered , for instance , that the Greeks thought that blood , phlegm , yellow bile , and black bile were the four dominant elements of the body , and that these four elements corresponded to and controlled the four wellknown dispositions , sanguine , phlegmatic , choleric , and melancholic . When these elements worked in equilibrium and harmony , good health resulted ; when they were out of harmony , a condition of dyscrasia brought about ill-health . It will be seen later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these views again held sway for a long time , and had to be shattered before further advance in knowledge could be attained . The second main reason for the long latent period in medical progress , mentioned at the beginning of my lecture , namely , the slowness of mankind to realize that a knowledge of the structure of the human body is essential before // any understanding of what really constitutes disease can be attained , is also partly responsible for the lack of rapid advance that might have been expected in this great era of Greek culture . Dissection of the human body was taboo to the Assyrians , Babylonians , Egyptians , and also to the Greeks , and they were therefore incapable of getting any sound knowledge of the condition of organs and tissues of the human body either in health or disease . It is true that , after the Greek settlement in Alexandria , the study of human anatomy was established at the instigation of the Ptolemys , and it is from this date ( 300 B.c. ) that anatomy can be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be temporary and local . Even the lively and ever-searching efforts of Aristotle were frustrated by his inability to examine the human body , but he endeavoured to make up for this by the dissection of animals , such as monkeys and pigs He confessed , for instance , that he had never seen human kidneys . At a later period , Galen ( A.D. 130 ? 200 ) did much to acquire knowledge both of anatomy and physiology . He it was who established the fact that the arteries of the body contain blood and not pneuma , although he failed to discover that the blood circulates , or even that the pulsation of the heart drives the blood into the vessels . With the disappearance of Greek culture in Alexandria the study of anatomy again lapsed , and during the period of the no SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS Middle Ages all matters of medical interest became practically moribund . It is true that the subject was kept alive to some extent in Alexandria after conquest in A.D. 640 by the Arabs , also at Byzantium and at Salernum in Southern Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly of interest in that they saved Greek medicine from entire destruction , but they had at the time no general or wide influence on the development of medical knowledge . It was only with the Renaissance , and especially after the establishment of the medical school of Padua , that the study of anatomy was properly revived and developed to a high art . It is impossible to consider this great and revolutionary period and its effect on medicine in any detail , but it can be said quite definitely that such men as Leonardo da Vinci , Vesalius ( 1537 onwards ) , and Fabricius ( 1594 ) , completely altered our whole knowledge of the structure of the human body . With this great development in anatomical studies the teachings of Hippocrates and Galen were reborn and a new period of medical culture arose . The lack of appreciation of the experimental method was mentioned above as the third reason for the long latent period before medical science advanced , but the time has now arrived when a classical demonstration of this method of investigation was given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was greatly influenced by PROGRESS IN MEDICAL SCIENCE III the teachings of Fabricius , being particularly interested in his observations on the presence of valves in the veins . It was in consequence of this interest that Harvey , on his return to England , settled down to study the circulation of the blood . The outcome of this study was the publication in 1628 of De Motu Cordis , in which he describes the experimental methods whereby he proved that the blood actually circulates through the body . This publication is now recognized as not only the first but also one of the most beautiful demonstrations ever recorded of the experimental method , and shows the possibilities of this method in bringing to light new facts . It must be remembered that even in the beginning of the seventeenth century people still believed in Galen 's theory ( A.D. 130 ? 200 ) that the blood was present in two different systems of vessels , in each of which it ebbed and flowed continuously , but did not circulate . It was many years before Harvey 's view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might be thought that the success of Harvey 's work would have resulted in the general adoption of the experimental method by other people interested in the study of disease . Unfortunately , this was not the case , for between the time of Harvey and the time that the experimental method was generally adopted as the main plan of action in biological and medical research , two hundred years had to pass . This , of course , // does not mean that no experiments were done in the meantime , but the statement is in general true . The world was still almost completely ignorant of those facts relating to health and disease which could be established by pure observation apart from experiment , and there was no basic knowledge of chemistry and physics at the time to allow much advance . Chemistry itself began to take shape about the time of Harvey 's life , and however much we deprecate the tardiness with which experimental biology developed , the same can not be said of chemistry and physics . The mention of the names of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Stahl , leading to Robert Boyle , Cavendish , Priestley , Lavoisier , and Dalton , is sufficient to show that chemistry as we know it originated in and developed from this time . There were , of course , numbers of distinguished physicians during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , but their interest in disease was rather as observers of its Natural History . Sydenham ( 1624 ? 89 ) represents Hippocrates at his best , and there was also the distinguished Dutch physician , Boerhaave ( 1714 ) , who introduced sane methods involving accurate observation into the study and teaching of medicine . The drawback of this period , however , was that even the most distinguished physicians , instead of studying and advancing medical knowledge , were intent on inventing hypotheses based on pure speculation to account // for all disease . Two of the best-known so-called systems of medicine dating from this time were those of Cullen , who regarded all disease as being due either to spasm or atony , and of John Brown , who put forward the hypothesis of excitability as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? discussion and controversy among those interested in medical problems . So far as medicine was concerned , these discussions were fruitless and a great waste of time . In this relatively sterile period of the eighteenth century the most outstanding advance came again from Italy in the work of Morgagni ( 176o ) , who , by his accurate post-mortem examinations succeeded in establishing the subject of pathological anatomy . When we remember how dependent knowledge of disease is on discovery of the condition of organs as found post mortem , we can realize what a revolution in the study of medicine was made by this distinguished investigator . Rather later , under the stimulus of John Hunter ( 1728-93 ) , pathology again made a great advance . Hunter was a naturalist keenly interested in pathology , and his very active life was spent in establishing closer union between medicine and natural science . He it was who wrote to Edward Jenner , " Do n't think , ? try , " when the latter was interesting himself in the observation that dairymaids who had contracted cowpox in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of this admonition on // Jenner had , as everyone knows , a revolutionary effect on the history of smallpox , for as the outcome the system of vaccination was developed , and its efficacy in preventing smallpox was established . In this period , largely through a group of distinguished French physicians , physical examination of the body both in health and disease became much more accurate . In 1819 Laennec introduced the stethoscope , and from this time onwards it was possible for medical men to use both auscultation and percussion in diagnosis . It was this group of physicians , also , who extended the work of Morgagni in the post mortem room to an accurate study of the cases prior to death . There was , in fact , at this time great progress made in the clinical diagnosis of individual diseases . Indeed , the material upon which medical research could then work was rapidly accumulating , although even now the experimental method itself was dormant . Modern medicine can be said to . date from the time of Pasteur and Claude Bernard , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief instrument of medical science . In the years 1857 to 186o Pasteur published his classical papers on lactic acid and alcoholic fermentation . As the result of this work Pasteur was imbued with the idea , which later he did a great deal to establish , that infectious fevers were due to the spread of a contagium vivum . This view he PROGRESS IN MEDICAL SCIENCE ris developed because he was convinced that the process of fermentation and the process of infection were closely related . Pasteur 's work led at once to the investigations of Lister , which established the fact that infection of wounds was due to the presence of germs of various low forms of life , and , following upon this , Lister developed the method of preventing sepsis in wounds by chemical substances having antiseptic properties . Thus Lister revolutionized surgery and made it practicable and safe . Another direct outcome of Pasteur 's investigations was the life-work of Koch , who in 1876 published an account of his researches on the aetiology of anthrax . It will be remembered that Koch grew the anthrax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced the disease in them . In 1882 he also discovered that tuberculosis was caused by the tubercle bacillus . Koch was the first to grow pure cultures of micro-organisms , thus establishing the subject of bacteriology . Before long there followed the isolation of the microorganisms responsible for typhoid fever , diphtheria , cholera , tetanus , plague , pneumonia , and gonorrhoea . Prior to the work of Koch another distinguished Frenchman , Claud Bernard , was using the experimental method to determine the functions of many organs of the body . He it was who , by discovering the glycogenic functions of the liver , opened up the whole subject of internal secretion . tt6 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS Whereas Koch might be regarded as the father of bacteriology , it seems reasonable to ascribe to Claud Bernard the fatherhood of modern physiology . Another subject also came to life at this time . namely , cellular pathology , through Virchow , who used the microscope to determine the real structure of the cells of different tissues and associated their appearance with specific disease . In this period of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of physiology , bacteriology , morbid histology , and surgery were definitely established as medical studies . Before turning to the medical advances of the present century , let us just briefly recapitulate the changes that have been mentioned above . We have seen medicine emerge from a period of magic and religion to a stage where disease came to be accepted as a phenomenon of nature . Following this there came a time when the structure of the body was investigated ; this led to the further stage in which clinical signs and symptoms and anatomical structures of diseased organs were correlated . Ultimately , the present era arrived , when the experimental method was seriously applied to the study of the body , with the result that big strides were made not only in knowledge of the actions of many organs , but also of the causes of many diseases . There were still , however , at the beginning of the present century , many diseases which had been distinPROGRESS IN MEDICAL SCIENCE its guished as entities but about which we knew little or nothing as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , the work of the last thirty years has helped to fill in many blanks . Let us first see why there has been this tremendous burst of activity in medical research since the beginning of the present century . There are a number of reasons for this , among which may be enumerated the following : 1 . Success breeds success . It is impossible for anybody to see the results of work such as that of Pasteur , Lister , and Koch without receiving inspiration and stimulus therefrom . It seems reasonable to believe that the knowledge and benefits produced by their investigations can be added to by others if the same or similar methods are adopted . This wonderful spirit of optimism has justified itself and has established the belief that no problem of health or disease is too difficult to tackle , and that there are no limitations to new knowledge procurable by the experimental method . 2 . A second reason is that modern research has led to great advances in the basal sciences of medicine , namely chemistry , physics , physiology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed new light on the healthy and diseased body and have put new weapons into medical hands for the study of disease , its diagnosis , prevention , and treatment . 3 . A third reason for this increased activity ii8 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS is that the whole civilized community has adopted the Greek attitude towards life , namely , that health is a great asset . Ill-health is not only uneconomic , but is largely responsible for the pain , suffering , and grief in the world . From a practical as well as an emotional point of view , therefore , everything should be done to eliminate disease either by prevention or cure , and , if investigation could lead to the . necessary knowledge , such research must be fostered . The general adoption of these views ultimately led both the State and private individuals to encourage medical research , and thereby bring new knowledge to bear upon the elimination of these defects of mankind . This movement was started in many countries throughout the world . In England in 1913 the Government set up what is now known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my predecessor , the late Sir Walter Fletcher , developed into a most effective system for encouraging the study of problems of disease . The Medical Research Council has also had the privilege of working in association with a number of privately established schemes for advancing medical science . It has , for instance , worked closely together with such well-known movements as the Rockefeller Foundation , with the Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine , with the Beit Memorial Research Fellowships , and with the Sir Halley Stewart and Leverhulme Trusts . // In addition to the establishment of methods for procuring new knowledge , public action led to the inauguration of the Ministry of Health , a body which in the last twenty years has shown great development . This resulted in a large increase in public medical services throughout the country , examples of which can be seen in ante-natal clinics , child welfare centres , centres for tuberculosis and venereal disease . The main function of all these bodies is to apply the scientific facts established by investigation as soon as possible to the prevention and cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health . Let us now see some of the effects of this great outburst of medical activity as evidenced in the increase of medical research and the administrative services . Some of these results can be best seen by examination of the general mortality rates and the death-rates due to specific diseases . Diagrams showing these mortality rates are given in Figs . I , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 . It will be seen that in the period 1896 to 1900 , 156 infants per I , 000 births died before the age of one ; whereas in 1934 this figure was reduced to 59 per 1,000 . In Fig. 2 the mortality rate of men between forty-five and fifty-five years of age was 20.3 per 1,000 in the period 187o to 1875 ; in the period 1926 to 1930 it was 11 .7 ( Fig. 2 ) . The death-rate from tuberculosis came down from 3,478 per million in the period 1851 to 186o to 740 per million in 1934 ( Fig. 3 ) . The death-rate from Lzo SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS whooping cough decreased from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51 per million in 1934 ( Fig. 4 ) ; in the case of measles from 38o per million to 93 per million ( Fig . S ) ; in the case of typhoid fever from 320 to 4 per million ( Fig. 4 ) . In most of the above diseases the actual fall in death-rate , sometimes of a startling nature , has occurred in the present cen tury . In the case of tuberculosis , however , the fall has been going on continuously now for the // past hundred years . Using these figures as a test , it is clear that there has been a tremendous improvement in the standard of health , especially in the past thirty years . There are , however , other methods of reaching the same conclusion . Although we have obtained a great deal of additional control in the diagnosis , prevention , and treatment of disease , it is un doubted that a number of diseases have dis appeared for reasons other than direct control . I22 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS For instance , there has been a virtual disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gout , which a hundred years ago was a very common disorder , is now relatively rare . Why this disease has practically disappeared is not known , but there are some who think its reduction in incidence is related to the diminution of lead poisoning . A second disease which has practically disappeared during the past thirty years is chlorosis , a particular form of anaemia in women . Twenty-five years ago the out-patient // departments of hospitals were attended by large numbers of young women suffering from this disease ; nowadays the average medical student hardly recognizes it . It has been suggested that chlorosis has disappeared owing to the discontinuance by women of tight-lacing ; this , however , is only a suggestion . Another disease which used to be of a deadly nature is summer diarrhoea and vomiting of infants , a condition which became almost epidemic in those years having prolonged // spells of hot weather . Many present in this room may remember the summer of 191 I , when thousands of children died owing to this condition . It has been suggested that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flies from town life , a result following the replacement of horses by the motor-car . Here again , however , the explanation offered is by no means established . Another important reason for the improvement // of health is undoubtedly the reduced consumption of alcohol by the community . There is probably more in this than we at present realize , but even now it can be stated definitely that certain diseases known to be associated with large alcohol consumption have been greatly reduced since the Central Control Board ( Liquor Traffic ) succeeded in making the country comparatively temperate as regards alcohol consumption ; for instance , cirrhosis of the liver , which was once a common cause of death , is now much less common . Delirium tremens also has become a much rarer disease . It is probably also partly for this reason that the smothering of children in bed is now a rare incident as compared with twenty years ago . A third reason for the disappearance of disease is the great improvement in sanitation and personal cleanliness . To England belongs the credit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this country ought not to forget what it owes to a group of distinguished men who , often against great opposition , persuaded Parliament to pass the necessary laws affecting public health . Little do we hear of such men as Chadwick , Murchison , Simon , Acland , Buchanan , and Benjamin Ward Richardson nowadays , although their great labours in the second half of the nineteenth century resulted in a dramatic decline in disease . Efforts in Parliament were greatly assisted by cholera epidemics , which stimulated the passing i26 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS into law of the first Public Health Act of 1848 and the Sanitary Act of 1866 . Organized sanitation , although started many years before the work of Koch , and having an empirical basis up to that time , was greatly increased when the bacterial origin of many diseases and the fact that they were often water- and milk-borne became established . It is indisputable that such diseases as cholera , malaria , plague , typhus , and typhoid fevers have practically disappeared as the result of improved sanitation and cleanliness . Of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as can be seen in Fig. 4 , there are now only occasional deaths from this fever in Britain , about four deaths per million of the population per annum . Nowadays there is , of course , no excuse even for this low figure . Let us now turn to the large group of diseases where increase in knowledge as the result of medical research has profoundly affected diagnosis , treatment , and prophylaxis . Roughly speaking , additional knowledge of disease has developed in modern times in three directions . The first large group includes those diseases due to the invasion of the body by protozoal , bacterial , and virus micro-organisms . From the study of these conditions a new branch of bacteriology known as immunology has emerged : a knowledge of active and passive immunity has provided medical men with the means to modify to a greater or less extent such bacterial diseases as diphtheria , // cerebro-spinal fever , measles , and scarlet fever . In the case of smallpox we have already seen that since the days of Jenner this could be prevented or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination . Recent work on measles shows also that even in this virus disease much of its deadliness can be avoided . In recent years it has been shown , for instance , that immune serum obtained from a child who has recovered from measles , or even adolescent serum , when injected into a child who has been exposed to infection , can either suppress the condition or greatly reduce its virulence , according to the desires of the doctor . Unless the child is under three years of age , or for other special reasons , the medical man does not wish to suppress the measles altogether , but to allow a slight attack , which in turn induces active immunity to any subsequent attack . How excellent such treatment is can be seen in some recent work by Dr. Gunn for the London County Council . In a series of three hundred and ninety-nine children inoculated with immune serum after exposure to infection not one child died , whereas in the control group , similarly exposed but not inoculated , 5 per cent died . Recent results also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown how effective this treatment can be in lessening the death-rate and lowering the incidence of their sequelae . The possibility of reducing the incidence of cz8 SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS middle-ear disease following measles and scarlet fever makes the modification of the course of these diseases especially important . It will be remembered that a great amount of deafness in this country is due to middle-ear disease , and until this serious condition can be suppressed the problem of deafness will remain . Methods for the substantial reduction at least of its incidence in measles and scarlet fever seem now to be available , and the general adoption of these methods is urgently needed . As regards protozoal diseases , another form of therapy has been introduced . I refer to the branch of therapeutics known as chemotherapy . In this connection we have , of course , salvarsan and its derivatives , specific remedies for syphilis , the use of which has greatly reduced not only syphilis but also the later syphilitic nervous manifestations , including general paralysis of the insane and tabes dorsalis or locomotor ataxia . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific remedy , has been to some extent replaced by another chemotherapeutic compound , namely , atebrine . In sleeping sickness Bayer 205 is very effective in the early stages . The second great group of diseases brought to light in recent years is that due to abnormalities of internal secretion . We have seen , for instance , cretinism and myxoedema cured by the active principle of the thyroid gland , namely , thyroxin , diabetes mellitus controlled by insulin , tetany // controlled by parathormone , the active principle of the parathyroid gland , Addison 's disease controlled by a substance obtained from the suprarenal cortex , and pernicious anaemia controlled by the anti-anaemic principle of liver . While it is impossible to discuss adequately , the great triumphs of medical science associated with this group of diseases , attention may be drawn to the fact that recently Dakin and West have obtained in pure or nearly pure form the anti-anaemic principle of liver curative of pernicious anaemia . One of the most striking therapeutic actions that can be seen in medicine is that which follows the injection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dakin and West 's substance into a patient lying almost moribund , suffering from pernicious anaemia . This small quantity injected once weekly will convert a patient within a few weeks into a normal person with good colour , and able to live a normal life . This branch of medical research is not only being actively pursued , but is one of the most promising . Anyone who has seen some of the physiological and pathological effects produced by the sex hormones oestrin , progestin , and androsterone , must have realized the unlimited possibilities that may result from progress in this branch of medicine . The third large group of diseases now amenable to medical treatment includes those due to nutritional defects . In the course of this work the necessary food factors known as vitamins have // been isolated , and in some cases their constitution determined . The result is that we now know a great deal about the aetiology of such diseases as rickets , defective teeth , susceptibility to infection and its relation to diet , scurvy , beri-beri , and disorders such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the development of this branch of medical science is that it is now accepted that diseases are not always due to the invasion of the body by a materies morbi agent , but are often due to the deficiency or excess of some chemical agent which is a normal and essential constituent of the body . Although it is only recently that this idea of the aetiology of disease has been established , it will be remembered by those acquainted with the history of medicine that the idea of the deficiency of a chemical substance being responsible for disease is by no means new . So long ago as 185o Chatin advanced the view that simple goitre was due to a deficient intake of iodine , and brought forward good evidence in its support . One of the sad chapters of medicine is that Chatin 's work , when repeated and examined by the French Academy of Sciences , was considered to be wrong because the members of the commission appointed did not think that such small amounts of iodine in food could ever have such a profound effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after 1895 , when Bauman showed that the thyroid gland contained iodine , PROGRESS IN MEDICAL SCIENCE r3i that Chatin 's original observations began to receive well-deserved recognition and confirmation . The aspect of medicine most strongly emphasized by work on the nutritional basis of disease is. its prophylactic or preventive side . Although it is true that such diseases as scurvy and beri-beri can be cured by the administration of a suitable dietary , it is more important to recognize that these diseases can be prevented if proper feeding is always practised . The same is true of rickets , a disease which I will consider later at somewhat greater length . I - wish to take this opportunity of saying a few words on the subject of prophylactic and curative , remedies , as there is much wrong-thinking , both in the medical profession and among the public , as to their relative merits and importance . A curative remedy , even if only of a temporary nature , is generally dramatic in its action . The disease is there at one moment and is relieved the next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case , however , of an effective method of preventive treatment the disease does not develop , and may be never thought of again , especially when the method of prophylaxis becomes a part of ordinary life . Now it requires but little contemplation to realize that of these two methods the second , namely , the prophylactic method , is far and away the better . By such means diseases can be completely swept // away , whereas in the second case , where curative remedies are used , the best that may happen is that life is prolonged , and the signs and symptoms of the disease mitigated or cured in individual people , but the disease is not eliminated . I wish therefore to point out that in any consideration of the treatment of disease it ought to be remembered that preventive treatment is the one to be aimed at , and its very success may be measured by the degree to which the original discovery is forgotten . One of the anomalies of medical research is that , up to a point , methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that condition . Of course , if we have sufficient knowledge of the cause of a particular disease we have at hand methods for both prevention and cure . But , short of this wider knowledge , we may be able to alleviate suffering and yet know little or nothing about the cause of the trouble , and , in other cases , we may know a great deal about a disease without having the particular knowledge to delay its progress or effect a cure . For instance , there are few diseases in the world that we know more about than cancer , yet our knowledge of methods for curing this disease is small , and of preventing it nil . On the other hand , in such diseases as diabetes and pernicious anaemia , of whose causes we have little or no knowledge , we can control their harmful effects by insulin and liver-active principle respectively , and restore the patient to a greatly improved condition . // I wish now to say a few words about a specific medical investigation , partly to illustrate how knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partly because it was this investigation that led to the recognition that , even in this country , where such a large variety of foodstuffs is available , there is much fundamentally wrong in the feeding habits of the people and much avoidable ill-health resulting therefrom . For centuries rickets has been a scourge in this and in many other civilized countries . Although it is now relatively rare in its worst forms in London , it is still common in many industrial towns in the north . As most people well know , it is a disease in which there is defective calcification of bones to such an extent that great deformity may be produced . Up till 1914 , or thereabouts , there were many views as to the cause of this disease , either of a dietetic , hygienic , infective , or internal secretory nature . The Encyclopaedia Britannica of 1911 ascribes rickets to the action of a toxin from the alimentary tract . Now anybody intending to find the cause of a disease of this nature would first ask himself whether the disease is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in animals , then the experimental method can be applied , and each possible cause can be tested in turn . An experimental investigation of this kind is , of course , impossible on human beings . It has long been known that young dogs sometimes // develop rickets . The first part of the inquiry , therefore , was to find conditions under which the disease could be constantly developed at will in young dogs . After much experimenting it was discovered that certain diets allowed the development of rickets , and that small changes in these diets prevented the condition . The basis of the experimental diet was as follows : Separated milk , 150 up to 250 c.c. daily . Fat , to grammes ; e.g. butter , olive oil , lard , or codliver oil . Orange juice , 5 c.c . Yeast , 5 to to grammes . Cereal , such as white flour , rice , oatmeal , maize , 100 up to 200 grammes . Lean meat , to to 20 grammes . It was discovered that , according to the type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did or did not develop . If , for instance , an animal fat such as suet or butter , or a fish fat , such as codliver oil , was included , no rickets resulted ; yet in other animals of the same litter receiving the same diet in which olive oil , linseed oil , peanut oil , or lard was included rickets developed . It was clear , therefore , that since the only variable in each experiment was the fat , some fats contained a substance which brought about hard bones , while other fats , especially the vegetable fats , did not contain this substance . This effective constituent was called at the time the calcifying // vitamin , and is now known as vitamin D. It is the property of vitamin D to bring about the deposition of the hardening substance , namely , calcium phosphate in growing bones ; when it is absent , even althouglr there may be plenty of calcium and phosphorus in the diet , the bones will be comparatively soft and deformed . Examination of the above dietary will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diet to test their relative effects . Thus , to a litter of puppies , all the ingredients may be given in the same amount , except that one puppy may receive white flour , another oatmeal , another rice , and so on . Now , if that is done , it will be found that , according to the type of cereal eaten , in the absence of sufficient vitamin D , the severity of the rickets that develops varies with the different cereals . It will be found , for instance , that oatmeal and maize produce very bad rickets , whereas the degree of rickets produced by white flour and rice is relatively less . These experiments show , therefore , that the development of rickets does not only depend upon a deficiency of vitamin D in the diet , but also on the amount and kind of cereal eaten . It is a surprising fact that those cereals which contain more calcium and phosphorus , such as oatmeal and maize , produce worse rickets than the cereals , such as white flour and rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially one of a deficiency of calcium and // phosphorus in the bones . This result was completely unexpected , and shows how impossible it is to arrive at the truth in biology by speculation , and that the only safe thing to do in any case is to test your ideas before accepting them , even when they appear self-evident . The above experimental work was then transferred to the study of teeth because it was noticed that the dietetic conditions which produced bad bones also produced defective teeth , and those responsible for good bone formation produced well-formed and regularly arranged teeth . From these studies we now know that such substances as milk , egg-yolk , cheese , cod-liver oil , and butter tend to produce perfect teeth , whereas the other class of substances , including oatmeal , maize , barley , bread , and rice , that is to say , the whole group of cereals , tend to produce badly formed teeth . Since the milk teeth of children , as in the case of many animals , are formed either in earliest life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching of these experiments is clear , namely , that in order to produce perfectly formed teeth the diet must be especially rich in the calcifying foods mentioned above at that time . The permanent teeth are formed from birth till full growth , and their degree of perfection is similarly controlled by the food eaten . It is known that the teeth of the average individual in this country are defective in structure , and this must mean that as a general rule the diet of children , // and even of the woman in pregnancy , is bad from the point of view of teeth and bone formation . It can be said with some certainty of prediction that until these dietary habits are altered the high incidence of dental decay and pyorrhoea will remain the scourge they are to-day , and it is only by insisting that far more milk , egg-yolk , cheese , butter , vegetables , etc. , are included in early dietaries , and less cereals are given , especially in infants and children , that they will be eliminated . I have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proper nutrition , but much more could be said on this subject , and , indeed , it is becoming clear that many of the physical , and possibly even mental defects so commonly found in this and other countries could be greatly reduced by the adoption of the dietetic principles above enunciated . It is this aspect of modern preventive medicine which will probably lead to a new standard of health among mankind . I have now completed my task , and given a brief survey of the advance of medical science throughout the ages , and more particularly of the spate of knowledge that has come in the last fifty years . Criticism has been directed in this lecture to the earlier attempts of mankind to deal with disease , and the great errors both of commission and omission which prevented the advance of knowledge have been pointed out . It is interesting to surmise what people will think // of our present-day efforts a thousand years hence . As a matter of fact , it is quite likely they will never think of this subject because disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to remember that there was a time in the world 's history when practically everybody suffered from some ailment or other . If , however , some antiquarian looks back and examines our literature , he will no doubt be interested in the fact that it was in this period of the world 's history that we first not only realized but applied in a practical way the idea that increase in knowledge comes rapidly by the so-called experimental method . He will probably wonder why we took so long in coming to this decision , and I have tried to give to-night some of the reasons for this long latent period . The danger is that we accept the existing situation without remembering the great effort which has been necessary on the part of mankind to arrive at our present point of view . Never again must we return to the condition where speculation without experiment holds sway . There are many things associated with presentday health questions which will cause amusement to our antiquarian philosopher . He will no doubt , for instance , entertain his friends with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either because he thinks it right or because patients demand it , supplies many people coming under his care with a large series of remedies , including a bottle of medicine , a gargle , // a dusting powder , and an ointment . If , however , he laughs at this , what will he think of the present situation in this country when he sees a land flooded with that type of food which is probably more essential than any other single factor for the promotion of good health , but under such conditions that many people can not get it ? I refer especially to the position of milk in this country at the present time . When he sees , for instance , that it is possible for a manufacturer of umbrella handles and buttons to obtain large supplies of milk at the price of 5d. a gallon at a time when it is impossible to obtai.i the same milk for infant feeding at less than 2s. 4d. a gallon , he will no doubt wonder whether the country had any sanity about it at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident . It is all so foolish that it can not possibly continue for long . When we once realize the value of proper feeding , especially in early life , the improvement in the public health will be so evident that its adoption will remain permanent just as improved sanitation and cleanliness have established themselves . At the present time , as regards the general problem of medical investigation and the accession of new knowledge , it can be said that the pace is quickening , and facts are accumulating faster and faster , and there seems to be no limit to the possibilities of discovery which will follow the present methods of investigation . So fast , indeed , is the progress that in preventive medicine , at c ? o SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS least , the administrative officer finds it difficult to keep pace . It would be good if we all realized that we are passing through a golden age of medical science , and I hope that one , and probably the main , outcome of this lecture will be to impress upon all of us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. HALDANE F.R.S . CHAPTER V HUMAN GENETICS AND HUMAN IDEALS THE object of the Halley Stewart Trust is the investigation of the application of Christian ideals in social life . There is perhaps a certain conflict between science and Christian ideals , and in some cases I think that it is a real conflict . Where that is so I can say without hesitation that I am in favour of science . But in certain cases the support of science is claimed for ideals which were there long before science , and which Christi-anity claims to have superseded by nobler ideals . To-day very remarkable demands are being made in the name of biology in this country , and also to a much greater extent in certain foreign countries . I want to examine two theories which may be briefly stated as follows . The first is the theory that racial health necessitates the sterilization of the unfit . The second is the theory that some races are superior to others , whose members are in-capable of rising to the highest levels possible to humanity . These two theories are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second , I think , we may say is definitely anti-Christian . It is inconsistent with the views which St. Paul took in the First Epistle to the Corinthians . The first // theory , that concerned with sterilization , has been formally condemned by the present Pope , but it is , I think , less obviously opposed to Christian ideals , and it is held by a fair number not merely of Christians , but of idealistic Christians . Perhaps they are not always aware of the consequences to which it leads . Both of those theories are based to a consider-able extent on an analogy with the principles which are known to hold in the breeding of domestic animals . I shall consider later how far that analogy is applicable , and what important differences exist in the actual application of the laws of heredity to man on the one hand and to domestic animals on the other . But , before doing so , I wish to examine the evidence for the first theory , namely , that the sterilization of the unfit is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormality called lobster claw or split foot , in which the // hand is reduced to an appendage with one thumb and one finger , and the foot is similarly deformed . It will be seen that this condition is transmitted , with one doubtful exception , only by affected persons , and to approximately one-half of their children , without regard to sex . In scientific terminology we say that it is due to an autosomal dominant gene . It is clear at once , from looking at a pedigree of this kind , that , if all the affected persons were sterilized , the abnormality would be wiped out in one generation , with possibly very rare exceptions due to a process called mutation , by which the abnormal gene arises anew . That process is so rare that it certainly does not happen more often than in one person per hundred millions or so . So , by this measure of sterilization , we could practically abolish that complaint ; but , be it noted , it would have the effect of preventing the birth of as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest possible type of inheritance . It applies to a fair number of other conditions . Some of them , such as nightblindness , diabetes insipidus , and brachydactyly ( short fingers ) , are more or less troublesome , but neither dangerous to life nor disabling . Until the rest of humanity has been greatly improved there need be no serious objection to the breeding of such persons . Others are more serious . For example , cleidocranial dysostosis is an abnormality of the skeleton involving invalidism of a // greater or less degree . Neurofibromatosis is a disease characterized by skin tumours , which frequently become cancerous . These , and a number of similar diseases rarely , if ever , skip a generation . It would appear that sterilization of the unfit would abolish them . However , recent work has shown that in the more dangerous of these diseases such a hope is vain . They would disappear as the result of natural selection were it not that sporadic new cases constantly appear as the result of mutation . Hence sterilization ( or other measures to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not all , of the cases . At any rate , no eugenic measure , except the prevention of breeding by unfit persons , is called for . Unfortunately , things are not always so simple . Let us take the case of hereditary brittleness of the bones , such as occurs in some families . In a severe case dozens of fractures may occur , some even before birth , and the sufferers are hopeless cripples . Now in these families all the brittleboned members have blue sclerotics , that is to say , what in normal people are the whites of the eyes are of a dull bluish-grey colour . Vision is normal , but deafness is common . Blue sclerotics are due to an autosomal dominant gene , and are handed down to half the progeny , without skipping a generation . Fig. 2 is the pedigree of a family in which that defect occurs . The black symbols there represent HUMAN GENETICS AND HUMAN IDEALS x persons with blue sclerotics . The letters F and D refer to their more serious abnormalities . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tics had multiple fractures and others were deaf , while two were affected in both ways . But a very considerable number of persons with blue sclero tics escaped from either of those complaints , although in their children the blue sclerotics might be associated with bone fragility or deaf ness . If we were to control breeding so as to wipe out those conditions , we should have not only to prevent the breeding of the deaf people and the people with brittle bones , but we should have to say that anyone in that family with blue sclerotics ought to be sterilized because their children might have brittle bones . In other words , // we should have to extend our principle of sterilization not only to the unfit , but to the fit . Indeed , in a disease of this type sterilization of the fit is much more important than that of the unfit , because it is fairly obvious that people with multiple fractures due to brittle bones are not likely to breed to any very great extent . If we were to apply sterilization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy child at the sacrifice of two or more healthy ones . A good number of diseases are inherited in the same way . Among them is pre-senile cataract ; that is to say , cataract affecting people in their youth or middle age . In most of the hereditary cases the descent is through affected persons , but if you study the pedigrees you find that many of the affected persons marry before the disease has manifested itself . Several other eye diseases , such as hereditary glaucoma , show the same phenomenon . Huntingdon 's chorea is a very terrible affliction of the nervous system , leading to involuntary movements , and often ending up in madness , which is transmitted , as far as we know , only through affected persons . But the mean age of incidence of that disease is thirtyfive years , and sometimes it does not appear until sixty or seventy , although it may develop in early youth . Therefore , a great many of the sufferers have married and produced children before the disease has manifested itself . In the present state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disease would be to prevent the breeding not merely of affected persons but of their children , because they might very well develop the disease after marriage , and after having had children themselves . It is clear , then that the apparently simple principle of sterilization of the unfit , like so many simple principles , if pushed to its logical conclusion , carries you rather further than appears at first sight . Now let us take a different type of inheritance , the so-called sex-linked inheritance . Fig. 3 is a pedigree of haemophilia , a disease practically confined to males , in which the blood does not clot normally , and which may lead to very serious consequences . There are two forms of it , the mild form shown in Fig. 3 and the severe form shown in Fig. 4 . The principles of inheritance // are the same in both . It is never , or very rarely , handed down by an affected male to his sons or to his daughters . Nevertheless , the daughters , though not the sons , hand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen that in one case in Fig. 3 it has been transmitted from the male at the top through no less than five generations of women before it finally affected the male at the right-hand bottom corner . The more usual type of pedigree is that of Fig. q. , in which the vast majority of males do not live long enough to have any children . Preventing the males from breeding would have done very little good for the simple reason that the majority // of them died in childhood , and therefore were cut off before they could have any children . One may add that in this particular case the operation of sterilization of an affected male would probably lead to death through haemorrhage . The question then arises whether the women who are carriers should be sterilized . There is a case for it . But supposing we . were to sterilize all mothers and daughters of haemophilics we should prevent the coming into the world of three perfectly healthy children for every unhealthy one . If we extended it to their sisters we should prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children for every unhealthy one . I do not know where we are to stop in a case like that . One would certainly stop at the sacrifice of a hundred healthy children to prevent the birth of one diseased one . I want to point out , though , that it is an extremely difficult problem . It is not one which can be decided on any simple principles . Further , no amount of sterilization would wipe out haemophilia altogether . The deaths of haemophilics are unfortunately compensated for by the sporadic appearance of the gene through mutation , so that the frequency of the disease remains fairly constant . Probably at least a quarter of all cases are sporadic , and could not be avoided by any eugenic measures at present available . This does not , of course , mean that eugenic measures would be useless . // A fair number of other diseases are inherited in the same manner as haemophilia , some , like colour-blindness , being trivial , others of varying severity . In some cases the disease is mainly confined to males , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of the women transmitters of Figs. 3 and q. , manifest the disease . In this class are hereditary optic atrophy , one of the causes of blindness , and anidrosis , in which the sweat glands are absent and the teeth defective . In all the cases so far considered there is a sense at least in which one can speak of the affection as hereditary . It is handed down sometimes from parent to offspring , sometimes from grandfather to grandson , skipping a generation , and so on . We now come to a group of diseases which are congenitally determined , but are not hereditary in the ordinary sense . These abnormalities are due to what are called autosomal recessive genes . A person carrying one such gene is entirely normal , but a person carrying two is abnormal . In most cases the abnormal gene seems to be a more or less completely inactive form of the normal one . In a person with two abnormal genes some important function is not performed at all , or is performed very inefficiently . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as ( to use a possibly slightly misleading analogy ) one kidney can do the work of two , so that a man may go // through life with a single kidney and never know it . The majority ( or in some cases all ) of the abnormal persons arise from the union of two parents , each of whom carries a concealed normal gene ? heterozygotes , as they are called . Fig. s is a pedigree of juvenile amaurotic idiocy . The victims of this disease are born normal . At the age of about six they gradually go blind . They then become progressively idiotic . They are generally hopeless idiots by fourteen , and dead before they are twenty . In Fig. 5 it has been necessary to show both spouses in the marriages because both may be concerned in transmission . The fathers of the idiots were brothers , and each married a cousin . The recessive gene was handed down to the parents of the idiots from one of the two spouses shown at the left-hand top corner . 154 . SCIENTIFIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who went through all the schools for blind children in Sweden , and probably detected almost all the cases in that country , 155 in all . The proportion of children destined to develop the disease is about 38 per million . In the general population the frequency of first-cousin marriages is about i per cent . Among the parents of idiots of this kind it is i S per cent ; while at least another lo per cent are blood relations of some kind . A further calculation shows that roughly one Swede in one hundred is a heterozygote for this gene , that is to say , carries one gene for juvenile amaurotic idiocy , which can only be detected if he or she has children by a similar spouse . Now , apart from inbreeding , only one heterozygote in a hundred will marry another heterozygote . That is to say , one marriage in ten thousand will yield idiots if enough children are born , the average proportion being one quarter . Thus one in forty thousand or twenty-five per million would develop this form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heterozygote marries a blood relation the chance that the spouse is also a heterozygote is much increased . Genes of this type cause a good many very serious abnormalities . It is clear that sterilization of the unfit would be entirely ineffective in this case , since there is no record of a victim of this disease ever producing children . Sterilization of heterozygotes is also impossible , both because // there are far too many of them for it to be practicable , and because the vast majority of them are undetected . There are two methods available for dealing with this type of disease . The first is to prevent or discourage the parents of children who have ever produced an abnormal child of that type from having further children , either by allowing divorce between them or otherwise . The second method is to discourage inbreeding . Curiously enough , the only body in this country which does discourage inbreeding is the Catholic Church , which is strongly opposed to many other eugenic measures . It is not the case that by preventing the marriage of first or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar diseases , but you could do a good deal . For example , of the cases of congenital deaf mutism a fraction , varying in different countries , of between 20 and 40 per cent are the children of first cousins . Of the victims of retinitis pigmentosa , a disease which accounts for about I or 2 per cent of blindness in this country , about one-third are the children of first cousins . Among the parents of children suffering from a very terrible disease , xeroderma pigmentosum , a skin affection which usually ends up in cancer before the age of fifteen , something like half are close blood relations . As regards physical defects , therefore , two types of eugenic measure are desirable : first , // to discourage the breeding of affected persons , and , in some cases , of certain of their relatives , and secondly to discourage inbreeding in general . The relative importance of those two measures depends on the relative frequency in the population of dominant abnormalities ; that is to say , abnormalities which are handed down by affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recessive abnormalities , that is to say , abnormalities which show up mainly as a result of inbreeding . Unfortunately , we know very little as to the relative frequency of these two types of abnormalities in man . My colleague , Dr. Gordon , in a population of wild flies , found that something like 5o per cent of the individuals carried a recessive gene of some kind , which , although the flies themselves were perfectly normal , showed up if their progeny were strictly inbred . But we can not argue with any certainty from that analogy to man . We can only say that , in the majority of animals so far studied , most abnormalities are recessive , that is to say , of the type brought out by inbreeding , rather than dominant , that is to say , of the type directly handed down . It is perfectly possible that man is exceptional in that respect . It is , to my mind , of very considerable importance that we should know whether or not man is an exception before we frame any thoroughgoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex-linked // recessives , that is to say , characters which are handed down to a marked degree by affected persons , six possibilities are open . The first is to discourage their marriage , and the second is to forbid it ; the third , to encourage married chastity . The fourth is to encourage birth control by affected persons ; the fifth to encourage their voluntary sterilization ; and the sixth to encourage their compulsory sterilization . Now I would suggest there is at least a case to be made out for trying the milder measures before the severer ones , and the voluntary measures before the compulsory ones . In the case of mental defect some is unquestionably due to nurture , to injury at birth , to diseases of various kinds , and to faulty pre-natal environment . Some , again , is due to the recessive genes of the type which I have described . Only a small proportion is due to dominant genes ; that is to say , only a small proportion of our registered mental defectives are themselves the children of defectives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or both of whose parents were certified mental defectives . Of those children only twenty-five , or 7 per cent , were themselves either attending special schools for defectives or under examination for such schools . The others were on the whole below the average in intelligence but by no means grossly so , and how far this may have been due to their unsatisfactory family environment it is difficult to say . Penrose , one // of the authorities on the subject , takes the view that about 5 per cent of our mental defectives have one or both parents defective . Others give a somewhat larger percentage . I think it is very difficult to suppose that the sterilization of all mental defectives would lower the percentage in the next generation by as much as 15 per cent . Some writers and speakers on the subject corn-pletely neglect the role of inbreeding . There are a few facts which suggest that inbreeding may be of considerable importance . In children in an eastern county investigated by Russell , of thirty awarded free places the parents of two were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence quotient of less than eighty , that is to say , definitely backward children , the parents of twenty-five were born in the same village . If that is a general rule , I think it suggests that the rural motor-omnibus service may be quite an important eugenic agency . There is very general agreement that mental defectives are not likely to make good parents , whether or not they hand on their condition by biological processes to their children . But I am strongly of opinion that , in their own interests , mental defectives should be segregated . It is said that mental defectives are often capable of earning a living , and of playing a useful part of some kind in society . I take the view that any person who , in the present conditions of unemployment , is able to keep a job and be of use to society , should // not be rated as a mental defective , even though he may not be quite as intelligent as some of ourselves . The sterilization of mental defectives as an alternative to their segregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How far any given economy is necessary is not for a biologist to state ; but a biologist may , I think , point out that the demand for the sterilization of such persons is primarily made on economic and not on biological grounds . It is worth while examining the origin of the belief that sterilization or similar methods would go far to solve social problems . First , I think , comes the false analogy with domestic animals . In domestic animals we select in the most rigid manner for desirable characters by castrating or killing a large majority of males , by only breeding from selected females , and , above all , by fixing such characters as we have got by fairly close inbreeding .
