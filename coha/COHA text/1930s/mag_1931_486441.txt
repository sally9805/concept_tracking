MAN being deluded and curtained from truth all his days , and mocked by error from his cradle to his grave , what does it boot for him to declare , in so many thousands , or hundreds , of words , that which he believes ? For be sure that what he believes will be as nonsensical as that which he doubts ; in any case , I am sure that so it is with me . Deceived by myself and continually deluded by others , I must needs  --  as Sir Thomas Browne so aptly declares  --  be stuffed with errors and overrun with falsities ; for we are all " within the line of Vulgarity , and Democratical enemies of truth . " Nevertheless , we must and do believe this and that ; we must , here and there , trust the opinions of others , or even of our own selves . For my part , I am a great believer . I believe  --  for they have always told me so  --  that the earth is an oblate spheroid which circles most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space . I believe ? for they now tell me so , and who am I that I should question it ? ? that this space curves ; I believe it , but I know . The fifth of a series of articles on this subject by well-nown men and women . Others will appear in subsequent issues. ? Entroil THE NATION.not what it means . I believe , one after the other , all those peculiar statements made to us about the universe which we appear to inhabit  --  appear , I say , for I know not if there be any truth in this notion that we exist , or inhabit anywhere . I do not know , but I accept and believe . It does me no good to consider it all over-much , for my brain reels and turns giddy at the contemplation of space , universes , stars , eternity , and the like ; the extraordinary doings in the heavens quite overset my frail intelligence . I turn from them with pleasure to " this orchard-plot of earth , floating unknown , far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am willing to accept the odd hypothesis that , however we got here , here we are , dwelling precariously with the other animals on our oblate sphere , our orchard-plot ; somewhat tragically  --  albeit also farcically  --  entangled in a mesh of affairs , of relationships , of meetings , partings , loves , hates , laughters , tears , excitements , strivings , dark and bright imaginations , dreams , lusts , passions , anguishes , and joys . But really , when asked what do you believe about it all , I am hard put to it what to reply . The Greek philosophers and the Roman , the Hebrew poets and the Syriac , the Christian Fathers , the medieval scholastics , the great preachers , the natural and the political scientists , the theologians , physicists , biologists , moralists , economists , poets , and doctrinaires , of all countries and of all times , have not hesitated nor scrupled to declare nobly and eloquently what they believed ; but who am I , that I should have the face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings , however puny , uninstructed , or obscure , have always claimed to themselves this right , and have ever piped shrilly into the ears of their unheeding fellows their little creeds . Well , then , I will pipe mine . I am encouraged in this articulation by having just heard H. G. Wells , in whom I do certainly believe , saying over the ether that those who can give no answer to the inquiry , what would they do with the world if they were dictators , are not fit to vote at elections . Alas , I can give no such answer , and have always been aware that I do not deserve a vote . Still , I have a few beliefs . I believe , for instance , that ignorance , vulgarity , and cruelty are the three black jungle horrors which have always beset and entangled man , and hindered him from rising even higher above the apes than he has yet done . Ignorance , that brutish stupidity which , content in its own indolent and know-nothing apathy , its imbecile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard-won results of the intellectual strivings of the few , or , worse , rejects these with ridicule or inane contempt  --  it is this stupidity and ignorance that has , from the beginnings of the human tragi-comedy upon our planet , wrecked truth , stoned and burned the truth-tellers , suffered delusion gladly , flung old women into flames for witches , gone on its way indolently , bound in its own indifference and sloth , like the other brutes that perish . Throw mankind a new and strange idea , an idea that is counter to its habits , traditions , or what not , and the majority will claw and chaw it to pieces in stupid anger , derision , fear , or contempt , as wild beasts will tear any strange object flung into their den . A minority will , on the other hand , seize it and toy with it , making themselves foolish with adulation of a thing they do not understand , but only relish because it is new and strange ; they will swear by it , though they lack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true or false . And only a very tiny fraction of mankind will understand a new thing and accept or reject it with their reasons . As to that , it is only the few who understand even the old things . It is very obvious that no one understands enough of political science to make a good society of states , enough political economy to preserve countries and societies from ruin , enough about life to make others happy or themselves , or even to discover what life is , and why . We are ignorant of our own natures , of our destinies , our origins , and our position in the universe . We can not even manage and tame this unruly globe upon which we so precariously exist ; ruin and famine skulk perpetually like ghosts at our feasts ; the sword of war ever hangs on a thread above our heads , and , ignorantly and wantonly , we cut the thread . All we can say of men 's ignorance is that some men are less ignorant than other men . And it must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , and have always been , even more ignorant than the bulk of men . Certainly far less well instructed , in the past , by their educators and bylife ; certainly also , I think , less intelligent . Some say that this will mend in time ; others say no , that it never will quite mend , since women have the poorer brains . This is probably so . After all , women are physically less and frailer in every part and capacity , and it is not likely that the brain should be excepted . Let it be admitted that the female sex in humanity is the less tough and robust , mentally , nervously , and physically , the less fitted to endure strain and hardness , to create , to initiate , to organize , and to perform . The stupidity of such women as have received little learning is a heavy retarding weight on the world 's progress . The stupidity and ignorance of most mothers : these are even greater than the stupidity and ignorance of most fathers , and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupidity is human- vulgarity . Our cheap , silly , common , sentimental outlook ; our aptitude for listening to and approving trash , cant , and coarseness ; our love of the short and facile way ; our tolerance of the popular claptrap press , popular claptrap oratory , popular claptrap literature and art ; our instinctive taste , furtive or admitted , for the ugly , the gross , the coarse ; our boredom with erudition or abstruse knowledge ; our inaptness to mark and marvel at beauty ; our devastating of the lovely face of earth with our atrocious edifices ; our gossip , our scandalmongering , our lewd uncivilization ; what forces are these , against which climbing humanity has to contend ! Strange enough it is that , in the same race of mammal bipeds , this stupid , barbarous vulgarity should thrive side by side with learning , wit , civilization , philosophy , beauty , poetry , art , science , genius , generosity , nobility , courage , elegance , and the highest dreams of the imagination . Strange indeed , but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vulgar up to the plane of the fine ? The vulgar human being , I mean , and also the vulgarian who lurks in even the highest and the finest individuals ? Here is , indeed , a task for the enterprising social reformer  --  to intellectualize and to refine barbarity . A cultivated , intelligent , and generous democracy  --  this was Aristotle 's ideal , and it is , I suppose , ours ; only Aristotle had more hope than we have that it might be attainable . For even if we could all be raised , by instruction , out of ignorance and out of vulgarity , it would take more than instruction to raise us out of cruelty . The cruelty of the savage , which drives us in crowds to see men and women tortured and burnt to death in the market place ; which lately enough drove the majority , and today drives enough to suggest that it may be but lack of the provision of such shows  --  at least in most civilized countries  --  which keeps the majority from witnessing them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gloating. mobs outside the walls of places of execution when some wretched criminal is dragged to his doom . The public can not now witness this fine sport , but many of them press as near to it as is permitted , licking their lips over the imagination of it . Then there is the cruelty , also of the savage , which derides any difference from the tribe , which stares and smiles at physical or mental oddity ; the cruelty of the strong to the helpless , the man to the beast , the adult to the child , the rich to the poor ; the cruelty of negligence , no less than that of deliberation  --  what has ever eradicated , or will ever eradicate , all this ? All one can say of it is that it has decreased , and does , indeed , appear to be decreasing , among the more civilized portions of the human race . No longer , except in the savage lands of Russia , Poland , and those other European states which lie to eastward , fringing our more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive ferocities , no longer do we in Europe allow public executions and torture . No longer do we flog men and women to death , set them in pillories , drown , burn , quarter , rack , break them on the wheel . When rumors reach us of the somewhat ferocious unkindnesses perpetrated by races less gentle , we are startled and shocked , we organize rescues and protests , we compile reports , we term " atrocities " what our ancestors took for granted as necessary penal severities . No longer do we hang children , incarcerate misdemeanants in gaols where rats companion them and slime oozes from the walls ; we make provision for poverty and age ; any child left like a dropped package in the streets is sure of care ; we have homes for strayed dogs and cats . Yes , we are certainly advanced in humanity . Yet still we are cruel ; still we let people want when we can give ; still we take ? one another 's lives , purses , reputations , for our pleasure ; there are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the cure for the world ? Education , we glibly say , and proceed to capture infants and pour this medicine down their reluctant throats . But too often it is medicine of small potency administered by physicians of small skill , who lack the power either to make up their prescriptions well , or to see that they are palatable , so that they prove of little profit enough to the imbiber . How fortify a human being against ignorance or vulgarity by telling him that Lisbon is the capital of Portugal , and that 11 times 12 is 132 ? How teach him to understand the excitement of history by reading to him an account of the tedious enactments of foolish parliaments long dissolved , of foolish monarchs long fallen into deserved and tragical deaths ? How cleave the magic paths into literature through the somewhat unillumined minds and unmelodious , ugly accents of its average teachers ? It is possible , also , that education through books is not profitable to all minds , and that many children would evolve more pleasingly if taught only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tend animals and grow plants , or to work machinery . Does it necessarily refine and raise their intelligences to know some of the more prominent facts in the history of men , to be able to do the rule of three , to write and read words on paper ? Consider to what vulgarities they would be perforce oblivious could they , for instance , not read words at all . There is quite a case against universal schooling ; but I think a stronger case for it . Some will say that it is all a matter of finding the right mode of education and that we should be perpetually casting about to see what will work . Others will say that education of whatsoever nature has its strict limits , and can not do more for a human being than the human being 's limitations , disposition , intelligence , and natural bias will permit , and that it is , after all , the character with which men come into the world that counts . Others , again , regard religion as the tonic medicine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be , were more people apt at this difficult endeavor of the spirit . Religion in history has achieved tremendous things . It has purified lives ; turned brains ; made revolutions and wars ; overturnedkingdoms ; drenched continents in blood ; reared cathedrals to heaven ; sent adventurers to the ends of the earth ; shut them in cells for life ; furthered , preserved , and cramped education ; obstructed science ; stimulated and hindered literature ; swept like a wind over communities , swaying them like grass ; set martyrs aflame  --  which entailed two fiery convictions , that of those who lit the flames and that of those who walked into them ; freed slaves ; delivered the oppressed ; drowned souls in prayer and mystic illumination ; made death seem sweet , seem terrible , seem nothing ; broken beauty in pieces ; imposed intolerable systems on men ; stung them to splendid visions ; veiled the stars ; lit the heavens . What religion will effect in any given individual , society , or emergency is always , until it has been tried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like liquids , it is apt to take the shape of the vessels into which it is poured ; it settles into a man 's being as a lake lies between its banks , molded by the shape and limits of his brain , temperament , and physique . The religion assimilated by one man will assume an entirely different form , and have utterly different results , from the religion of another , even if it starts by being the same religion  --  as the history of religion has always shown . Compare , for instance , the Christianity of Christ with that of Torquemada , of Cotton Mather , of the vision-seeing monks and nuns , of the modern fundamentalists of the American Middle West . Religion can do no more for a man than the man will permit it to do . Religion at its best is a force for good beyond calculation ; but how often is it at its best , as absorbed by the human race ? What part should and will this strange , tremendous force play in civilization ? All I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given its chance , and that it might take it and help to stand between man and the wreckage of his world . It might , and it should , be on the side of the poor and the oppressed ; of virtue , freedom , courage , intelligence , unselfishness , ethical progress , and peace ; of learning , culture , decency , and civilization . But in what form it should be taught and delivered , this is too difficult a riddle for me to guess . The approach of humanity to its gods is a delicate business , all too easily coarsened and mechanized , once it tries to express itself outside the silent communings of the soul , and outside the treading of that funambulatory path of virtue which the soul believes to be enjoined . Religion is a two-edged weapon ; it can do more good and more harm than almost any other one thing . Properly understood , assimilated , and followed , Christianity might still redeem the world ; muffled , distorted , and warped to men 's desires , capacities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small hope . Here seems a matter for the churches , and for religious believers outside the churches , to take drastically in hand . Meanwhile , what of the night ? Our watchmen can tell us little , except that it looks black . Possibly they are too much addicted to regarding mainly the darkness . For my part , I see , on our lovely orchard-plot , with its meadows and its moon , its genius and its dreams , its gaiety and its abundance of human good-will , its valiant , adventuring , and amused humanity , enough light for hope to travel by . After all , what a spectacle is this , to which we are all admitted free ! I believe that it is an entertainment worth our grave and deeply interested attention .
