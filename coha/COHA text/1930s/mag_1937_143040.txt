In convention at Springfield , Ill. last week assembled the National Federation of Federal Employes , an independent union competing with A. F. of L. and C. I. O. for the nation 's 800,000 Government employes . To the N. F. F. E. delegates President Roosevelt dispatched a message , conceding the place of Government unions in the U. S. Labor picture but sternly warning : " Militant tactics have no place in the function of an organization of Government employes . . . . Such action looking forward to the paralysis of Government by those who have sworn to support it is unthinkable and intolerable . " <P> The President 's dictum was hardly in print before a group of Government employes struck-not in Washington , not in the U. S. , but aboard ship on the River Plate off Montevideo , Uruguay . The crew of the S. S. Algic , a 5,496-ton freighter owned by Joseph Patrick Kennedy 's National Maritime Commission , refused to help unload cargo onto a lighter in midstream . Uruguayan longshoremen were on strike against employment of non-union labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabid unionists , the Algic 's seamen swore they would not work with scab longshoremen until the River Plate froze solid. * <P> Seamen may strike when a ship is docked in the home port . But once a ship has sailed , to strike is mutiny . In Montevideo last week the Algic 's Captain Joseph Gainard reported his plight to the U. S. Vice Consul , who went aboard , harangued the mutineers for an hour . Still they refused to unload ship . So Captain Gainard and the Vice Consul shot a cable to the owners . <P> Back to Captain Gainard from the Maritime Commission went a terse message which looked as if it had had the personal attention of Chairman Kennedy : <P> " Instruct crew to proceed with your lawful orders . If they still refuse warn crew that all still refusing to perform duty will be placed in irons and prosecuted to full extent of law on return to United States . If they still refuse , place ringleaders in irons . If other crew members still refuse duty , have them removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if not , foreign seamen . In case you experience any difficulty , request assistance local authorities . Report developments . " <P> The crew swiftly returned to duty . Meantime in Washington Chairman Kennedy , stealing a phrase from his boss , declared : " The Maritime Commission takes the position that the action of the crew is unlawful . It also takes the position that in this particular case such an act constitutes a strike against the Government . Neither situation can be tolerated . " <P> <P> *It never freezes , even in July or August ( midwinter in South America ) .
