Half-masted last week was the flag of the New York Stock Exchange in memory of its most famed member-John Davison Rockefeller . Only once did Mr. Rockefeller ever enter the Exchange . That was in 1883 when he bought his seat , the rules-requiring his personal apearance before the admissions committee . But his membership , entitling him to low commissions , saved him vast sums in his personal transactions . He paid $30,000 for his seat , saw it sink to $15,500 in the 1890s , rise to $625,000 in the 19205 , sink again to the current figure , $91,000 . When the membership was enlarged in 1929 , he sold his " right " for $125,000 , more than four times his original investment . <P> The Exchange 's constitution provides death benefits for members deceased-$15 from each surviving member . Last week small-trading members whose summer budgets were already a problem had to deduct their shares of $20,000 or so for the estate of the man who made more money than any man who ever lived . Efficient budgeteers were prepared for this contingency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die every year .
