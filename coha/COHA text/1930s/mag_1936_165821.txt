Sir Ronald Lindsay , the moose-tall Ambassador at Washington of His Britannic Majesty , eschewed last week each of his many opportunities to correct or deny the extraordinary dispatches which hourly arrived from London concerning Edward VIII , by the Grace of God , of Great Britain , Ireland and the Dominions Beyond the Seas , King , Defender of the Faith , Emperor of India . <P> The British Ambassador might have taken exception to the Washington Post 's assertion that King Edward " plans to marry " Mrs. Ernest Simpson . Or Sir Ronald might have objected to the United Press story carried from coast to coast by the Scripps-Howard chain under headlines the entire width of the page : <P> " CHURCH HEADS SNUB KING EDWARD " <P> " 2 PRELATES SHUN PARTY ATTENDED BY MRS . SIMPSON " <P> " British Ruler Blushes and Appears Distressed at Private Conference with Archbishops of Canterbury and York " <P> " BALDWIN SAID TO HAVE DEVELOPED HOSTILITY TOWARD HIS MAJESTY " <P> If there were any doubt about all this , the British Embassy might have set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving Peake Johnson , D.

They were placed in a position in which they had to choose between their conscience and expediency . It is to their credit that they had the courage to witness to our Lord 's command . " <P> Undenied by any British source , the story of the King and Mrs. Simpson last week was blunt and simple . Under English law a man who makes a trip in company with another man 's wife , the two stopping at the same hotels , has in fact given the husband opportunity to sue the wife for divorce on the ground of adultery . The King has just made an extended yachting trip in company with Mrs. Simpson , and notably in Vienna they stopped at the same hotel ( TIME , Sept. 21 ) . But Mr. Simpson , as a loyal British subject , could not institute proceedings for divorce in which His Majesty might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what any disgruntled English husband does who wishes to spare his wife 's name . <P> The usual procedure is for the husband to register with a hired corespondent at an English hotel , the staff of which are familiar with their jobs . When the wife brings the suit for divorce , hotelmen testify that the husband and the corespondent spent the night together in the same room and were registered on the blotter as man &; wife . Needless to say , in such sordid circumstances any actual commission of adultery is usually omitted by the husband , whose mood is apt to be one of bitterness at a divorce system which many British jurists and prelates have denounced as " revolting " and " unfair . " Last week Mrs. Simpson filed such a divorce suit against Mr. Simpson in the rural Ipswich Court of Assizes . Under English law , she must appear in court and prove that she is herself of good character , for in England , if it can be shown that husband and wife have each committed adultery , then neither can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been described as Holy Deadlock and supplied the title for a novel of that name by Funster A.
