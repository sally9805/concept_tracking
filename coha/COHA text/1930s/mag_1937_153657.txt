When news got out eight weeks ago that the Democratic National Committee had sold souvenir campaign books-bound in leather and autographed by the President - for $250 each , and that some of the $700,000 worth of books had been bought by corporations , which are not allowed to contribute to campaign funds , Republican Representative Bertrand H. Snell naturally demanded an investigation ( TIME , June 21 ) . Last week , while Representative Snell 's resolution remained securely pigeonholed by the House Rules Committee , the subject of the campaign books cropped up again , this time in the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce investigation of the Van Sweringen railway system . By the time the railroad investigation got back on the track , the campaign books had taken up the better part of three days ' hearings , made most of their headlines , been threshed out almost as thoroughly as they would have been in an investigation of their own . <P> Star witness when the Committee resumed hearings last week after a month 's interval , during which its chairman , Montana 's Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Broker Robert R. Young of Manhattan . Most sensational development of the week was that 40 year-old Broker Young , who with his partners Kirby and Kolbe acquired control of the huge Van Sweringen railroad empire by buying a majority in Alleghany Corp . for a mere $6,000,000 , had less shrewdly spent $15,000 for 60 campaign books which he had then " scattered all over Texas and Oklahoma among my friends and relatives . " Said unhappy Broker Young , whose presence in Washington had forced his wife to curtail plans for a huge dinner dance in their Newport , R. I. country house : " I would have taken soap wrappers if they had been offered to me . " <P> The solicitors from whom Broker Young would gladly have purchased $15,000 worth of soap wrappers were a group of pressure salesmen who got a 50% commission on campaign book sales . Senator Wheeler read a letter from Manhattan Lawyer Watson Washburn who said he had been notified that one of the salesmen who had approached Broker Young was one N. M. Lichtblau . Wrote Lawyer Washburn : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Eva J. Hurst , we have been searching unsuccessfully for two years to find one Nat Lichtblau who it appears was one of a gang of high-pressure salesmen who secured by misrepresentation our client 's last $12,000 worth of securities . " Senator Wheeler suggested that Lawyer Washburn ask the Democratic National Committee about Lichtblau 's " whereabouts and antecedents . " <P> Although Senator Wheeler grumbled because Broker Young had not ousted leftovers from the Van Sweringen regime and complained that U. S. railroads are controlled by men who lack practical experience , the net summation of a week 's rail-road investigation was the chairman 's sharp comment on the campaign books . Said he : " . . . I resent the Democratic Committee going to people just prior to their coming here , and soliciting funds . . . . It might give the impression that people had to give money to get proper treatment . . . . "
