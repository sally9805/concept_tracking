After twelve days of fierce fighting Rebel Generalissimo Francisco Franco 's " win-the-war " offensive against Catalonia temporarily slowed down last week . At week 's end the red- gold Insurgent flag flew over two sizable new bulges of terri tory totaling about 750 square miles . If Insurgent troops pierce another 16 miles into Catalonia to take Artesa , then Barce lona , the Loyalist capital , will be seriously threatened . <P> Biggest Rebel victory of the week was the capture , by the bayonet , of Granadella , 18 miles south of Lerida , centre of the Catalonian battlefront . Before they could take Artesa , however , a group of rugged , rocky peaks well-defended by machine-gun nests had to be crossed . <P> In some respects the Battle for Cata lonia was the greatest military engagement since the World War . Although the number of soldiers was far less than that on the Western front in 1914-18 , the Rebel concentration of artillery was as great as that used by the Germans at Verdun- about one cannon to every ten yards . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generalissimo Franco 's troops pounded the enemy with a fierce artillery barrage , then bombarded the Loyalists from the air , then attacked with from 100 to 150 tanks . Finally his infantry moved in . <P> Not only did the Loyalists face vastly superior armaments , but for the first time in the war they were outnumbered in soldiers in the field . Commanded by their best military brains-Generals Juan Sarrabia and Enrique Lister , Colonel Juan Modesto-the Loyalists employed the only possible methods of fighting under such conditions - i.e. , slow retreat , then localized counterattacks . They hoped for a spell of bad weather to cripple the Rebel offensive . <P> At a New Year 's lull the Loyalist soldiers , better fed than the civilian population , got a half bottle of beer apiece , a few pieces of candy , a dinner of chick-pea soup , meat stew with potatoes , and coffee . The Rebels enjoyed two hot meals like this every day , plus a special coffee ration to hearten them through the freezing cold weather . <P> The Rebel offensive near Tremp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by Aragonese troops commanded by General Jos Moscard . The most unusual feature of the offensive , however , was that for the first time since the rout of Italian troops at Guadalajara in March 1937. unmixed divisions of Italian " legionnaires " were again in the front lines , south of Lrida . <P> Not from Rebel Spain did any hint of Italian participation come , but from Italy itself . The Fascist press attacked France for still supporting the Loyalists , but saw no inconsistency in boasting ( Loyalist communiques substantiated the boast ) that four Italian divisions ( about 40,000 men ) were heroically conquering Catalonia . These divisions included famed Black Shirt detachments . Italian correspondents wrote from Spain that among the Italian soldiers were veterans of the offensives of Mlaga , Bilbao , Santander , Aragon.
