txt Land Value an Index . To the Editor of The New York Times : Many of your readers will feel an especial debt to you for your editorial , " How Fast We Grew , " on the national wealth of the United States . Would it not be helpful to many besides the writer if the amount allotted to land value were published as a separate item ? There is , of course , no more land in 1930 than there was in 1900 . Its relative valuation depends upon the proximity of population and the relative prosperity of that population . Therefore , to gain a right idea of progress in the accumulation of wealth the valu ' ation attached to land should be separate . True wealth is those prodiucts of labor which have been accumulated beyond the quantity consumed and thus added to surplus in buildings , equipment and supplies of every character . GEORGE FOSTER PEABODY . Saratoga Springs , N. Y .. Jan. 80 , 1932.                @ @ @ @ @
