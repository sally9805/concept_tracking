Saving Face on War Debts FINDING a way to deal with war debts is not an economic puzzle but a political one . Those who observe the way it is answered will receive a first-class education , not in the calculus of trade , exchange , money and capital , but in the calculus of accommodating the general mind to an inevitable result . The next few months will illuminate a frequent phenomenon of social psychology-6 ; e mechanism of accepting an outcome former/ spurned with great heat , by means of finding ne'l words , new formulas , new symbols , for that out come . These will allow the politicians to pretend that what they are doing is what all along they had intended to do , in spite of the fact that it is the precise opposite . Why do we say that the economic problem is already decided ? Simply because there is no possible way , in the visible future , to take from our debtors anywhere near the quantity of real wealth which the debts are supposed to represent . Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue payment without dissipating her investments abroad and so losing the means of feeding her population and supplying her industries with materials . Indeed , she may not be able to pay for the necessary imports in any case . France , as is frequently pointed out , has a lot of gold , and might , by sufficiently reducing her gold reserve , meet her payments to us with that . This would help , provided the possession of the gold enabled us as a nation to acquire the real goods and services which the gold nominally could buy . But our bank reserves are already bulging with gold which is of no use to us , because the credit which it would make possible is not being employed in producing goods and services . And France 's debt to us is a minor factor in the situation anyway . Her biggest debt is to Great Britain ; this is channeled to our shores through London via the British debt . France has nowhere near enough gold to pay both England and the United States . No refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facts . We could even go to war in order to collect , and still find it impossible to take away enough booty to meet the obligations . The economic question was finally settled by the depression itself , which so drastically reduced prices and limited trade . Even before that , the Probable answer was foreseen by many , although it was veiled from the public eye by the fact that we kept lending to Europe what we received from her . We lent , principally , to Germany , who thus could pay France , Italy , Great Britain and the rest . These nations in turn paid us . Thus the fiction of payment was maintained . This fiction now having broken down because we will no longer lend , another fiction must be invented . President Hoover and President-elect Roosevelt have begun the good work of invention , while stoutly asserting the old principles . The President 's contribution is mainly in the matter of the payments due December 15 . He has no power to Postpone them and will not recommend that Congress do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But he will consider payment in foreign currencies , and it is strongly hinted that Congress will do likewise . This is the surrender in fact , disguised in technical language which naturally seern , s harmless to those who are economically so Toorant that they think the debt can be paid . Acceptance of the payment in English pounds rather than in American dollars , the pounds not to be converted into dollars until the transfer can be accomplished without danger to exchange values , is in fact an indefinite postponement of payment . Pounds are not of the slightest use to the United States government , unless they are spent where British currency is valid . In other words , we say to Britain : " If you will go through the form of payment by depositing with us a certain number of symbols of purchasing power , we will simply keep them on deposit , not taking from you the real wealth which they represent , until it is convenient to do this without injury . " This procedure is nothing if it is not postponement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail . Governor Roosevelt 's invention deals , quite properly , with the negotiations about ultimate revision which must take their course after he assumes office . He , too , accepts verbally the familiar principles about the justice of the debts . But he must begin to find a way of escape for a Congress which is unwilling even to talk about any change in the payments . President Hoover wants Congress to reconstitute the debt-funding commission . But for Congress to do this would be to admit that there is something to talk about , and that concessions are possible . Congress will not now do so . Here , at the very beginning , is a collision of principle with necessity . Mr. Roosevelt deftly avoids it by pointing out that according to another principle , well established in private dealings , debtors always have access to creditors . And in the case of international relations , their normal channel of communication is that of diplomacy , which is constitutionally in the hands of the President . Through the Department of State the debtors can negotiate with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress . Congress will be called upon only to ratify any result of the negotiations . This formula provides a breathing spell for the essential change of atmosphere . It allows time for the invention of new symbols which Congress may be induced to accept . There are numerous possibilities in this direction . Congress can in the end , we are confident , be persuaded to ratify a satisfactory , settlement which its members can say is not cancellation . It would be possible , for instance , to cut the future payments about in half by remitting any further interest , and insisting only on instalments of principal . This would , in words , be insisting on payment of the last red cent of the debt ? whereas if we cut the future payments in half by requiring payment of interest , but remitting the principal , that would , in words , be complete cancellation . Between these limits there are numerous possibilities of juggling with the rate of interest . This is merely an illustration of the sort of thing which may be done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go far enough . What is really necessary is to clear the slate of future payment entirely . A good precedent for this is the Lausanne settlement of reparations . France had been just as adamant against lenient treatment of Germany as many in this country are against lenient treatment of the Allies . The problem there , as here , was to find a formula which would , while satisfying po ; mlar sentiment , fit the hard facts . Reparations wore not , in words , canceled . They were merely reduced and put in the form of a lump sum . Payment of this sum was postponed . In the end it was to be paid only if a bond issue of the requisite size could be floated on the international market , at a minimum price . It was foreseen that this flotation could not succeed unless Germany had in the meantime developed sufficient capacity to pay the charges on it . Even then , the proceeds were to be used , not to pay France or other governments , but to finance economic reconstruction in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany itself . Thus , real cancellation was provided for . And French opinion was further conciliated by the proviso that the agreement would be presented to the several parliaments for ratification only if a satisfactory settlement of the outpayments of the Allies on war debts were in the meantime arrived at . A parallel settlement of the debts is entirely possible . We insist , let us say , that the debts are just , and must be honored in full . But we are convinced at the same time that , in our own interest , a settlement must be made which will help and not hinder worldwide recovery . We provide , therefore , for the lump payment of the capital sums , reduced in accordance with the deflation of prices and the difficulties of transfer created by the shrinkage of trade ( which , we could be persuaded , is not real reduction ) . We further provide that this payment be made only if the bonds necessary to finance it can be sold . ( Of course , those who think France and Great Britain can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be sold . ) We specify , again , that the proceeds of the bonds be used , not to pay us directly but for investment wherever they would most help revival of trade . It would be easy to find ways of so using them that the foreign markets for American manufactures and farm products would be corre spondingly increased . Mr. Roosevelt might even further parallel the Lausanne agreement by recommending at the same time measures to decrease the burden of our own internal debt . It is entirely possible to elaborate a logical structure of this kind which would be too complex for Mr. Hearst , Senator Johnson and The Saturday Evening Post to understand , which would be capable of being interpreted as involving no surrender by the anti-cancellationists , but which still would in effect acknowledge the end of real payments and remove the barriers which the lack of settlement raises in the path of trade . For it must be remetnbered that while the economic question of the debts is now settled , and the necessary adjustment is a political one , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we assimilate the inevitable , and what we do next , have a great deal to do with what becomes inevitable in the ft ? ture.
