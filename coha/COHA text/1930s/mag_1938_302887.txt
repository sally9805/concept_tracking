Dr. Francis E. Townsend , as he arrived in Washington last week to " clean up this contempt business " -i . e. , to serve a 30-day sentence for having walked out on a Congressional committee trying to investigate his $200-per-month pension plan , in May 1936-seemed almost eager to get behind bars . He was planning , he said , to work on his autobiography during his incarceration . He scoffed at efforts on the part of Senator William G. McAdoo , who in the past had made no secret of his scorn of Planner Townsend , to get him pardoned . <P> But just as Planner Townsend was about to give himself into the hands of a U. S. Marshal to begin his term , word came that Franklin Roosevelt had lent a sympathetic ear to Senator McAdoo , had pardoned Planner Townsend . Apparently not in the least crestfallen at losing a month 's privacy and martyrdom , Dr. Townsend said : " It is complete vindication and an act of contrition on the part of Congress .
