" Ces Aimables Paroles " <P> After a bewhiskered fortnight in the nowhere off the Maine and Nova Scotia coasts , Franklin Roosevelt went ashore last week and once more climbed back on to the front page . His seagoing sideburns were gone before he showed himself in range of a camera . A few minutes after dark his chartered schooner Sewanna dropped anchor in Friar 's Bay below the Roosevelt cottage on Campobello Island , N. B. Forty red-coated Canadian police drawn up on the dock snapped him a brisk salute as the sleepy President went in to supper and to bed . <P> Next morning he was up &; around again as a man of affairs . With his house guest , Harry Hopkins , he talked over the future of the nearby Passamaquoddy tidal power project , now that Congress has definitely refused to authorize funds for its completion . Then , with his family , Premier Allison Dysart and several members of the New Brunswick Cabinet he went picnicking on a beach a mile from his home . There were only some 40 guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Presidential yacht Potomac succeeded in filling them adequately with roast beef , ham , salad and cake . On the sand , with a comfortable rock at his back , the President spent most of his time conversing with the New Brunswickian Premier and eating frankfurters , than which he likes only scrambled eggs better . <P> In a convivial state he held his first press conference in nearly three weeks , devoted it chiefly to expounding the desirability of the ' Quoddy project , based on his expectation of a 10% to 15% annual growth in electric power demand , new methods of transmission that would take ' Quoddy 's output to areas where it could be used . That duty done , he settled back to watch his boys play baseball on the sand , a game which ended with members of the New Brunswick Cabinet taking on an all-U . S. team . Driving home as the fog began to roll in from the bay , the President held a reception on the porch of his red bungalow for his fellow-islanders and visitors from the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making men hopeful , he told them : <P> " I believe in ' Quoddy , and I think you do , too . . . . ' Quoddy will be completed . " <P> Next day , canceling plans to view the uncompleted ' Quoddy dams by sea from the Potomac , he took his mother in his car , ferried across to the mainland to visit Lubec , Eastport , and ' Quoddy Village , so that Maine men could not say , as they did three years ago , that he had failed to visit them when only a mile away . He saw the neat , clean , $1,500,000 ' Quoddy Village erected for the dam builders , was engrossed by the bathtub model of the power project with its four-inch tides demonstrating how power will be made if the President has his way with Congress .
