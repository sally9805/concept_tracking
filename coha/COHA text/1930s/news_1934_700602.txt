txt As business organizations mobilized their forces yesterday against Mayor LaGuardia 's business tax , the Mayor and City Chamberlain A. A. Berle Jr . explained the necessity for the tax to a joint committee representing the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen , which met at City Hall . Strong opposition to the tax is expected at a second hearing at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon , when representatives of civic and business groups will have their first opportunity to be heard . The Mayor 's bill proposes a tax of one-twentieth of 1 per cent on the gross receipts in 1933 of all businesses , professions and vocations which earned more than $15,000 . Calls Levy Inevitable . The Mayor told the committee that regrettable as the new tax might be , he declared it was unavoidable . The Mayor made it clear that the business tax , if passed now , would in all likelihood continue for at least another year . This statement was contrary to the general impression that the tax would be an emergency measure lasting for only one year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature , the city is restricted to a one-year period for collecting the tax . The Mayor said later that he had asked for a longer period , which had been refused by the Legislature . In explaining the city 's position to the joint committee he said : " Now if it were just a matter of one year we might be able to spread the deficit of 1934 . But it wo n't be long , gentlemen , before you will have the budget right here in this room  --  just a few months  --  and we will have more trouble . If you stop to consider that we will have to provide in that budget $50,000,000 as a reserve fund . necessary under the bankers ' agreement  --  you know it is four and five years , a $200,000,000 revolving fund  --  we will have to provide $7,000,000 more in debt service as our first instalment of the $70 , - 000,000 borrowed for relief purposes , ? $57,000,000 . We will have to provide $7,000,000 for snow removal this year . As you know , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due Awards Cited . " Now there you have $64,000,000 , one item alone that we know of . With the increased debt service , I am not even able to say that this will take us out of our troubles , because the Controller will inform you that he has $40,000,000 right now of awards past due carrying 6 per cent interest , which must be paid . The Controller is served almost daily with papers , so that as soon as we can put our house in order the Controller will be compelled to go out and borrow more money to pay these present bills that are past due . And that is not all of our troubles . " ln a few months we will have $57,000,000 worth of short-term notes that became due last Decem- ber and were extended , which we will have to meet in some way . " Fair Tax , Mayor Says . His tax proposal was the most equitable and leak-proof one that could be devised , the Mayor declared . Taxing gross incomes , he said , would simplify collection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional man earning $20,000 a year would pay a tax of $2.50 . Turning to the proposal to place a two-cent tax on elevated and subway fares , which was introduced as a substitute proposition by Borough President George U. Harvey of Queens , the Mayor said emphatically that ke would not support such a measure . The Harvey proposal in principle at least has the support of the Merchants Association , the Fifth Avenue Association and other powerful mercantile groups opposing the Mayor 's plan . In speaking about the transit situation the Mayor said : " I do n't feel at this time that we can impose a two-cent tax on a subway ride for several reasons . First , I think it will confuse , if not make much more difficult , the present negotiations for unification . I think that it is the entering wedge for a permanent increase in fares , that ultimately might not go into the treasury of the city . " The Mayor was not impressed by statments that the tax would drive business men out of New York City , holding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the advantage of every business man in the city . $8,000,000 Revenue Foreseen . Mr. Berle said the city expected to raise $8,000,000 through the tax . Under questioning by the commit tee members he declared building and loan associations would be exempt from the tax , as they are not operated for profit in the commercial sense . ' Bonding and mortgage companies , however , would be subject to the tax . The Mayor and Mr. Berle agreed businesses would be taxed on their 1933 gross income even if they had suffered a loss during the year . Alderman Morton Baum ques-tioned Mr. Berle closely on many details of how the tax would apply . In most instances he received specific replies , though there seemed to be some confusion on the exact application of the new levy . Democratic members of the Board of Aldermen feel that they need more time to study the Mayor 's proposal before expressing a definite opinion on it . Their concurrence is required before the tax can become effective .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
