( See front cover ) <P> In the State of Utah the rock of ages has assumed strange forms . Geologically , as observed in such scenic reservations as Bryce Canyon National Park , The Cedar Breaks , Zion National Park ( see map p. 27 ) , the rock has been sculptured by erosion , forming unearthly peaks and terraces , ornate gorges , petrified and ghostly cities . Utah 's religious rock of ages-its dominant church-is equally exotic . It is , as everyone knows , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , or , more familiarly , the Mormon Church . Fully half of Utah 's half-million souls are Mormons . The history and commercial development of Utah is more closely linked with the Mormon Church than is Roman history with Catholicism . <P> Last week the thoughts of all the 700,000 Mormons in the world dwelt in Salt Lake City , capital of Mormondom and of Utah , where the centenary of the founding of the Church was to be celebrated , exactly to the day , on April 6 , 1930 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . <P> Holy rites of celebration would be secretly performed in the six-spired Mormon Temple , open only to Mormon church-members in good standing ( i.e. , approved as moral and right-minded by their local pastors- ' " bishops " ) , and thus long supposed by superstitious Gentiles* to conceal queer ceremonies of polygamous import . But Mormonism is by no means merely a closeted , holy matter . It is also a hard-headed economic system and the communicants are bustling , practical , prosperous . Always have non-Mormons been welcomed to services and organ recitals in the great domed Tabernacle ( seating capacity 10,000 ) just behind the Temple . This auditorium , where the late great Soprano Adelina Patti remarked : " My voice is twice as large here , " had undergone last week a vast refurbishing for a public pageant calculated to impress its audiences with the fact that Mormonism is a successful religion if ever there was one . Accompanying the pageant would be music from one of Mormondom 's most cherished treasures- its mighty organ . In 1866 oxen began hauling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glue was made by boiling strips of cattle and buffalo hides . Recently reconstructed , the instrument , with 5,500 pipes , is among the world 's largest , draws comparisons with those in Frieburg , London 's Crystal Palace , Manhattan 's St. Patrick 's Cathedral . Designed on a monumental , historic scale , the pageant would begin , of course , in Heaven , where the Creator 's appointment of Jesus as a Redeemer was to be represented with luminous effects and invisible voices . Next would be shown the creation of the world and its peoples ; the ancient prophets ; the Nativity , Sermon on the Mount , Resurrection . Then would follow the dark period of apostasy and , finally , the story of Mormonism :
