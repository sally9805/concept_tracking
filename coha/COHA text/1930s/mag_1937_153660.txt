For months Benito Mussolini has been mightily displeased with Britain for refusing to recognize fully his conquest of Ethiopia . Sullen antagonism flared into open hostility four days before the Coronation when II Duce , hoping that for once the pen might be mightier than the sword , issued orders and Italian newshawks in London , like a well-drilled Fascist Legion , route-marched for Rome and the entire Italian press clamped down a boycott on British news ( TIME , May 17 ) . <P> Last week the direction of march was reversed . A battalion of Fascist newshawks was marching back to London- not the same men who had been writing vitriolic anti-British stuff until their recall last May , but a new , unsullied group. * Italian newsorgans meantime carried dispatches with London datelines , the first in three months . <P> Reason for these amenities was that British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had sent Il Duce a dovelike message on the Spanish question . Mussolini sent a not less silky reply to London . The contents , though " secret , " were soon being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted by the British " gesture of friendship . " <P> In Rome , meantime , British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond , having sped back from a visit to his dentist in Vienna , called on Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano at the Palazzo Chigi , remained closeted for more than an hour . <P> Mussolini , no altruist , was clearly hoping that he would be properly rewarded for his friendliness . He would like nothing better than for the British Government to recognize his Ethiopian conquest , then to persuade the League of Nations to follow suit . As the week progressed these hopes looked less &; less wild . <P> In Britain 's sedate Bath , famed for its " waters , " silk-bearded Haile Selassie , former Emperor of Ethiopia , has long been in exile working studiously on his memoirs . By last week the memoirs were nearly finished ; arrangements had been made for their publication . Suddenly Publisher Michael Joseph announced that the Emperor had been " compelled " to forego publication on orders of his " political advisers . " London wiseacres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government to find public opinion being whipped up for an Emperor who might at any moment be declared officially throneless . <P> * While Italian newshawks were filing back to London , Werner von Crome , chief London correspondent for the Berliner Lokalanzeiger , his assistant , Franz Otto Wrede , and Wolf Dietrich Langen , a German newsagency correspondent , were preparing to go back to Germany . They had been informed by Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that their permits to remain in Britain would not be renewed . Declared Correspondent von Crome : " There was no reason given . . . . I deny that the action was taken as a result of complaints of espionage . " These three were believed to be the first German newshawks ever expelled from Britain in peacetime . This week Germany retaliated by asking the London Times to withdraw its Correspondent Norman Ebbutt from Berlin .
