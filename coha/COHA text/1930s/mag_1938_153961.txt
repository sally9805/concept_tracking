Main idea of a cinema sales convention is to put the coming season 's production program over with a bang . At one of this year 's conventions the spirit of Hollywood enterprise was neatly summed up by firing tommy guns loaded with blanks . At other conventions , this year 's plans for some 500 feature pictures , to cost some $150,000,000 , were introduced with less noise , no less ballyhoo . By last week salesmen were visiting the nation 's 16,558 exhibitors , talking up next season 's shows . Under the block-booking blind-selling system of distribution to which the sprawling cinema industry is geared , they were all out to sell , in prescribed assortments , films not yet produced . <P> But U. S. exhibitors met them with more determined sales resistance than ever before . In the season just closing , exhibitors had heard far too often the ugly noises made by disapproving audiences ; their pocketbooks were feeling pinched . Some exhibitors thought the trouble lay with stars who seemed to be " boxoffice poison " ( TIME , May 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior pictures . Meanwhile the Government has cast a quizzical eye over Hollywood 's trade practices . While film circles last week rumored that the $2,000,000,000 cinema industry was slated for official arraignment , a Hollywood lobby in Washington fought to prevent the Neely bill , already passed by the Senate ( prohibiting compulsory block booking and blind selling* ) , from reaching the floor of the House . <P> But at most conventions this year , platforms were cannily paved with good intentions . Most producers forswore " B " pictures , made high &; mighty promises of action , thrills , allure , import , quality . <P> Of the minimum expenditure of $150,000,000 for 1938-39 , the payroll will be more than $85,000,000 , to be shared by the many studio executives in Hollywood 's nepotistic structure , and those of the 28,000 cinemartisans who have managed to survive recent retrenchment . The remainder will largely go for the papier-mache , froufrou , sundries that give Hollywood its supercolossal gloss . <P> Biggest share of the Hollywood budget will probably be spent by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , opulent producing subsidiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as $3,000,000 on a picture ( Conquest , Marie Antoinette ) , M-G-M does so to give proper setting to Hollywood 's greatest star roster , to produce most of Hollywood 's best jobs , many of its stuffiest . Over last fiscal year , Loew 's Inc. topped the cinemindustry with a net income of $14,426,062 . In the coming season , MGM 's schedule calls for 52 films , to include Northwest Passage , with Robert Taylor ; The Women , with Norma Shearer ; The Citadel , in production in England to satisfy the new British quota law ( TIME , April 11 ) ; Kim , with Freddie Bartholomew ; and Dale Carnegie 's How to Win Friends and Influence People . <P> Most successful purveyor of mass entertainment is Twentieth Century-Fox , whose net profit last year was $8,617,114 . This year a program of 58 features will find the Dionne girls hygienically spotted in a musical to be called Five of a Kind . Other notable projects : Drums Along the Mohawk , the Ritz Brothers as The Three Musketeers , three Shirley Temple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cantor and Sonja Henie.
