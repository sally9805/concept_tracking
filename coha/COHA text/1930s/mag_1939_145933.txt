Last week some Maryland chemists ( the Maryland section of the American Chemical Society ) stuck their collective neck out . To entertain fellow chemists , meeting in Baltimore , they staged a show the like of which no chemist or choreographer had ever seen-a " chemical ballet . " The theory was that the formation , movement and dissociation of molecules , the nuclear spins of electrons , etc. , could be represented by appropriate music and dancing . The music was written by Dr. Donald Hatch Andrews , a musically inclined chemistry professor at Johns Hopkins , in collaboration with one of his students . The choreography was arranged by Carol Lynn Fetser , a Baltimore dancing teacher . <P> " Who would ever fail , " inquired the program notes , " to understand the vibrations of hydrogen , if he had felt them while dancing with a beautiful living atom in his arms ? Who would ever forget the position of the bonds in benzene if he had played the part of a carbon atom whirling around with lovely hands holding him on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharmaceutical Chemist Alfred Robert Louis Dohme , longtime ( 1911-29 ) president of Sharpe &; Dohme ( drugs ) , the ballet scenario tells of a scientist who tries to synthesize radioactive benzene from acetylene with the aid of an atom-smasher . Something goes wrong ; " there is a series of blinding flashes and he staggers back . " After another failure , he sits down , sinks into discouraged sleep , dreams : <P> " First the hydrogens , clothed in brilliant red , appear and trip through a gay waltz expressive of their joy at the escape from the harsh gas laws that usually confine them . Then two atoms in black , carbons , emerge and grab four hydrogens each . Their kinetic freedom lost , the hydrogens now execute vibrations around the carbon atoms ( methane ) . . . . <P> " Then four more carbons enter and join the groups . The molecules are suddenly aware of their gaseous nature and the atoms execute nuclear spins as the fast throbbing chords of the ethylene and acetylene dance are heard . . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trailing flames . It is fire . . . . Following fire , the oxygen atoms clothed in blue enter , and seize the hydrogens and carbons . First there is the dance of the water molecules thus formed . . . . <P> " There is a momentary pause while water and carbon monoxide combine to form methyl alcohol . As the synthesis proceeds the music turns into a syncopated Cakewalk , the dance of ethyl alcohol . . . . The atoms hesitate , swaying and staggering about , intoxicated by the motions they have discovered . . . . The chemist awakens and rushes to the centre of the stage . . . . "
