Wall Street 's reaction to events in Cleveland last week could hardly be called a Landon boom . The Dow-Jones industrial stock averages rose 3 points to 154 , utility averages about a point to 32 , rail averages less than a point to 46 . Credit for even these gains had to be divided with a big batch of favorable business items , particularly in retail trade , which had been rolling at the best levels since 1930 and was ready-set for distribution of the Bonus , a $1,900,000,000 shot in the retail arm . <P> But if nomination of Alfred Mossman Landon did not bring forth a boom , anti-Roosevelt Wall Street at least did honors with a respectable pop . The stockmarket managed to put on two successive million-share days before slumping back into the dullness of the past six weeks . Businessmen and brokers were pleased with , if not excited by , the G.O.P. platform . Mr. Landon 's talk of gold had no market magic . <P> What Cleveland really gave to U. S. Business was something to hope for instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped from 2-to-1 to as low as 8-to-5 . There was almost no money actually bet , however . Market-minded people preferred to buy deflated shares in utility holding companies which have suffered from Democratic power policies . They figure that if President Roosevelt is reelected , utility companies will be little , if any , worse off than they are now .
