The world Press dithered because all in one morning last week chunky , pipe-sucking Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin conferred with frail old U. S. Ambassador Robert W. Bingham and immediately afterward with hale old Banker J. P. Morgan . Supercilious comment in The City , London 's Wall Street , was that most of President Roosevelt 's fiscal emissaries to Europe , such as Professor Raymond Moley , have been " neither known nor trusted here " and that if the President now has any proposals to make to His Majesty 's Government he could not have done better than to entrust them to Mr. Morgan who is " a well-known and well-liked figure . " <P> This was followed by unconfirmed rumors that No. 23 Wall St. had talked with No. 10 Downing St. about stabilizing the world 's currencies and bringing the fantastically kited price of silver to lower levels . In the House of Commons innuendoes were hurled by Labor M. P. 's , who now smell " munitions " in everything , that Banker Morgan had somehow turned up in the interest of Merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the House with that perfect aplomb which never leaves Stanley Baldwin : " Mr. Morgan is an old personal friend of mine with whom I have stayed in New York . He always comes to see me when he is in this country . I hope he will continue to do so . " Meanwhile New York Times Correspondent Ferdinand Kuhn Jr . cabled : " Persons who attended the royal garden party last week noticed the almost affectionate greetings that Mr. Morgan received from the King and Queen . He had waited patiently at the end of a long line of Dominion High Commissioners and minor officials , who filed quickly past with nothing more than a formal handshake from the King and Queen . <P> " But when Mr. Morgan reached the royal stand , according to witnesses , it was as if a long-lost brother had appeared . <P> The King and Queen stood with him fully ten minutes in eager and animated conversation , and hundreds of guests wondered who this portly stranger could be who was so intimate with their royal family .
