Tens of thousands of " mustangs " and " fuzztails " - the wild descendants of horses that , have strayed from ranches - used to roam the vast sagebrush ranges of the U. S. Northwest . In wilder days , wild horse roundups were carried on periodically for the Portland , Ore . firm of Schlesser Bros. , then the world 's biggest packers of horsemeat . <P> In five years ( 1925-30 ) the Schlessers slaughtered some 300,000 head of outlaws , salted their meat in 51 - gallon barrels , shipped most of it to Holland and Scandinavia . Hooves , ears , tails were sold for glue and oil ; ground bones and scraps for chickenfeed ; hides for baseballs and shoes ; blood for fertilizer ; casings for German sausage . Then the day of the wild horse began to wane , and the Schlessers turned to packing beef . <P> As winter last week finally settled over the " horse heaven " country of central Washington , the weather-wise Yakima Indians had already finished their first wild horse round-up of the year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oregon and Washington . <P> Whooping like their warrior ancestors , the Indians rode their own cayuses in hot pur suit of the outlaws , chased them out of deep canyons into trap corrals , where long fences led them into bottlenecks . <P> Cattlemen and the U. S. Government have two principal reasons for desiring a clean-up of the remaining wild horses : it will save the range for livestock , remove the menace of the dread dourine ( genital ) diseases often found in wild horses .
