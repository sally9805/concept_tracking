In business indices last week there was evidence of little but stagnation . Steel production rose from 33% to 35% of capacity , highest point since November . Car loadings rose a mite in expectation of the new rates . But lumber output was off 6% for the week , power production 2% , oil production 0.8% , soft coal 8% . Bank clearings were at a new low since 1934 but gold was pouring into the country at a rate which showed that the rest of the world still thinks the U. S. the safest place to cache its valuables . The stock market proceeded to slip from 107 to 98 on the Dow-Jones industrial scale . These mixed statistics could be interpreted almost any way . But both Henry Ford and Jesse Jones chose to be optimistic . <P> Said Mr. Ford : " Nothing that has occurred during the last few weeks has changed my belief that a prosperous era is ahead of us . " <P> Said Mr. Jones : " I am not at all pessimistic . ... I am convinced from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real basic economic ills responsible for the present setback and that the worst part of the recession is in the minds of the people . " <P> That the entire country is commercially going to hell in a hack is certainly not true . While generally bad , business is not equally bad everywhere , a point not generally appreciated , but brought out last week when Dun &; Bradstreet published in Dun 's Review a nationwide chart of trade volume at the end of January ( see map ) . Prepared by Dr. L. D. H. Weld of McCann-Erickson , Inc. , the chart was based upon Federal Reserve Board figures for bank debits , wholesale sales and department store sales , R. L. Polk &; Co. figures on new car registrations , Editor &; Publisher 's statistics on advertising lineage and Life Insurance Sales Research Bureau statistics on new policies . Aside from variations in the price level , for which Dr. Weld made no provision , the Dun &; Bradstreet analysis gives about the best picture of the current distribution of depression . Published monthly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy of telephoning Dun &; Bradstreet where to go next . <P> Where not to go now is obviously the industrial East , hardest hit section of the U. S. Because of the slump in automobiles , trade in the Detroit area was off 26% in January from January 1937 . New England trade was down 21% as its rambling textile mills operated on a 3-day week . Glass , steel and auto-part mills were listless in northern Ohio . Northern Illinois trade shrank as Chicago unemployment grew . In Manhattan trade volume plumped 19% with cinemansions and department stores feeling the pessimism of Wall Street .
