txt Mr. Rogers Now Is Certain That Spring Has Arrived To the Editor of The New York Times : HOLLYWOOD , Cal. , May 5 . ? Spring has been late arriving this year , but this morning on our front page she got here . It was the old familiar figure of Citizen Calvin Coolidge wading in the creek . When that distinguished weather mark takes his hip boots out of dry dock and launches forth with rod and cigar into the very bowels of a Spring freshet , America knows she can then shed her woolens and enjoy her depression in the open air . The picture showed he had a little " perch " in his hand and the same grin on his face that he wore on that memorable day in Washington when he , with due premeditation and malice aforethought , slipped the custodianship of these whole United States into the innocent hands of Herbert Hoover . You ca n't blame him for grinning , if he never caught a fish . Yours , WILL ROGERS .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
