Last April , at the age of 77 , Dr. William James Mayo , elder of the Rochester ( Minn . ) Clinic 's famed Mayo brothers , went under the knife for an ailment he had often treated : perforating gastric ulcer . For a while " Dr. Will " rallied , but all the magnificent resources of the Mayo Clinic failed to save his old , wornout body . Last week Dr. Will died . He had survived his brother , Dr. Charlie , his lifelong friend and partner , by only two months . Still practicing in Rochester is the last of the Mayos , Dr. Charlie 's son , 41-year-old Dr. Charles William Mayo .
