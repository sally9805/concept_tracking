The Merry Widow ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) is the third and by far the best cinema version of Franz Lehar 's famed operetta . The first was a two-reel monstrosity in which the late Alma Rubens and Wallace Reid performed in 1912 . In 1925 Erich von Stroheim directed Mae Murray and John Gilbert in the second . Cinemaddicts who have seen all three are likely to find the current version , directed by Ernst Lubitsch , as far superior to the second as the second was to the first . Only the most captious critics could find any fault with a picture which fairly entranced audiences with its oldtime music and glamour . <P> In the Lubitsch version , Captain Danilo ( Maurice Chevalier ) is dispatched from Marshovia to Paris to marry his country 's richest widow ( Jeanette MacDonald ) lest she impoverish the royal treasury by marrying a foreigner . He goes to Maxim 's for a farewell debauch , makes love to a cocotte who turns out to be the widow in disguise . Meeting her again at a diplomatic reception , he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he has been convicted of treason for failing in his mission .
