Fortnight ago Soviet Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Molotov frankly expressed his doubts about the sincerity of the British Government 's desire to stop Adolf Hitler on all fronts . Last week , from the lips of highly placed British statesmen themselves , he had plenty of evidence to support these doubts . <P> First witness was Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax , who spoke in the House of Lords . Ostensibly the Foreign Secretary simply reassured Germany that the idea of " encirclement " was furthest from British thoughts . But when he talked about " problems which may now or hereafter appear likely to disturb international order , " looked forward to a " peace settlement " and even referred to " economic Lebensraum " for Germany , many anti-Nazi Britons were sure that the British Government , through its Foreign Secretary , was talking appeasement again on the pre-Munich model . <P> Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain thought Lord Halifax 's speech " remarkable " and in two of his own speeches , one before the House of Commons and the other at Birmingham , amplified the Foreign Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We would not refuse to discuss any method by which reasonable aspirations on the part of other nations could be satisfied , even if this meant some adjustment of the existing state of things , " said Mr. Chamberlain . Day later he repeated his offer : " We are ready to discuss around the table claims of Germany or any other country , provided there seems a reasonable prospect of settlement . " <P> President of the Board of Trade Oliver Stanley and Sir John Simon , an appeaser from way back , swelled the chorus , but the strangest note was struck by Sir Francis Lindley , onetime Ambassador to Japan , longtime foe of Soviet Russia , stanch friend of and host to Mr. Chamberlain . Sir Francis told the Conservative Party 's Foreign Affairs Committee that British prestige would rise if the projected pact with Russia fell through . <P> Across the Channel in France two onetime French Premiers openly talked appeasement . Pierre Laval , signer of the 1935 pact with Italy and saboteur of the French eastern European alliance system , urged before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , warned that a Soviet pact would be more dangerous than helpful . Pierre Etienne Flandin , who wired congratulations to Adolf Hitler last autumn after Munich , called for " mediation " with Germany .
