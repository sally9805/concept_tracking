It was necessary for Queen Victoria 's campaigners to execute Afghans by blowing them from cannon mouths to impress other Afghans sufficiently with the horror of their death . In Harar last week it was necessary for Ras Nassibu , the Ethiopian Commander facing Italian General Rodolfo Graziani , to impress with similar horror the simple African mind .

Twelve times an executioner with a plaited bull whip laid on until quivering flesh and muscles came off in strips and the bones of the black man 's carcass gleamed white in Death .
