Last week all Europe was excited about the propaganda battle between England 's Commander Stephen King-Hall and Germany 's Paul Joseph Goebbels ( TIME , July 31 ) . As Commander King-Hall 's fourth letter to his " dear German readers " reached Germany , Britishers received in their morning mail copies of a mimeographed pamphlet entitled News From Germany . Published by Dr. Goebbels ' good friend H. R. Hoffmann of Starnberg , News From Germany bears beneath its masthead the motto : <P> " And ye shall know the truth . <P> And the truth shall make you free . " <P> Says a letter from Publisher Hoffmann : " The sole aim of News From Germany is to further a better understanding of the aspirations , the achievements , and the spirit of Germany ; which , I am convinced , will serve the cause of world peace . The receipt of unbiased and accurate information will help readers to form just opinions . " But Publisher Hoffmann 's information is hardly unbiased or accurate , nor has it the humor , conscious and unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> GERMANY WANTS PEACE <P> AMERICA ALREADY TIRED OF BENESCH <P> JEWS KEEP OUT ! <P> LIES , LIES !
