Up in Chicago 's Palmer House one day last week rose speaker after speaker to pledge renewed allegiance to Liberty , the Constitution and the American Way of Life , assure his fellow members of the Republican National Committee that they had fought a good fight , been beaten only by the New Deal 's unbeatable Relief funds . Vice President-reject Frank Knox generously conceded that the return of prosperity and Republicans ' failure to " popularize " their issues had had something to do with it . The only harsh words at the consolation party came from two uninvited guests . <P> No committeeman , but flushed with assurance by virtue of his standing as a re-elected Republican , was Representative Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois . " You 're just salving your own consciences here this morning , " roared he . " I thoroughly disagree with all the self-admiration that has been expressed here . . . . We have n't got even enough members of Congress to force a roll call . And still we listen to rhetorical pap . . . like ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would you do ? " cried an indignant member . Congressman Dirksen did not reply . <P> Representative Hamilton Fish of New York , present by proxies from Alaska and Puerto Rico , won himself no welcome by gloating : " I carried Roosevelt 's own district for Landon and myself by 24,000- and that 's more than the rest of you can say . " Long famed as a Red-baiter , Congressman Fish has stepped out since Nov. 3 as a would-be liberalizer of the GOP . Last week his target was National Chairman John D. M. Hamilton , who had called the Committee 's first post election meeting to act on his offer to resign . <P> Chairman Hamilton , boomed the towering , buck-toothed Representative from New York , was a fine fellow , but as a representative of the " old . reactionary elements " he must be dropped . " If word goes out today that the Republican Party has learned no lesson , " warned he , " it may be too late and our Party perishes before we can act to liberalize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Social Security Act drove millions out of the Party in the big industrial cities . " <P> Challenged from the floor on this point , Representative Fish blurted : " If you want me to tell the whole truth I will , and it will be 100% worse than what I 've said . The Republican Party itself inspired the sending out of vicious attacks on Social Security in pay envelopes . Why . I have letters from William Allen White and other liberals denouncing this practice in such language that I could not use it before this assembly . " <P> Solidly backed by his vice-chairmen- Connecticut 's longtime Boss John Henry Roraback . Oregon 's Ralph E. Williams , rich and buxom Mrs. Worthington Scranton of Pennsylvania and Mrs. John E. Hillman of Colorado-Chairman Hamilton did not rise to the Fish bait . On his own behalf he said only : " I have no particular defense to make of the last campaign . There were lots of errors , but I said at the start there would be . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
