txt J. Richard ( Dixie ) Davis went into Supreme Court before Justice Ferdinand Pecora yesterday and said he was guilty of all thirteen counts in the policy racket indictment against him . Then he blanched visibly when . it seemed , for a few moments , that Justice Pecora might send him back to Tombs Prison to await his appearance as a witness for the people in the trial of James J. Hines , Tammany leader . In the Tombs , Charles P. Grimes , Assistant District Attorney , said Davis feared he might be slain by a flying " shiv "  --  a prison word for the thin and piercing knives that inmates sometimes acquire  --  but to Justice Pecora this fear seemed a reflection upon the good . name of prison management . Then , while still considering what he would do about paroling Davis in the custody of the District Attorney 's office , Justice Pecora angrily remarked that , to date , no explanation or inquiry had been made concerning reports that Davis was permitted to violate the court 's order , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit a physician , by visiting other places as well . This was in reference to the visits Davis made to an apartment in the East Sixties where he met Hope Dare , the former showgirl who was with him when he was arrested in Philadelphia early in the , yeat . The jurist , side-stepping any mention of Miss Dare , declared that unless some such inquiry were undertaken soon , he would open one himself , and finally ended the hearing by asking Mr. Grimes to prepare a report for him on it , and then granted the ' request for parole . Davis had been scheduled - to appear at noon , but did not reach the court room until more than a half hour later . He was driven up to the Supreme Court building in a car with a group of detectives . A crowd had gathered on the steps waiting for a glimpse of him . A good part of his face was covered by green spectacles and the moment he was out of the car he was surrounded by detectives . The detectives marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was manacled to one of them . When he reached the court room on the third floor and took a seat inside the railing , with the detectives still around him , his face was white . He took off the glasses and stared around and only by degrees did his color return . J. Richard Davis , the lad who raised himself Ito power as chief counsel to Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer , who ! has been credited with the idea out of which the policy lottery racket was created , and who supposedly I inherited the racket when Schultz I was murdered in 1935 , was fright ! ened. 1 Pleads Guilty on All Counts His name was called by the clerk 1 and he entered a plea of guilty . i Justice Pecora inquired if his plea Icovered the twelve felony counts of the indictment in addition to the I conspiracy one and he replied that it did . Mr. Grimes renewed his request that the defendant be paroled in the custody of the District Attorney , to be kept in a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detectives especially assigned . The " defendant Davis has informed me that he is in fear of his life in the Tombs , and does not feel that he could be safely returned to any city prison , " Mr. Grimes said . " The averment that this defendant is in fear of his life while in the Tombs , " Justice Pecora. said , " casts perhaps an unjust reflection on a public institution and the officials of the institutions of this city . " I am not disposed to allow such a reflection to stand . The statement that the defendant is in fear of his . life is a bit disturbing . " " That statement was made by Davis in connection with the statement that he will be a witness for the people , " Mr. Grimes said . " He is to be such a witness . I do suggest that Davis 's wishes as well as those of District Attorney Dewey be taken into consideration . " Danger Questioned by Court " Are prisoners in the city prisons in danger while in prison ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed in prison , " Mr. Grimes replied . " I am aware that it may involve some reflection on prison officials , but it does not alter the facts . Al Capone was stabbed three times in Alcatraz , and that is one of the toughest and best guarded prisons , and a Federal one . " Justice Pecora then reviewed the Davis case in connection with bail , recalling that when Davis was returned from Philadelphia the District Attorney 's office  --  it was Mr. Grimes then  --  had asked that bail of $200,000 be fixed , and that it had been granted . " I hope , " Justice Pecora remarked , " that the District Attorney is fully aware of the responsibility he is taking upon himself in making this request . " He switched to the visits to the physician . " This defendant , " he said , " was permitted by somebody or other to enjoy certain indulgences under an order signed by me that he be taken on a specific date for treatment at a doctor 's office . " According to press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office and to receive other than medical treatment . Nothing has been done to ascertain why the orders of this court were violated , and who were the persons responsible for its violation . " If something is not done very soon , the court will undertake an inquiry of its own . " The justice stopped and paused for a. full minute , staring at Mr. Grimes . Davis , standing at one end of a long counsel table , with a detective on each side of him , was perspiring . ' " Mr. Grimes , " Justice Pecora resumed , " do you want to see to it that an explanation for all those indulgences be laid before this court at an early date ? " " I 'd be very glad to , Your Honor , " Mr. Grimes said . " Very well , then , " the justice answered , " this court will grant your request . " Davis then gave his family history . Contrary to the usual custom , the questions were not read aloud by the court clerk who recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His answers were , however , audible . He said he had been born in the United States , was 33 years old , that his parents had been born in England of Rumanian descent . He gave his profession as a lawyer  --  he was disbarred  --  and declared he had never been convicted of a crime . He gave his address as 898 West End Avenue . Then Dixie Davis went out again , his dark glasses on once more , the ring of protecting detectives still around him .
