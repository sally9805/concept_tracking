The Gashouse is what old Tammanyites call New York 's 16th Congressional District , a long , jagged strip of Manhattan Island that touches Park Avenue , stretches across proletarian jungles under roaring elevated lines and brings up at the piers of the murky East River . There lived and reigned such Tammany greats as Richard Croker and Boss Charles Murphy and in the Gashouse stands Tammany Hall itself . There today live some of Manhattan 's poorest and some of its richest , for just uptown from the East River gas tanks that gave the district its name , the rich have built a riverside colony of towering apartment houses . Through this home of doormen , poodles , gamins and Irish politics last week reverberated the angry sounds of a highly important skirmish in Franklin Roosevelt 's Purge . <P> Purgee-designate was the man who has represented the Gashouse in Congress for 15 of his 52 years , squarejawed , redheaded , truculent Representative John Joseph O'Connor . A Massachusetts Irishman who has two blood ties with the New Deal ( his younger brother Basil was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fourth cousin ) , Tammany 's O'Connor has been only an off &; on New Dealer . He has been off more than on since the White House helped Texas ' Sam Rayburn beat him for the House Leadership , a situation not unlike that created when the President pushed " Dear Alben " Barkley into the Senate leadership ahead of Mississippi 's Pat Harrison . <P> Careful to keep a protective New Deal coloration on his voting record , John O'Connor used his chief function-as chairman of the powerful Rules Committee-to bottle up New Deal legislation , notably the Wages- &-Hours; Bill , which Rules twice kept off the floor until the White House prodded the House into discharging the bill from committee . Already marked for Purge when he went back to the Gashouse to campaign this spring , Congressman O'Connor wrote a letter to the New Dealish Daily News , claiming that his only actual anti-New Deal vote was against Reorganization . But he was too late , and Franklin Roosevelt branded his brow along with that of Millard Tydings by declaring that a New York Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 ) . <P> Purge-sponsored candidate , selected by the New Deal 's chief metropolitan patronage dispenser , Boss Edward J. Flynn of The Bronx , was James Herbert Fay . Purgee O'Connor and Candidate Fay are to the naked eye as much alike as two Irish politicians , but Mr. Fay , unlike Mr. O'Connor , was born in the Gashouse , has lived there all his 39 years . Short , barrel-chested , he lost his left leg in the Argonne at 19 , now gets about nimbly on an artificial one . President of Tammany 's Anawanda Club , Jim Fay ran against John O'Connor for Congress in 1934 , lost by 101 votes . Since 1935 he has held a $4,600 job as Chief Field Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue . His platform this year : 100% for Roosevelt . His most earnest hope : that Franklin Roosevelt or James Aloysius Farley will have time for at least one speech in the Gashouse before election .
