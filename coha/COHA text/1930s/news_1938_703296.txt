txt The first move toward an adjustment of major differences between House and Senate versions of tax revision legislation is expected to come from the House conferees Friday when joint sessions are resumed after a two-day layoff . The House group leaders , it was learned , are considering a meeting between now and Friday to take up a proposed compromise which would provide in general for retention of the major features of the House bill . including the principle of the undistributed profits tax , in exchange for the retention of the Senate capital gains and losses tax provisions . Chairman Harrison himself has stated that in his opinion the Senate 's capital gains and losses tax would make a vast amount of capital available for business and industry , thus being more beneficial to general recovery than any other single feature of the bill . Of the two subjects which are the main causes of the deadlock , capital gains and corporate income taxes , the former is the only one on which the Senate and House provisions really differ substantially as far as net result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undistributed profits tax principle , actually imposes a levy ranging only from 16% to 200 ' 0 on incomes , while the Senate provides for a Bat 187c tax . On capital gains , on the other hand , the Senate gives much more generous treatment to transactions on property held more than one year than the House bill ; and it is also more generous in permitting the use of capital losses . It is still considered unlikely that any agreement , even a tentative one , will be reached for some time to come- However ; a check-up last night of the prevailing views of conferees from both the House and Senate indicated that they all believe some compromise bill ultimately will come out of the negotiations . Senators from the industrial states , in private discussion of the tax issue Tuesday . stated that they are willing for the Senate conferees to stand out for the Senate bill as long as it will be necessary to get the best bargain possible out of the conference provided that chances for a moderated business tax program at this session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disadvantage Some of the strongest supporters of the Senate 's flat corporation tax  --  who incidentally are on the conference ' committee  --  declared that in their opinion President Roosevelt has indicated he prefers existing law to the Senate bill and that the Senate conferees are placed at a disadvantage in view of his interference with the negotiations between the two houses The canvass of conferees indicates that the entire responsibility for a tax bill favorable to business rests with Chairman Harrison of the Senate group and that any change in view by him is likely to win the support of a strong majority in the Senate . Senator Harrison . meanwhile , is understood to have taken the view that his bill would-have a much better psychological effect on business than President Roosevelt 's pump-priming and relief program . Hand in hand , the two might turn the tide of the depression , he is said to believe . For this reason , at least for the time being , Senator Harrison is expected to make a strong fight for the Senate 's version of tax legislation .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
