Cheered by 100,000 gathered at El Campo de la Victoria outside Saragossa , the swart little President of Rightist Spain , Generalissimo Francisco Franco , celebrated the first anniversary of his Cabinet last week by having a radio chat with the people of Leftist Spain . Cried Spain 's Robert E. Lee , purporting to address Spain 's Abraham Lincoln , the Leftist Premier Dr. Juan Negrin : <P> " It is time that all people whom you have got beneath your tyranny should know that your prolonged and absurd resistance is only a means to prepare your escape . It seems unnecessary to say it , since everyone knows it , that you are beaten ! Each day you prolong your resistance , each additional life you waste , every fresh home you sacrifice , each new crime you commit is a new count in the indictment you will be brought to face before our justice . For we have won the war ! " <P> The Rightist President announced that he and his followers have set out on a " quest for social justice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain " and that " agents of international Communism as well as Democracy " have helped Leftist Spain . In its territory , charged the Generalissimo , 400,000 civilians have been executed as political opponents of the Leftists " for the sole reason that they believed in God and their Fatherland , " Catholic Spain . <P> The Rightist President said that during the past year his Government , in addition to prosecuting the war , had stabilized prices , held down rents , abolished civil divorce and civil marriage ( restoring these matters to the Catholic Church ) , and had given the people in Rightist Spain a Charter of Labor . <P> Under this Charter , according to President Franco , his adherents are now in course of staging a Social Revolution , and he warned Spaniards of the old regime they are completely deceived if they think the Spain of Franco will be a repetition of the Spain of Alfonso XIII . According to Harold Callender , the New York Timesman present at the broadcast , the Generalissimo is trying to build a State " expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within limits , and which yet will be highly socialized.
