The epidemic of infantile paralysis in Los Angeles and San Francisco is not so dangerous as indicated by the number of cases ( TIME , July 2 ) , proclaimed Surgeon General Hugh Smith Gumming of the U. S. Public Health Service last week . He did not think that the situation warranted any discouragement of normal business , recreation or tourist traffic . <P> General Cumming 's optimism sprang from the unprecedentedly light mortality of the disease , which sometimes kills as many as 27 out of 100 victims . California 's present mortality is less than 1.5% . Why this is so no authority has ventured to guess . In other respects the spread of the epidemic has been typical . It began in May and apparently has reached its mid-summer peak . It shows lighter incidence in San Francisco ( 90 cases ) and Alameda County ( 106 cases ) , where the population has been long urbanized and exposed to the disease , than in Los Angeles County ( 949 cases ) where a large part of the population comes from the rural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had infantile paralysis was being used as a preventive . Such immunity could last only a few weeks . <P> In Manhattan last week Dr. Maurice Brodie , 30 , assistant professor of bacteriology in New York University , was certain that he had a poliomyelitis vaccine which confers long-time immunity . Likewise did his chief . Dr. William Hallock Park , 72 , whom New York City is retaining as director of the Department of Health 's bureau of laboratories although he is beyond the retirement age . Likewise did Dr. Brodie 's colleague Dr. Josephine Bicknell Neal , 54. and Dr. Henry Wirt Jackson , 48 , and Technicians Judith Figarsky , 24 , and Anne Goldberg , 22 . <P> Infected Rhesus monkeys supplied the material for the vaccine . Just as the monkeys were dying of infantile paralysis , Dr. Brodie killed them , snatched out their spinal cords which contained the virus of the disease , macerated the cords in a solution of formalin to kill the virus . This virtually is what other investigators of the infantile paralysis problem are trying . Dr. Brodie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans . <P> In principle the vaccine should create antibodies in the blood of Dr. Park and friends . Their fortified blood should be able to destroy or neutralize living infantile paralysis virus . This means immunity . <P> The Press tried to make heroes of those who submitted to injections of the Brodie vaccine . Reporters flocked to the laboratories . Laughed old Dr. Park : " I had a good night 's sleep and did n't even think about the injection . I got up this morning at 7:30 o'clock . Breakfast consisted of fruit , ham and eggs and coffee . I got to the office at 9:30 a. m. and began to work . I feel fine . Danger ? Pooh , pooh ! We wo n't know for a week or ten days what the reactions are . "
