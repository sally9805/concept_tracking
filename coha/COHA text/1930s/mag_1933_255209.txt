After a sensational three-month spurt President Roosevelt 's recovery program was slowing down last week . Farm prices had sagged from July highs , leveled out flat . September business was lagging behind August . NRA had yet to produce its miracle of re-employment . Public works made more headlines than new jobs . Banks were still tight-fisted on credit . Labor troubles pocked the land . Price rises due to NRA tended to cancel out A. A. A. gains in farm purchasing power . President Roosevelt was being bombarded with redoubled demands to turn to direct currency inflation as the one quick , sure means of keeping the country on a rising economic curve . <P> Into the President 's office last week strode Mississippi 's tall , bald Pat Harrison , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , just back from a scouting tour of the South and West . For years Senator Harrison has been a conservative " hard money " Democrat . Yet now he boldly told the President that only by currency inflation could his recovery program be made a success . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison as he emerged from the White House : <P> " Commodity prices have got to go up . I favor some form of rational inflation . We 've got to do more than we are doing . Personally I would try out the issue of Treasury notes . If commodity prices do n't rise , I do n't know when we are going to get out of this depression and the next Congress will repeal the President 's discretionary-powers and make monetary inflation compulsory . If something is n't done quickly , you can kiss the baby good-by-I mean , the baby of agricultural prosperity . The success of the President 's program may be in doubt . " <P> Living proof of Senator Harrison 's contention was soon furnished in Washington by the assembling of a cabal of cotton farmers ' spokesmen represented , with Oklahoma 's arch-inflationist Senator Thomas sitting coonily on the sidelines , by South Carolina 's Senator Ellison D. Smith and Senator John H. ( " Tallulah " ) Bankhead . More than 100 interested parties attended these caucuses , whose animated membership demanded two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment 's market price ) . <P> 2 ) $30 cotton seed ( per ton ) for the hand-to-mouth citizenry whose domestic economy has brought them scarcely enough to run their 1927 automobiles since 1929 . <P> Eugene Talmadge , Governor of the President 's " adopted " State of Georgia , was meanwhile recommending that the Government " print a lot of $10 and $20 bills and scatter them over the country by throwing the money out of airplanes . " <P> The new outcry for cheap money failed to stampede President Roosevelt . Nobody was more ready than he to admit that his whole recovery program was experimental , that some parts of it worked better than others , that knots and kinks were inevitable . He was not discouraged by last week 's slack-off . If one method of relief failed , he was willing to shift nimbly to something else , improvising as he went along . Currency inflation he still regarded as a last resort , to be used only in the event of a major business relapse . He did not propose to waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowing down in their advance .
