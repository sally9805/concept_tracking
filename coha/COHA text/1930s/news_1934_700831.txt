txt There is no apparent intention en the part of the New York Stock Exchange to change margin requirements adopted last August and which differ from the requirements as laid down by the Federal Reserve Board . It is pointed out the Exchange margin requirements were adopted after considerable deliberation and a survey of the situation . In the case of small accounts ? those below $5,000  --  the margin requirements of the Exchange are actually higher than those of the Federal Reserve Board . No great difficulty would seem to be presented in interpretation of the new margin regulations so long as present market conditions prevail . It is believed , however , as a result of the study by the brokers that as time goes on the application of the regulations will become more familiar and Exchange houses will be better equipped to overcome confusion resulting from a sharp change in prices .

Meanwhile the Association of Stock Exchange Firms announced that in cooperation with the New York Stock Exchange Institute , several meetings will be held on October S at which margin clerks of brokerage firms are invited to attend and discuss the new margin regulations . The controversy over the legality of the sale of 58.000,000 Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit bonds and their subsequent listing on the New York Stock Exchange is entirely a matter between that company and the Securities &; Exchange Commission , in the opinion of Exchange officials .
