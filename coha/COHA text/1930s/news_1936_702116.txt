txt The nearest thing to a real " brokers ' loan " report , now made available for the first time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System . indicates that stock and bond buying of the past year has been preponderantly of a " cash " nature . It shows that brokers ' loans to customers trading on margin increased from about $1. - 098,000,000 from September , 1935 , to a total still below $1,300,000,000 last July . This was an increase of roughly Meanwhile . the stock market as measured by Dow-Jones averages gained somewhat more . Industrials. by this measure , were up ** and railroad shares Purpose of New Study The new study compiled by the Reserve System 's Governing Board is designed to show the course of Stock Exchange credit . It provides for publication of customers ' debit balances , and other credit and debit items compiled from the records of member firms of the New York Stock Exchange . The credit extended to custobers by these Stock Exchange members comprises an estimate of 90 ' , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new compilation will be brought up to date monthly , starting with the currently released figures which cover the eleven months from September . 193.3. to July . 1936 , inclusive . It presents the best series of figures released to I date on the amount of borrowed funds used by margin account customers to carry stocks and bonds . Other Federal Reserve Reports Meanwhile , the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board released additional re . ports . It stated : Accumulation of funds in large deposits is curtailing demand for bank credit . Their I accumulation has enabled companies to snout hank borrowing or recourse to the capital markets . Member banks in meeting the 50% increase in reserve requirements %% hick ' went into effect on August 15 had to make adjustments which %%ere only " of relati  --  ely minor importance . " Principal interest , however , centers in the Board 's new compilation of statistics designed to show the course of Stock Exchange credit . Hitherto , two sources of information on " brokers ' loans " have been available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City , which includes an item on loans to brokers and dealers . The inclusion of dealers in this weekly total has always detracted from its usefulness as a stock and bond market credit barometer because government bond dealers , for example , borrow from banks in New York in the course of their business and these borrowings fluctuate in a way that has little or : no connection with Stock Exchange transactions . The other securities credit figure is the monthly report of collateral loans by members of the New York Stock Exchange . But some of these firms do no margin business at all and , therefore , the monthly statistics do not show exactly what investors and traders on marg-a have been doing . The new margin accounts figures are based ' on reports from those New York Stock Exchange firms which carry securities on margin . for their customers , Customers ' Debit Balances The most important record in the new tabulation is a set of monthly totals showing the trend of " customers ' debit balances " . Debit bale antes are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unpaid-for element in the securities field , or at least 90% or it according to Federal Reserve estimates . These estimates are based on the assumption ; that member firms of the New York Stock Exchange extend at least nine-tenths of all the credit in the United States that is extended by , brokers to clients . Like the other figures that were already , available , the new statistics indicate that the stock and bond buying of the past year has been preponderantly of a " cash " nature . In September , 1935 customers owed their brokers about $1,098,000,000 and at the end of last July the total was still below $1,300,000,000 . If we call this an increase of roughly 20% it compares favorably with an advance of about 28% in the Dow Jones industrial stock average in the last 12 months , a rise of 53% in the railroad stock average and even a gain of 26% in a group of bond like the Dow-Jones " second grade " rails . But it is not difficult to explain the " cash " nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money has come in . Exact amounts may be hard to compute but a good deal of the great inflow of gold from abroad is known to represent " capital transactions " and some of these " capital transactions ? have been stock and bond purl:Missesfor cash . Idle Deposits With demand for commercial money at low ebb and new security offerings fur below normal , there has naturally been a large amount of idle bank deposit money looking for work . Some of this has gone into the securities markets . Anybody with a large and unused bank balance has no need for broker 's credit when he seeks to invest in stocks or bonds  --  or even to speculate , for that matter . In the normal course of business , profits and earnings accumulate in the hands of successful individuals and corporations . Unless fresh investment opportunities are available to soak up the savings , demand for outstanding securities increases . This helps promote a rising market ? without at the same time drawing on credit . Furthermore , for the past few years the federal government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic system . In a sense , government borrowing has obviated the need for private borrowing . There is such a great surplus of banking funds ? partly due to governmental operations  --  that the task is to find use for it . Once the government borrows money from a bank and spends that money , it no longer is " credit " money . In the hands of him who receives it , it is the same as cash . What Puts Brokers ' Loans Up Another important fact that it is good to remember in connection with this subject of securities markets and credit , is that the experts agree it Is taking money out of the market . which puts brokers ' loans up . They believe , in other words , that a rise in security loans is more likely to show up when and if speculators and investors begin to cash their profits and , rather than reinvesting them in securities , divert the gains to other uses . It is then that the banking system is ordinarily called upon to fill the gap left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into houses , automobiles , living expenses and perhaps a yacht or two . This process is simpler than it sounds . If John Clearwitz , for example , buys Great American Steel common for cash at $50 a share and holds it for $150 and then takes his $100 a share profits with him on a trip to Bermuda , the fellow who buys the shares at 5150 has to have cash or credit to make those profits come true . Chances are he buys on Margin and thus bank borrowing enters just as Mr. Clearwitz departs .
