No U. S. city of 500,000 population except Washington , D. C. has five daily newspapers . Result has been that only one- Frank Brett Noyes 's stodgy Star-has made money ; seldom have they achieved any particular journalistic distinction . Five years ago among the least distinguished was the Post . When former Federal Reserve Board Governor and RFC Chairman Eugene Meyer bought the rundown property in 1933 for $825,000 , few thought that a banker , entering the publishing business at the age of 57 , would make newspaper history . <P> But Eugene Meyer has a fortune conservatively estimated , at $30,000,000 and a capacity for surrounding himself with able men . From The Brookings Institution , he hired an editor , Felix Morley ( brother of Christopher ) , who soon won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing . To give the paper zip , he hired a Middle-Westerner as managing editor , Alexander F. ( " Casey " ) Jones . The Post soon developed a set of features good enough to be syndicated . Brightest among them are the arresting cartoons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post doubled its circulation ( now 112,000 ) , more than doubled its advertising lineage . By last year , its $1,000,000 annual losses had been reduced to $400,000 . But Publisher Meyer was having too good a time with his newspaper to be fazed by such deficits . Last week , he celebrated the anniversary of his entry into the Fourth Estate by announcing the acquisition of the foreign news service and 14 features from the New York Herald Tribune , including Walter Lippmann , Dorothy Thompson , Mark Sullivan , Book Reviewer Lewis Garnett , Drama Critic Richard Watts Jr. , Sports Columnist Richards Vidmer and the impeccable Lucius Beebe , to whom Washington dress is " a little like country folks in sports clothes .
