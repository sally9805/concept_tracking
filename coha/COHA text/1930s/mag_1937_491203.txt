EVER since the election , this query has arisen on all sides . especially among businessmen and financiers : " What will the President do with the tremendous new power at his command ? " This question is the result of a political phenomenon  --  a popular and national verdict , almost unanimous as to states ; a President beholden to no class or group for his re-election ; an opposition reduced to legislative impotence . It is not surprising that leaders of finance and business are bewildered , sensing their misunderstanding of public opinion with respect to the policies of the President and their own . This query has often been addressed to me , among others by the editor of THE SATURDAY EVENING POST . In my opinion , there is another query which needs to be answered first , and I venture to propound it in return . It is : " What will the leaders of finance and industry do , in the light of the recent elec-tion ? " If these leaders continue to display an unrelenting disposition to hold fast to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implications of the election of November 3 , 1936 .

Not soon again , if ever , will we establish in office the philosophy that the welfare of the nation is advanced if we guarantee prosperity for the few . An English friend of mine puts the situation best : " There can not simultaneously and successfully exist in the same nation a political democracy and an economic oligarchy . " The Burning Question DUT the immediate signs are pro- pitious among the leaders of business and finance . The day after the election , the sign " Business as usual " was hung out .

That is for the leaders of business and finance to answer , and upon their answer , I think , depends the immediate future of legitimate business management in the United States . It may he recalled that about two days after the election there was published an exchange of letters between John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , and the Democratic National Chairman , James A. Farley . Mr. Rockefeller congratulated Mr. Farley for his statement of election midnight in which he promised that " there would be no reprisals . " Take Mr. Rockefeller 's letter as symptomatic  --  good as far as it goes . But if it were followed by a thousand other such letters , it would be of value only if fortified by an attitude in consonance with the sentiment therein uttered . This sentiment would amount to a pledge that business will en-operate with the President in his labors for a permanent recovery . .

Rare , indeed , it was to find an important executive who took the other position . In some instances , when an officer of a large company showed a disposition to foresee the popular determination better than his fellows , he was bullied or cajoled into lining up with the rest . One result of this has been , in my opinion , unfortunate . It was not unfortunate in its effect on the result , for a popular majority of eleven million votes and an electoral success in forty-six of the forty-eight states demonstrated the futility of individual positions . But the misfortune lies in the fact that many men who , by their experience and patriotism , are best qualified to advise the Congress must bring their advice into a hostile atmosphere of their own creating . Possibly because I was not one of those who responded to the pressure or emotionalism of my natural business friends and associates , I have been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what the future relations of Government and business should be . Accepting that role , though protesting my inadermacy for it , I venture to make certain proposals to those sections of American business and finance which have at last become aware of the direction in which the sovereign people have ordered the American Government to go . There are , of course , a great many program items that space will not permit me to enumerate at this time , but I should like to mention eight points to which business should give careful consideration : FIRST , Industry should lead the way in reviving the good aspects of the NRA , with the ultimate object of providing more employment in the United States and the elimination of unfair trade practices . This revival need not include government by executive order and remote control by Washington of the smallest concerns of village life . Those mistakes , natural to a hasty formulation , were swept away by the unanimous Supreme Court decision , and I do not understand that anyone in authority at Washington wants to revive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Social Security Act  --  objections relating primarily to method , and not to objective . We should remember that it has taken England more than twenty-five years to arrive at a workable plan of social security . But there are a great many points in the current act that must be studied in order to make it practical . Industry , instead of offering all the objections to the plan that can be thought of , should , out of its experience , offer ways and means to make it workable . THIRD . Industry surely recognizes the attempt of the President and the State Department to generate more business in the United States through the reciprocal-tariff treaties , It , therefore , should become 78 " They 're uncommon heavy for calves that . age , " growled Cal .

The issues have been of the highest grade and could have been sold many times over with no effort on the part of the bankers . A one-point spread would have given them a good profit . A number of issues of smaller New England utility companies have been offered for public bidding during the past year or two . In almost every case , the issues brought a higher price than was expected and were sold to the public with only a small spread . Within the past few weeks , a power-company issue of 3 ! 4 's was purchased through competitive bidding by a syndicate at about 102t2 and resold to the public at about:1033/4 . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the bonds of the larger system . During 1935 , a leading New York banking house handled two large industrial-debenture issues for a fraction of a point . It is understood that the firm made a good profit on the issues and was planning to handle several more on the same basis . The deals were very good for the industrial companies , as they cost very little and resulted in large savings in fixed charges . Presumably , many more industrial companies would have done similar financing . However , it is understood that most of the large investment bankers commenced to boycott the house which worked for such a small profit , and , as a result , that firm had to discontinue the type of business mentioned above . When Bankers Step In A large utility concern has For many years been directed in its financial affairs by a fiscal agent for the company in New York . A few years ago , the latter suffered reverses . At the time , it owed the utility , as a deposit item in the capacity of fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was settled by the giving of a note secured by residence real estate . This note has been carried by the utility for a number of years as a cash item . Banking control made such a predicament possible . A leading New York bank has for many years been in close contact with a leading power and industrial eoncern , presumably due to former personal relations between bank officers and corporation officials . Now the bank owns about 17 per cent . of stock , most of which , presumably , came from a loan defaulted by an official of the corporation . The bank now controls this great enterprise . In 1929 , a group of New York investment hankers acquired at a high price a large interest in a leading utility . In 1930 , they formed a corporation to hold this interest . About $20,000,000 had been borrowed from banks to make the acquisition . With the depression , earnings of the system declined . However , in order to get . funds to pay interest on the bank loan and to reduce it , these investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though not earned and even though the company had a $25,000,000 maturity in 1935 and no means in sight of meeting it . As a result of this dividend policy , the company was unable to meet the maturity in 1935 . High and Low Finance The indications are very strong that the principal reason for the acquisition , in 1929 , by the New York investment hankers was to enable them to get in on the financing of this large system . In 1935 , the utility probably could have got holders of the $25,000,000 debentures to extend the issue for five years . IF no commissions were paid to get bondholders to extend , no registration under the Securities Act of 1033 would have been required . Many companies obtained extensions in this manner . This utility . however , chose to register under the Securities Act and pay investment hankers  --  who controlled the company  --  two points to get the bonds extended . The original agreement with the bankers even provided that on bonds held by the bankers themselves , and extended , the bankers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result of the plan to give the bankers two points , the company had to register . It filed a registration statement so complicated that only by great skill and great patience did the SEC learn the real story . It required six months of effort before the registration statement could become effective . Incidentally , in the process the SEC required a complete recasting of the financial statements in order to reveal what had been concealed  --  to wit , that for a number of years dividends paid had exceeded net earnings . The bankers were not able to secure the consents of a sufficiently large number of the bondholders and late in 1935 the utility took steps to reorganize under the Federal Bankruptcy Law . This affair cost the company several hundred thousand dollars in accounting , legal and other expenses as well as several hundred thousand in bankers ' commissions , all futilely expended . It probably cost the company a million dollars of unnecessary expense and resulted in great loss of value of holdings to security holders . The investment bankers , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study at the request of Congress . This study showed serious shortcomings in our institution called the corporate trustee and in the protective-committee device which was supposed to he a method of protecting the holders of defaulted securities . Basically , the problem arises because of the helplessness of the individual security holder . The poorer he is the more insecure his position . Let us consider the case of Mr. A , who owns a bond of the X Company , which has defaulted in its interest . The Y Trust Company is trustee under the mortgage . It alone can institute proceedings to foreclose and to take the steps necessary to protect the security holder . The researches of the SEC have disclosed that this company which calls itself a trustee is in effect a mere stakeholder . Although the sale of the bonds has been aided by the prestige of the Y Trust Company , it gives the individual security holder practically no protection and has assumed numerous relationships which make it almost impossible for it to concern itself with the rights of the bondholders . Mr. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent abuses by the issuer or to protect him when loss is threatened . 11 Misleading Word There never was a more misleading term than the word " trustee " as applied to this situation . For years and years , the ingenuity of the Wall Street lawyers has been devoted to devising language which would immunize these trustees , so-called , from any sort of liability , with the result that for all practical purposes the elaborate indenture is mainly concerned with what the trustee need not do , what it is not responsible for , and how much it is to be paid for the elusive benefit conferred . The term " trustee , " as applied to the present system , must he abolished and some method devised to assure the small investor that he will receive from the agent who represents him a reasonable amount of protection against the wrongs of the issuer , even if the agent is to receive a larger compensation . Protection That Does n't Protect The activities of protective committees constitutes one of the most dismal chapters in the annals of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple . A company gets in financial difficulties . A single security holder can not act effectively for himself . Hence a committee seeks to secure authority to act for the security holders . But in practice it has resulted in the most vicious kind of imposition , double-dealing and downright fraud . The investigation by the SEC has revealed two general types of protective committees , and in their practices there is little to choose between them . The first , and by far the more common , is the investment-banker committee , and the second is what might he called the entrepreneur type , which is sponsored , usually , by a lawyer and is seldom but a racket for fees . The investment banker who sponsors a protective committee usually justifies his conduct on the ground that he is protecting the investor to whom he sold securities . This is seldom , if ever , t rue . The investment banker , except in rare cases , organizes these committees for selfish purposes , and the interests of the security holders are a secondary consideration at best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there existed major conflict of interest . In many cases , the investment bankers organized committees to act for one class of security holders when they themselves held large blocks of a different class of securities . There was bound to lie a conflict , to the detriment of the hapless and helpless investor . In the field of foreign defaults , ( Con0nnoal on Pogo 80 ) 80 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST , January 16,1937 ( Continued from Pate 78 ) the investment bankers were frequently found to be negotiating for the holders of long-term debt while at the same time they were owed by the issuer on short-term notes . Well , who won second prize ? You guessed it . The bankers did not . In many instances , the bankers organized a committee for the express purpose of taking command of the reorganization and , by covering up the evidence of their past wrongdoings , insulating themselves against liability . In practically every case , the bankers were motivated by a greedy desire to preserve or secure control , so that they might enjoy the perquisites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " graft " in public life . In addition to all these factors , the legal fraternity have distorted , by the most ingenious phraseology , a simple relation of principal and agent into a status where the agent lays down all the conditions and the principal who owns the security and does the hiring has nothing to say . After signing on the dotted line , the principal finds himself bound hand and foot by his protective committee . The immediate queryis : " Who is being pro-tected ? " As for the entrepreneur legal racket , a measure of discretion in the Securities and Exchange Commission could easily outlaw the type of racketeer and still leave room for honest and vigorous minority committees to watch the reorganization . I will hazard the guess that the Congress will abolish the institution of the investment-banker committee as it now exists . The record reveals that they have betrayed their trust . The SEC is now conducting , at the request of Congress , an investigation into the history and practices of investment trusts . For months the press has reported results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Every type of corporate evil that one could imagine has been shown in this study . Investment 71-113i5 It is really a paradox that our banks should have been the subject of such legislative concern almost from the beginnings of the country while investment trusts have avoided practically all Government supervision since they first developed in this country after the war . As a matter of fact , in one respect the investment trust needs greater supervision , since the security holder is unable to demand his money , as can a bank depositor . Consequently , the very threat . of deposit liability is a veritable sword of Damocles over the banker 's head  --  a threat , unfortunately , not present in the case of an investment trust . Our old friend , duality of interest , is found most frequently in this form of institution . The investment banker in this field has played a major part as sponsor . with the usual result . The record is replete with instances where these bankers have served their selfish interest over that of those for whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment-banking house sponsoring and controlling an investment trust than for a commercial hank to do so . The potentiality of evil is present and the choice of masters is inevitable . The relation itself should he outlawed by statute . In this way , the dealings as principal , the brokerage fees , and such perquisites as the insurance business of controlled companies , will be eliminated . Strangely enough , there was hardly a witness at the commission hearing who did not espouse the rause of Federal regulation of investment trusts . It is to be hoped that Congress will act in a thoroughgoing manner to give renewed meaning to the fiduciary concept so ably championed by the President . Today we see on all sides the evils of investment ? bankers serving on industrial corporations . If our premise be valid , this practice must end , and I venture to predict that it will be outlawed . I could fill many pages with recitals of how this relationship has been prostituted in favor of the hanker and against the best interests of the issuer . Excessive financing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host . of other evils  --  which , if they occurred in public life , would be unequivocally condemned as graft  --  are of frequent occurrence where this relationship persists . Multiple Directors Quite apart from the morality of the situation , the economic arguments seem to favor the abolition of this conflict of interest . The investment banker , if he is conscientious , has a full day 's task attending to the job of being an investment banker . The law should not ignore how little can be done by one man , no matter what may be his reputation . When one takes into account the strict obligation which is supposed to be assumed by a director , the high standard of care and good faith , the ease of one gentleman , a director in fifty-eight corporations , looks a little ridiculous . It is utterly impossible for him to serve adequately on the boards of one-tenth of these companies . Yet is mere numbers there is not only financial prestige but the inevitable perquisites . Of course , the forms of polite society are observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York transportation company , the subject of issuing bonds was up for discussion , and the minute book records that this director left the room . Then the issue was voted and his firm was named as principal underwriter . The minute book then records that the multiple director came back , but fails to tell us how surprised and pleased he must have been at this little evidence of his fellow directors ' confidence . The fact is that an investment banker should act as a financial adviser to a corporation and should not act as part of the management . In the first place , the relationship is morally wrong ; in the second place , it is not efficient , and , in the third place , the reason advanced for the practice  --  that the investment banker must watch the issuer , in the interest of the security bolder  --  is not a valid one . The time to watch the issuer and form a judgment about the trustworthiness of the management is before the money of the public has been taken . To these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to these suggestions of reform , the response of American business ought , in my opinion , to be candid recognition of the evils , admission of the need for reform , and constructive and fair-minded countersuggestions . These are some of the outstanding evils in the conduct of capital and finance that need correction . But there are two suggestions I am taking the liberty of making herein for real consideration by Government authorities . These suggestions have two purposes : The establishment of the safeand-sane economic conditions to effect which President Roosevelt has pledged himself ; and real and substantial aid to business . I propose : FIRST . Real modification of the capital gains tax . ( a ) To accelerate money . ( b ) To soften sharp breaks in the stock-exchange prices . ( c ) To eliminate the real handicap to American investors as against foreign speculators . S  --  COND . A revamping of the economic features of the new corporation tax . ( a ) To benefit new corporations , which must be encouraged . ( b ) To permit corporations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxation Dangers In considering modification of the capital-gains tax , I think the Govern-ment should allow increment growing out of sound investment to a man while he lives , and not take it away from him in wholly disproportionate taxes . England has found it salutary to encourage initiative by permitting a man to enjoy the fruits of his earnings from investments while alive , and has been satisfied to take its proportionate share of those earnings from the beneficiar-ies  --  recipients of wealth unearned by themselves  --  after the death of the man whose labors pur-chased the wealth . The argument for the repeal of the present tax should not only be a tra-ditional one ; it should also be based upon the fact that while American citizens are taxed on their security appreciation , other countries impose no such tax upon their nationals ; the foreigner can trade to tremendous advantage in our . security market , sell at the appropriate time and avoid assessment on his profits , whereas the American citizec is prevented , by the taxation laws of his country , from exercising even ordinary prudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also harmful . If Americans in large numbers are prevented from selling the securities and capturing profits , then stock inflation is accentuated , be . cause there is a premium put on holding stocks off the market . An artificial scarcity is thereby created that will make effective unwarranted price levels which inevitably and ultimately must collapse . Without spelling the matter out in detail , I can also see a benefit to the general economy of the country by the free exercise of judgment of practically all security holders . Corporation Surpluses The profits in security appreciation in recent years have been very great in the aggregate . If these profits were taken and used , then , on the mere principle of velocity of money circulation , business would be stimulated by the increased purchasing power thereby created . As it is , an inert and froze-mass of purchasing power reins , idle . My reasons are several for hopin that the Administration will take steps to undo the harm it has done to shrew corporate management by the ontoing undistributed-profit tax on corpo-7. rations . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purpose ; that the 5650,000,000 additional revenue needed by the Administration is assured by the flood of taxable dividends currently being made by American business corporations . The larger consideration , to my way of thinking , should prevail . The larger consideration calls for our restoring as a virtue in American business life the corporate practice of providing a reserve against the inevitable rainy day . We have all had experience with corporations which , no longer than three or four years ago , bad substantial operating deficits and would have been plunged into bankruptcy had they not accumulated surpluses in former prosperous years . It is a terrible thing to contemplate another period of business recession with large American corporations inadequately equipped to ride through the storm . In recent years , an economic revolu- I tion has occurred in this country , in the sense that millions of people have become investors in securities and count upon continuity of their dividend returns in budget ing their living expenses . Anything that would interrupt the continuous flow of dividends will rob the thrifty American investor of part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of things possible is inherently a bad law . I admit that the law has some substance . I admit that the hoarding of resources beyond the needs of potential crises by some of our corporations can not be justified . I know that during the period of wanton extravagance and bad judgment within the past ten years corporations spent money on plants and expansions for which they have never since had a need , and it would have been far better to have distributed those funds to stockholders . ( Continued on Page 82 ) ( Canelnued from Page 80 ) But these few instances do not offer justification of a tax which weakens the structure of a typical American business corporation and which actually penalizes the small and younger concern that has never been able , in the course of its development , to accumulate a treasury surplus . I hope and confidently believe that these inequalities and shortcomings in the present law taxing corporation surplus earnings will receive the prompt attention of the Senate Finance Committee . I feel , in general , that we are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation ago , This sudden development of our economic life into the corporate form , the rise of giant business , the separation of ownership and control , the evolution of management as an interest separate and distinct from , and often antagonistic to , the owners of a business , have reared a thousand difficulties . Gradually we are solving them under the leadership of the President , who is sponsoring the revival of standards of democracy to be applied to corporations of the present clay .
