BOUNDARY AGAINST NIGHT-Edmund Gilligan-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.75 ) . <P> Critics say that U. S. fiction began with the gothic romances of Charles Brockden Brown . They mean that it began with weird plots , wild scenes , frenzied speeches , mysterious encounters between mysterious characters . By next month Brown will have been dead 128 years , but U. S. fiction still has a gothic tradition that realists have never been able to conquer , running from Poe right down to the operatic extravagances of Thomas Wolfe . Last week its persistence was demonstrated by a long first novel that had all the ingredients of a gothic romance except a ghost , and which seemed all the more extraordinary because its wild scenes were laid in Boston in 1919 , and its gothic horrors tied to a social message . <P> Though it has no ghost , Boundary Against Night has almost everything else- spies , detectives , a conspiracy hatched after dark in a deserted church ; 3 mad philosopher who sees the coming of complete moral darkness over the earth ; a blind hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which appears from this account a bigger show than the French Revolution ) ; a mass of characters , largely Irish , drawn about equally from the police and the underworld ; returned soldiers , as embittered as they are eloquent ; three suicides , a rape , a robbery and a final thundering climax in which a crazy policeman attired in priestly garments shoots at a thief , hits a can of nitroglycerin and makes the devastation complete . There are a number of death scenes in which characters in their final agony rise as sturdily as opera singers to express their wrath , their views of the world and their lost hopes in prose poetry that owes a good deal to Thomas Wolfe and James Joyce . There is even a scene showing Calvin Coolidge telling homespun jokes in the State House . <P> But with all its headlong violence , Boundary Against Night follows a clear pattern , contains a dozen long narrative passages that stand out like detached stories . Its characters are stylized social types rather than conventional realistic portraits : Ben Coventry , blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless , is a symbol of sightless aristocracy that can not provide social leadership . John Hargedon , the hard-pressed , woman-chasing policeman , is a symbol of leaderless strength and courage that wastes itself . Ben Coventry lives in seclusion in his Beacon Street house , breaks with his class when the amorous wife of an old friend guides him to her house at night , slowly recovers his balance only to die in the riots when mobs rule the city and thugs assault his sweetheart . John Hargedon , after a long career trapping and abandoning girls , is himself trapped into marriage by a shrewd wench who despises him , robs a house during the strike , shoots two gangsters after the same loot , and dies an ironically heroic death .
