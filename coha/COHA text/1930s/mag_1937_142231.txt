In Washington last week U. S. Weather Bureau officials cautiously told newshawks that they were having good luck with " air-mass analysis , " a new weather forecasting technique which consists of a vertical examination of atmospheric conditions rather than a horizontal survey at Earth 's surface . On five days during the previous week the Washington office received upper air data from Harvard 's Blue Hill Observatory , where small sounding balloons were sent up with radio-meteorographs . These little gadgets contain a thermometer , hygrometer ( humidity recorder ) , barometer , shortwave radio transmitter and batteries , encased in a streamlined aluminum shell , the whole weighing about 2 lb . One of the balloons went up 12 miles . In Washington it was observed that a storm had penetrated that far into the stratosphere-or rather , that the storm had lifted to 12 miles the lower boundary of the stratosphere , since that region is by definition a calm , " weatherless " stratum . <P> The air-mass theory holds that great masses of cold air and others of warm air rolling over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog , snow . When a " cold front " slides over a " warm front " the air at the boundary is twisted and violent disturbances are likely to occur . The Weather Bureau is by no means the U. S. pioneer in this meteorological technique . In fact the Bureau 's critics , of which it always has plenty , have reproached it for not making greater use of the method once its value was demonstrated . The Bureau has a quick retort : it is doing what it can on its exiguous budget ( $3,861,000 for the current year ) . <P> Air-mass analysis was developed in Norway and was taken to the U. S. by Dr. Irving Parkhurst Krick of California Institute of Technology , who started using it for the benefit of air lines in 1932 . The late Harris M. Hanshue , then president of Western Air Express , found the Krick forecasts 96.1% accurate , estimated that they saved him $35,000 in one year . Currently Dr. Krick 's best customers are cinema producers , who some time ago discovered that good weather for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not buy . Dr. Krick 's uncanny ability to predict , a day or so in advance , the hour when rain will start or stop , when fog will roll in or lift , is reputed to bring him fat fees from cinema coffers .
