Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt graciously greeted a gathering of writers , critics and reporters last week at the Manhattan " editorial workshop ' ' of Philadelphia 's Ladies ' Home Journal . Momentarily lost in the bulky herd of Rockefeller Center office buildings , Mrs. Roosevelt had arrived a little late and out of breath at her own party . Its purpose was to inform the world that Ladies ' Home Journal will appear next week with the first installment of " This Is My Story , " Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt 's autobiography . These memoirs were billed as the first ever - written by a First Lady while resident in the White House . The Journal editors promised that Mrs. Roosevelt 's writings would be " unusually frank . " The stark honesty of the first installment , released at the announcement party , made plain that this was one editorial boast which was likely to be fulfilled . Extracts : <P> " My mother Anna Hall of New York City was always a little troubled by my lack of beauty , and I knew it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring me the eldest child up so well that my manners would in some way compensate for my looks , but her efforts only made me keenly conscious of my shortcomings . . . . My father Elliott Roosevelt , brother of Theodore Roosevelt , charming , good-looking , loved by all who came in contact with him . high or low , had a background and upbringing which were alien to her pattern . He had a physical weakness ... Whether it was some-weakness from his early years which the strain of the life he was living in Texas accentuated , whether it was the pain he endured , I do not know . . . . He began , however , to drink , and for my mother and his brother , Theodore , and his sisters began the period of harrowing anxiety which was to last until his death in 1894 . " <P> Last big job of magazine writing by Mrs. Roosevelt was " Mrs. Roosevelt 's Page , " a feature of Crowell Publishing Co. ' s sturdy Woman 's Home Companion for two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Roosevelt began dictating her autobiography , carried it up to the Democratic National Convention of 1924 , showed the manuscript to Franklin Roosevelt when it was done . The President suggested no changes , and Mrs. Roosevelt 's dapper literary agent , George T. Bye , made the sale not to Crowell 's Companion but to Curtis Publishing Co. ' s Home Journal . Proceeds of Mrs. Roosevelt 's writing and broadcasting have hitherto been donated to various charities . What charity would receive the Journal 's undoubtedly large check ( probably upwards of $50,000 ) , Mrs. Roosevelt last week did not say .
