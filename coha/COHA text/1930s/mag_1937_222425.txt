Through the bare corridors of the House Office Building one day last week padded an alert young German shepherd dog named Rex , a harness with a thick handgrip buckled around his shoulders . To the grip clung Rex 's master , Dr. Harry P. Claus of Arlington , Va. , a consulting engineer blinded in an airplane crash three years ago . Man and guide turned into a room where a sub-committee of the Interstate Commerce Committee was considering unfavorably a bill to require railroads to permit blind men 's dogs to travel with them on trains . <P> Present to oppose the bill was R. V. Fletcher , counsel for the Association of American Railroads . He argued that there was no necessity to fix one more onerous law on railroads , that they were glad to do of their own free will what the bill proposed . The subcommittee 's Chairman Alfred L. Bulwinkle of North Carolina and his colleagues were inclined to agree with him . Then Dr. Claus and Rex walked in . Eloquently the young engineer told of the months of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing Eye institute in Morristown , N. J. Most railroads , he conceded , had indeed been willing to let him and Rex travel together , but one had forced them both to ride in a baggage car . As he talked , Rex , with even more eloquence , was thumping his bushy tail on the green committeeroom carpet . Seeing Eye dogs , declared Rex 's master , were taught always to be friendly with everyone , unless commanded otherwise . Amiably Rex rose , stalked up to R. V. Fletcher , stuck out his paw . Grinning , the railway counsel unbent and shook the paw . Unseeing Dr. Claus continued his plea . The 13-month-old dog rolled over on his back , waved his paws , swished his tail . Dr. Claus stopped talking , unleashed the dog . With a bound Rex leaped to Chairman Bulwinkle , licked his hand , his chin . Then the big pup made a circuit of the room , pawing Congressional knees , shaking Congressional hands . After a final shake with Chairman Bulwinkle 's daughter , called in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuzzled his knee . " The subcommittee , " twinkled Congressman Bulwinkle , " will favorably report this bill . " <P> As the economy-minded Senate considered the $571,000,000 Department of Agriculture appropriation bill last week , Idaho 's conscientious Borah spotted an item of $1,000 for care of a herd of cattle in Oklahoma 's Wichita Mountains . It had been recommended not by the Department of Agriculture but by the Senate Appropriations Committee , and Senator Borah rose to question it . Up stood the item 's sponsor , Oklahoma 's handsome white-crested Elmer Thomas , to explain that the cattle were one of the last herds of longhorns left in the U. S. " These cattle are friends of mine , " cried he . " I have been down to see them . I know them . " <P> " If these cattle are friends of the Senator from Oklahoma , " gravely assented Senator Borah , " then I 'm satisfied . "
