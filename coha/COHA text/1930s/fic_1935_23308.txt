THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEENIS She has a country place . . . " Those damn thing , " Pietro-angelo Cocozzello exclaimed to young Pozzi . " Ten thousand those thing around . Who she think she is ? She no own the great big State for New York . " With his twelve-gauge shotgun , carried under his arm , he pointed at the frayed weathered cotton sign , tacked on the leafless tree beside the gap in the stone fence . The sign read : WARNING . PRIVATE LANDS . HUNTING , TRAPPING OR TRESPASSING FORBIDDEN UNDER PENALTY OF THE LAW . ADELAIDE M. DARBY , PROP . " They make me crazy , " Cocozzello grumbled . " Bandite di caccia . ' Every tree , she say , Tandite di caccia . ' I shoot next one . " Three bars had been laid across the gap in the fence . Leaving the frozen rutted road , Cocozzello handed young Pozzi his gun and climbed over the bars . Pozzi passed both gulls , muzzles forward , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were matted with sapless poison ivy vines . " She 's got it posted for miles up and down this road because that 's the law , " young Pozzi said , jumping into the Darby pasture . They hunted down hill , several feet apart , guns ready . The sour abandoned field was grown over with birch shoots and fox grass . There were no rabbits , and they crossed Whippoorwill Creek , the brittle ice edges splintering under their boots , and started up the opposite slope . The country was autumnal . Rolling half-cultivated valleys , geometrically parcelled by stone walls , lay between the wooded hills . The hills recurred one beyond another like the stumps of mountains . Underfoot in the grown-over field , occasional corn stubs , two or three years old and never plowed under , were rotting . " Nobody care for land , " Cocozzello grumbled , kicking at the hummocky corn roots . " Nobody make land to grow . Owner no care for this land . " " It 's no good . I would n't take it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " In Italy she consider a good land . She grow lot . The land want to work . The land like a woman . Woman work good for the husband . She no work for strangers . She lazy for strangers . " " You Italians are all crazy for land , " young Pozzi said . " What do you want land for ? Not for me . I know when I 'm well off . The hardest work I ever want to do on the land is to hunt rabbits . " " In my village , in Le Puglie , Don Sebastiano own all the land . He never come home . He go Naples and get rotten with Neapolitans woman . All poor people work for Don Sebastiano 's fattore . Fattore , he cheat Don Sebastiano . Fattore , he cheat everybody . " " Sure , " young Pozzi said . " I know . So one day you up and shoot the fattore . I know you South Italians . " " I have to go to war . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse down in Le Puglie , do they ? " " You too fresh for young kid , " Cocozzello said grinning . They crossed another stone fence and continued up the hill through the woods . " It day of Santa Cecilia or I shoot you . " " When you are n't gunning for landlords and their agents , what do you hunt in Le Puglie ? " " Tordi . You know tordi ? He brown bird . He sing . " Cocozzello imitated the bird call . " Very sweet . Tordi eat the olive . He get big sweet fat on the olive . He love olive . Pizza de tordi . That is one good dish . " " Thrushes , " young Pozzi jeered . " Tordi are thrushes . That 's nothing to shoot . What 's the matter with you Italians ? The old guineas around here go out and shoot sparrows even . Sparrow pie . Pizza degl ' ochellini . Italy must be some place . Nothing to eat but polenta , twelve out of one dish , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of sparrows or a thrush sometimes . When I go hunting I want to shoot something bigger than the end of my gun . " " You not know Italy , " Cocozzello defended . " She better than you think . But what happen ? Everybody go hunt . Everything is shoot quick . " They came out on the top of the high wooded ridge . There were huckleberry bushes and spaces of naked schist , and underfoot the frost-rotten earthy leaves . Except for the oaks , the trees were bare , and through the branches they could see far up and down the valley . On the far side of the valley was an old summer house , weathering black , fancy with gablesand veranda . The lower story was boarded up . Suddenly Cocozzello threw his gun to his shoulder and fired . The snapping echo ran from hill to hill . " What do you think you 're doing ? " young Pozzi shouted . " Those shells cost five cents apiece . We only got eighteen now . " Cocozzello calmly ejected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket . He had blasted the trespassing notice twenty feet ahead of them . " What for she post , " Cocozzello demanded , " if she no got rabbits ? I no like her . " Young Pozzi was examining the tree . " The guy that stuck this notice way off up here sure had ambition , " he said . " Say , give a look . " The shotgun charge , at close range , had torn the notice into hits . Across the bottom a single tag remained , fastened in the cedar by two tacks . " Look at this . " Under the name , Adelaide M. Darby , they read in very fine print the address as required by law : " Palazzo D'Albro , Via Borgoguona , Florence , Italy . " . . . and an independent income The day 's tape from the stock and grain tickers overhung the baskets and tangled on the floor . It was a few minutes past four o'clock , E.S.T. , and the New York Exchange was an hour closed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on his desk out of the way , was going through Leiber 's report . He looked at Leiher once , quickly and totally , like a snapshot , as Leibcr entered the office , and then with a grimace of concentration , returned to the confidential balance sheet of Everett , Easton &; Darby . " Look like a good thing , Leiber ? " he asked cursorily and ran a circle round the figures for Cash In Bank and Sur-THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY plus Account . Before Leiber could reply , " George , " he shouted , " George , " and bolting to the door of the outer office , shouted to his secretary , " Take all my calls , " and shut the door . Mr. Preinreich , entering by an inner door , followed Mr. Chilton 's example and closed the door . " Yes , sir . " Mr. Chilton , settling back into place , opened his eyes amusedly at Leiber 's too eager and ready opinion . He flipped the typewritten report across the desk to Preinreich with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , " and returned to Leiber . " Come on . Get it out of your system . Let 's hear . " " To begin at the beginning , " Leiber said , " the company is old , incorporated in 1862 , chartered by special statute in Connecticut , and the line is cutlery , silverware , meat choppers , skates , scales , vacuum bottles , household hardware . The plant at Webster , Connecticut , has three hundred thousand square feet of floor area , with rolling mill , power plant ? " Mr. Chilton interrupted brusquely . " Skip . I know all that . One of the war babies . Bayonets . Went to 147 in 1917. " " 174 , sir , on June 3 , 1917 . " " Never mind . What did Easton have to say ? " " He wants to get out . They 've just lost the renewal of the Montgomery Ward business and he 's down in the mouth generally . Thinks the company 's future is poor . Easton 's young , about thirty-five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of big ideas , not seasoned yet , and he 's all hopped up about the future of pre-fabricated houses . Knives and forks are too slow for him . There are 80,000 shares in the Company . Easton has 40,000 , about 7,000 scattered , and 33,000 tied up in a life trust . He wants you to unload the stock for him . It 's on the Curb but inactive ever since the War . He 'll give you an option for the whole 40,000 shares at fifteen dollars a share . " " What do you say ? " " That 's bottom . Hell peddle them somewhere else first . " " There might be something in it , " Mr. Chilton said , slapping his knee and jumping to his feet . " The market 's right . " He crossed the room briskly and switched off the translux projection which had shone idly on the wall for an hour . " What do you think , Preinreich ? " Preinreich fingered the typewritten report and looked uncomfortable . " I have n't had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Chilton stopped his pacing . " Heavens , man , " he burst out , " I know that . All you can give me is a horseback opinion and that 's all I 'm asking for . What do you think ? " " How tightly are those 33,000 shares tied up in this life trust ? If they came on the market during the move . . " " How about that , Leiber ? " " They 'll stay where they are . Old man Darby was one of the founders and when he died he left the stock in trust for his son and daughter during their lives . Son 's dead . Easton showed me a copy of the will , and the trustee is expressly restrained from disposing of the holding . Another thing , while I think of it  --  old man Easton and old man Darby had some kind of gentleman 's agreement not to sell out on the other ; but Easton says it was never in writing and he does n't see any reason to consider himself boundby it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " he said , resuming his pacing . " Forget it . What else ? What about present conditions ? What about labor ? " " The business is actually run by a salaried man who 's very capable . He 's pared his labor costs down about forty per cent since 1929 . The organization is down from about seven hundred fifty employees to four hundred today ; they 've taken four wage cuts , and Webster is one of those small towns  --  only two other factories there  --  and there has n't been any labor trouble . Most of them are foreigners , Polacks , Wops , Canucks . The unions ca n't do anything with them . If the company had the business it could get two hundred men overnight . The men are there , hungry for the jobs . Women too . There 's no serious risk of labor troubles under those conditions . " " I want to come back to this trust , " Preinreich interjected stubbornly . " I 'm not satisfied . This daughter you mentioned . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't that true ? What if she should die ? " " I thought of that , " Leibcr grinned , satisfied with his own foresight , " and asked Easton . Her name is Adelaide M. Darby . She 's an old maid , about fifty-five years old , in excellent health , lives abroad . She takes absolutely no interest in the business so long as she gets her dividends . She made a stink , I guess , several years back , in 1930 , when they cut the dividend fifty cents ; but they 've maintained the dollar rate ever since and she 's used to it now . Apparently she 's exactly what you 'd expect , fussy , getting eccentric , wears black , and all wrapped up in art , tea , titles  --  the usual line of crap . She has n't been back to this country for five or six years . " " How do you know her health is good ? " " For Christ 's sake , Preinreich , " Mr. Chilton roared . " Leiber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when a woman gets past fifty and looks and acts healthy , and has plenty of money , and her old man lives into the eighties  --  longevity is inherited , you know  --  and she goes over to Europe and lives on the fat of the land , how long do you think she 'll live ? " " I do n't know , " Preinreich said . " Hell 's buttons . The man 's a fool when he gets away from statistics . Listen , Preinreich . Get this . We are n't going to worry our heads any more about the lady . " " All right , " said Preinreich , shrugging . " If you say she 's healthy , all right . " .. . dresses quietly and well The three embroidery needles flew to the right , hands tugged at the thread momentarily , and the needles dipped , flying back , three thimbles charging after them . " Do or do n't , " Estelle snapped , her needle flying faster than the others . " It 's nothing to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says about me . " Rose nudged Maritza . " Mrs. Highhat-my-hat do n't care . Oh , my no . She do n't care what he says . We should just forget it . " " Okie-doke . " Maritza 's suffocated laughter whistled from her like escaping steam . Ten women were at work in the crowded back room , smelly from the steam presser , and as the forewoman had gone into the stockroom for the moment , they were all talking without lifting up their heads from the work tables . The heads were all dark , except a peroxided blond one , and bent , eyes close to the work , under the glass-shaded droplights . The three embroiderers had a table to themselves ; as it was January and the off season , five seamstresses had been let go . At the sound of Mrs. Baumgarten 's high heels on the uncarpeted hall floor the talk ceased . Mrs. Baumgarten returned with a bolt of unbleached muslin , put away the keys to the stockroom , and went to work cutting . " Imagine worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered Rose against the hum of the sewing machines . " Can you feature that . " " Gas about something else then for a change , " snapped Estelle . " You give me a pain with your elevator man . That dope . Do n't you dumbheads have nothing else on your mind ? " " Anything to oblige , " Rose sang , biting off the thread and nudging Maritza . " We always do what she wants , do n't we , Maritza ? " and with a glance at Mrs. Baumgarten 's hack and a quick movement , she held up the white batiste corset cover on which she was embroidering . " How 's this ? " The corset cover was entirely handmade and finished with a peplum , the scams hand-felled , the edges hand-scalloped , the beading hand-done , and down the front , in hand-worked buttonholes , six tiny pearl buttons . Against the white gathered fullness the embroidery hoop made a taut prominent circle on the left side . " Wait . " She dropped her hands from her shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to show you something . " Snatching up another set of hoops , she fixed them in place and , watching Mrs. Baumgarten like a cat , she held up the corset cover again . The hoops , each five inches across , like two whirls of a charcoal crayon , presented the sudden caricature of a woman . Maritza gurgled aloud ; when Mrs. Baumgarten straightened , Rose was threading her needle , the corset cover in her lap . " Imagine anyone wearing corset covers in this day and age , " Rose whispered , twisting the thread to a dampened point between her teeth . " Just feature the old girl climbing into the works . " " A fat old momma , " chimed in Maritza . " Stop it . Tell me what he said , if you do n't want to feel these scissors in your locus . " " Hear that . " " Am I listening . " " We got other things to talk about now , " Rose said . " Her initials are A. M. D. , " Maritza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own work . " You got to do a monogram when you finish the forget-me-nots . " Estelle leaned toward them , her eyes on Mrs. Baumgarten . " I know all about her , " she asserted importantly and swayed hack to her work . " I 'll trade with you . Balmy told me when she handed me the work . It 's good . " They looked at each other from the corners of their eyes . " Why not tell ? " said Maritza . " Why be foolish . I 'll tell . The elevator man told Sema you were the only girl in the back room that acted like a lady . " " Wait a minute . Not so fast . Get it right . He said she was the only girl around here that carried herself like a lady . " " What 's the difference ? " said Maritza . " Is that all ? " said Estelle . " I thought it was going to be something . Mine is something . " " He probably means she looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know what else . If the customers up front are ladies , to judge by the measurements , there 're no ladies with flat stomachs and two shoulders the same heighth . " Maritza gurgled . " He did n't mean that . He meant he did n't dare get fresh with me . Which is more than some people can say . " " Sure , " said Rose . " We all know where you kicked him . Come on . What 's yours ? " " I 'm half a mind not to tell you . " " Do n't , " said Rose . " Come on , " pleaded Maritza . " Mine is something , " Estelle whispered . " Listen . I 'll tell . It 's funny . This old girl has been coming to Madame 's for her underthings for thirty years . Of course Madame has all her measurements and every year , without asking or saying anything to the old girl , they make the corset covers half an inch bigger . Every single year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " These are 46 's . " " That 's right , " said Estelle , wriggling with delight , " but the old girl still imagines she 's wearing a 36 bust . " " That 's a scream . " " She 's awful rich and never married . Balmy says she ca n't bear the thought of ready-mades against her skin . " " Oh , boy . The skin no man has touched . " " Can it . Balmy 's looking . " " Hotcha , " said Maritza under her breath , bending to work . . . . is devoted to art Mr. Sachs , the proprietor of Sachs Gallery , having left his inconsiderable business in the hands of two capable women , in the course of his afternoon constitutional stopped before the Fifth Avenue windows of the Vandaman Gallery . Mr. Sachs narrowed his eyes , pursed forward his over-developed lower lip , and thought poorly of the oil painting in the window . The painting resembled a cassone panel . Against an Italianate background a procession of gothic hunters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the window noticed the current exhibition of paintings by Walter Arden . Mr. Sachs had never heard of Walter Arden . He several times shook his garrulous old head  --  he always covered it with a black fedora ? and entered the gallery . The young woman in attendance , whom Mr. Sachs immediately classified to himself as worse than so-so in appearance and disregarded , recognized and spoke to him . He walked throughthe gallery quickly , verifying that there was no one in Vandaman 's either , merely two nondescript women of no age nor style such as are always visiting galleries without so much as inquiring the prices . He examined at the same time Walter Arden 's paintings and his first impression hardened into an impregnable conviction . The attendant , who had slipped away for a moment , came back with Mr. Vandaman . The two dealers shook hands . At Vandaman 's question , back and forth commiseratingly went the garrulous old head ; Mr. Sachs waved disparagingly at the walls . " The entire gallery too , " he marveled . Vandaman clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Decidedly interesting , I think , " he said . " Very , " said Mr. Sachs acidly , resisting the suggestion that he withhold his opinion . " The boy 's a fool . All this mystical , allegorical , romantical business . " He waved again . " Does n't he know that the pre-Raphaelites died out forty years ago through inanition ? There is nothing harder in any art than to be a successful romantic . Tennyson and Botticelli . He should n't . He really should n't . The next stage will be cornucopias and the matrons of Industry and Agriculture . " Vandaman bridled . " You 're too harsh , " he remonstrated . " There 's something to be said for the lad . At present he lacks vigor but he is only twenty-six and he 'll develop . I 'll confess that I would n't take the boy up myself , but speaking strictly in confidence , he met my price for exhibition space  --  or rather someone else did for him  --  and after all , in these times . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake of the head . " I could n't do it , " he said . " He ca n't paint and he wo n't sell . What more is there to be said ? " " But he can paint  --  note : a sense of wit , an over-valuation of composition , the veridical technic of a miniaturist  --  there you have it . His next stage is surrealism . " " Pfui , " scoffed Mr. Sachs openly and immoderately . " Pfui . You defend him cleverly , my dear fellow , but there is simply nothing there CO de-velop . " " I wanted you to say that , " Vandaman declared , a premonition of triumph edging his voice . " Come with me . I have something to show you ? ' In the disorderly private rear office , Vandaman ransacked among the canvases , framed and unframed , which leaned untidily , one against another , on tables , chairs , and the floor . With an exclamation he lifted out the work for which he was searching and propped it facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he announced , brushing the dust from his hands and clothes . From a draped black coffin a shower of knives and forks was falling , accumulating in a pile , and in the pile , some nearly covered. , others standing upright , were crutches . The background consisted of rubble heaps like barren brown mountains . A red tasselled lasso , alive in midair , hovered over the upright crutches and an arm in the puffed sleeve of an old-fashioned black-silk bathing suit held the end of the lasso . The arm projected from behind the coffin . Here and there bluebirds flew , which seemed to have nests in the draperies of the coffin . " What are those mountains made of in the background ? " " Wooden nutmegs , " Vandaman said gleefully . " The objects like croquet mallets are crutches . " " Very interesting . Another allegory , but this time the symbols are private . I fancy the complete interpretation would give me a headache . Who is the lady ? " " That is correct . The identity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . The crutches , of course , are the artists . " " Ha , " derided Mr. Sachs . " Very lucid . But if you do n't mind , my dear fellow , may I hang on to reality ? Who is she really , if it is not a secret ? " " On the contrary , she insisted on having her name appear in the catalogue of the exhibition . Darby , Miss Adelaide Darby . She lives in Florence , owns a Tiepolo , I believe , and a few Guido Renis . She is n't weal thy enough really to go in for paintings . She has a fine collection of certosina work though , and has helped several young artists , none of whom as yet has amounted to anything . She 's very particular . Only unimpeachable Anglo Saxons need apply . No Jews , Irish , Italians , et cetera . Arden is her present hope and the pre-Raphaelite influence is hers . " Mr. Sachs turned his back , stiffened with all the rigors of contempt , on the painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do I understand you seriously to claim that because this boy has painted this thing behind her back , it proves there is a chance of his amounting to something ? " " More or less , " Vandaman said , nettled . " This surrealistic experiment indicates that he is only using her . When the time comes he will strike off for himself . " " Nonsense , my dear Vandaman . Do n't you see ? it is she who is using him . For a few dollars she buys a participation in the creative act . Then she imposes her own will . Doing work behind her hack  --  is that the vitality of the artist ? There is some sickly maternalism at work here . She domineers over his creativeness like a mother over the growing virility of her son . It is a secret female vice . Women have nourished artists but they have never nourished art . Lovely creatures , Vandaman , lovely creatures  --  they have their uses  --  but they dilute an artist 's force . No woman , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cobwebbed in her virtue  --  can play the patron to great art . The patron must be male . " " Possibly , possibly . But the point is , Arden realizes all that . He is awake . He calls this The Artist as Prot6ge . And he has shown the artist as a crutch . " Mr. Sachs put on his black fedora disdainfully . " I do not believe it , " he said , ringing with a conviction so fixed that Vandaman shrugged . " Arden imagines he is awake but unconsciously he is one of those Imehirds . Old maids are not attracted to eaglets. " . . . and to her brother 's family " What does that young snip want ? " grumbled Mr. Shipley , throwing down his work . He tore off a slip of scratch paper , marked his place in the record on appeal from the Surrogate 's Court which he was studying , and scowled at his secretary . " He 's old enough by this time to know he should n't drop in here without an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which one , did you say ? What 's his first name ? Tell me his first name . " " Mr. Raglan Darby . He 's in his second year at Yale . " " Have him in and let 's get rid of him . " The senior partner of Shipley , Shelton , Faithful &; Towbriner angrily pitched the record to the far end of his desk . " Raglan , " he fumed . " Yale . Raglan . What kind of a name is that ? That 's his mother . His grandfather must squirm in his grave at the sound of it . " Mr. Raglan Darby was nineteen , very casual and assured , but to Mr. Shipley 's way of thinking , limp . " How are you , Raglan . Glad to see you again . How 's it going at Yale ? Second year , is n't it ? Unless I 'm mistaken , this is the Easter vacation . " " Right , " said Raglan , collapsing into the nearest chair He flashed open his cigarette case , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and snapped the case shut dextrously . " Mother and I ran into town for today and to-night . We 're going to the theater . I want very much to see Katharine Cornell . I 'm a bit interested in the stage just now . " He gave his sentences an assertive inflection that induced pauses . " I 'm quite interested in it , " he repeated . Mr. Shipley waited unresponsively . " Mother wanted to come in and sec you , but she never gets into town any more and she has a hundred matters to attend to , so she sent me . " Mr. Shipley nodded . " It 's about Aunt Addie , " Raglan plunged , flipping ashes toward the carpet 's edge . " You see , Mr. Shipley ? I -- Mother told me to be extremely tactful about this . I believe in tact of course , but considering everything ? " he paused and considered everything for five seconds . " We 're two men and I think I 'll come straight out with it . For nearly a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly , you know  --  she refers to a Father Bentley . She mentions Father Bentley taking her to visit a church , or they meet at teas , or he discovers some knickknack that she wants ? little things like that . The point is , who is this Father Bentley ? Mother has some friends in Florence and she 's written to them and they say he 's an Englishman , an engaging sort of person , and like a Catholic father , only he is n't a Catholic ; he 's an Episcopalian ? very High Church . I forget the name of the order . Mother knows it . Mother wondered if you knew anything about him . " " 1 never heard of the man , " said Mr. Shipley , shortly and emphatically , with the conclusion of the interview in mind . " Then he ca n't have been mentioned in the codicil that Aunt Addie made in February , " Raglan cried triumphantly . " You would certainly remember it if you had seen his name there . " Tilted back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted laughter of a father who sees his infant 's fist clenched and the blow aimed at him for the first time . " I 'll have to look out for you , Raglan , " he said . " You 're pumping me . " Raglan stirred uneasily . " I 'm sure your mother told you that , as your aunt 's attorney , I 'm not free to divulge the contents of a codicil without her consent . " " Mother said that you were the family lawyer . " " There are some confidences that even a family lawyer must respect . Let 's get down to cases , Raglan . What is it that your mother wants to know ? " " Agreed , " cried Raglan . " I 'll be frank with you and you be frank with me , " and ignoring Mr. Shipley 's demurring face , " Aunt Adelaide is getting along  --  Mother says she 's fifty-four now  --  and when a woman gets to that age , particularly if she 's never married , her repressed sex life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody knows that , " he said to Mr. Shipley 's eyebrows . " It 's called sublimation . One sees it working on every hand . " " So , " said Mr. Shipley . " Now if this Father Bentley is as clever as he is supposed to be he might get a very strong hold on my aunt , and when she dies we 'd wake up and find that instead of leaving everything tous , she 's left it to the Church of England , or these Fathers , or who knows what . " " You 're perspicacious , Raglan . " " Then what ? What arc we to do ? We could break the will when the time comes but we ca n't sit by now and let this person ingratiate himself with my aunt in her old age . No . It is n't right . Mother and I have discussed this thoroughly and Mother wanted me to ask you this . Aunt Addle likes me , we know . She likes young men . There are all those artist boys that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal , Mother thinks . We had it in mind that I should go over and see Aunt Addie this summer , and if this Father Bentley is n't all that he should be  --  I mean if he 's taking advantage of my aunt 's religious emotions  --  then Mother thought I should persuade Aunt Addie to come back with me for six months , so as to break this man 's hold over her . I 'll tell you frankly , I 'm very keen to go over , but mother is always looking at the practical side . Mother has a very good head on her . I guess you know that . She says we ca n't afford it unless it 's absolutely necessary . There , I 've told you everything . I want to go very much , but for Mother 's sake I must put the question up to you fairly .

Hit me . " In the corner Perce Trenchard , proprietor of the cigar store up front , was reading the Omaha Bee , his feet in a chair . Cap Walcott placed the bottle carefully on the floor . " Hey , Perce , " he called . " Hey . Quit reading the paper . Listen to me , Perce . " " Do n't get him started , " said one of the players . " Keep quiet , Cap . " " Listen , Perce .

She 's not supposed to be so hot but her dinners are good . So one day invite comes for me and Captain Kerfoot . Will we come ? Okay . Did n't think nothing about it . That was the one big mistake of my life , Percc. it was now , ' cause listen , when the time comes , last minute , this guy Kerfoot , he ca n't go . I 'm in awful hole , Perce . " I ca n't back out , can I ? Would n't be polite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the country a ways , so I dolled up and my orderly  --  hey , Perce . You listening ? I 'm sitting there in the parlor , waiting for this Darby dame , all in a muck of sweat , I 'm that scared  --  and in she comes . " I 'm not going to exaggerate , Perce . In my honest opinion  --  this my honest opinion  --  she was n't so much . Nothing to make you forget your company manners . No spring chicken either . Just a woman , Percc . She was about forty and getting on to stout , and you knew she had n't ever looked sidewise or kicked up her heels  --  nothing gay about her , just respectable sort . Hey , Perce , I 'll tell you who she reminds me of  --  that teacher 's been here so long , teaches seventh grade  --  Breed , her name is . That 'll give you an idea how she looked . " " Last time , " one of the players remarked , " she looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perce . At first it did n't go so good . I made excuses for Captain Kerfoot and we talked along . About the War mostly . She was strong for the War . Every now and then the conversation goes into awful tailspin . By and by dinner , wine , things loosen up a little . I remember she 's set on licking the Huns . Pretty soon she gets to telling me how interested she is in people  --  how she learns about everything because the maid gives her the lowdown on her life and so does the cook , I guess , and the delivery boy and so on . It gives me an idea . " I begin shooting off about my own life and she seems to eat it up . I begin with my ancestors , how they come out to this country in a covered wagon and scalped Indians  --  she seemed to swallow anything , so I made it good  --  and about my grandmother , how when she caught two ornery worthless dirty Sioux stealing a flitch of bacon out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the bead on them and makes them put it back . I told her that and about when I was coming in here to school and you guys used to chase me for a country kid , so I loaded up my dinner pail with stones and swiped Beef on the side of the bead and laid him out cold  --  remember , Perce ? " " I got you for that , " Beef muttered . " Remember that too ? " " And about the time I was doing guardmount at Fort Snelling and three regulars jumped me and I fought them off till they slugged me unconscious and stole my pistol . They used to do that and sell the gun . You could get about twenty bucks for those army Colts . And about ? " " Skip it , Cap , " one of the players said . " Let 's get down to where you scared the old biddy pea-green . Give me another , Beef . " " I never did . Listen , Perce , honest to God , I never scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't make you drunk . I swear all that happened was this . Pretty soon the maid brings in a bottle of champagne in a fancy bucket with ice and a towel , just like you see in the movies . Exactly the same . Figure out what that did to me . I think this Miss Darby is the swellest article in the way of an old maid I 've ever laid eyes on . I 'm all for her . Strong . She only takes a little , but I have a glass , and is it good ! First champagne I ever tasted . I saw plenty before I got back after the Armistice , but that was my first , and did it go down smiling . I begin to feel glad I come after all . The maid pours me a second when I tells her to and I 'm kidding away  --  perfectly proper , you understand  --  telling this dame how swell she is having me over and how I love champagne and how my old man wo n't drink anything else and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the bottle  --  it wastes if you do n't drink it and Kerfoot could n't come  --  I 'm running on , the old tongue wagging like it was greased on both ends and hung in the middle , and the maid is n't handy , so I reached over and poured myself another glass . " ' Do you think you should have another glass , Captain ? ' she says out of a clear sky . I just looked at her , too surprised to open my trap , because I was just going to say here 's to you , ma'am , or something like that , and I had a good look at her face . By cork , her eyes look like two holes burned in a blanket -- she 's scared to death . I 'm not exaggerating . It was an awful shock . I looked round , expecting to see the Heinies busting open the door , but there was n't nobody , and she could n't have been scared of the maid , so by Jesus , I think to myself , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt me . Here I figured we were getting along . She was lapping up the yarns I 'd been telling her and I was beginning to like the old girl  --  and all of a sudden she goes off this way . " ' What are you scared of all of a sudden ? ' I says . ' You do n't need to be scared of me . I would n't touch you . I have n't never touched a woman yet that was n't ready and willing or worse ' ? that was really true then ? and you do n't think an American officer do n't respect American womanhood , ' I says . " Well , it did n't have no effect . She just looked more like she might pass out any minute . " I did n't want to go home and leave things that way . So I had an idea.had an automatic  --  a little German Lueger  --  in my pocket . I pulled it out and pushed it across the table toward her , business end my way . The safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to work it , and I says , ' There now , do n't you be afraid . If I forget myself , you just plug me , lady . That 's fair , is n't it ? ' " You would have thought the gun was a snake the way she looked at it . She just moved farther away from the table . " ' I really think you must excuse me , ' she says , hardly able to get the words out . " ' I do n't know what I 've done , ' I says , ' I apologize if I 've done anything I should n't have . ' " ' That 's quite all right , Captain , ' she says , ' but you must excuse me , ' and out she goes like a hen beating an auto across the road by an inch . " ' What the hell ! ' I said . That was the first cuss word I used all evening and she was out of the room . There you have it , Perce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Perce ? I want to know , ' cause it 's tragedy for me . She made me feel like a bum . I sat there , getting sorer and sorer , and I killed the bottle of champagne , and when my orderly comes at ten o'clock I went home without seeing hide nor hair of her . " You 'd think that was enough , would n't you , Perce ? Would n't you now ? Would n't you think that was enough ? But a couple of days later the colonel calls me in . Here 's a letter from this woman complaining about my foul and abusive language , drunkenness and conduct unbecoming an officer . What ails her anyway ? The colonel is a square guy  --  besides the Argonne is coming  --  so he lectures me and lets it drop . It never caught up with me again over there , but when I come back I apply for a transfer to the regular army . I had two citations , and if it had gone through I 'd be sitting cushy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right this minute . What turns up but this god-damned letter . There 's a lot of writing hack and forth but she sticks to her story , says I 'm no gentleman , that I give her the most terrible experience of her life and so on  --  why , Perce ? " Cap Walcott broke down drunkenly . " Why ? Why does she tell all those lies about me ? What did she do it for ? Why is that the most terrible experience of her life ? What 's the matter with her ? Why has she got it in for me ? Her old man 's a friend of the senator from Connecticut , and they 'd been selling the government war supplies ; so she 's got the pull and I got the dirty end . " " Buck up , Cap , " Perce said . " They 'll make you a general in the next war . " " No , they wo n't , " Cap blubbered . " They wo n't . " " Outside , " said one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cap . " . . . and has a strong sense of spiritual values . In the Cascine on the pleasant mornings , for half an hour , a lady is walking . She has left her balmoral cape with the chauffeur in the car and she walks vigorously pursuant to injunction and conviction , aroused and resolute in her vigor , arms swinging , the breath quick in her nostrils . Beside her , Father Bentley , with his grave lined face , strides like a grenadier . The gravel starts under their sensible English shoes . and Glastonbury . They Iie so close to your heart , these venerable Christian legends , that at times I ask myself , should one believe  --  does he believe  --  that Glastonbury Thorn sprang in sober truth from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea , that it grew on and on , flowering miraculously at Christmastide , until some wild fanatical Puritan forebear of mine cut it down ? Do you , Anson ? How charming of you . " The lady is respectably ample and brisk and hale . Her lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooch ; the black satin tricorne and her graying hair were designed , each for the other , quietly , and as she walks in this soft air her Yankee vigor seems scarcely to exist even in the instant in which it is exerted ; it exists , if it exists at all , anomalously and vanishes in the surrounding tranquillity . " I dread it , even for a few months . The climate is outlandishly hot and then the hurly-burly of the country , Anson  --  I have always lived quietly to myself , asking nothing from anyone , quite withdrawn and contented , and now to go back  --  as you say , to a country in which Joseph of Arimathea 's staff will never take root , even in legend  --  I dread it , Anson . " Among the myrtles a nightingale solecistically is singing and by the wall in the dense ilex shade , fordo , that brown bird , is running on his quick quick legs . The lady is not distracted by the myrtle groves , the occasional cyclist , the vista of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightingale . She is rapt in conversation and her gentlewoman 's face , its full flesh settled in the unassertive expectation of a world 's obedience , is livened like a girl 's . " You do n't want me to go , I can see . I really must , though , Anson . If it were only Raglan , having him here in two years on his graduation , as you say , would provide him an incentive to work at his studies and be time enough ; but Walter is an immediate problem . I have had a letter from him , such a blue despondent letter . The critics behaved badly at his exhibition . One would think that it was enough to paint beautifully and poetically , but no , not according to the critics . Their present fad is the native American scene , and Walter says flatly now that he wo n't return to Italy . It 's surprising in a boy who sincerely wants to succeed as a painter , but there it is and will take arranging . I know you doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and if I can only hold him and give him direction , he will succeed . You will see . We must make him succeed . Is n't that a substantial reason for returning to the States for a month or so ? And Raglan too . You do n't know the sweet devoted letters he writes to me , saying how he wishes he could see his Aunt Addle again . Both Raglan and his mother want me to visit them this summer . . . . " Insensibly her arms have lost their resolute swing ; she lays one hand across her ample breast as though in caution against these exertions . " You will smile at this , but as a further instance , I must have my old family dressmaker in New York remeasure me . The last garments were too small . It is such minor things  --  last straws my father used to call them  --  that make up a woman 's mind . Have n't you discovered that yet , Anson ? And besides , my solicitor writes ? taxes , trespassers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all very complicated and I do n't rightly understand it , but I feel that I ought to be there . Ah , Anson , you do n't really appreciate , enough that is , how fortunate you are not to have to concern yourself with money and business . No , you do not . If people  --  why certainly you may read the solicitor 's letter if you wish  --  if people generally would only be reasonable and fair , I ca n't believe there would be the concern the world over with everyone we know about money . But of course they are n't . I hardly dare open the newspapers these mornings . We live in a world of unreasonable people . Like that dreadful soldier , for instance . I always think of him as a sample of that world . What can you do with such people ? However , I do n't want to begin on him . He had a fine old New England name too . Look , Anson , we are lagging , it 's my fault . Quicker now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution and she foregoes speaking . The sensations of her exercise become a sufficient occupation . Now and then impatiently she notices her wrist watch . At last , before an alley of cypress , sloping to yellow Arno and the Bellosguardo hills , the fifteenth minute ticks , and quickly turning about , they go back the way they have come . " How you keep me at it , " she cries , laughing breathlessly . She has taken Father Bentley 's arm . " Why do you bother with such a worthless person ? I 'd never have the character myself to keep at this every day . " He catches his step to hers and they stride together . A breathless little smile is erect on her lips ; she is confident that any response of his will not displease her . Free arm swinging , eyes shining , the lady is returning to the waiting car , to luncheon , the siesta , and the anticipation , already starting , of to-morrow 's walk .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
