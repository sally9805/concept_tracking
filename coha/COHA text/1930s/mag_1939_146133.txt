A successful surgeon with his own private practice is Professor Bertram Bernheim of Johns Hopkins . But he does not have much faith in the U. S. system of private medical care . He sees the public asking for more adequate , low-cost medical service , sees national health insurance coming , and he wants his colleagues to prepare for the future , lest laymen take over " the big business of medicine . " <P> This week in a startling book , Medicine At the Crossroads , + with a warp of drastic criticism and a moderate woof of diplomacy , Dr. Bernheim ripped into the medical profession . Considering himself a " terrible old reactionary , " he offered plans for medicine 's modernization . Among his suggestions : <P> Surgery . Americans , says Dr. Bernheim , are " hellbent for surgery " because it is dramatic and thorough . Although there are hundreds of outstanding surgeons who never rush into an operation , " too much surgery is done . " Reason : Surgery " is easy money-it comes quick and there 's lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , are paid very small fees , " the surgeon is the big shot-and big shots cop the coin . " Too often the only money a physician gets from an operation is an unethical " cut " the surgeon hands him for bringing in a patient ( fee-splitting ) . <P> To protect patients from greedy surgeons , Dr. Bernheim suggests a major operation : " cut out the surgeon-eliminate him entirely from private practice . " All surgeons , he believes , should have their offices in hospitals and should receive salaries from hospitals . Patients should choose their hospitals , but leave the choice of their surgeon up to the chief of staff . This system is practiced in the " justly famous " Mayo Clinic . If it were put into general operation , says Dr. Bernheim , surgeons would become more highly specialized and hospitals would weed out inefficient men . Of course , " surgeons wo n't like it ... but men ought not to want to make great sums of money . . . for cutting into human flesh . " <P> Horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of medicine that a great number of physicians are practicing " horse and buggy " medicine according to the rules of the past generation at the expense of " the defenceless sick . " Dr. Bernheim 's remedy : medical licenses should be granted not for life but for periods of five years . This would allow young graduates a five-year trial period in which to find themselves , would make it necessary for specialists to secure separate licenses to work in their chosen fields . Since they would have to take periodical examinations , doctors would find it fatal to neglect postgraduate study . <P> Eventually , thinks Dr. Bernheim , all doctors will band together and practice in clinics , and this streamlined system of medical care will in itself bring greater specialization and raise the quality of service . Once this great step is taken , he believes it will make little difference in a doctor 's professional life whether the patient or the government pays the doctor 's bill . <P> <P> + Morrow ( $2.50 ) .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
