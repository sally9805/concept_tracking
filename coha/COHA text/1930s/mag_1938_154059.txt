South 's Semmes <P> Sirs : <P> Your magazine 's comments on Semmes of the Alabama biography of the Confederacy 's greatest privateer , reviewed in TIME , Oct. 31 seemed to follow your usual policy of throwing off on the South . However , you threw off your cloak of subtlety this time and became openly silly . . . . <P> N. J. HEYWARD Asheboro , N. C. <P> Sirs : <P> May I suggest that the surly manner in which you review Semmes of the Alabama , by W. Adolphe Roberts , is in itself no mean tribute to the subject of the book , and one which gains weight by its very belatedness ? . . . The fact that his name rankles in Northern minds 75 years after the event , is sufficient evidence of his efficiency in carrying out his duty . . . . <P> JNO . C. EMMERSON JR . Elizabeth City , N. C. <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Instead of reviewing the book , your author has attacked Southern Naval Policy . . . . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been so busy blockading every Confederate port and starving Southern women and children to death while his armies were marching around pillaging and burning everything in sight , he might have saved his merchant marine . . . . <P> HAROLD B. SINGLETON Attorney-at-Law Lynchburg , Va . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . TIME speaks with the venomous tongue of the Yankee Press of Civil War Days . This bitterness has at last died in Georgia . . . . It should certainly not persist in the uninvaded North . . . . The U. S. Navy has a destroyer by the name of Semmes . . . . The service evidently takes a different view from your unenlightened critic . <P> O. J. SEMMES JR . City Engineer ( Great Grandson Raphael Semmes ) Pensacola , Fla . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . It is true that I may be prejudiced since I learned at a very tender age that damnyankee is only one word and besides that , I am a descendant of the old " pirate . " . . . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points : <P> 1 ) His cruises were not , as you infer , of no military consequence . They were of sufficient importance to warrant commissioning all overseas naval vessels of the Washington Government to make special effort to find him and destroy him . <P> 2 ) In the end , a ship , The U. S. S. Kearsarge , constructed for the express purpose of sinking the Alabama , was sent on a successful search . <P> 3 ) If ruining an enemy 's merchant marine is considered by TIME as of no military importance , I merely refer you to the prosecution of any war . . . . Most thinking critics believe the Captain 's mistake was in fighting any men-of-war at all , since his value as a commerce destroyer was so great to his government . <P> 4 ) . . . Foreign military and naval observers have long admired him for his ability to avoid capture for two years without entering a Confederate port . . . . <P> 5 ) The U. S. Navy has subsequently found the exploits of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyer in his honor . . . . <P> RAPHAEL SEMMES JR . Ensign , U. S. Navy U. S. S.
