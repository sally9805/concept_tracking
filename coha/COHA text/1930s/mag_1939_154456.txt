In a natural fortress of boulders and timber , near Clark 's Fork Canyon 30 miles northwest of Cody , Wyo. , Earl Durand , 26 , the huge , hairy " true woodsman " who broke jail in Cody last fortnight and shot down two pursuing peace officers ( TIME , March 27 ) , lay waiting and watching one day last week . They had sentenced him to six months in jail for shooting a bull elk out of season , threatened him with ten years more for killing a beef cow . Now they wanted him for double murder . A posse of peace officers under Sheriff Frank Blackburn was down below , coming up to get him . Well , they never would . Not for nothing had he sat through two showings of the movie Jesse James . This was his country , the Beartooth Mountains . Here he could live indefinitely with only his rifle and knife , eating his game raw by preference , hiding out in caves . They would never take him back ; at least , not alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a return address , " Undertaker 's Office , Powell , Wyo . " Excerpt : <P> " . . . Tell King and Kennedy the game wardens who arrested him to always carry a pistol . If I ever meet them I will give them a chance for an even draw-something I wo n't give you . . . . <P> " Of course I know I am done for and when you kill me I suggest you have my head mounted and hang it up in the courthouse for the sake of law and order . <P> " Your beloved enemy , <P> " Earl Durand . " <P> Said the killer 's father , respected Rancher Walter W. Durand of Powell , Wyo. : " The boy seems to have gone insane and started killing men he has known throughout his lifetime . The great outdoors was my son 's god . I think when he was sent to jail he went nearly crazy thinking about having to give up his outdoor life . . . . God help my boy ! " <P> Earl Durand watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideout . After a time , two riflemen ( Orville Linabary , 42 ; Arthur Argento , 46 ) started across a clearing directly toward him . They had their nerve with them . He let them come within 50 paces , then quickly gave them each a bullet in the belly . None of the other possemen dared show himself , not even to get the dead . The canyon fell silent . Day died . <P> In the night Earl Durand stole down to the corpses , smashed their rifles , took rubber-soled boots from one , bootlaces from the other . He made a false trail up the precipice behind his boulders , then doubled back . Next day when the posse closed in on his fortress , he was not there . While they tried to trail him with bloodhounds on the mountain , while militia dragged up a howitzer , Earl Durand held up a car down on the valley road . <P> At about 1:30 p. m . Earl Durand strode into the First National Bank at Powell . He had a six-shooter on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulging with cartridges . Bank President Bob Nelson , his three employes and five customers reached for the ceiling . Durand grabbed $3,000 in cash , then started shooting crazily through the bank 's windows and walls . " They 'll plug me anyway , " he told his frightened captives . When he had fired 40 or 50 shots he bound Nelson , Cashier Maurice Knutson and Teller John Gawthrop together by the wrists with rawhide . " Come on , boys , " he said , " we 're going out .
