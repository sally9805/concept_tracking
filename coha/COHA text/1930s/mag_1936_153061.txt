THE BEAUTIES AND FURIES-Christina Stead-Appleton-Century ( $2.50 ) . <P> " Men of genius ruin themselves for some fantasy , or for their families , that 's why there are so few that succeed . There are really hundreds of thousands of men of genius in the world . " This minority opinion is delivered not by Author Christina Stead herself but by one of her characters ; but she writes as if it were true . The Beauties and Furies , like her earlier books ( The Salzburg Tales , Seven Poor Men of Sydney ) is something rich and strange , bears the same relation to workaday life as Ariel 's song to a drowned man . <P> Against the realistic but poetically envisaged background of yesterday 's Paris , in a political climate heavy with the Stavisky scandals and the riots of Feb. 6 , 1934 , swarms a crowd of fantastic figures in a kind of Lutetian Lupercalia . Outlines of the story are mundane enough . Elvira , pretty and discontented , has left her stodgy British husband to join her lover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meets Marpurgo , a cultured lace-buyer , an opaque fellow who grows more sinister with acquaintance . He describes himself as " a virtuoso in decadence , disintegration , mental necrosis . . . . " His hearers are usually mystified , end by mistrusting him admiringly or asking him for a match . In Paris , Marpurgo attaches himself to the lovers and encourages their troubles . For a while the course of their illicit affair meanders with delightful smoothness . Then Elvira begins to miss her settled respectability . Oliver shamelessly discovers that he is attractive to other women . While Elvira maunders at home over her fate , Oliver with regrettable lightheartedness deceives her with the fey Coromandel , the veteran Blanche , with a chance prostitute who knows her Baudelaire . <P> Elvira 's husband goes to Paris , to do the decent British thing , muddles the situation more . Conferences coagulate . Marpurgo flits from group to group , breathing out night thoughts and miasmal metaphysics . When his boss fires him because of his artistic expense accounts , thinks of hiring Oliver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a gloomy consciousness that he has done all he can , Elvira 's husband tires of her vacillations , takes himself back to England . Elvira settles herself to lie on the bed she has made , then suddenly realizes that Oliver is an inconstant bedfellow , goes home to her husband after all . When Oliver decides he is through with Paris too , Marpurgo encourages his departure , for more reasons than one . On the boat train Oliver , by now an incorrigible ladies ' man , meets another girl . . . . <P> Not so much in the story nor its background but in her characters ' coruscating conversations , the implications of their grotesque actions and their wilder words , does Christina Stead 's originality shine . Readers who know where they are with the Saturday Evening Post will get little or nothing out of The Beauties and Furies . Its trolls and hobgoblins may show less timid readers a thing or two not visible except by moonlight .                @ @ @ @ @
