OZ.E2EY GgRNETT S0 , ANYHOW . the Old Reporter was going to write a piece on government . He took the matter up first with Plato , and then regretted it. , for Plato , who had been one of his heroes among the thinkers , turned out to be a total loss . His beautiful science of government avoided the first reality  --  namely , people . It had to be so because there was no science of people . The more he studied people the less he knew what to do about them . Confronted by the human Greek who should say , " I see the better way and take the worse , " he was helpless . Once he went as a one-man brain trust to tell the young dictator of Syracuse how to set up a new deal , and it turned out badly . After that , if it had been modern time , he would have become a newspaper columnist , uttering the word of irresponsible wisdom in a superior manner . Instead , he invented an ideal state , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even that he supposed would eventually dissolve itself in wickedness and class conflict , because you could not trust people forever to restrain themselves so far as to begot children only under the augury of the mysterious number principle on which depended the good or bad quality of births . Aristotle was better . He studied the natural facts of government . The Mediterranean world with its little city states was a political hothouse . Aristotle examined more than one hundred and fifty constitutions , like specimens . He , too , could imagine an ideal state , but when he could not reconcile it with reality , he gave it up . He could not say for sure what ought to be done about property , lest the poor combine against the rich to plunder them , which would be very bad for the poor ; or the rich combine against the poor to enslave them , which would be very bad for the rich . If only property could be private and the use of it common , that would be perfect ; yet how the people could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended itself at first sight by its good appearance and specious pretense of humanity ; but then it would be found that the evils thereby to be removed , such as were supposed to arise from property in private , arose instead from the wickedness of human nature . In any case , that manner of life , granting its conveniences , would be found impracticable . " It is evident , " he said , " that every form of government must contain a supreme power over the whole state , and this supreme power must necessarily he in the hands of one person , or a few , or many . " In no case was the weakness in the form . The trouble with kingship was the king , the trouble with oligarchy was the oligarch , and the trouble with democracy was people . So he arrived at the conclusion that any kind of government that worked well was good and any kind that did n't was bad , and that for very practical reasons no kind of government should he too good , especially the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " tutored Alexander the Great , and Alexander conquered the world , or all he could find of it .. That was something . But as concerning government , he leaves me nowhere . " Turning from these two baffled ancients , he reread a lot of history . Descending through history together , inseparable and indestructible , he saw people representing the necessity to be governed , and government representing the passion to govern , supporting between them a deadly feud . The repetitive nature of the struggle may have been what gave the ancients the weary idea that the path of human destiny was circular , going nowhere . The issue in every case was that either the government overthrew the people or the people overthrew the government , and which it was seemed to make no difference at all , for nothing was ever learned or settled , and again in a little while they had to stop to see which could overthrow the other . The idea that the path of human destiny was circular was replaced by the idea of progress , of going somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only so long ago as the eighteenth century , arose the idea that there was no natural necessity for people to be governed ; this was an unnatural necessity that had been horribly imposed upon them by government . Naturally people were good and kind and fraternal , and would not need to he governed at all , except that authority , government , institutions , assuming them to be evil , had made them so . Therefore , abolish the principle of a government to govern people , abolish along with it reason , also , and let people govern themselves by instinct . This was Rousseau . If you said it might . turn out that civilization itself was abolished , his answer was that civilization ought to be abolished , for it had ruined people . hi barbarism they were perfect . Let them return to barbarism . But when he came to say how people should govern themselves by instinct , there were difficulties . To be fraternal , us naturally they were in a beautiful manner , they would have to live together ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule of instinct , it would have to he a rule in common ; it would have to represent the direct will of the majority . Thus , a popular assembly to utter the majority will , a code , a minority to be coerced  --  and government again . Such , at any rate , was the beginning of democraey in the modern sense , or the idea of it , and it was an idea that deeply moved political thinking throughout the world . The sovereign people as an abstraction . The people always right . The people divine . People as God . Out of it came the worshipful proletariat of Marx . And none of that made any difference . People representing the necessity to be governed and government representing the passion to govern , continued on , pushing their deadly feud between them , down to the present day . To Govern Government Coming to this point , the Old Reporter took down from the shelf a work he remembered as the most important single contribution he knew to the literature of government . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty , by John W. Burgess . It was history , too , but not general history ; it was the history of man 's effort , to solve that one problem , through ages of time , in Asia , Africa , Europe , North America and South America . It had never been solved . Just as it seemed that it was , or might he , then something happened , like the coming of Caesar . and " Liberty Find been again overwhelmed by government " ; and worse , " the great problem of the reconciliation of the two seemed for the moment to have disappeared from the consciousness of men . " What a tragic phrase ! Liberty again overwhelmed by government . As the story went on , the true nature of the problem was revealed . It was this : Government and freedom are naturally antagonistic , and that can not be helped . Government is necessary , and in order to have government at all , people are obliged to surrender sonic part of their freedom . As the area and powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diminish ; if the power of government becomes absolute , freedom is lost . The kind or form of government , therefore , is not so important . The problem is to limit its powers , no matter what the kind or form of it is . How shall the powers be limited ? Doctor Burgess arrived at that question finally ; and he wrote : " What is genuine constitutional government ? It is not simply a government based on a written document . Genuine constitutional government rests upon two fundamental principles . These two principles are , first , that it must be representative government , and , second , that it must be limited government . That is , first , there must be back of government a more ultimate authority , which decrees the organization of the government , vests it with powers , and imposes on it limitations . This body we denominate in political science the sovereign . Now , in genuine constitutional government this body must not govern . if this body should govern , such government would necessarily be absolute and unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the order of authorities , there would be nothing back of it which could control or restrain it . But this is not yet enough for the establishment of genuine constitutional government . Constitutional government must be representative government , but representative government can exist without being genuine constitutional government . Let us suppose , for example , that there exists in a given political system a sovereign power organized back of , separate from , and supreme over , the government , but that it should invest all of its own power without exception or limitation in the government . Such a government would be representative , but it would not be constitutional in any true and genuine sense of the word . It would be an absolute government. , no matter how benevolently disposed . in order to be constitutional , it must he subject to limitations imposed upon it by the sovereign in behalf of the rights and immunities of the individual . Constitutional law is a body of limitations on governmental power , and you dare not call any document a constitution , no matter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would not solve in the slightest degree the great problem of political history and political science , the reconciliation of government with liberty . It would simply sacrifice liberty to government . " In all the reading the Old Reporter had done , this seemed to him the high point of political thought . Government as the limited agency of a sovereign power ; a sovereign power that shall not govern , precisely because it is sovereign . Let that sovereign power be the people . Its true function  --  or their function  --  is to ordain the prinreples that shall govern government , jealously to limit the area and powers of government , and then to retire , leaving government to govern , upon those principles and within those limits , and beware of doing more , lest the sovereign power reappear to assert itself . lf , on the other hand , the sovereign power does more than this , if it undertakes to govern , then you have at once unlimited government , and again freedom is overwhelmed by government . That was what John Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson : " The fundamental article of my political creed is that despotism or unlimited sovereignty or absolute power is the same in a majority of a popular assembly , an aristocratical council , and oligarchical junto , and a single emperor  --  equally arbitrary , cruel , bloody and in every respect . diabolical . " With Limited Power And the same thought was running in that famous decision of Chief Justice Marshall , saying : " The basis on which the whole American fabric has been erected is the original right of the people to establish for their future government such principles as , in their opinion , shall most conduce to their oem happiness . The exercise of this originul right is a very great exertion , nor eau it be , nor ought it to be , frequently repeated . The principles , therefore , so established are deemed fundamental , and , as the authority from which they proceed is supreme and can seldom act , they are designed to be permanent . This original and supreme will organizes the government and assigns to different departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or establish certain limits not to be transcended by those departments . The Government of the United States is of the latter description . The powers of the legislature are defined and limited , and that these limits may not be mistaken or forgotten , the Constitution is written . The Constitution is either a superior permanent law , unchangeable by ordinary means , or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts and , like other acts , is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it . If the former part of the alternative be true , then is legislative act . contrary to the Constitution is not law ; if the latter part be true , then written constitutions are absurd attempts on the part of the people to limit a power in its own nature illimitable . " Pessimism assailed the Old Reporter . This thought which he knew to be important and believed to be sound was by no means a simple thought , simply arrived at ; nor could it ever be made popular . For several reasons it could never be popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take ; secondly , to understand it would require a degree of political intelligence and a power of reflection such as many of the sovereign people were utterly incapable of ; thirdly , no flattering formula could be worked upon it ; and , lastly , it put a price upon freedom  --  namely , the price of self-restraint . Said Burke : " It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate minds can not be free . " He asked himself a question . Since men knew how to be free , knew how to reconcile government with liberty . why should the problem still exist ? That was the crucial point . One would not need to be as dour as Dean Inge , who said masses of the people had no respect for either democracy or liberty if only the government would transfer the wealth of the few to the pockets of the many , to realize that there always have been and always will be many people who , when freedom begins to hurt , willingly surrender it in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has by any means acquired the power to distribute benefits has found already the stranglehold upon its old antagonist . The Old Reporter asked himself why he was writing a piece on government . He was doing it because the subject was one people were exciting themselves about . In five years there had been an increase in the area and powers of Federal Government such as had not taken place before in time of peace since the Constitution was written , and the area of individual immunities had diminished accordingly . That was what they were excited about . But in all the discussions going on there was a confusion of words , people on one side saying this was in violation of the principles of democracy and calling upon one another to rise and defend democracy , and at the same time people on the other side saying this was democracy acting . Conservatives and radicals both talking democracy ; the conservatives for defending it and the radicals for extending it . What could that mean ? It . would seem to mean that the word " democracy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what if it meant that we had forgotten an ancient truth  --  namely , that whereas democracies rise out of tyrannies , crying for freedom , they tend , if they are unrestrained , to become themselves tyrannical and to devour their own freedom . Aristotle noted the similarities between the monarch in a tyranny and the people in a democracy , both desiring to be absolute , under no control of law ; and between the tyrant with his flatterers and the people with their demagogues . " Anyone , " he said , " may with great justice blame such a government , as being a democracy and not a free state ; for when the government is not in the laws , then there is no free state , for the law ought to be supreme over all things . " Again , what if it meant that we had lost the important distinction between a republic and a. democ-racy ? What was it we started with ? What was founded in this country  --  a republic or a democracy ? The Problem of 1787 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prodigious book , entitled , Formation of the Union . It entirely consisted of formal papers in reprint and it was the documentary history of the Constitution of the United States . When , in May , 1787 , the delegates to the Federal Convention assembled themselves in Philadelphia , their instructions were to prepare amendments to the Articles of Confederation under which the thirteen states were very loosely held together . That was understood to be their sole and express business  --  to amend the Articles . But their first resolve was to constitute a national government . By the Articles of Confederation there was already a Federal Congreas : nevertheless , it was a fact that there was no national government . The Articles did not constitute one ; they provided only for an association of the several states . The Federal Congress did not possess the ordinary powers of government . Said Gouverneur Morris : " We are not now under a Federal government . There is no such thing . " Moreover , no such thing could be created by amending the Articles . Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four millions of free people , highly civilized , political minded , with a continent to conquer , and no government . It was a tall resolve on the part of the delegates to forget their instructions and to write , instead , the constitution for a national government . If they succeeded , it was a revolution ; if they failed , it might be a kind of treason . Beginning in that dangerous way with a clean slate , they sat for 115 days . The proceedings were in secret , so that everyone should he able more freely to speak out his thoughts : however , several delegates kept notes , foremostly James Madison , and these notes , long afterward made public , were there in this book of historic documents . The Specter of Tyranny Anyone who will read the debates may see for himself that the delegates  --  that is to say , the authors of the Constitution  --  were possessed of two fears ; not fear of anything as concerning themselves or of what might be the personal consequences of what they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of monarchy ; the other was the fear of democracy . Specifically , in one case it was fear of the executive , who should be called President , lest he turn into a monarch ; and , in the other case , it was fear of the people , lest they give themselves up to temptations of democracy . In both cases it was fear  --  of what ? Of tyranny . The tyranny of a monarch and the tyranny of a democracy were equally dreaded . Nevertheless , it was necessary to include both the executive principle and the democratic principle . The problem was how to limit them . It was long debated whether the executive power should be delivered to a single person . " A single person , " said Randolph , may be considered the foetus of a monarchy . " Benjamin Franklin said : " The executive will be always increasing , here as elsewhere , until it ends in a monarchy . " Again he said : " There is a natural inclination in mankind to kingly government .... They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am apprehensive , therefore , perhaps too apprehensive , that the government of these states may in future times end in monarchy . " However , it had to be a single executive . A multiple executive simply would not work . Then the question of how the single executive , to be called the President , should be elected . There were various proposals . The one least considered at first and never returned to was that the President should be elected by popular vote , for it was agreed that this would increase the danger of an elective monarchy , and , besides , if one branch of the national legislature  --  meaning Congress ? was going to be elected by popular vote , and if the President , too , were elected in that way , there was the danger that he would collaborate with the demagogues in the popular branch of Congress to encroach upon the Constitution or to overthrow it . That would be , of course , only in case the President himself were a demagogue ; but , said Alexander Hamilton : " Demagogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 32 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 20 , 10.36 At last it was decided that the people should elect electors and the electors should elect the President , a very awkward arrangement , and yet . the best they could think of to avoid the evil of submitting the choice to direct popular vote . Then was the question of how the two branches of Cougress should be elected . It was easily agreed , and yet not unanimously , that the first branch , to be called the House of Representatives , should be elected by popular vote , because , as Mason said , " Whatever inconveniency may attend the democratic principle , it must actuate one part of the government . It is the only security for the rights of the people . " That was settled ; but all the more because it bad been settled that way , the other branch of Congress , to be called the Senate , must not be elected by popular vote . What was needed was an austere , resolute Senate , unresponsive to popular clamor , with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be the conservative principle . It was to restrain " the fury of democracy . " Or , as Randolph said : " The object of this second branch is to control the democratic branch of the national legislature . If it be not a firm body , the other branch , being more numerous and coming directly from the people , will overwhelm it . The democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures proves the necessity of a firm Senate . " In this matter there was scarcely any contrary opinion . The idea that the Senate should represent the conservative principle as a check upon the democratic principle was practically unanimous . All the argument was over ways and means to insure keeping it in that character . And it was decided that the members of the Senate should be elected , not by the people but by the state legislatures , two for each state , and that they should sit for six years , as against two years for members of the House of Representatives . What came of these deliberations was our Constitution . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this Constitution with all its faults , if they be such ; because I think a general government necessary for us , and there is no form of government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered , and believe further that this one is likely to be well administered for a course of years , and can only end in despotism , as other forms have done before it , when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government , being incapable of any other . " A Three-Word Government Which was what Aristotle might have said . Tho form was less important than the spirit . Almost any form of government might be either good or bad . Now , the Government of the United States , so constituted , was one in which there was what the political scientist calls a separation of powers . The finest statement of what that means had already been made , seven years before , in the Massachusetts constitution , and it was this : " In the government of this commonwealth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or either of them ; the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers , or either of them ; the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers , or either of them ; to the end it shall be a government of laws and not of men . " It was a beautiful political mechanism of cheeks and balances . Three powers  --  the President , the Congress and the Supreme Court  --  each one able to cheek the other two , no one of them able to control the other two . And besides , the Congress itself was a balance of two principles ; in the House of Representatives the democratic principle , in the Senate t he conserve t ive principle . And how should such a Government , the first of its kind in the world , be defined ? It was a constitutional , representative , limited Government , designed to solve the great problem of how to reconcile government with liberty . All three words were necessary  --  constitutional , representative , limited . Most definitely it was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and this incident was in the documents  --  a lady asked Benjamin Franklin , " Well , doctor , what have we got ? A republic or a monarchy ? " To which he answered , " A republic if you can keep it . " What had happened to this Government since ? Not to think everything , of course : the Old Reporterwas not writing history . What he needed here he could take out of his head . Well , every important . change he could think of as having happened to Government since the Constitution was written had been in one direction , and that was  --  toward democracy . First , after forty years , came universal suffrage . here before such a thing existed anywhere else in the world . When the Constitution was written , the rule was that in order to vote , one must he a taxpayer or possess a minimum amount of property . What else ? Next , the total eclipse of an aristocratic governing caste from Virginia and Massachusetts , out of which the first six Presidents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson , a people 's hero . For a long time after that nothing much more happened in the meaning of democracy , and this was probably owing to a series of great distractions , such as the gold rush , the Mexican conquest , the Civil War , the amazing rise of American industry and the westward flight of the frontier ; though meanwhile , almost unawares , the President was corning closer and closer to the popular vote . The people still elected electors to elect the President , and do still , in fact , but this became gradually an empty legal form . For the Electoral College really to choose a President , as the intention was , now would be unimaginable . Then the Constitution was amended to say that the Senate should be elected by direct popular vote , and thereby was destroyed the conservative principle that the founders set in one branch of the Congress in order to balance the democratic principle in the other branch , The original Constitution very definitely limited the power of the Government to levy direct taxes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that says Congress shall have unlimited power to levy a , rising tax upon private incomes wherever they may be found , up to the point of confiscation . What this amendment did was to give he Government not only unrestricted access to the wealth of individuals but the power to redistribute wealth as it might see fit to do . Since the adoption of that amendment , said Burgess , " We have no real constitutional government upon the most important of all subjects , the relation or government to the individual 's right to property . " It was constitutional , to be sure , because it was written into the Constitution ; therefore , it was legal . Burgess did not mean to say it was not legal ; he did not mean to say it was not constitutional in every legal sense . But according to his thesis , no power that is unlimited may be called constitutional in the true political sense of the word , whereas in this case the Congress had been given unlimited power of sovereignty over private wealth . By these and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by imperceptible changes , too , in what the ancients called the ethos , or the collective disposition of people , democracy advanced irresistibly , and the people were acting more and more directly upon government , until at last a President could appear claiming to have a mandate direct from the people to impose his will upon the Congress and oven upon the Supreme Court . Yet now here was a startling contradiction . As people act more and more directly upon government , they may be going further and further away from self-government . The people in the Roman Forum , tearing down one Caesar and setting up another , thought they were acting directly upon government , and so , in one sense , they were . But would anyone say they were practicing self-government ? What happened was that in the act of exercising the sovereign power they surrendered it . Certainly , any people at any time may exercise their sovereign power to elect a'dictator or a monarch , thereby resigning it . Power Out of Control With no theory about it , the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although democracy was definitely on the rise , the people he talked to in all strata of American life seemed to feel increasingly remote from government , regarding it strangely , not as a power they understood and controlled but as a power controlling them . Now he looked at it . What he saw when he looked at it was this : By virtue of a continued and progressive delegation of power , by the people to the Government and by the Congress to the President , there had arisen in Washington a new , auxiliary Government , beginning suddenly to grow very much faster than the regularly ordained Government . That new Government took the form of independent agencies , such as commissions , boards , corporations , authorities , administrations and bureaus , invested with legislative , executive and judicial powers of their own , so that they issued rules and regulations having the force of law  --  administrative law it was called , apart from statute law  --  and than themselves executed . these laws , took proceedings against all who disobeyed them , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government people were feeling so remote from ; this was the Government they could neither elect nor control . Not long before this the Old Reporter had written an article on the situation at Weirton , to show the National Labor Relations Act and the National Labor Relations Board in their way of actually touching people . Several times in that article , instead of naming the instrumentalities of Government , such as the National Labor Relations Board , the National Labor Board that preceded it , or the National Recovery Administration , he used only the word " Government , " as to say , " The Government meanwhile was neither forgetting nor forgiving , " or , " The Government never forgave Weir for the wound lie had inflicted upon it , " meaning there the wound he gave the Blue Eagle . Then he got a letter from a severe lady in Michigan , reproaching him for having employed the word " Government " in that way . " Both you and I and the rest of the one hundred and twenty millions are the Government through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So it was intended . But if this was not the Government , what was it or who was it ? What was the National Recovery Administration with its Blue Eagle and compulsory codes , if not the Government ? What was the National Labor Relations Board with its powers of trial and sentence , if not the Government ? 34 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 20 , 0938 What could an instrumentality be that nets in the name of Government with the powers of Government ? He had not answered that letter , but he meant to answer it . The Michigan lady identified herself as a Democrat and suggested that the Old Reporter was not one , wherefore , of course , he would be full of prejudice . Well , he would answer her letter by asking her to read the address delivered by the Honorable Hatton W. Sumners before the American Bar Association at Kansas City last September . Mr. Sumners is a strong Democrat from Texas . He is chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives . In that Kansas City address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it will be decided whether our economic system and our Government will stand or fall . A very serious situation is before the people . What are we going to do about it ? Are you willing to join a battalion of death to save the Constitution and the Government ? When we look about we see Free government disappearing . In our own country we see the same causes that broke up other free governments . The states and the people are losing their power to govern because they are not exercising those powers . . . . The Government of this country has passed into the hands of a million people in the executive department , in which only one man was elected . The result of the rule by the million is that we have rapidly changed our form of government while preserving its exterior appearance . We have changed from representative popular control to a government by an executive department which the people can not control . " And that was the Government , the new Government , the Old Reporter was talking about . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court had said the sign of political change was ascendant in the heavens . Whether one could read it or not , there it was . A great movement was taking place . It involved the whole world at once . This country alone could not hope to escape . The Credo of Freedom Here he came to a long pause . Everything be had put down so far had been in the spirit of reporting , not entirely without prejudice , perhaps , and yet as free of opinion as seemed possible . But from this point he could not go on in that manner . He had now some ideas . He may have begun with them ; and whether it was that his ideas were in consequence of the facts or that the facts were to prove the ideas , he would not say for sure . In any enqP , it would be understood that what was to follow would be statement and conclusion , with a creed implicit ; the creed being that freedom is more to be valued than security , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , and any other kind is in all common sense a fiction , and that to the question  --  Is it more important for people to be self-governed than to be governed well ? ? the answer is , Yes . So then : The first statement is that the words we use to denominate governments by kind and doctrine , such words as Communism and Fascism , are like religious images , to be hated or to be worshiped . Even the word " democracy " has no longer any certain meaning . There is no existing reality that corresponds to the emotions these words evoke . Nothing comes out of them ; people put their own feelings into them . In England there is democracy together with an extravagant king ritual . The word " Communism " has a definite grammatical meaning . But where is Communism in political fact ? Not in Russia . There is tyranny in Russia , calling itself Communism , saying its errand in the world is to make people free and save democracy , which is only one image talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondents should ever become reel and there was a great struggle on the earth between what they call the democracies on one side , and what they call the totalitarian states , meaning tyrannies , on the other side , the Russian tyranny would be on the side of democracies ; and how absurd that would he . Russia defending the liberties of Englishmen , Frenchmen and Americans ! The struggle is not what they think . It is a struggle between government and freedom , now as it always was , with freedom on the defensive , even in this country . What made this country unique in the world for more than one hundred years was not necessarily the form of its Government , but that of all governments it was the most limited ; hence more freedom here than anywhere else in the world . Pat the definitions all aside . Then you have what is really there  --  namely , government , people and the relation between them . That brings us back . Now the second statement . It is that there is a natural law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one kind , but a natural law of every government that ever was ; and it is like the biological law from which every living thing derives the blind impulse to swell and extend itself to the extreme possibility . A tree would grow to the sky if it could . The living thing is stopped by the resistance of other hostile things and by the limits of the food supply . What a government feeds upon is freedom ; the resistance to it is the human motive to defend freedom . Many have reflected on these facts in different ways . Thomas Jefferson said : " The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground . " And again : " The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it always to be kept alive . It will be often exercised when wrong , but bettor so than not to be exercised at all . " With this natural law in mind , turn now and look again at the principal governments of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name themselves , and you will be struck by their similarities , not by their differences . The New Economic World All alike , they are extending their powers to the utmost . All alike , they are limiting the areas of human freedom , for no government can in any way extend its powers over people but to limit freedom . All alike , they sweat with the conviction of doing to people what is best for them . All alike , if they do not already possess it , they are pressing for sovereign power , above any law , beyond any restraint . All alike , they are unmoral , which is to say , whatever they do is right . All alike , they claim the power to dispose of private wealth , some of them doing it in the name of the state , some in the name of the proletariat , some in the name of social justice . This is extremely important . It is not a matter of what happens to private wealth as such . That is relatively unimportant . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more money . A truth that was learned long ago seems now to be forgotten  --  namely , that freedom is in the purse . Give the government an unlimited purse and the life of freedom is already pledged . The certain way to limit government is to limit its purse . And lastly , all alike , they are resolved to dominate economic forces . The reason for this is quite simple . In certain circumstances , as in war or in a great depression , the economic sphere is that in which the extension of the powers of government is least resisted , and the one , also , in which the effects are likely to be the most irreversible . Once the government puts forth its hand to touch the economic system , that hand almost can not be removed . Simple as the explanation may be , there is a history here . The nineteenth century was that period of modern times in which , taking the world as a whole , there was a minimum of government and a maximum of human freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time during which governments exorcised the least control over economic forces . But this was nothing governments ever intended . The doctrine of laissez faire , or let it alone , was never adopted by governments . What they controlled they never relaxed their hold upon ; but what they controlled withered in their hands . The change was that a new economic world appeared . It was born of science , power and invention . Its growth was amazing and unpredictable . Governments ( lid not understand it , nor the forces and mechanisms it worked with . They were afraid to touch it . That is why they let it alone . So this new economic world was free and went its way . Then the governments began to study it . In one hundred years they overtook it . Now they are resolved to control it , even as they controlled the simple economic system that was before this one . The statements are in , It was understood , that there would be also a conclusion . The conclusion is that for all who would defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any particular kind or form or name , but government itself in its immemorial nature . If government can not be limited , freedom is lost . To defend the Constitution is not the same as to defend freedom . Under the Constitution , by amendment or interpretation of it , there can be unlimited extension of Government , even to the point of the absolute . The process is insidious . Let the Government 's intent be good . That may be assumed . But the better the intent the worse it is , for the goodness of the intent disarms resistance . For remember , an absolute government , a government that has totally abolished individual freedom , may as well as any other possess the conviction that it is doing to the people what is good for them . It brings them security , happiness , the abundant life , equality ; in another case it may be the conviction , as in Germany or Italy , that it brings their destiny to pass . And all of that may be so . Here is no ethical question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world you want to live in , a world of freedom or one of status . The Sign in the Heavens Such then is the sign that now is ascendant in the political heavens . Such is the movement that is taking place in the world . The member of the Supreme Court who said this country alone could not escape was either right or wrong . That remains to be decided . Neither the sign nor the movement is new in the world ; they are new only in this country , where now , for the first time , it may be that Government will overwhelm freedom . Certainly it will if the extension of its power be not heroically resisted . Freedom is not a gift . It is a hard possession . People who inherit it may tire of it . " The path of freedom , " says Berdiaev , in The Meaning of History , " is difficult and tragic , more beset than any other with heroic responsibility and martyrdom . The paths of necessity and compulsion are easier , less tragic and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many derogations from the path of freedom to that of compulsion . " He refers to Dostoievsky 's Legend of the Grand Inquisitor . " The Grand Inquisitor wishes to relieve men of the burden of freedom , so that they may all be happy . Mankind yielded to this temptation in the Inquisition , and does so again in our time in the religion of Communism . which is simply the doctrine of the Grand Inquisitor based on the fall from the path of freedom to that of compulsion . . ? . This is the very essence of the historical drama , rooted in the eonffict between the principles of freedom and compulsion , in the ceaseless supersession of the one by the other . "
