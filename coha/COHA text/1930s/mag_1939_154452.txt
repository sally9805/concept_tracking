At Munich , Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Hitler very ably appeased each other . Mr. Chamberlain by giving in , Mr. Hitler by declaring his good intentions . The big unsettled question about President Roosevelt 's business-appeasement policy is whether it is the Chamberlain or Hitler kind . Last week it looked more like the Hitler kind when the head of the Federal Reserve Board , Marriner Eccles ( the New Deal 's prime advocate of spending for recovery ) , appeared before a Senate committee and gave Congress a lusty double dare . He challenged it to try economy . Said he : <P> " A great majority of people appear to believe*. . . that business confidence would be restored if the Budget were balanced and that the spurt of economic activity that would result would accomplish our common aim of recovery . . . . <P> " A majority in both houses of Congress have indicated that they also hold this view . While I am convinced that such a policy of retrenchment under present conditions would have disastrous results , we live in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint of the majority should promptly be made effective . . . . <P> " If balancing the Budget will bring about recovery , then Congress can instantly do so by reducing expenditures to the level of receipts . . . . Such items as work-relief projects , CCC camps , roads and public works of all kinds , veterans ' benefits , all farm benefit payments and national defense , some or all of these would have to be drastically curtailed . <P> " This would not be my program , but if , as would appear , it is the program of the majority , they should assume full responsibility for it and put it into effect without delay and without compromises for the benefit of any special groups . " <P> Like Mr. Hitler at Munich and after , daring Mr. Eccles had his adversaries on the hip . Said Chairman Pat Harrison of the Senate Finance Committee , who knows perfectly well that Congress will not economize in a big way : " If the statement of Mr. Eccles represents the views of the President and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue , I shall be glad to assist in the formulation of a reasonable program . " Said Chairman Adams of the Senate sub-committee which cut $150,000,000 from WPA 's deficiency appropriation , only to have the President demand it again : " If there was some cooperation by the Administration , we might get something done . " <P> Meanwhile a committee of the House , where eight consecutive appropriation bills had been cut symbolically but not substantially below Budget figures , voted to undo all that economy with a farm bill to provide parity payments $244,098,376 above Budget figures . A $400,000,000 log-rolling bee between farm Congressmen and WPAdvocates hove into view . And the World War Veterans ' Legislation Committee prepared to add heavily to the Government 's overhead , to ask regular pensions of $40 a month for 65-year-old World Warriors-a cost of $31,000,000 a year to start with , $13,000,000,000 eventually . <P> <P> * He cited " a recent Gallup Poll , " " innumerable resolutions of trade associations , " " bankers ' groups , " " newspaper editorials.
