The 19th Century saw U. S. women emancipated in many fields-but not in religion . The first U. S. women 's missionary body , founded in 1819 after a Methodist divine exclaimed , " The help of the pious females must not be spurned , " was purely ancillary to a male board . When , in 1869 , eight women formed the Woman 's Foreign Missionary Society , an independent body , churchmen tried to persuade them to let it be administered by men , who knew about such things . But the women stuck to their purpose , which was " engaging and uniting the efforts of the women of the Church in sending out and supporting female missionaries , native Christian teachers and Bible women in foreign lands . " <P> The society sent to India one of the most famed missionaries of all time , Isabella Thoburn . For her it named Asia 's first college for women-in Lucknow , India . It dispatched to the East the first U. S. woman doctor , Clara Swain . Today the Woman 's Foreign Missionary Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible women and other workers in 17 lands , is the largest U. S. organization of its kind . Last week , not without some pangs and misgivings , it faced the prospect of losing its identity-in the impending merger of the three main branches of U. S. Methodism . <P> The M. E. Church , the M. E. Church . South , and the Methodist Protestant Church , aggregating 8,000,000 members , are to be united next April by a conference in Kansas City . Among other things the conference will decide on how best to merge seven boards all doing related tasks . <P> Probably four boards will remain : Education , Home Missions , Foreign Missions , Christian Work for Women . The Woman 's Foreign Missionary Society will have to join with one of the last two . Last fortnight its president of the past 17 years , soft-spoken Mrs. Evelyn Riley Nicholson of Mount Vernon , Iowa , voiced a plea not only for the members of her society but for Methodist women in general : " We implore that you not relegate our activities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way as to limit us . " While Methodist committees last week explored ways &; means of settling this and other questions , 1,300 Methodists gathered in Nashville , Tenn. for the largest banquet the city had ever seen . It was the first time the three branches of Methodism had met officially since the Methodist Protestants split off in 1828 ( over lay representation ) and the Southern Methodists broke away in 1845 ( over slavery ) . Two Negro Methodist bishops sat among the banquet guests of honor . No Southerner complained .
