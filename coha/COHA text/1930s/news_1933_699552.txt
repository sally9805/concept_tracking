txt THE HOOVER REGIME . Comment Evoked by French Strother 's Article in The Times . To the Editor of The New York Timea : You are to be congratulated on publishing the article by French Strother covering the Hoover administration . Of a number of men I met yesterday and today each commented most favorably on the scope , material and the high tone of this article . May I suggest that it was the opinion of several men gathered together at a luncheon today that it would be well worth while if THE NEW YORK TIMES issued this article in pamphlet form for a much wider distribution ? In view of the widely known unfavorable attitude of THE NEW YORK TIMES toward President Hoover . the printing of Mr. Strother 's article is another proof of the fairness of THE NEW YORK TIMES and another reason why it stands out in the front rank as a newspaper . W. F. MILLER . Harrisburg , Pa. , Feb. 27 , 1933.                 @ @ @ @
