I STARTED looking for work at Swift 's . At quarter of seven the great barnlike employment office was already partly filled . It was a bare room , with no furniture except for long , unvarnished benches and bleak gray walls banded , shoulderheight , by a stroke of black to serve as a precaution against contact with dirty men . The one touch of color was a ragged poster carrying a profusion of American flags and a patriotic pledge . In the entire room there were scarcely a dozen men collected in groups . Hunting work is a job better done alone , and the men stood by themselves with eyes on the floor or on the door out of which the employment boss would issue . By seven there were two hundred men , or more , in the room , a good half of them Negroes , and the balance divided among burly Poles , Mexicans , Germans , and a few men of slighter build like myself , who , if asked , would have called themselves Americans . A day 's growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn mackinaw gave me an indigenous appearance , and our tatterdemalion American language provided me with appropriate vocal accessories . There was nothing left to indicate that two days before I had presided , from a comfortable office , over the activities of men like these who swung picks and oiled machines , who dragged barrels four times as large as themselves , or who shoveled their own weight forty times an hour . The incongruity of hiring and firing these people , of exercising control over them , of deciding what was a fair amount of work to expect , of determining , within limits , their remuneration without knowing by actual experience what they or their work were like had prompted me to find out . I bought a battered suitcase and a ticket to Chicago . With these and twenty dollars I set out to learn what life at the bottom is like . " How long you been out ? " I asked a Negro next to me . He stared at me a moment . " Got laid off before Christmas . I had a run-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They taking many on now ? " He shook his head . " Kinder slow everywhere you go . There ai n't nothing doing anywhere . Ca n't get nothing here , but you ca n't never tell . My old woman 's working , so I ai n't worrying . " I compared notes with one of the " Americans . " " I had a pretty soft job over at Zenith Radio , " he told me , " but they 're laying off a lot of guys now . Me and another guy saw we were going to get let go so we asked for a day off and hunted all over this damn town for something , but there was n't a thing doing anywhere . Seems like there ai n't no openings now . Yeah , testing radios is pretty soft . Here you hafta work like a damn nigger and then you ca n't even get a break . It 's this stock business that 's raising hell .  | You 'll never get a look-in here unless you got a drag somewhere . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note . I 'll probably get something if anybody does . " One of the Poles whom I accosted was surprised to find anyone hoping to find a job . " You know somebody ? " he asked . " Got no friend in the company , catch no job . You never get job here . They want ' em big guys . Hard work , I been thirteen weeks out . " Suddenly there was a hush like that in a theater when the curtain rises . The Employment Boss was coming in . He was a grizzled old Scotchman with square jaw , compressed lips , and quickshifting , penetrating eyes that focused on us like an animal trainer overawing caged hyenas . A flabby policeman with a triple chin got up and made a big show of pushing the crowd back ; he may have been only a company cop but he carried a club which he jammed into our ribs authoritatively . In the cleared space the Boss walked up and down , staring at us . Though we followed his gaze and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dropped our eyes as though caught overstepping our rightful place . When he had cowed us he began pacing back and forth with his chin dropped full upon his purple-striped shirt , hands clasped behind his back . He seemed amazed that we were there , and I somehow got the idea that he was concocting a story to discourage us from bothering him . I sensed that the men around me were impressed as I was with his attitude that he was putting in an appearance only as a matter of company policy , and that as far as hiring us ? or anyone else ? it was quite out of the question . Finally he spat at the wall and wheeled around , eyes leveled at us . The last time I had felt quite as insignificant was when , as a boy , I was caught after throwing a stone through a store window . Finally he shot out a finger . " You , " he growled . A great black Negro pushed through the pack , and all of us craned our necks to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he barked like an irate traffic cop as he directed this fellow partly elated and partly stagestruck at being the cynosure of four hundred pairs of eyes , into the fencedoff enclosure . In similar manner he called a half dozen more out of the crowd . A few men presented folded notes into which he glanced between spurts of tobacco . " Ai n't no use to come here ' less you got a pull , " whispered a little fellow . " You said it , " answered a man in front . " They can take their lousy jobs straight to hell . I been here twenty times , but they always pick out a gang of jigaboos . Never catch me here again . " We watched the boss talking to each of the men , smiling grimly at some , nodding sententiously as others talked quietly into his ear . Whenever he approached the swinging gate we quieted down . Orders might come through for some more men ; you could never tell . Nothing happened for an hour , yet scarcely anyone left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else grew more remote . We talked to one another now like lodge brothers , and a feeling of bad luck and a dirty deal in common warmed us to one another like mutual bereavement . We told where we had tried to get jobs , where we had heard of prospects , where we worked last , how slow things were , and what a hell of a cold day it was to have to trot the streets . Finally the Boss came out again , waved his hand with a flourish . " Thassall . " We filed out , except for a handful slumped on the benches who preferred  | the warmth of futile waiting to the discomforts of futile job hunting . It was no use trying any of the other packers late in the morning inasmuch as they all start hiring at seven , so I tried the Central Manufacturing District . In the small factories an indifferent office girl invariably informed me that they were n't taking any men on just then ; and if I seemed on the verge of asking any other questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriter to supply more than a curt reply . In the larger plants the professional employment managers were almost angry at being asked and answered in a bark , " Nothing doing . " One told me that his plant wanted good men , not bums . The American Can Company employed a touch of humor and wanted to know my racket . Wrigley 's Gum was unique in regretting that it could not use my services . Everywhere else people were condescending and annoyed or surprised that I should ask . As an employer , entrepreneur , and amateur student of economics , I have , of course , been concerned about unemployment as an economic phenomenon . It was something to be classified according to its causes into technological , residual , cyclical , seasonal , occupational , and optional species . It was something to study in its long-term aspects . I went to sleep that night with something of a new appreciation of unemployment . It had ceased to be a problem to be solved ; it had become a state of existence . People had pitied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too covertly , as a down-andouter . I caught the idea which they revealed only too plainly when they found I had no job : there must be something wrong with me or I should n't be out of work . I even felt the surge that comes once in a lifetime to every contributor to the success magazines : I 'll show them . But most of all , I wondered how long it would be . Might I get a job to-morrow ? Next week ? Might my case be like that of some of the unfortunate men I had met who had been out thirteen , fifteen , twenty weeks ? The broader aspects of the unemployment problem , the long-time trend that would relieve the situation ? I never thought of it . II It was the same story the next morning . " No , we ai n't taking anyone on . " " Nothing doing here . " Sometimes the sign , frequently posted by the side of a warning to peddlers and mendicants , " No Help Wanted . " No feeling ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of having no job . All around me people did purposeful , useful things ? things I could have done better than they ? but no one had any use for me . The great moving army of workers and bosses seemed like a conspiracy against me , like a lodge which I could not persuade people to let me join . The suspicion that I was a pariah began to lay hold . I began to fancy that people looked at me quizzically with the question scarcely latent in their replies : why was I out of work if I was good enough to hold a job ? Was I a trouble-maker ? Was I lazy ? Was I shiftless ? I remember an early experience as a salesman when I had been subjected to a similar barrage of negative replies . But then the effect had been just the reverse . I had had good wares to sell and I knew it . I had lost nothing of my self-respect ; indeed , every refusal merely sharpened my wit and determination . But now I was selling myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Must I point out my good qualities , ' my salient abilities ? That  | old copy-book phrase , " the labor market , " occurred to me , and suddenly the phrase split apart from its immaculate economic context , and I saw the labor market as a degrading , doorto-door peddling of a parcel of flesh . The connotation of market as a place where there is free bidding of buyers and sellers has little application to the selling of labor : selling one 's services is like a tramp offering a valuable heirloom at the housewife 's kitchen door . She looks at it and inspects it , says that it is probably no good or the tramp would n't have it to sell , doubts the story of how he acquired it , bullies the tramp into thinking that no one ever put any value upon such trash ; and finally , having measured the tramp 's lack of resources , offers him a fraction of its real worth . I had it borne in upon me how ineffectual is the poor man 's ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a shred of modesty that prevents him from praising himself over much , he feels the weight of the circumstantial evidence of being out of a job discrediting him , and finally he can not pick and choose on an empty pocket-book but must take whatever he chances upon . What positive ecstasy I felt when I finally stumbled upon a job . A man had just been fired at Libby-McNeill 's , and I was the first to apply . It was all done in scarcely two minutes . " After a job ? " The employment boss was young , quiet , almost polite for the moment . I nodded . " Whatcha do last ? " " Whatcha quit for ? " My answers were untrue , but plausible , and he was satisfied . I was hired ! Somebody wanted me ! Somebody thought I was worth paying for . I was so inwardly jubilant that I dared not break the shell of my external composure by asking about pay . It later occurred to me that I had perhaps been unusual in this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what their job or pay will be when they are hired . So vanished some illusions about that shibboleth of laissez-faire -- the labor market . III As number 3960 , I was quickly rushed through an insurance examination by a bright young man newly out of a medical school , then led to a foreman on the loading dock . After casting an appraising eye over me and deciding , apparently , that I was about the sort of stuff the employment boss could be expected to hire , the loading foreman , a round-faced Dutchman with protruding brows like the eye sockets of a hippopotamus , pointed to a Negro resting on a hand truck . " Follow him . " My initiation into the life of manual labor followed . In the conversations that take place between the over-stuffed chairs at the City Club it is definitely assumed that any man who works with his hands is accustomed to strain and exertion and does n't " mind it . " So I thought before I tried manual labor . But the real thing is not what we armchair economists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important factors that enter into the conditions of employment . Laborers are almost invariably chosen by a blind process of selection that places in arduous jobs those who are least fitted to hold them . The hard and dirty jobs are shunned by any man who can get other work . The best physical specimens , being able to pick off the most desirable jobs , leave the " culls " to fill the hardest ones . On our job , for instance , in which we lifted boxes and pulled them  | around all day long , were many men under one hundred and thirty pounds . Some of the boxes were almost that heavy ! Here were these bantam weights crowding themselves to the breaking point to hold the job , confronted all the time with the fear of getting fired if they let down , and knowing that there were dozens of men who would snap at the work . True , I met a few men who had worked at my job in the past and swore they would never go back to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hungry are many . My colored buddy had been working on the job for four months and he was literally being knocked to pieces . His arches were dropping and , finding arch supports beyond his means , he wrapped his feet with strips of tape . His knees and calves swelled up , and he was compelled to soak them in hot water and rub them with liniment every night . A pain in the back necessitated a swathe of cloth , which he wore tightly wound , as a corset . To top it all , his lungs were beginning to bother him . He was a better than average worker , and the boss thought he got along well ; as a matter of fact he was committing suicide at fortytwo and one half cents an hour . Nor was my buddy exceptional . Not a man in the gang who did not nurse an ailment of some sort , and if not an organic difficulty , then an accident . Though the company religiously posted graphic illustrations on its bulletin boards emphasizing the wisdom of caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible to heed them . For the most part our accidents were minor enough to make us limp if not to lay us off ? but over us hung the often repeated story of the man whose head had been cut off by our elevator two years before . If I learned nothing else on the job , I at least learned this : that it is an illusion of armchair executives to think that laborers are " used to " their jobs and are immune to pain and excessive fatigue . I shall never again be able to regard a man complacently as a mere instrument . Similarly , the conception which executives hold of a laborer as a being accustomed to a bleak and unintermittent life of hard work , untroubled by longings and desires beyond his ability to satisfy , is likewise a delusion . My buddies were not ignorant of better days . One had been a porter in a wealthy Pacific coast country club frequented by Hearst , the publisher . One had worked at paint spraying and had lived very comfortably on the lucrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job because it was ruining his lungs . One had held a fairly responsible job as hay buyer in some foreign country . All of them had experienced the comparative prosperity of the War which had given them a taste of a scale of living impossible before ? and since . For every one of them the present job entailed falling below a standard they had set as desirable ; and the imminence of hunger and fear of sickness were bitter incentives to bettering themselves . Not one of the many I met was satisfied to remain in the job he held at the wages he received . But they are handicapped by lack of acquaintance with any but the lowest stratum of industry , by lack of anything but hearsay rumors as to where jobs are available ; they lack the specialized skill or the trained adaptability which enables men to command decent pay ; they lack the waiting power afforded by capital and are consequently compelled to accept the first job that turns up ; they lack self-confidence because of the bullying unskilled laborers are given always and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ignorance , and fear prevent them from  | finding good jobs ; and the poor jobs they get keep them ignorant , fearful , and economically insecure . But neither fatigue , low wages , or irregular employment is at the root of the most bitter grievance I found among the workers . Men expect to get tired and be injured ; they demur at low wages but regard them as inevitable ; though they fear plant shutdowns and layoffs they accept them as inescapable risks . But they can not swallow the unfairness , the treachery , which manifests itself in many forms , but especially in the speed-up system . In general , speed-up systems include all schemes whereby men are called upon to do more work than they freely choose and range all the way from justifiable incentives designed to overcome normal human indolence or deliberate malingering to obnoxious contrivances that push the individual to the breaking point . It is a hard thing to say where the system of artificial stimulation of production becomes vicious . Any standard is bound to be oppressive to some members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power to make even the most humane scheme thoroughly reprehensible . A great deal depends upon the considerateness of the individuals who apply these systems ; and I am afraid that it is one of the serious defects of our industrial system and a reproach to the executives in whose keeping it is , that we have not developed managerial technic to a point at which thoughtful individuals are encouraged or permitted to apply the speed-up system in a constructive manner . The speed-up system is a corruption of the bonus system . It is what a bonus plan becomes when handled in a careless and unscrupulous way . Unlike the bonus plan , which endeavors to serve as a more or less free incentive to workers , a speed-up system operates through the application of fear , deception , and downright trickery . The workers to be speeded up are first put on a bonus and as soon as they are induced , by the prospect of large remuneration , to push themselves to increased exertions , the pay is cut . Often this procedure is repeated two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it necessary to put forth constantly increasing exertions to retain the same pay . A momentary increase in production is attained at the expense of the worker 's confidence in the management and in industrial honesty . It is the worker 's clearest evidence that factory owners and bosses are out to " do him dirt . " Moreover , the speed-up plan defeats its own ends . The men come to regard themselves as victims of a system and find means of retaliating when they receive what they think is unfair treatment . They stall , they sabotage , they defraud the company . I had n't been on the job an hour before my buddy pointed out that I was working too fast , and that if I continued I should show the gang up , and there would be another rate cut . We engaged in a conspiracy to keep down production to forestall further wage cuts . When we were pushed too hard we would get lost , or the push cart would develop some defect . If any member of the squad refused to conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by blocking his truck and hampering him at every turn . For good measure , our gang made a practice of breaking a maximum of company goods , purely by accident of course , and of stealing on all occasions . Our philosophy embraced the notion that since the company was out to trim us , we had better lose no opportunities of gyping the company . IV Work is the central fact in life as it is lived in the Yards . Being unpleasant ,  | it is generally regarded as an unmitigated evil . Like death , it is accepted as a necessary and unpleasant concomitant to life . What good there is comes from an escape from work . Amusement thus serves more than one purpose . It is not only a distraction , but it supplements , and in many people entirely displaces theology as an explanation of the purpose of existence . Contrary to common belief on Main Street , I found the inhabitants of the Yards not at all oblivious to questions of eschatology , and not unreflective . The Yards has thought over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that the purpose of life is to get a reward either in heaven or here on earth . Since the reward on earth is rather scanty , most of the older men whom I could get to discuss the question were inclined to trust heavily in the hereafter ( " if I did n't think so I 'd go shoot up a bank and have some fun " ) ; but there was a general inclination to squeeze what pleasure they could out of the moment as a debt that was due them . Aside from our work and our amusements , we had practically no interests . Everything we talked about fell under one or the other head . If it is the measure of civilization to acquire interests not related to mere personal survival and distraction , we were emphatically a barbaric crowd . We were thoroughly self-centered in that we knew no point of view but our own . I had never realized before what it means to have been brought to maturity without the benefit of the acquired perspectives which literature , science , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate now and the immediate here . To arrive at any understanding of the barrenness of the worker 's life it is necessary to bear this in mind . The topic that bulked largest in our conversation was women . We talked about them in a purely impersonal way as though they were so much furniture and not as personal entities that might be entitled to some privacy . Indeed , our gang had no privacies . Marriage was no affair of the spirit but simply a legalized physical need , prostitution a recognized accessory in the life of all those who had no wife available for use . The gang were simply so many prurient animals . Liquor and the means of obtaining it furnished a subject over which we spent hours of discussion . There was not a man in our gang who did not drink , and most of us imbibed as generously as wages permitted . The liquor traffic is the Yards district 's most prominent retail trade . My rooming house included a speakeasy , and there were five more in the same square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been padlocked . ' The degree of concealment which they affected appeared to depend upon the amount of protection paid , a few of them operating clandestinely , but most of them with no more camouflage than a bottle of strawberry pop in the window . Almost every member of our gang planned for at least a pint of gin on Saturday night . Some of the more opulent , or less responsible , went on two- or three-day bouts , and one of my Irish cronies at the rooming house had been on a four weeks ' carouse when I left . Those reformers who think that liquor is an added curse to the povertystricken are not wholly correct . In a sense it is something of an economy and a blessing . Cheap liquor is the most inexpensive form of entertainment available for a working man . For fifty cents ? a pint of gin ? the average man can get himself into a pleasant frame of mind for a few hours . And as for the horrible habit of men drinking on Saturday night , I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't look forward to the occasion as a break in the monotony of existence . It takes a drastic break in the scheme of things to produce a pleasant effect in the Yards , and this the Saturday-night drunk accomplishes . There is no pleasure in the liquor itself ? not in the stuff that sells at fifty cents per bottle ? but the necessity of escaping from the cage at intervals is a universal need that must be met by the best means available ? art , literature , religion , or liquor . It was in our nominally leisure hours that the gang was most conscious of its caged feelings . We read in the pink and salmon newspapers the vices and dissipations of the rich ; we sneered at them as they rode in long , slim cars ; we met them leaving night clubs on our way to work . Here we were , trying to make sixty cents cover two meals and a lunch ; not a dime left to raise hell on . Our virtue was insufferable . It is frequently pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present generation is better off than the worker of any past period . To this there are two replies : first , that it is not so much the absolute standard of living that measures satisfaction or dissatisfaction as the relative disparity between one 's own standards and those of the conspicuous members of the community . Second , the fact that workmen have starved and been undernourished for centuries past does not in the least assuage one 's present hunger . The members of my gang would have had no difficulty in recognizing what was meant by " minimum subsistence level " ; they were always close to it . My Negro buddy borrowed two dollars of me one Saturday night , returning it very promptly on Wednesday when we were paid . Knowing that he had two children , and that his wife was sick , I asked him what he had done with a mere two dollars . I learned that half of it went to buy three scuttles of coal ( which figured at the rate of $14 per ton for stuff that sold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dollar he had spent for stew on which the four had somehow lived for three days . One of the Poles asked me one day how much I was paying for my room . I thought that my $4 per week was low enough to boast about , but when I told him he swore in amazement at my extravagance . His family of five lived in three rooms of a ramshackle old house for which he paid $9 per month . I asked him if he was saving for some purpose . " Save hell ! " he said , " I been out work three month , save hell ! " On Main Street , where even in bad years we are at least sure of our salary check every month , we think of poverty in terms of lifting the mortgage on the old homestead . On Halstead I encountered men to whom even a mortgaged homestead would have meant fantastic opulence . One was a Hungarian farmhand who had hoboed from the Dakotas into Chicago , not without being shot at by railroad detectives , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job which called for the ownership of a butchering knife he pawned all his possessions and could raise only eighty-five cents . There was old Downey , born in Brookline of Back Bay parentage , who had lost a fortune in cotton and copper in 1893 and 1907 and who now tends stove in the speakeasy for food and an occasional glass of something . There was a young chap just out of Bridewell jail where he had been half frozen and half bludgeoned ; his beer fiat having been smashed up in his absence , he found himself unable to take anything but a restaurant job because he could n't find anything else that would pay him soon enough to permit him to eat .  | There was old Bill Evans , seventyeight years old , still working in the Yards driving cattle on and off a scale in every weather for twelve dollars a week . There was a very likable old codger who was hit by a car and carried in , writhing with pain like an injured kitten ; when we called his son , who owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised to ship the old bird to a charity hospital because " he was too old for anything anyway . " There was Schwartz , the son of a Lutheran minister , who was reduced to washing dishes in a restaurant sixteen hours a day for board and fifteen cents an hour . My own twenty-five dollars a week was a fairly enviable income in my circle ? for honest work , that is . The proprietor of the speakeasy sported a second-hand Packard , and the Republican precinct captain drew eight dollars a day for locking up a tool house " when there was n't no investigations going on . " Necessarily , life is rather barren on these incomes if you are not prepared to lead a " life of the spirit . " We emphatically were not . We wanted food , and entertainment , and respite from weariness , and escape from worry about the next day 's meals . We were too tired and too poor to go to sport events . We had no automobiles to ride . The one radio in the establishment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers ? even the religious weeklies were an intellectual exertion a little too great to make except on Sundays . The only movies we could afford had such bad projectors that they pained the eyes . Our diversions were limited to women , liquor , the papers , cards , street-car riding , going to church , and politics . V The one road that offers egress from the poverty and monotony of the Yards is the political business . To the masses it offers brief but spectacular drama ; it affords the one occasion on which they are flattered and toadied to . To the enterprising individual it offers the prospect of quick wealth and an escape from the stultification of poverty . The Yards regards politics not as a public trust but as a business . It is not a function of the private citizen entered upon as an interlude in an otherwise occupied life . It is carried on by a professional political class as distinct from lay citizens as the clergy is distinct from its congregations . Besides being a speakeasy and general rendezvous , my boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidant was the Republican precinct captain . Thanks to the occurrence of an aldermanic election during my stay in the Yards , I was given some opportunity of seeing some of the minor cogs of the political machine in operation . In fact I shared a small part in a Republican campaign and , because my precinct captain was also judge of election , even helped the precinct in an official and professional non-partisan way too . Of the total of approximately five hundred names registered in our precinct , my friend , the judge of elections , told me that nearly three hundred were floaters , that is , fictitious names . On election day there was a grand rush by both parties to float the spurious names . Carloads of hoodlums were hired and carried from one precinct to another , given cards bearing floated names , and sent in to vote as many times as the judge of elections had been " greased off " to permit . The high record in our precinct was 18 times for one man , but he was hard pressed by several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation upon the number of votes which a " floater " may cast , it is not exaggerating the  | possibilities to estimate that a single man may vote upwards of 60 times during the day . The judge of elections , who had presided in originally tabulating the floater vote , estimated that of approximately 325 votes cast in the precinct , less than 70 were legitimate . The brazen way in which the ceremonies are run off is what amazes a man from Main Street where , no matter what our derelictions may be , we cast only one vote , and that our own . A man came in carrying a floated name , announced himself , and got ready to cast his ballot , when one of the party watchers discovered that the name had already been voted . He thereupon nonchalantly pulled a handful of cards from his pocket , blew a cloud of smoke in the face of the policeman guarding the box , and announced that he was an entirely different person . I gaped , expecting that this hypocrisy would be too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was " verified , " and he proceeded unhindered to vote . I voted a floated name myself , and I have not to this day seen the address at which I was registered . In addition to being a spectacular side show in the life of the Yards , politics has a deeper significance . It provides the pattern by which the Yards interprets and judges our economic system and the men who run it . The Yards does n't read books , does n't know history , does n't take a long-range view of any situation , does n't harbor any Ideals . All the broad generalizations by which we Americans and business men are enabled to make a more hopeful and , according to our lights , more accurate appraisal of our society and ourselves are impossible in the Yards . They are impossible because there is no sense of security and no opportunity for dispassionate and disinterested reflection . When existence is a bitter business and you are unremittingly at it you do n't think very abstractly about it . You do n't have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most immediate standard you have , namely how the sixth precinct of the thirteenth ward is run . Grafting is looked upon as the normal form of economic relationship for everyone in any position where graft is possible , whether in business , politics , religion , or philanthropy . The Yards has a theory that everyone in the world grafts off somebody else : the employer grafts off the employee and the employee off the employer , the wife off the husband and the husband off the wife , the municipal employee off the city and the city off its citizens , the policeman off the street walker and the street walker off her client , the Church off its congregation and the priesthood off the Church . Mr. Hoover " gets " his , Congressmen " get " theirs , judges " get " theirs , business men " get " theirs , big-league ball players " get " theirs , racketeers " get " theirs . It is human nature to graft , the Yards concludes . Almost invariably when someone is discussing corruption in the Yards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knockdown ? I would , too , if I was in his place . " Life is a universal racket . More than anything else , this constant sense of grafting and being grafted upon has the effect of imparting an impression of the jungle . You begin to look upon everyone you meet with a view to determining whether he means to get anything out of you or not . One of the keenest pangs of poverty in the Yards arises from the realization that one is impotent to prey upon others and is at that very lowest state of society where he is at the mercy of everyone else and is powerless to return depredation in kind .  |
