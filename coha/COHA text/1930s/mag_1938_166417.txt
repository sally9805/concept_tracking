Eons before Franklin Roosevelt strewed Canada 's broad Laurentian slope with fistfuls of international amity ( see p. 9 ) , Ice Age glaciers had been over the place , scupping out the wide St. Lawrence river bed and garnishing it , like a great dish of trifle , with thousands of inviting islands . Since then many men have visited the Thousand Islands-legendary tribes of gravel-knoll dwellers , red-paint people ; then Indians and white men-but until one day last week no summer sightseer could drive through them in his automobile . <P> On that day . President Roosevelt and Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie King motored over a series of bridge spans , viaducts and curving highways , came to a stop on a go-foot span . Below them rippled a narrow streamer of the St. Lawrence known as the International Rift , through which runs the U. S.-Canada boundary line . Each with his right hand clutching one grip of an enormous pair of shears , they snipped a gaily fluttering ribbon . The first Thousand Islands International Bridge , from Collins Landing , N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Undertaken last year by New York 's Thousand Islands Bridge Authority , the crossing cost $3.050.000 , is expected to pay for itself in 15 years with automobile tolls of $1.25 . A series of five two-lane bridges connected by a viaduct and about five miles of highway , it traverses four islands , brings 200 others into view , will be cheaper by more than half , quicker by many times than the ride on the nearby Clayton ( N. Y. ) - Gananoque ferry . <P> Within a 300-mile radius of the new bridge , a comfortable day 's drive , live 35,000,000 people , a fourth of the U. S. population , a third of Canada 's . To many of these the link meant an international short cut to a neighbor 's dooryard ; to others , weekends in the bass and muskellunge waters , easier access to a prime vacation land . But to a " whimsical few the route had still another charm . Nearer the U. S. than ever were Ontario 's Dionne quintuplets.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
