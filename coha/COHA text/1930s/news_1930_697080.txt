txt AFFECTING TRUST FUNDS . Pending Legislation Would Relax Legal Restrictions . To the Editor of The New York Times : A very dangerous relaxation of the Legal restrictions upon the Investment of trust funds is contemplated in Senate bill 388 and Assembly bill 446 now pending before the Legislature of this State . It is proposed to amend Section 21 of the personal property law and Section 111 of the decedent estate law so as to legalize for trust investments certain collateral trust mortgage certificates issued against a pool of first mortgages on real estate , with discretionary power of substitution , extension and renewal reserved to the company issuing the certificates . It is in this power of substitution , extension and renewal that the danger lies . The original investment might be entirely conservative and proper ; the fiduciary purchasing such trust certificates would have an opportunity to examine the security offered and the responsibility would be upon him to satisfy himself concerning its sufficiency . He would , however , have no way of performing the equally important duty of vigilant supervision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus invested would be in effect at the mercy of the managers of a blind pool . The hazards of this nature incident to a possible change of management in the companies issuing the certificates are both obvious and real . The bills mentioned have been referred to the Committee , on the Judiciary of the Senate and Assembly , respectively . It is suggested and urged that all persons interested in maintaining the legal safeguards for the security of trust funds should write without delay to the chairmen of these committees and record their objections to this dangerous legislation .
