txtP10We are called to the car , and we go to it reluctantlyalthough we know that there is still a great deal to be seen . There is a track of sorts and along it we travel fairly fast , through everchangingscenery . We are descending now and looking for a site for the night 's camp . But our eyes are too busy to search thoroughly , for there are sights of interest continually before us . There is something on the road in front : surely a snake ? Yes , a big mamba , crossing the track with his head raised some two feet above the ground . We acceleratein the hope of getting a closer view , but although we had only fifty yards to cover he has disappeared into the grass and bushes by the time we reach the spot . On we go , seeing animals within fifty yards of the track , including groups of giraffe : they stand and stare at the car , but make no attempt to run from it . A kudu runs beside the track , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashes across the path in front of us and disappearsinto a belt of fairly thick bush . The country here is very varied : patches of short thorn alternating with clearings , and beltsp11of closely-growing trees . As we run through one of those tree belts , we see on our left a clearing , and in the middle of it a small driedupswamp : and there , not a hundred yards from us , are a couple of cow elephants and a big bull . They are entirely unaware of our presence , for the wind is blowing from them to us so that they can not pick up our scent : and so we stop for a while to watch them ? a wonderful and very peaceful scene . But even to watch elephants we must not stop : and besides , the wind might veer so that our position would become dangerous . So on we go again . A hill is now running upwards on our left and on some small rocks in an open space about a dozen baboons are perched ? " old folk , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old males looking exactly like natives squatting with elbows on knees . Fifty yards farther along , a troop of gray monkeys crosses the road , but the car is traveling quickly now and the last of them will not have time to get clear ; so half a dozen climb a big solitary thorn tree at the side of the road . We can not dash past so promising a scene as a party of monkeys on aP12branch that overhangs the track , so we stop and look up , trying to keep perfectly still and silent ; but presently we see that a mother with a very young baby in her arms is getting nervous , peering down , darting to and fro , and chattering . Of course , we must not disturb a nursery ? besides , it is nearly time for us to think seriously of where we are going to camp . There is a small stream a hundred yards fartheralong , and there we can get good water , shade , and plenty of wood for the fires . The bank will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fires alight , and dinner in the pot . It is good to be at rest after a day which , if it has not been very active , has at any rate filled our minds . But there is still work to be done , for tests of the various pieces of film exposedduring the day have to be made , to make sure that the light has not been playing tricks . So one of us gets busy with his developing bag , while the rest sit in the light of the camp-fire , telling stories and speculating as to what the baboons will think of the up-to-date concert which is being played on our gramophone.  |p13Out  of the darkness comes an appalling sound , the fretful wail of a restless hyena , who must be prowling around the camp in the hope that we shall leave some piece of meat for him to steal . Well , he must take his chance , and in any case he will doubtless find a better meal beforedaybreak . But as his wail , like a demented cry , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be satisfied , for by now we have taken to our beds and are seeking sleep . It is a restless night . Just as dreams are coming to us , we start at the sound of a lion 's roar . A mile away , perhaps ? but it sounds quite close ? he has made his kill , and afterwards he has been to a pool to drink ; and now , well satisfied , he is giving that mighty full-throated roar which speaks his contentment . Then sleep , again ; and another start into wakefulness at a sound like the puffing of a steam-engine , which tells us that we are camped near the path of a rhino who has discovered our scent and is venting his annoyance . Again we nearly drop off to sleep ; and this time we are aroused by one of our own native boys ' ( but though we always call him that , hep14is , as a matter of fact , a finely-built man of thirty-five with a wife and four bonny piccaninnieswhom he has left in his village ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tembo ! " ( Master , elephant ! ) ; and very hastily we scramble out of bed and stand ready for emergencies . We can see nothing , but we soon hear the breaking of branches and know that the elephants ? forall we know there may be a herd of as many as two hundred ? must be uncomfortablyclose . There will be no chance of sleep for us till they move off , so we switch on the spot-light of the car and bring it into action . See ! There they are ! ? not two hundred , but a dozen , certainly , and there may be others out of the range of the light ? just on the other side of the stream . They do not like this strange full moon which has suddenly appeared in the night , and they are not so foolish as to stay beforean unknown danger . Away they go , so silently that we can not hear them move . Now some sleep at last . Thank goodness , that hyena is silent ? doubtless he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sounds aroundp15us , but we are far too tired to bother about them . Let them come , lions , elephants , whatever they are ? we do not care ( or tell ourselvesthat we do not ) if only we can get some sleep . It is the sun , coming in where the flap of our tent has been opened , that awakens us . A beautifulmorning , and we must start early before the heat makes movement impossible . A fairly long drive brings us to the shores of a beautiful lake , where we stop to take an early lunch . There are thousands of birds here , pelicans , cormorants , herons , kingfishers : it is a wonderful spot with so much to be seen immediately before our eyes that we decide to pitch our camp in the shade of a big tree . As we sit there , looking at the lake , we see a family of hippo , apparently very suspicious and only bobbing up out of the water now and again to peer at us . When they rise they scare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flapping of wings as the birds scatter for thirty yards and then settle down again . On our right is a big belt of papyrus , and there we see a sight which is comparativelyp16rare ? weaver birds of another kind at work making a wonderful nest which hangs down over the water with a long tube-like attachment to protect the eggs and the young from snakes . There are a hundred things here to interest us , and we are so fascinated that we do not even bother about the ever-present mosquito . Even if there was nothing to watch but the lazy hippo , we should be content , but there is much more than that , including two very repulsive looking crocodiles that are basking on a sandbanka hundred yards away . Towards evening , from a few miles of bare country , the zebra and other game wend their way towards the water , and as this tells us that the heat is now considerably less we start on a short expedition among the little volcanic hills which make a background to the lake . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extraordinaryand rather depressing sight , for it is a lake of the dead . Dead tree stumps rise out of the water and all is as silent as the grave . No birds fly here , no fish swim in the lake , no animals come to drink . And the heat is almost unbearable . Come away , quickly . There are far betterp17things to be seen by the bigger lake , only a mile away , which we have just left . Why should we look at dead tree stumps and a silent water , when we can see the papyrus , and the trees of the weaver birds , and the lake with its waterfowland hippo ? Now , night is coming upon us again . The zebra are calling and squealing , an ostrich cries " boom , boom , " the owl in a tree behind us is hooting , and the hyena is once again disturbing the beauties of an African night . There comes a roar that might be that of a lion ; but it is not , it is the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That grunt . . . grunt . . . grunt : that is the noise of the hunting lion . Come . Who wants to lie abed to-night while the creatures of the bush are awake and alert ? Or who would linger late in the morning , when there are a thousand sights to be seen ? Elephantsyou can see , and the busy ant , the locust swarming , and the cheetah hunting , the ostrich sitting on her eggs in the plain , the giraffe contortinghimself to drink , and the python waiting for his prey . . . .  |p21I  SAT on a small hill in the heart of Central Africa . Twenty miles away , the plain began to rise , and my view was bounded by mountains , with one long-extinct volcano high above the others directly in front of me . There was grandeur in those mountains and I could have watched them for hours if matters of more pressing interest had not been close at hand . A hundred and fifty yards away , the ground rose fifty feet above the level of the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot high , with a solitary small thorn tree near the top . On the plain between the hill on which I stood and that other hill , browsed some two or three hundred of the gentler animals of the bush ? zebra , kongoni and gazelle . Feeding off the grass , the herds kept a short distance apart ; but away on the left stood a single zebra and at about the same distance to the right a kongoni.  |p22It  was a sight that is common enough in Africa ; a herd of animals feeding , with two of their number standing apart as sentinels , to give warning to the rest at the approach of danger . At the first glance , there was no suggestion of danger in the view , which might well have been the subject of an Academy picture . But the two animal sentinels were alert and watchful , looking towards the little hill . Clearly , they knew of the presence of an enemy . And I , searching with field-glasses , suddenly detected a movement and discovered what the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree that crowned the little hill crouched a lion . The herds apparently had confidence in the sentinels , and although they too must have known that the lion watched them , they fed steadily forward until they were within seventy-five yards of the hill . Then the lion advanced , very much like a cat , creeping on his belly through the grass . Immediately the two sentinels bolted and the whole herd , taking the alarm , thundered away . But the herds were not willing to desert thep23good pasture they had found , and in a minute or two they started once more to feed back , whilst the sentinels again took up their position , looking towards the hill and the lion . This was in broad daylight and , of course , the lion 's chances of a successful stalk were small , as the grass was shorter on the level ground than on the hill . Indeed , although occasionally it must happen , I have never seen a lion succeed in a daylight stalk , and since he must know how poor are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely in earnest , unless he has missed his feed in the night , as he sometimes does , particularly in the wet season when he is inclined to stay under cover . The day is not his natural feeding time , and I think he hunts then more for the excitement of the chase , than to kill . The temptation , when he sees a feeding herd , is too much for him , and he stalks it like a playful cat . But at night , as I shall show , it is different . After I had watched the herds and the lion for some time , I went forward on horseback to try to see the lion at closer range . But he had vanished . For nearly three-quarters of a milep24the grass was less than a foot high , and yet the lion had been able to retreat at my approach without giving the slightest sign of his movements . It is always amazing how a lion , huge beast as he is , can crouch almost flat and come and go in short grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that three lions were hiding in a tunnel washed out by the rains , I watched the spot with two companions , thinkingthat we should see the lions as they moved away . But an hour passed and we saw nothing . At last we decided on a closer investigation and moving cautiously we went to the lower end of the tunnel , only to discover that the lions were no longer there . To the three of us it was almost incredible , and yet it was undoubtedly true : those three beasts had come out of the tunnel and had crawled , under cover of grass eighteen inches high , down into a small valley and up to the ridge beyond unseen , although the whole of the valley was well within our view . At another time , I was out alone except for a native boy ' in the same sort of country : occasionalsmall undulations , but otherwise nothingp25in the way of cover ' except the foot-high grass . As we came round the side of one of the little hills , the boy ' suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( lion ) . They were not two hundred yards away ; five huge creatures feeding on what was apparently a small gazelle which could hardly have suppliedthem with a mouthful each . It was one of the chances of a lifetime , and I sent the boy ' back to fetch my companions , and also my camera so that I might get a picture . I had a special reason for being interested in those lions . Earlier in the morning , I had discovered by chance a human skull , picked almostclean of flesh , but unmistakably that of a native . Two things were clear about it ; the killingof that native had been done within the last twelve hours ? and it had been done by a lion . As , then , there was a man-eater in the district , it was more than likely that he ? or she ? was one of the group I had just discovered . That was why I had sent for my companions , since , with lions as with other things , there is safety in numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ip26was exceedingly rash to wait on the spot for my friends and the camera . But I never care to miss a chance of studying the lion , and I calculatedthat the animals were all far too busy with their meal to trouble about me , and that I should have an excellent opportunity to make my observations undisturbed . But there I was wrong ? utterly and completely , and very nearly finally , wrong ! Either the meal must have been much nearer completion than I imagined , or else the gazelle was too insignificant to occupy the lions ' whole attention . In any case , long before my companionshad had time to come from the camp , a big lioness yawned , licked her lips , looked round , and fastened her eyes on me ! Then she got up , came forward a few yards , and stood considering me , while the other four stood up and began to follow . It has been said that a lion that has finished a meal is so sleepy and contented that a man can go within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true ? sometimes . It was certainly not true of this lioness . Perhaps her meal had been really inadequate . Perhaps there wasP27merely something in the sight of me that particularlyinterested her . Or perhaps ? and , as I decided at the time , more probably ? she was the man-eater whose grisly leavings I had discovered . At any rate , she quite clearly meant business and she had no intention of either leaving me in peace or letting me get away uninvestigated . It was a position in which something had to be done , and that quickly . If I sat still , the lioness would very soon reach me . If I turned and ran , she would be after me at once and I should have no chance of outpacing her . So I decided to try to adopt something like the lion 's own stalking tactics , with variations of my own , and with the object of getting farther instead of nearer . If lions could slip out of sight in the grass , why should not I ? Suddenly , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute of lying there with a thumping heart , I very cautiously raised my head and looked to see how much nearer the lioness had come . Apparently my maneuver had mystified her , for she was standing still and looking back at  |p28the  four lions behind her , as if to ask whether they could tell her what had become of me . So far , so good . But the lioness began to come forwardagain . This time , I suddenly sprang to my feet ; and the sight of me , suddenly appearinglike a jack-in-the-box out of the grass , so much startled her that she again stopped . But not for long . It puzzled her , this sight of a man who kept appearing and disappearing , but it must , I suppose , have added to her curiosity . In any case , she came on again , now more steadily . Again I disappeared into the grass , and now I began to work my way backward , as quickly as I could , but taking infinite care not to show myself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by my sudden vanishingsand appearances , I had not been retreating while I made them . It was only while I was down in the grass that I could go backwards , and I soon found that , for all my hurry , she was coming on faster than I could go back . And there was n't much chance that I should be able to steer myself sideways sufficiently to get outp32sarily as a lion in another district . But more than that , it is impossible to say that two lions , in the same district , and even hunting together , will act in anything like the same way . For the lion , more than all other animals , has individuality . He may be good-tempered or bad-tempered , brave or nervous . He may act on impulse , and no one can say what that impulse is going to be . Of many animals , one may safely say that one thing will always be done , and another thing never . But not of the lion . To everything that looks like a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to be uniform . The lion , for instance , is quite definitely an eater of meat ; yet he has been known in some districts to feed on fish . For many years I thought that the lion stood still when he roared ; but I have once seen a lion roaring asp33he walked along . I personally have never seen a lioness with more than two cubs ; yet there is ample evidence that they sometimes have three or even four . And although as a rule if the lion is shot the lioness will immediately attack in defense of her cubs or in revenge for her mate , I have known two instances in which the lioness deserted her cubs and bolted for safety . Often I have wondered what I should do if I found myself on the ground with a lion above me . I think I should make the greatest effort at self-control that I could manage and try to remainabsolutely still and silent : for if the lion could be convinced that I was dead , and if any other man should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought in place of myself ? and this time one that was forewarned . Just as lions vary in habits , they also vary in appearance . There are several kinds of lion in Africa , and one must not conclude that a creature of the lion family without a mane is a lioness , for it may be the male of the kind known as the bush lion , which has no mane . There are variations , too , in color , from golden brown , through drab , to the pale color morep34often seen in the donkey ; indeed I once assumed that two very pale-colored creatures seen only a hundred yards away , just after daybreak , were donkeys , and only discovered just in time that they were lions . You may meet lions singly , or you may meet them in troops , and it does not seem to be certain that the choice of company is necessarily associated with mating . It is much more likely that it originates merely with the need for protection . You may see two lionesses with one lion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few yards of as many as sixteen lions together ? twomales and the rest either females or youngsters three parts grown . Lions that come together in a troop will usually keep on the move ( presumably because so many of them might exhaust the commissariat possibilities of one spot ) and hunt in circles of about forty miles . The day , for the lion , is the time of rest and relaxation ; it is at night that he is busy . During the day he must sleep , in short snatches ; he may amuse himself , as I have already related , with a little experimental stalking and if by chancep35this results in a kill , he will eat ; he may partake of an extra meal if he has the luck to find something left by the jackals and the vultures when a rhino has been shot and it is sufficiently " high " to tickle his palate ; and during the day too he will play with his cubs ? a rough sort of play which must , I think , be intended to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill . A friend of mine once looked over a little rock and saw a family of lions in the open , forty yards away ; father , mother and two cubs . Besidethem lay the remains of a zebra , and high overhead circled the vultures , waiting for their chance to clear the crumbs . Mother-lion was resting after the meal , lying on her back and rolling from side to side to watch the vultures ; but father-lion , like the human father on Sundayafternoon , was playing with the children . I have had the same sort of experience myself , when for more than an hour I watched a male lion playing with his cub . First he licked it all over and then ? like a cat with her kitten ? the game began . The lion took hold of the cub with his paws and rolled on his back withp36the little fellow on his chest . Then he rolled from side to side while the cub gamboled around him . Once the cub ( as children will ) was overcome by the excitement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out its claws ; and immediately the paternal paw came down in a smack which was certainly no part of the game . It is always pleasing to see the care with which lions look after their young , quickly betrayinganxiety if they roam out of sight ? although it may be that coupled with natural anxiety is the fear that a wandering cub will lead the lion 's enemy , man , into the vicinity . There is a good deal of time for play while the lions are at rest , and the younger ones enjoythemselves just like kittens ; for though hunger may drive the lion to raids , and though in the night he is a terror to all the other inhabitantsof the bush , when he is full and well fed he finds life agreeable and shows his contentment , playing or sleeping , or sunning himself on some ant-hill , while the cubs play or sleep or eat the meat that has been given them , and the lioness lies on guard.  |p37A  lion and a lioness together will stay in the same place for weeks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly return to restarttheir family life in the same place . A rocky glade with thick bush or a small wooded hill is a favorite lair . I have known them , too , to live in small caves , and often they are to be found in the dongas , as they are called ? small ravines washed out by rains at the foot of the hills . The lair is for the day and for the cubs , but it must be near to the feeding grounds of other animals so that when night falls the lion ? and when her cubs are grown the lioness ? may find and kill the prey . Then it is ? directly night falls ? that the lion comes out into the open , not to stalk carelesslyas he has done during the day , but in deadly earnest . Unless the lioness has very young cubs , she will go with her lord to the feeding grounds or near to the water-holes where the animals drink , and will do her share in the killing , afterwards very likely carrying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lion ( and here in that word I include thep40share in other kills besides his own . I have photographed five lions eating the body of a wild beast , taking a pull at the flesh , then wanderinground to try another part of the body , and finally settling down , each to his own portion , all snarling together and quarreling when one of them approached too near to another 's chosen meal . The lion will eat his fill , and lap up the warm , salt blood ; for though he likes his meat to be high if he eats the remains of a rhino , he will eat his own kill while it is fresh and red . Then , his hunger at last appeased , he will make for a pool to slake the thirst which comes after drinking blood ; and at last he will give his great , full-throated and terrible roar , that all the animals around may know that once again a lion has killed . Then he will probably go back to his lair : but if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepy and stay beside what is left of the carcass , while jackal and hyena wait anxiously for his departure . Sometimes he may rise in an hour or two and let the jackal and the hyena , and after them , at daybreak , the vultures , havep41their meal ; but at other times he will sleep on , and only awake when the sun has risen . Occasionally at daybreak a lion may be seen rising from beside a kill and making quickly for home . But when this happens , there has been a reason for the heavy gorge that has precededthe lion 's long sleep . It is not as a rule mere greed , but a sign of genuine hunger . Hunting must have been poor of late , perhaps because rain has interfered with it . It is when the lion is old or hungry that he is most dangerous . Then , he may leave his usual hunting grounds and raid the cattle of the natives . Then , too , in extreme cases , he turns maneater . If he wants cattle he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cunning which he has learnt in the open . The natives guard their herds by building kraals or bomas of thorn and by lighting big fires inside them , because they know that the lion fears fire . But now and again the fires die down , and then the raiding lions find their opportunity . A troop once attacked a big boma built on the slope of a hill . The thorns were close , stoutp42and sharp , and the lions knew well enough that the barrier was too thick either to be broken or to be crossed by leaping . Two of them therefore went up the hill and pretended to charge , givingtheir terrifying grunts . The frightened cattle rushed to the lower side of the boma and bunched together there , close against the thorns and as far from the noise as they could go . Still the two lions threatened and grunted , and still the cattle pressed and scrambled to get fartherfrom the awful sound . And at last the thorn barrier broke on its lower side under the cattle 's weight and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other lions of the troop had waited for them . Just as a lion will take cattle when once he has acquired a taste for it , so too will he take man once he has tasted human flesh . Of course , any lion may attack a man when wounded , or perhaps when its mate is wounded , or when it is in danger . That is not man-eating . The man-eater attacks without provocation , simply for food . If you came face to face with a man-eating lion , his method of attack would depend oh thep43distance at which he sighted you . If he saw you at fifty yards , he would charge on his belly , coughing as he came , until he was near enough to spring . But if you came upon him ( as the natives do when they are lion-spearing ) so that he was cornered and stood at bay , he would stand for a second , roaring and lashing himself into a fury ? and then he would charge . It is not probable that in either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened that your boys ' or your companions were in time to rescue you , you might realize long afterwards that in the terrible last seconds , you saw the lion at least twice his normal size , with his great mane standing out and his tail in the air : and that all the while his awful grunt of rage beat again and again on your ears . Stories by the score could be told of how man-eating lions have secured their victims . One of the most terrible stories of a man-eater ? and incidentally an excellent illustration of the lion 's waywardness ? is told by Colonel Paterson in his book The Man-Eaters ofp44Tsavo . ' Colonel Paterson describes how a lion repeatedly attacked the staff of a certain railway station , taking a man night after night until the spot became a place of absolute terror . At last three Europeans decided to lie in wait for him , and took up their position in a railway carriage that was drawn on to a siding . For a while two slept ? one in a berth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , but after a while , as all seemed quiet , the third also lay down to sleep , in the second berth , the three men occupying a single compartment . Later in the night , the man-eater came , found the slidingdoor ajar , pushed it back with his paw , and entered the compartment in which lay the three men . Now , here is the curious point . It might have been thought that the lion , having come into a position of considerable danger , would have seized the nearest man and have made off withp45him to safety . But not a bit of it . The lion , instead of seizing the man who lay on the floor directly at his feet , actually stood on that man while he dragged down the man in the berth above ! Hard as it is to explain that , it is equally difficult to say why a lion after seizing a white man should leave him ? as he has been known to do ? in order to attack a native ; or , for that matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should once have pursued a zebra right into the heart of a lighted street ; or why a lion who once attacked a hunter who had no defenseexcept an empty rifle held across his chest should have swerved at the critical moment and galloped past , leaving the hunter unscathed . A few months ago I had one of the oddest experiences with a lion that has so far come my way . I was driving down a rough track at night , when suddenly a big lion stepped on to the track only thirty-five yards ahead . The wind was behind me , so that the lion must have heard the noise of the car 's engine , yet he paid absolutely no attention to it , but proceeded down the track . Naturally I slowed down , for I had no urgentp46desire to diminish the distance between us . Yet still the lion did not look behind him , only gazingsteadily at something ahead which seemed to interest him . Then , suddenly , I realized ? or at any rate suspected ? what was happening . The lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more puzzled by the strange spectacle of pieces of bush lit up in the darkness by the glare of my headlights ! To put this theory to the test , I moved the spotlight so that the beam traveled off the track to one side ? and immediately the lion followed it ! Then I accelerated , and passed the lion withinten yards , as he still investigated those ghostly-looking bushes . I doubt if there is anything that gives you a more creepy feeling than to walk close to the haunt of a lion at night , without knowing whether or not he will spring . And as may be imagined , the horrible feeling is accentuated when you know that somewhere in the district there lurks a man-eater . The natives may have told you of such a creature , with stories of how their friends have been waylaid , never to re/turn ; then , when you have stayed late at a waterhole , you return fearfully , with eyes and ears alert , starting even at your own shadow ; and later , when at last you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest sound and sit listening to the noises of the African night.  |p51I  THINK that by nature the elephant is a mild-mannered creature desiring above all things to be left alone and in peace . But that ambition , if he had it , has not been fulfilled , largely because of the commercial value of ivory ; and the elephant has passed through a long struggle for existence which still continues and which has fixed , in the place of his natural quietness , a self-protective aggressiveness . The elephant is not alone in this forced alterationof character and habits : indeed , it is not too much to say that few of the larger creaturesin Central Africa are to-day leading an entirely natural life . A hundred years ago ? beforethe coming of the man with the rifle , and long before the coming of the sportsman in a motor-car ? these animals must have lived in surroundings of comparative peacefulness , and consequently would not have had the air of suspicionwhich most of them show uto-day.  |p52Even  twenty years ago , the number of victimswas regulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day : but now he can travel five times that distance in a car and his " bag " is therefore at least five times as great . And not only has the toll of slaughter risen , but not every man who fires a rifle in Central Africa is a first-rate shot , so that many a painfultale could be told of the wounding of wild creatures by men who have been either too unskillfulor too careless to end the agony of their victims . But even apart from the actual killing and maiming ( though I certainly would not minimizethe crime of it ) , there is the moral effect of these attacks ; for it is that which changes the animals ' habits . The coming of the white hunter has destroyedthe comparative peacefulness of their haunts . It has created a new instinct of apprehensionand of wariness which is passed down among wild animals from generation to generation . It has made even the lion a shyer creaturethan he was made by his Creator , and it has forced even the most harmless of the ani/mals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this true of the elephant , who for years has faced the rifle and has learnt that man is his enemy . I am certain that if there were still in the world a tract of **25;489;TOOLONG where the white man had never penetrated , I could walk there , and watch , and photograph ( provided of course that I showed my realization of the fact that I was a trespasserby doing nothing that could harm or threaten to harm the animals and their young ) without the slightest fear of molestation . But it is not so in Central Africa to-day . Naturally , the elephant does not distinguish between the white man with a camera and the white man with a rifle . He will only settle down to feed after displaying the utmost caution and even then with constant suspicion ; and if he fancies that his suspicions are justified he will either decamp at once , or he will find out the trouble and attack . I know a water-hole where in past years the elephants came to drink during the day . A few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district , for I saw them con/stantly in the bush ; but they came to drink only by night and although I watched for a month I did not once see them at the water-hole by day . Not until later did I discover the reason : a photographic expedition had come to that water-hole in the daytime and had shot one of the elephants as it drank . It is because of acts of this sort that the elephantis now rarely seen in the open except in secluded areas . There , thank goodness , it is different ; and the striking contrast between the habits of elephants in the secluded areas or in the Reserve and those of elephants in the more easily hunted districts entirely bears out what I have said . Where the sportsman has often been , there are almost even chances that an elephant on detecting a man will charge ; whereas in the Reserve I have spent many hours in watching a bull and two cows , and although they scented my presence they showed no sign of fear and only a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences in secluded districts . Because of this , when you are in the unprotectedand unsecluded areas , the elephant is notp55to be trifled with . Should he decide that you are dangerous to him or his family , he will not hesitate to come for you , and then , since his speed is such that he can overtake a car travelingat twenty miles an hour , you will have to be agile to escape him . And although , if you were to choose the instrument of your death , an elephantmight at first seem less horrible than a lion , you might almost hesitate in your choice if you had seen an elephant holding a man powerless in his trunk , dashing his body with frightful force against a tree , and then tramplingthe half-conscious remains to death . Since speed will not avail when an elephant attacks from close quarters , there is then little chance of safety for the unarmed man . When the photographer faces rhino , if he is wise he stands near a tree , and when he is charged he climbs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree is no protection from the elephant for he will simply push his great weight against it till it falls . '  |p56No  ; one must not trifle with elephants . Study them by all means , for few creatures are more interesting ? but be wary , especially if you travel , as I invariably do , unarmed . I have an admiration for the nerve of the photographer who sets up a step-ladder to get his studies in elephant grass , but there I leave him . He is a brave man , but in my opinion a foolish one unlesshe is armed . I am not , and therefore that is a feat that I have no intention of ever attempting . Apart from the obvious desirability of being unarmed on a point of principle , I think that it has also other advantages ; for it avoids the necessity of trying conclusions with a wounded animal , and , more particularly , it ensures a greater degree of caution . But even the greatest care amongst elephants can not mean anything like an absence of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come unseen behind you . You may suddenly find yourself almost surrounded by a herd ? and I know of nothing that creates a more demoralizingeffect of utter helplessness than the sound of a herd , when it has been disturbed , plungingp57about in fifteen-foot high elephant grass , and trumpeting with notes as high as a squeal and as low almost as the roar of a lion . An elephant among trees is not easily distinguishedin spite of his great size , and on more than one occasion I have seen nothing , and heard nothing , until an elephant has moved only twenty yards from me . On the other hand , he can discover you both by hearing and by scent , for though his sight is very indifferent , his other senses of detection ( as is usually the case ) are keenly developed . The elephant moves with an amazing quietness and makes no sound to prevent him from hearing his enemies , so that if the wind is even approximately from you to him you will have no chance of remainingundiscovered . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hearing or both will disclose your presence and then he will search for you . If the wind blows steadily from him to you and you stand in absolute silence , he will probably have no idea that you are near him ; but winds , unfortunately , are not to be relied on , and if you are wise you will have someone beside you to test the breeze con/stantly with sand or dust kept handy in a small bag . I have said that when an elephant attacks at close quarters , the chances of escape are not very great ; but when time is given you there is of course one method of outwitting the elephant which gives you every chance ? you can move quickly in a transverse direction so that the wind fails to carry news of you to him . Not so long ago a friend of mine was travelingwith his wife by car in one of the most remoteparts of Central Africa , when suddenly they saw an elephant approaching them along the rough track . As the trees were thick on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning . They therefore very hurriedly left the car and ran for shelter behind a large ant-hill , taking care that in doing so they got out of the elephant 's wind . The elephant came up to the car , felt all over it with his trunk , and finally put his trunk inside the car , feeling about to make sure that no one was hiding inside . Then , realizing that the occupants had escaped , he raised his trunk , sniffing for the scent of them . But the wind held and he learnt noth/ing ; and finally he wandered away down the track by which my friends had come . During my last visit to Central Africa , my wife had an adventure which at one moment seemed certain to end in tragedy . Accompanied only by a native boy , ' she had taken the car to fetch additional supplies of cinematograph film , which I was to use in a thick belt of tropical forest where elephants lived . The road crossed two dongas , or wooded ravines , one some distance from the elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had arranged to meet her on her return at the first of these dongas , but as it happened she arrived twenty minutes before she was expected and , knowing that I would be on the road to meet her , decided to drive on towards me . Coming in a lorry down the track , I saw a herd of about forty elephants with their youngsterson the left , close to the edge of the forest . As the wind blew from the right , across the road , the elephants suspected my presence as I approached and came closer with trunks raised to investigate . I swung the lorry off the track in a detour over the grass to the right , and therep60to my utter horror I saw my wife driving towards me , straight for the elephants which , hidden from her sight by the donga , were now practically across the track . I drove straight for the donga , and down into it . Pulling up short when I reached the other side , I sprang out and almost dragged my wife from her car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although in fact we were closer than beforeto the elephants , the wind no longer carriedour scent towards them . It was , I think , the most merciful escape in my career , for had I arrived but one minute later , the car would have crossed the donga and in twenty seconds my wife , struggling perhaps to jump from the car , would have been caught . As it was , the elephants were ignorant of our whereabouts , but still suspicious , and we could see big ears spread out to listen and trunks wavingin the air from side to side , only a few yards from us , as they sought to find the scent they had lost . It was n't , quite clearly , a position in which we wanted to remain , lest the wind should be treacherous . So three times I clapped my hands loudly ? three single reports : andP61then the waving trunks went down and without the slightest sound all those elephants and their youngsters faded and disappeared into the forest . There was no sound : but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps I should say , and I say it thankfully , the anticlimax ? illustratesbetter than anything else that I could relate the marvelous power of the elephant for moving without sound . I am not exaggerating . There were about forty elephants , within a few yards of us , in a thicklywoodedravine , yet we did not hear the slightest sound as they moved away , and only our eyes told us they had gone . The elephant is to be found in the thicker parts of the country , either forest with tall trees or thorn bush , or the elephant grass which is nothing more than ordinary grass of a type which grows to fifteen feet , with a correspondingthickness and strength . The elephant goes wherever he finds suitable cover , and I have studied him in the Congo , Uganda , Kenia and Tanganyika ? as well as in India and Borneo . Curiously enough , he does not mind cold . Ip62have found him at every altitude from the sea level up to ten thousand feet , even in bamboo forests on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frequently seen in big herds ( of any number from three hundred downwards ) , and there is a popular idea that when an elephant is found living alone it is because he has grown too old to hold his place in the herd and has been turned out . In some cases , that may be so . But I have seen lone elephants who certainly did not suffer from age or weakness , I have seen them in pairs and I have seen them in threes . Perhaps some of them lacked the clubable instinct ! In some parts of Central Africa the herds are very large , although of course it is always difficult to say how many one has seen at a time since they move constantly and one can not be sure of not counting one animal twice . A herd as a rule will be constantly on the move , using a particular road which they have broken for themselves through the grass or forest , beating the earth flat , pushing the trees down and disregarding every obstacle . Whenp63they are on trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows , youngsters and the other bulls ) close behind : but sometimes a herd will consist only of cows and calves . If you are so skillful or so lucky as to be able to remain unsuspected as a large herd treks past , you will be fascinated by what you see . In the midst of the herd you will see little calves , often less than three feet high , plodding along besidetheir mothers ? and if by mischance the herd becomes disturbed you will wonder how the little creatures can possibly escape being trampled as their huge parents and uncles and aunts and cousins plunge and turn . But then , as you continue to watch , you will see how every minute the mother elephants are watching their young and protecting them , even ? or perhaps more especially ? in moments of fright . And often , as the herd tramples past you , you will see a very small calf confidently put its little trunk over that of its mother , very much as a child would hold its mother 's hand . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that age , as they have little or no tusks , they wrestle with theirp64trunks , squealing all the time in the excitement of the game . I have often seen two young cows standing with their trunks twisted the one round the other , not apparently with any idea of fighting , even playfully , but as an attitude of sheer affection so that only a kiss seemed to be needed to complete the picture . You may see , too , the young calves feeding ? and if you see that , you will notice what few people seem to realize : that the mother 's teats are not in the same place as a cow 's but between the front legs , so that the calf when it wants to feed will stand under its mother , throw back its trunk and suck with the mouth . An elephant herd on trek has set bathingplaces , and close thereby it will also have chosen trees and rocks against which , one after another , the animals rub themselves , with the result that the surfaces of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow water , the elephants will stand and squirt water over themselves with their trunks , and then they may lie down , with their heads just above the surface , and continue the operation . Clearly , it is a procedure whichp65they enjoy , but its object must , I think , be coolnessrather than cleanliness , for as often as not , directly they come out of the bath , they will start to undo all the good work by squirting dust over themselves , just as they had previouslysquirted water ! One might have thought that the picking up of dust or sand with a trunk would have been uncomfortable , but the elephant never seems to mind . Once I watched at a small river-bed , where there were steep banks down to the water ? or rather to sand which covered the water , for it was necessary to dig to a depth of almost two feet before getting anything drinkable . Elephants came to the top of the bank and proceeded to negotiate it by sliding ? a method which is also used in similar circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once in the river-bed , they started to clear away the sand with their trunks , picking it up and then blowing it in a shower over their backs , until at last they reached the water and drank their fill . I have mentioned how in the Reserve the elephants who were not afraid of man regarded  |p66me  with a good deal of curiosity . I think the elephant is naturally inquisitive : you will remember , perhaps , the Elephant 's Child who wanted to know what the Crocodile had for dinner . By the time an elephant is fully grown he has learnt , I imagine , that giving way to curiosity means running into unnecessary danger , and outside the Reserve caution takes its place . But the calf has not yet learnt that , and he will come and inspect anything new and strange . A friend of mine climbed a steep escarpmentto prospect for minerals , and from the top he saw a mother elephant fast asleep thirty yards away , with a calf beside her . The youngster saw my friend , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at him . It came quite close , then seemed to remember that it ought not to be straying and ran back to its mother . But curiosity again got the upper hand and it came for another look . Then , thinking presumably that this was something very strange which Mother ought to look into , it squealed excitedly . The mother woke up at once : but what she would have done my friend did not wait to see , for he wasp67unarmed and he knew better than to wait when a cow elephant came to the protection of her calf ! For all the elephant 's fear of man and his readiness then to attack , he rarely if ever attacksany of the many animals that are his neighbors ? at any rate though I have often seen him close to zebra , giraffe and even cattle , I have never known him to attack them . They , of course , do not attack him , and accordingly , as a peace-lover , he does not worry about them . Whether he is ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moment he forgets his natural character and fights , I do not know . But at any rate , on the only occasionin my experience when such a thing was threatened , nothing more violent occurred than crashings and trumpetings : it was a case of much shouting on both sides but no fight . It was during my recent expedition . I was photographing , one afternoon , when a big bull got my wind sufficiently to know that I was there but not so definitely as to be sure of my position . For sixty yards he came forward till he was quite close and then he turned to onep68side to try to find me . Finally he appeared to make up his mind that there was really nothing very much to trouble about , and accordingly he went away , across a dried-up swamp towards a patch of reeds and elephant grass and trees . A hundred yards away he turned suddenly into the high grass ? and immediately I heard the sound of his trumpeting , and in the midst of it the terrific roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered from the tracks next day . Within the patch of elephant grass was a little pool where animals came to drink . Near it the lion crouched , ready to spring at the sight of a zebra . Tense and quivering , like a cat , he would have waited with eyes on the pool , for his kill . Then , so silently that even he could not have heard a movement , the grass was parted ? and lion and elephant were face to face . The lion roared ? but I , listening , knew that the roar was not only of anger : three-quarters of it were from fright . And the elephant trumpeted ? butI detected also a note of fright in his trumpeting . And then the lion turned , and the elephant turned , and they went their ways ,  |p69the  lion to seek less disturbed hunting-grounds , the elephant probably a little bothered , because an otherwise peaceful morning had been completelyspoilt . And I , for my part , turned too , and went my way , wishing above all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between me and such a scene.  |p73A  FEW months ago , on a little hill-side , I discovered a very old rhino . He lived in the center of a clump of dense bush around which had grown a ring of almost impassable thorns , high and prickly , so that his retreat was safe from intruders . Protection of some sort he must have badly needed , for only a few yards away ran a road along which motor lorries passed , and a few miles to the east were settlements with Indian stores and hundreds of the Masai . Old as he was , he would have been of value to anyone who could have shot him , for his horns ( which , by the way , are not in reality horn but matted hair ) must have weighed thirty pounds , and rhino horn has a commercial value of 11 per pound weight . ' From his wariness I have littlep74doubt that attempts at shooting him had been made . The surroundings of this rhino 's home were so impenetrable that photography was out of the question ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he went each night to drink , I went there and watched , thinking that if he stayed late I could get my picture in the early morning . But the old fellow was far too wary for that and always departed to his fortress at dawn . By that time I was naturally keener than ever to photograph him , and accordingly I decided that the only thing to do was to try to intercept him on his return to his retreat , when the light would be a little stronger . I found the track by which he came , and on it a clearing a couple of yards across . Close to this I hid behind an ant-hill , waiting for him . In due course he came , and I got a few inches of film . But I made a slight sound , and instantly , without stopping to see the cause of it , he slipped through the thorn bushes and made off as fast as he could , home to his shelter . Now , that state of fear is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if he scents danger he will either bolt or charge ; but he will not show the extreme warinessof this old fellow , nor make for a thorn fortress to stay there till night returns . Nor is it normal for him to live alone , as this one did , the only rhino in many square miles of country . Twenty years ago , in eight square miles , I used to count as many as fifteen or twenty rhino in a day , and then I spent my time largely in climbing trees to get out of their way . To-day , in most districts , all is changed . The settler regards the rhino as a nuisance , because he is no respecter of private property , and also ? quite rightly ? as dangerous . The hunter shoots him for sport . Roads now cross his privatedomain in every direction . Even the natives see advantages in his extermination . And this extermination is fast occurring . For a time he may , to some extent , escape , because , unintelligent as he is popularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate had the sense to leave dangerous areas and to take refuge farther from the settler in districts where the bush is wilder and thicker . But Ip76foresee that in another twenty years , in Central Africa at any rate , the rhino will be hard to find . Once it was impossible to help meeting him ; now it is possible , as a friend of mine has recentlydone , to undertake a journey of thousands of miles through Central Africa without seeing a single rhino except the one old creature to whom I have just referred , who , I imagine , must resolutely have refused to desert the scenes of his youth , even when all his friends had departed . This may not be the place in which to apportionblame for the extermination of wild life , even when one knows of such incidents as that in which a hunter recently shot no less than one hundred and twelve rhino ; but I must at least record that the rhino is fast disappearing even in what is called the Great Game Reserve , where the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thirteen thousandsquare miles and is in the charge of only a few wardens , it is obvious that preservation is difficult . Nevertheless , difficult as it is , it mustP77be accomplished if wild life in Central Africa is to survive . In South Africa proof has been given that protection ? real protection ? is possible . And what can be done in South Africa can certainly be done also in Central Africa . The first step must be the keeping of the Game Reserve for the game on whose behalf it was created . I regret to say that this is not done at present . Indian trading stores are now to be found almost in the heart of the Reserve ? and it would be interesting to know who is responsiblefor allowing them to be there . Motor lorries carry goods from one of these stores to another ; and thus the Game Reserve threatens gradually to become a commercial trading ground instead of remaining an animal sanctuary . Because of these things ? the partial exterminationof the rhino and the driving of the survivors into exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes to study this animal has to follow him into undisturbed districts , in which the settler has not yet penetrated . There , at any rate , he will be found living very much as he lived twenty ( or forp78that matter , I suppose , two thousand ) years ago . There , the rhino lives in country that is comparativelyopen . He likes to eat short thorn bushes whose branches are soft ; and in passing I should mention that one of the effects of the killing and driving out of the rhino in certain areas is that the bush has grown high and thick because it is no longer eaten , and in growing it has become hard and very prickly ? so much so that the mouth of the old hermit rhino whom I found near the road which passes through the Reserve on the way to Tanganyikawas torn and swollen because , perforce , he had had to live on the higher-grown thorns . The rhino is extraordinarily regular in all his habits , and will do the same things day after day at very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he will mostly lie in the shade of a tree , though he may get up and enjoy a mud bath . But in the late afternoon , when the greatest heat has passed , he will begin to feed . Then , in particular , his regularity is seen , for he will browse always along the same path ,  |p79about  two feet wide , which he has worn for himself from his home to his particular watering-place , with probably a path branchingto one side to the spot where with equal regularity he leaves his dung : a habit in which he is peculiar . Sometimes his pool will be as much as six miles away , but he will never vary his choice or wander very far afield , and his daily route will be to and fro along his wellwornpathway . Once I fixed my camp near the foot of a hill two or three hundred feet high , on the top of which , in a clump of bush , a rhino had his retreat . Every afternoon he would leave the shade , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slide on his four feet ( like an elephant descending the bank of a river ) to the bottom . There he would start to feed , working round the base of the hill till he reached the side opposite to that by which he had descended , and then in a straight line to a water-hole threequartersof a mile away . When his thirst was quenched , he would return to the hill , but not , of course , to the slide , for although that was good for the descent itp80was useless for a climb . The upward journey was always made by a path which he had worn on the side nearest to the pool , the line of it having no doubt been chosen because after his feed and his drink he wanted to return as quickly as possible to safety . One day this rhino deviated slightly from his regular path and walked right into my camp . There was a narrow space between a grass hut which we had built and a tree , and the animal apparently thought that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he very soon discovered . His head passed through safely , but there was no room for his body to follow . Of course , the sensible thing would have been to withdraw and to go around either the hut or the tree , but that was not in the rhino 's mind . Instead , he tried to force his way through , got badly scared because he only wedged himself more firmly , and finally plunged and pushed until at last the hut collapsed . Then he bounded forward , and without a single backward glance raced away as if the Devil were behind him . He was very badly frightened by that time , P81and it is probable that he did not stop running for miles , for that is the way of the rhino . Once panic holds him he will run until he is far out of sight of whatever has scared him . Readers of my book , My Dog Simba , will remember how my fox-terrier routed two rhino and chased them until he was found by horsemenin an utterly exhausted state five miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a rhino 's track , or even very close to it . In my case it was only a hut that was demolished , but it might as easily have been myself . You can never be sure of the rhino 's temper . He is a short-sighted animal , and , like the elephant , apart from the warnings given him by tick birds , he relies for the detection of danger on hearing and scent . He can pick up scent at considerable distances ( I have known him aware of my presence at two hundred and fifty yards ) , but then he does not always know whether or not what confronts him is a source of danger . He therefore has to come closer to investigate and to confirm his suspicions ; and as his hearing reinforces the stronger scent hep82often seems to hesitate whether to charge or to run away . It seems probable that both actions are dictated by fear . I have known him come within a dozen yards , looking as if he were about to charge , and then suddenly turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also known cases when , though he might have been expected to bolt , a stronger scent made him quite certain of what was before him and he charged . There is , of course , a difference between fear of the known and fear of the unknown ; and it is possible that the first impels the rhino to charge while the second prompts him to run away . In any case , it is clear that the saving of his own skin is his first consideration . Sometimes , for instance , he will come up against the wind , pass comparatively close to a man , and then , of course , pick up that man 's scent ; but then he will not turn and charge for he is already headed for safety , and he will race for it as hard as he can go . That , however , is a statement which requires a certain qualification . It certainly does not apply to the rhino if he has been wounded :  |p83then  he is almost certain to charge , directly he discovers his enemy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the west , and at last complainedthat the country was lacking in the thrills she had expected . Two days later she encountereda rhino , and although she had no weapon with which she could have killed him , she fired with a small rifle and wounded him . Instantly he charged and killed her . Then he took shelter in a donga , which was crossed by a road . Down this road the next day came a local settler with his wife , in a motorcar . The rhino , tormented by the pain of his wound , charged the car directly he saw it . The settler very quickly got his wife out of the car and half-way up a tree ; but he himself was caught , and shared the fate of the lady who had thought that Africa lacked thrills . When a rhino charges he is indeed dangerous , and unless one is prepared to shoot there is only one way to safety : a tree . I probably know that fact from as many personal experiences as any man living , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to see that ap84stout tree is handy . In the past I have won this knowledge in experiences when only luck has saved me . The charging rhino puffs and blows like an antiquated steam engine , but he travels fast , and if he gets you he will almost certainly either trample you to death or rip your body with a blow from his horn . Once I was photographing at night , when the flash just behind the camera so much startled the rhino ( and , by the way , I have had exactly the same experience with a lion ) that he charged it immediately . Fortunately , I was up a small tree ; but the camera was on the ground ? and when I climbed down , the lens was all that I could find intact . During the war I persuaded the native who had many times acted as my personal boy ' to enlist , and in due course he found himself serving in the front line , where natives served among the white men because the sharpness of their eyes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , whilst advancing on outpost duty , the boy ' saw a rhino mother and her baby dangerously near both to himself andp85to the Englishman on his left . In the excitement of the moment the boy ' forgot his Englishand shouted the name of the beast in his own tongue : " Kfaru ! Kfaru ! " The Englishman , of course , failed to understand , and as the rhino was hidden from him by a bush he marched calmly on . Just as the boy ' rememberedthe word " rhino " the creature got their wind and charged . The boy , ' unfortunately for himself , stayed to shout a warning . The Englishman leapt aside , but the boy , ' in turning , stumbled , and as he lay flat on the ground the foot of the mother rhino caught him a glancing blow and smashed his shoulder . Certainly a lucky escape , for if he had been on his feet nothing could have saved his life . Once , whilst photographing in open country , I saw a couple of rhino browsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my party were out on horseback , and I could see them although they could not see the rhino . The horsemenwere too far away to catch my warning , and very soon the rhino picked up their wind and promptly charged . I had often seen thep86rhinoceros pursued by horsemen : now I was to see the positions reversed . The speed of a gallopinghorse is just about equal to that of a charging rhino , so that the chase was a long one , and for a time the horsemen maintained their lead without being able to increase it . But the rhino has not the horse 's staying power , and , as the country was flat and open , the horses began at last to draw ahead until , after threequartersof a mile , the two rhino simultaneouslydecided that the thing was n't good enough and branched off , one to the right and the other to the left . On another occasion in the open I myself had a very fortunate escape . From a little hill I had seen through my glasses a rhino lying asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as by good luck I was able to advance against the wind , I set out to stalk him . I got successfully within forty yards , when the tick birds gave the alarm . Up jumped the rhino at once , knowing that something was wrong but , because of the direction of the wind , not knowing what was the danger nor whence it came . I waited until the settling of the tick birds re/assured him , and then I crept still nearer and began to set up my camera , once more disturbingthe tick birds , so that the rhino again becametroubled and stood turning his head this way and that , with his nose in the air in an effort to pick up scent . Finally he decided on personal investigation , and as luck would have it he came directly towards me . There was n't a tree within reach , and the creature that could chase horsemen without losing ground for three-quarters of a mile would very soon overtakea man who tried to run . Therefore the only thing to do was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold and that uncertainty of my whereabouts would deter the rhino from charging . And meanwhile , just in case I came through the adventure alive , there was an excellentchance for a film , much too good to be wasted over an attack of " funk . " So I started turning the handle of the cinematograph camera , while the rhino came steadily on till he was within fifteen yards of me . By that time , though he still apparently could not smell me , he must have noticed something to add considerably to his puzzlement ? theP88very faint clicking of the camera . Probably that was something new in his experience , and he did n't know what to make of it . It might be an enemy that he could easily demolish ? or it might not . He stopped , hesitated , and then gallopedaway to the left . His behavior then was very odd , and for me not a little exciting . Fear sent him a little fartheraway from me , then curiosity brought him nearer , so that he completed a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more he came back ? another half-circle . And all the while he was gradually working round to my left in an effort to find out the cause of the buzzing that came from my compressed-air camera , and to get my wind . Finally he stopped , again only fifteen yards from me , hesitated once more , and at last ? very much to my relief ? decided in favor of discretion and bolted , makingfor shelter among bushes half a mile away . But these pictures of the rhino when he is disturbed do not tell the whole story . With them must be coupled others showing him at peace , for that is the way of his normal life , apart from disagreeable incidents which , noP89doubt , he regards as very upsetting to one who prefers a quiet and orderly routine . He does n't want either to hunt or to be hunted ; the daily promenade up and down his well-worn path is good enough for him , and these calls for violent exertion , besides disturbing his rest , make him excited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he immediatelygoes off to cool himself in a bath , either in water or in mud . I think of the two he prefersthe mud . And then , much refreshed , he lies in a little depression to be dried again by the sun . If he has bathed in mud he does not wash it off , but lets it dry on his skin while he sleeps , so that ? particularly in that part of the country where the earth is reddish ? he eventually looks exactly like the remains of a broken-down anthill . Once I examined a stretch of open bush through my glasses , decided that there was nothing on it in the way of dangerous game , and accordingly started to walk across it , accompanied by two native boys . ' A reddish , broken ant-hill lay right in front of me , and in another moment I should have stepped on top90it ? when suddenly it stood up ! Rhino ! There was no lack of wind then , and no uncertainty in the creature 's mind . He charged instantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boys ' who deliberately led the beast aside and then succeeded in climbing a tree just in the nick of time to save himself . The family habits of the rhino are interesting . The youngster always stays with its mother until it is nearly fully grown ; but the father , although he may come back at night , is inclined to keep out of the nursery while the rampageousinfant is around ; and it is not till the youngster is grown that ordinary family life is resumed ! And although the rhino is alert and suspiciousby day he relaxes by night ? so much so , indeed , that at water-holes I have found him to be positively frisky . You would not think that this word could possibly be applied to a big and cumbersome and at times very terrifying animallike the rhinoceros ; but often I have seen two or three rhino at play near a water-hole , chasing each other round and round , and puffing and squealing all the time . It was quiteP91obvious that dangers ? men , rifles , clicking cameras and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful rhino had set out to enjoy themselves in the short hours of the night before wariness and suspicion again became necessary.  |p95THE  hippo is such an easy-going , lumberingcreature , that you can only regard him with good-tempered amusement . Even when you see his huge teeth you can not conceiveof him as being dangerous , and you feel that the baring of those teeth can not possibly be anything more exciting than the beginning of a lazy yawn . The more you watch him , the more you are convinced of his utter harmlessness . He has alwaysthat air of contentment which we see in people who are excessively stout ; and one can picture him among his own family as being sleepily humorous . On an island of rock in the middle of a Central African river or lake , you can see him basking in the sun at peace with all the world ; or you may see a school of twenty or thirty , tussling , swimming , and plunging in turn from the island into the water , all withp96the air of finding life a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuous ; or you may see the fat mother hippo with her fat round baby , as she encourages it to climb on to her back and lie there while she floats . Seeing these things , as I have so often done , I find it impossible to feel anything but affection for the hippo . Many a time he has stretched my patience to its limits because in certain circumstanceshe is not easy to photograph , and it is sometimes necessary to wait and watch for a week before getting a result . But patience is the animal photographer 's chief attribute , and waiting is never tiresome when it provides an opportunity for the most interesting of all studies ? that of animal life . The difficulty of photographing the hippo is due to his power of scent . In my earliest days in Africa , because I saw his curious habit of apparentlypeering into the distance , I spent a great deal of time in building a hide and makingit conform to the vegetation of the river bank . But I soon realized that this was entirely unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that was nearest to hand , orp97even in some cases wait in the open , without any notice being taken of me , provided that I was out of the wind . On the other hand , if the photographer arrivesat the bank of a river which he can not cross and finds the wind blowing steadily from him to the hippo , there is nothing for him to do but to retire for a distance , sit down and light his pipe , and wait in the hope that the wind will change . The hippo , placid as he is , shares with the elephant a dislike of being disturbed . It is most unlikely that he would attack unless the very waters of his home were disturbed and he saw danger threatening his cows and his young ( indeed , I have never heard of a single instance of a hippo attacking a hunter ) , but he would at once go to ground ? or , to be more accurate to water . Directly he detected any unusual scent in his neighborhood , he would dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and his family would be their heads as from time to time they popped up to peer towards the shore , blowing occasionally just like whales , before diving again.  |p98Because  of this , the hippo-photographer usually feels that he would do far better from a boat . But that is not always the case , for though a boat can easily be paddled out of the wind it can also be taken close to islands ; and when the photographer 's enthusiasm brings him too near , the hippo 's good-nature is badly strained . On one of my first visits to Central Africa I was walking one day along the edge of a papyrusbed when I noticed the track of hippo , leading to a sort of tunnel through the thicklygrowingvegetation . Going down this for thirty yards , I came suddenly on a small lake in which , to my delight , I saw at least a dozen hippo . I could have taken my photographs then and there at seventy yards ' range , but I knew of a boat on another lake not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to be missed . Accordingly I went back to camp , and the next day eight porters carried a small , flat-bottomed boat to the edge of the pool . With one native boy to paddle , I set out in this , paddling close to a little floating island ofp99papyrus ' in order to choose the best angle from which to get my picture of the creatures that were peacefully basking against its edge . I brought the boat closer and closer , without realizing the significance of the fact that one old bull was paying me a great deal of attention . He had been lying half in and half out of the water , with his little pig-like eyes almost on its level ; and I have no doubt that to him we must have looked truly alarming , for he would have seen us chiefly as a great dark mass looming above him and appearing more and more threatening as we drew nearer and nearer . I doubt if he recognized us for a white man , a native and a boat : it is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been an invading hippo or might not , but was certainly too large and was coming too close for the safety of his family . In any case , he slid into the water , and came for us : and as he drew near he dived . On the comparatively rare occasions when aP100hippo pays serious attention to a boat or a canoe , he has two methods of attack : he will either try to crush it in his huge jaws , literally almost bitingoff the prow , or he will dive so that he comes to the surface beneath it and overturns it . Either method , provided that the hippo is able to reach the boat , is almost certain to be successful . In this case it was clear that unless our boat was turned very smartly indeed and paddled at top speed for the shore , the hippo would reach us and the native and I would go into the water . And although we were both strong swimmers , the pool was thick with reeds in which swimming would have been impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten and I grasped the second paddle . The boat shot round , and away we went for the shore , the hippo following . Once I thought to gain on him by steering so that the half-submerged end of an island came between us and him ; but he cleared it at a leap , rising out of the water and jumping over a full yard of moss and weeds . And repeatedly he dived , leaving us in doubt , as we lookedp101round , as to how near he would be when he came to the surface , or whether he would even rise beneath us . Certainly it was a near thing , for we had started fifty yards from the shore ; and indeed I think it was only the shallowing of the water in the last twenty yards that saved us . There he could no longer dive , and swimming became more and more difficult , although our flatbottomedboat could travel as fast as ever ; and at last we sprang ashore , while the hippo turned slowly , grunted , and swam back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that sort , one invariably speculates about what would have happened in the other event . Well , it would n't have been pleasant , but I do not think the actual unpleasantness would have come from the hippo . He would almost certainly have regarded his attack as finished when he had upset or smashed the boat . He could easily have killed us in the water with his teeth , but I do not think he would have bothered about it ? perhaps because it was the boat rather than its occupants that had terrified him . No.  |p102The  unpleasantness would have come from the crocodiles . I do not know what exactly are the relations between the hippo and these neighbors of his . On a small rock in the middle of a river you will often see half a dozen hippo , two or three water turtles , and a couple of crocodiles ; and there will be no sign that the hippo have even the slightest fear . Yet the crocodile ( as I shall relate elsewhere ) certainly can kill a rhino , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead hippo , so that one would have thought that live hippo are not always safe when Mr. Crocodile feels hungry . And CertainlyI have often been struck with the scarcityof hippo babies . But it is a point on which it is very difficult to be certain . The hippo 's chief enemy , alas ! is man . He is killed by the natives partly because he invades gardens and damages crops , and partly because they regard hippo meat ? and particularly hippo foot ? as a great delicacy . He is also killed by the white hunter ? though for that I find it hard to give a reason , since the value of his skin ( used for walking-sticks , etc. ) and ofp103his teeth ( once the foundation of many sets of artificial teeth ) is not great ; and he supplies no other commercial products . Yet , although it must be poor fun indeed to shoot so harmless an animal , it is not infrequentlydone . A few years ago , for instance , a sportsman came to a beautiful pool which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot the hippo dived , but a minute later one of them , with the curiosity which the animal invariably displays , popped his head out of the water ? and received a bullet for his pains . He dived ( or sank ) , and a minute later a head again appeared , to receive another shot . It is probable that the hunter imagined that he was but pouringlead into one tenacious hippo ; but he did not know that the body of a dead hippo , if not recently fed , will stay under water for two or three hours , and he apparently did not realize that all the hippo in that pool were filled with the same curiosity and were all showing it in hippo fashion by popping up continually to see what was happening . And the result ? the tragic result ? of this effort at marksmanship was that a few hours afterwards the dead bodiesp104of no less than twelve hippo floated down the stream . Some no doubt escaped ; but the pool was then deserted , and although the incident occurredyears ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant and other creatures , news spreads and memories are long . It is doubtless for the sake of protection that wherever possible the hippo prefers to rest on an island rather than on the shore , except in the more secluded places . Where he inhabits a pool or river that is free from rocks or islands , he is compelled to rest on the banks , but it is obvious that he finds this much less satisfactory than even the most knobbly rock where his enemies are less likely to reach him . The hippo , as the adventure I have related above implies , is for his great size remarkably rapid in the water . He is amphibious , but the water is always his home , and not only can he swim strongly on the surface but he appears also to be able to travel under water . Once I surprised one on a low bank of a narrow river where he appeared to be asleep . Instantly he half rolled and half dived off thep105bank , very much alarmed and very anxious to put as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the cover of the water . He went straight to the bottom , and as the water was fairly clear I , from the top of the bank , could see him , not swimming , but actuallyrunning along the bed of the river , leaving a trail of mud behind him ; and so fast did he go that , although I followed him as fast as the bushes along the bank would let me , he went out of my sight in seventy-five yards . He is also surprisingly strong . One day I found a young hippo asleep on the banks of the Tana River . Thinking that I could study him in temporary captivity in my camp , I tried to secure him , just as , in the far-off days when I was a farmer in Yorkshire , I used to handle a pig . Holding a pig , if you know how to do it , is n't very difficult , but holding even a young hippopotamus is quite a different matter . I am a fairly powerful man , but I was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by letting go at the critical moment that I saved myself from being dragged over a ten-foot drop downp106into the river ? where the crocodiles would have finished me . Although the hippo spends most of his time in the water , he takes no interest in fish and is entirely a vegetarian . Even the damp weeds and reeds and moss around his home do not interesthim , and consequently he has always to come ashore to feed , where ? walking along and browsing as he goes ? he looks clumsier than ever . Although now , as I have said , the water is his home and he only uses the shore sometimes for sleep and always for food , I think that at one period he probably lived on land for ' the greater part of the day and only took refuge in the water at night . The evidence for this is that even to-day it is only in districts that have been settled and where he has been disturbed that he confines his visits ashore to the night : in the remote districts where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is often to be found on land in the daytime for long periods . In the same way , it is only in the secluded places that he will dare to give tongue by day , making noises which are indescrib/able ? a medley of sound which starts with a roar that could be mistaken for that of the lion . When the dry season comes and the smaller pools and rivers begin to dry up , the hippo migratesto larger stretches of water , traveling for the most part at night but often compulsorily for great distances . At one much inhabited river many miles from other water , hippo , crocodiles and fish will all move as the water gets scarce , first to deeper water farther down stream and finally to a swamp into which the water passes . There they will remain till the dry season ends , apparently under the impression that the swamp is bound to provide them with water . But in the hottest days they find their mistake : the fish die and crocodiles and hippo are almost in extremities . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one particular piece of water , going from it perhaps in the dry season , but always returning to it when the rains come . He is not by nature an adventurer , and exploration for exploration 's sake would not be likely to appeal  |p108And  yet there are exceptions . I have occasionallyfound tracks of the hippo far from any water and quite out of the line , between one pool and the next , which would be used between the seasons . Such signs are unaccountable , unlessthere is here and there a more daring member of the race who treks from one haunt to another . After all , the student of nature is constantly finding surprises . He may be quite convinced that a certain animal will do this and will never do that ; and then he will find unquestionable evidence that in one instance at least what he imagined would never happen has occurred . Once , for example ? and once only ? have I found a hippo who apparently did not regard water as his favorite element . Trekking inland , I saw what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or possibly some gigantic piece of bone . But it was neither : it was the wet back of a hippo lying in a swamp or morass ! Only half a mile away flowed a river , but this hippo ? this eccentricamong hippopotami ? preferred a mud bath to one in water . To satisfy his taste he forsook the society of his fellows and ran thep109risk of staying on shore in the daylight ; and although he rose lazily at my approach and waddled river-wards , he seemed to be demanding , disgruntledly , why , because he had been born a hippo , need he do exactly the same things as every other hippo ; and why could he not have his sleep in peace ? No doubt an unanswerable question ? though that there could be cause for asking it , or even appearing to think it , seems more surprisingthan ever when one goes again , as I did last autumn , to a broad river , and sees the normalhippo , entirely happy in the water , yawninglazily , but absolutely content . There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hippo I have ever seen . It is fortunatelylittle known , and I certainly shall not discloseits position lest the man with the rifle shall think there are hippo there to spare for him . It is there that I have done much of my study of the animal ; and I , at any rate , could spend weeks beside that water , watching , till I too decided that there was nothing better in life than to float and swim and dive , and peer now and then at things that did n't matter , and yawnp110and blow water-bubbles , and sink lazily below the surface , and then float again in the warmth of the sun.  |p113WHILE  such animals as the lion , the leopard , the elephant and the rhinocerosmake an instant appeal to the stay-athomeimagination as creatures whom it would be unsafe to meet in the open , there is no such popular feeling , I believe , with regard to the buffalo : at any rate cinematograph pictures of them invariably meet with a chilling reception , the truth being , I suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you asked a number of men who knew the African wilds to name the most dangerousanimals of the country , it is certain that the buffalo would appear on every list . Just as I consider that the elephant has lost his natural mildness of temperament through being persecuted by man , so do I think that the buffalo by nature is not so much fierce as inquisitive . He is inclined to inspect at closep114quarters anything which seems strange to him ; but when he is shot at , his curiosity frequently gives place to a wild anger , so that he seeks revenge . When a buffalo has been wounded he may do any one of a number of things . He may attack at once . Or he may gallop away into the bush ? and then the inexperienced hunter followshim up . Suddenly the hunter may be startled to hear a bellow a few yards behind him , the buffalo having made a circle , picked up his scent and literally stalked him . The hunter , in such a case as that , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily into a tree , thanking his stars that there was one available . But later , if the buffalo is thoroughly roused by pain , the hunter will become less sure of his advantage , for the buffalo will roam at the foot of the tree for hours . The man will becometortured by thirst and exhaustion : or perhapswhen night falls he will imagine that he can climb down and steal away . But no ! When he reaches ground he finds the angry beast still waiting ? and he is lucky indeed , then , if he can escape again.  |p115That  , of course , conjures up a horrible picture . But it is a true one . I have myself been chased by buffalo and only the speed of my horse saved my life : on foot I should not have had the slightest chance . During the war a herd took alarm at a company of my battalion marching through bush , charged , and injured several men very seriously . Last year I worked my way in daylight quite close to a herd on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small bushes . For a time all went well ; then one old bull put back his horns so that his nose pointed directly towards me , and began to advance . At that moment I was focusingmy camera . When I looked up again he was still advancing , straight at me , and very much nearer . I did n't wait to take his portrait ! Certainly , the buffalo is far from being one of the safest animals for the unarmed man to photograph . Now that I have escaped from that adventure , I often wish that I had taken the risk of staying a minute or two longer so as to expose a few score feet of film on a charging buffalo . But then I console myself with the reflectionthat though I might have secured thep116picture , it is very improbable that I should have lived to develop it ! Once I came to a papyrus swamp , quite close to civilization , where a herd of buffalo had lived for years . Being very anxious to photographthem , I built a platform on four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there ? fortified only with dried food , biscuits and cold tea ? I kept watch for three days and nights . But I did not get a photograph . All day the buffalo lingered among the tall papyrus , the fluttering ibis disclosing to me their hidden position : at night they came out into the open to feed , often within a few yards of my camera ? butalways they returned to shelter before the light came . At other times I was more fortunate in gettingmy pictures , but nevertheless I have certainly had many disappointments with regard to this animal . I once lost , by sheer bad luck , what should have been an ideal opportunity . I was camped close to land where I knew a big herd frequently grazed and had planned to stalk them the next morning . Meanwhile a young friend of mine who was entirely new top117the country went out alone . He knew that a settler had taken land only a couple of miles away , and when he saw what he took to be a number of this settler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance of just a hundred yards and admiring the particularly fine breed ! Suddenly a native came on the scene , saw the buffalo and the man inspecting each other , and quickly put my friend wise to the real state of things , shouting to him to take refuge on a big clump of rocks . There , realizingat last his narrow escape , the novice was afraid to come down ; so he fired a shot and sent the buffalo bolting for safety . Of course , they were nowhere to be seen next morning , and that chance had gone . This was some years ago , before that area was so much overrun by civilization as it is now . To-day , no buffalo would be seen there by daylight , for , like many others , this creature will no longer feed by day except in secluded areas where he has not been molested . Where buffalo have been much disturbed , they make a retreat on a hill-top or take refuge in dense forests . But those are not their naturalP118haunts , for above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . They are perfectly at home in swamps and can live contentedly in morasses of water and mud three feet deep . They are strong swimmers : indeed , though it may seem scarcely credible , it is a fact that seven or eight of them once appeared on an island on Lake Victoria , having actually swum four miles from the mainland . It is no unusual thing for these animals , like the elephant and the rhinoceros , to trek for considerable distances at certain seasons . Needingwater as they do , they are compelled , to move in the dry season ; but except in the most secluded areas they only travel at night . It is a sad thing , but they know that man is their enemy . The lion is also an enemy , but except when a calf is stolen unnoticed from a herd , the buffalo can often defend themselves effectively . Diseaseis another enemy , and a serious one , for these animals suffer from the severe scourge of rinderpest ? so much so , indeed , that whole herds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known of men being able toP119walk up to them without the slightest opposition , only to find that the animals were too ill to resent the intrusion . P123I DO not like the crocodile . Glad as I should be to feel that there is in him , as there must surely be in all creatures , something that is pleasant if not actually charming , the fact remains that the only feeling aroused in me by the crocodile is one of loathing . This has nothing to do with the fact that , as I shall shortly relate , only six months ago a crocodile snapped his jaws within six inches of my leg . It has not even very much to do with my knowledge that crocodiles devour young native girls who come to a river for water . It is simply that the very sight of him makes me-shudder . Probably the feeling dates from a day , several years ago , when I saw a giant among crocodiles ? themost fearsome and repulsive monster it has ever been my misfortune to meet . The ordinary crocodile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch less than twenty-seven feet . I was waiting with my camera near a sandbankon the Semeliki River . Several crocodiles of normal size waddled out of the river with the painful-looking and apparently exhausting gait which the creatures always use on land , and threw themselves down on the sand among some crane and plover . There they lay , opening their huge jaws so that I could see their teeth and look down their horrifying throats . Suddenly the water of the river stirred , a scaly snout appeared , and then yard upon yard of body followed as the giant crocodile raised himself slowly on his legs till his body was two feet from the ground . He waddled about two yards away from the water and then flopped down on the sandbank , lying there , an abhorrentcreature of evil , until after some minutes he slowly turned , waddled once more to the river , and sank out of sight . In spite of my knowledge of his strength , in spite of a glimpse of his teeth , in spite even of the probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other ornaments oncep125worn by men and women , it was not terror or even horror that filled me , so much as disgust . There was something of evil uncanniness in the way the great brute rose silently out of the water and then in equal silence returned to it . Ungainly as he is on shore , the crocodile is surprisingly fast when swimming . And his strength is enormous . A few years ago three observerssaw a rhino come down to a river to drink . No sooner had he put his mouth to the water than he was seized by a crocodile which began slowly but surely to drag him into the river . Imagine that struggle ! The weight of a rhino is close upon two tons , and he is amongst the most powerful of wild creatures : yet even with the frantic strength born of terror he was no match for the crocodile , and in a very few minutes he was pulled under water . The crocodile 's strength , however , is less surprising when one discovers his great weight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin of one of the creatures for a museum . At my companion 's shot , the crocodile , which was lying on a rock thirty feet from the bank , gave a little jerk andp126then lay still . Undoubtedly the beast was dead , but he might not have been alone , so the native porters got my friend to fire several shots into the water before they would venture across to slip a rope round the body . Then very nervously they waded into the river ; but just as they reached the rock , one of them cried that the dead crocodile had moved , and there was a panic-stricken rush to safety . Finally they went again and put round the ropes , and we all began to haul . Then I discovered the peculiar smell given off by crocodile , and was amazed , first at the creature 's heaviness , and afterwards at the weight of his skin alone . And there was anotherdiscovery then , too ? or at least a partial one ? for when we returned next day we found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , though there was no sign to tell us what had done the scavenging . Probably many beasts had fed off it , and it would not be surprising if the lion had had his share . The crocodile 's weapons are the teeth of his two jaws , which close upon each other almost with the precision of a rat-trap , and his enor/mously powerful tail . Often he will lie apparentlyasleep upon a bank until some unsuspecting creature comes near . Then , instantly , the tail will be lifted and swung round to knock the victim at one blow into the river , where as it struggles the crocodile will seize it and drag it under water . Or if the first attack is made too far from the bank ( and I have seen crocodiles thirty yards from water ) for the victim to fall into the river , it will be struck down , very likely with broken limbs , and then seized and dragged into the water . Neither animal nor man when caught by the crocodile has the slightest chance of escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man may foolishlybe cooling his fingers over the side of a boat , a dog may be swimming , or an animal may be drinking ? then a scream , a yelp , or a cry ? a splash ? a swift swirl of water ? and finally silence while the crocodile drags his victimto the bottom or under some bank , there to eat him at leisure . No sensible traveler would cross a river of any size in Central Africa except by boat or canoe , for the crocodile inhabits most of thesep128rivers , often in great numbers ; and it is frequentlyimpossible to tell whether he is present at a particular spot or not . The fact that he cannotbe seen is no proof of his absence , for he can remain under water for long periods . A friend of mine with two companions once found a deep and beautiful pool at the foot of a fall where in the wet season a river pours over rocks fifty feet high . Very rashly the three men decided that such a place called for a Sunday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten feet high for some fancy diving . After a while they decided that the dog of one of them ought to be sharing in the fun , and pushed it into the water . It swam two yards ? then gave a sudden yelp and disappeared . Nothing but a crocodile could have been the cause of that disappearance , for no body floated later to the surface . Apart from their habit of keeping under water , crocodiles are not very easily distinguished . Lying mostly in the water with just a few inches of head showing , they look exactly like floating logs , and many an animal ? and even many a man ? has been deceived with fatalp129results . And although the crocodile may look almost yellow immediately on emerging from the water , as he dries in the heat of the sun his color changes to a gray that is almost exactly the shade of the mud or rocks on which he lies . It is curious that crocodiles do not seem to like a cool breeze when out of the water , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock , when the wind has died down and the sun beats on the unshadedland . It is said that when on shore they lie with their jaws open as an invitation to the birds to pick insects from their mouths . I can not be sure of this : scores of times I have seen crocodiles with birds around them , but though they repeatedlycame near the crocodiles ' mouths I did not witness the operation . The crocodile has good eyesight and exceptionalpowers of hearing . Also he can feel vibrations under water for extraordinary distances : quite recently I tested this by having a board smacked flat on the water ? and a crocodilebelow the surface over a mile away gavep130signs immediately that he had been disturbed by the vibration . All creatures , both on land and in water , are the crocodile 's prey . As I have said in an earlier chapter , although he is seen sleeping at peace on the same rock as a family of hippos , he appears to include hippo babies in his diet . He has enemies , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the monitor , an amphibious creature with somewhat the appearance of a monster lizard , which digs up and eats the crocodile 's eggs , give him the most trouble . It has been suggested that it is only in old age that he takes to eating man with any regularity ; but when any full-grown crocodile is cut open it is no unusual thing to find within him a collection of native ornaments which is certainly not the result of the killing and eating of a single person . At any rate , no man should rely upon stories that crocodiles , or a particular crocodile , will not eat men . Nor should he run risks with any crocodile . I have learnt that for myself in an adventurewhich very , very nearly taught me finally the danger of rashness . Last summer I wasp131taking cinematograph pictures of one of these creatures , when I went to a position which was only safe providing that the crocodile either did not turn or gave me warning of his intention to turn . There for one moment I half turned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my eye while I signed to one of my boys . Suddenly I saw a movement , and as I instantly sprang back I heard a crack behind me , and , turning round , I saw the crocodile with his mouth , just closed , six inches from my leg . But for my noticing the preliminary turning the teeth would have closed on my flesh , and I should very quickly have been dragged into the water and drowned ? to be subsequently eaten . Thinking these things as I moved hurriedly backward , I looked at the horrible , scaly , unpleasantbody of the crocodile ? and once again I shuddered . No . There is no charm for me about the crocodile . I have no virtues in him to report . I can not even describe scenes of domestic felicity in his private life : for when Mrs. Crocodile lays her eggs she only buries them in the sand to be incubated by the sun.  |p135THE  giraffe , to those who do not know him , is rather a subject for merriment . We recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noah 's Ark with the giraffe 's head protruding through a skylight ; and his shape , " all legs and neck , " and totally unlike that of any other living creature , makes us sympathize with the child at the Zoo who pointed and said : " Mummie , is that real ? " But when we know him better , when we see him at close quarters in his own home , in spite of the ungainliness of his gait and the acrobatic contortions which he has to perform in order to drink , we discover that he is graceful , that his skin is like a beautiful and patterned velvet , and that the adjective which best fits him is " stately . " It is a curious fact that when you see a giraffe from afar you think that while he has a veryp136long neck and very long , thin legs , he has hardly any body ; and yet when you come to within ten yards of him you are surprised to find how large his body really is and that he no longer seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered the body of a dead giraffe , and then more than ever I was struck with the size of the body . It is not very easy to account for this optical effect , but I imagine that because of its chestnut coloringwith dark lines , the body appears to increase in size in proportion to its nearness to a background : from a long distance you will see the giraffe against distant landscape , and the chestnutmerges into the background while the lines are too , thin to indicate an outline ; when you see the animal contrasted with the grass only a few yards behind it , it appears much bigger , because the difference between the chestnut and the brownish-green is apparent and the lines are clear ; and when you see a dead giraffe on the ground the closeness of the background gives still more emphasis to the coloring . But apart from that effect , I do not think that the imitative qualities of the giraffe 's skinp137are very great , except when he is amongst thorn trees ? and then he can be almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you can hardly distinguish the chestnut , and he seems to stand out almost in relief ; but against a tree you can not possibly tell which are his markings and which are the branches . If he is standing behind a thorn tree , with his head and neck projecting over it , you will very likely be quite unaware of his presence . Often I have set out to stalk , as I thought , a single giraffe standing near a tree , and then as I drew closer three or four others have appeared , apparently out of nowhere , although all the time they must have been standing against the background of the tree and well within my sight . There are four ways by which you can approachgiraffe . You can come boldly on foot over the open country , and , provided you approachat an angle , so that it appears that you will pass them , the giraffe will allow you to come as close as a hundred and fifty yards withoutundue alarm , but then will suddenly boltp138for thirty yards , turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can try to pursue them on horseback , and if your horse is good and the country quite open you may just be able to overtake them ; but that is of little use to the photographer , for they will be hundreds of yards away again by the time he has dismounted . You can stalk them , noting their position and then making a wide detour through cover and finally crawling closer and closer , and by this means , if you are a skillful stalker , you may be able to come within thirty yards ; but directly you show yourself the giraffe will loup away , with their long tails twisted up over their bodies , presumably to prevent a pursuer from having anything to grasp . And , lastly , you may approach them in a motor-car , and that is by far the most successful method , because , strange as it may sound , the giraffe ? and for that matter the lion and other animals also ? do not fear a man in a car as they fear a man on horseback or on foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Africa . Animals that can hardly even be stalked on foot can quite easily be approached inp139a car driven quite openly towards them ! One is compelled to assume that they appreciate an approach only in motions of the legs , and that they hardly realize that a box-like object which grows bigger and bigger is therefore coming nearer . In any case , it is unquestionable that the giraffe who bolts at the sight of a walkingman a hundred and fifty yards away will remain perfectly calm while a car is slowly driven within twenty-five yards of him . And as long as the observer in his car refrains from undue movement he can remain and watch without scaring the animals into flight . Similarly , if a giraffe is standing near a track along which a car passes , he will make no attempt to run away but will stand perfectly still , staring , presumably in amazement ; and if the car goes on its way without stopping he will let it pass him and go right out of sight before he moves . Once I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain and at last stopped to feed off a clump of thorn trees . My pursuit was perfectly obvious , but the giraffe merely moved while they wanted to move and haltedp140when they wanted to feed ; and they showed no alarm even when I stopped the car within thirty yards of them . They fed quietly , and after a while moved on again . While watching , I had counted them , and now I realized that they were one short of their full number . By the tree at which they had been feeding , therefore , one must have remained ; but try as I would I could not see him . If he had moved I should , of course , have discovered him at once , but for five minutes he kept absolutely still , standing just behind the tree and watching me over the top of it . Then at last I saw what I looked for : a movement ? not it is true of the giraffe , but of tick birds which were running round his ears , under his lips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I should have thought would have produced an almost intolerabletickling ! Now , except for his curious trustfulness in the matter of the motor-car , the giraffe is a particularly wary animal , and , as I had been leaning this way and that from my seat in the car in an effort to discover him , he must have been aware of my presence . And yet he hadP141stayed perfectly still , watching me , without making any attempt to bolt . It was n't what one might have expected ; but I think the reason was that he had perfect faith in his invisibility ? and indeed trusted to that far more than to his speed . If he had realized that the tick birds had given him away he would have changed his tactics and bolted , but as he continued to keep perfectly still ? even in spite of the tickling ? he must have thought himself hidden . The giraffe is not very well furnished in the matter of defensive weapons ? or at any rate he knows that he can only afford to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornered , or when the presence of youngsters prevents his running away , will he resort to violence . A friend of mine once watched a mother giraffe defending her baby from a lioness . She had put the youngsterinto the only position of safety ? immediatelybeneath her body ; and she turned to face the lioness , which circled round her in search of an opportunity to spring from behind and out of reach of the giraffe 's forefoot ? for it is the forefoot rather than the hindfoot whichp142is the giraffe 's weapon , and its kick is deadly , even to a lion . Whether the hunting skill of the lioness would have prevailed or whether the giraffe would have been able to profit by an incautiousmoment to get in her kick , I do not know , for the arrival of my friend on the scene quickly sent the lioness to the right-about . The famous hunter , F. C. Selous , told me of a similar incident ; but in that case the end was tragic , for the mother , in her frantic excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broke the little creature 's back . The mother giraffe is always very anxious for her young ones , and it is pretty to see the care with which she guards them . Recently , while I was watching a herd , the calves strayed away for some distance ; but suddenly a mother looked round from her feeding and quickly made her way to them , collecting them into a bunch and driving them before her back to the herd . But on one occasion in my experience , when a herd took sudden alarm and bolted from a party of observers who had come up in a car , a youngster fled away from the rest , turned **26;516;TOOLONG towards the car ? and would not leave it ! The herd instinct must be very strong , for a single giraffe is much more wary than the members of a herd , while one that ? as has sometimeshappened ? is pursued on horseback and captured may die , not from exhaustion , but from sheer fright . One of the peculiarities of the giraffe is that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terror ; and yet the animals in a herd seem to have some method of conveying ideas to one another , for they will all move in one direction at the same moment . They do not exactly follow a leader as sheep do , but move like a battalion of soldiers turning at a word of command . I have seen herds of as many as thirty aniinals , and I have been struck by the fact that they vary somewhat both in color and in the design of their lines . Once , in a herd of normal coloring , I noticed one , in perfect condition , who was nearly black , and I have seen others that were almost gray . They vary , too , in temperament , some herds being very trusting andp144others really wild . They are found mostly in open country , but also in the hill districts ; and herds that live in the open will sometimes wanderinto the hills ? presumably in search of water , which they generally find at the foot of a hill . A man once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank at all . Of course , that is not the case , but it is true , nevertheless , that they often go without water for considerable periods . I once watched a herd for three days , and certainly , unless they found water at night , which is not their normal drinking time , they did not drink during that period . In the dry season water may be scarce , so that it might take them two days to reach it , and it is clear that abstinencefor so long would not trouble them unduly . On the other hand , when a giraffe does drink he does it thoroughly . It is not an easy matter for him . His anatomy is adapted , not for eating grass off the ground , but for eating the topmostleaves of thorn trees , and to get his head down to water requires a real effort . He has first to spread his front legs far apart , because his legs are longer than his neck , and at the samep145time to bend his knees . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , making sure first that he is in exactly the right place for bringing his mouth to the water . Then he drinks , very daintily but thoroughly , and afterwards proceeds to straighten himself out very much like a contortionist at the end of a complicated performance . And very likely , as soon as he is in an upright position , he will decide that his thirst is not quite slaked , and down he will go again , straddling his legs and bending his knees as before . Once while I was watching at a water-hole I saw a herd of thirteen giraffe approaching from a ridge . The wind was in my favor , and yet so wary were the animals that they took over an hour to cover a hundred and fifty yards from the ridge to the pool . But at last they came , and I was rewarded for my patience by the wonderful sight of zebra and oryx and the thirteen giraffe all drinking together at the same water-hole within fifteen yards of me . The giraffe is a peaceful and harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lion , but living otherwise on good terms with hisp146neighbors . In some districts he is killed by the poisoned arrows of natives , and sometimes he is shot by sportsmen . But in spite of this there is good evidence , I am glad to say , that his numbers in Central Africa are increasing , so that , whatever may be the unfortunate fate of such animals as the rhino , the giraffe at any rate is likely to be left to adorn the African bush.  |p149LYING  as he does in the thickest of tropicalforests and on far-distant mountains , the Gorilla is not easily studied by the naturalist , and comparatively little is known of his habits . Many a dead gorilla has been examined and measured ( and subsequently stuffed ) , and it is known that he stands nearly six feet high , has a chest measurement of over sixty inches and a span from outstretched hand to hand of over seven and a half feet . Much , too , is known of his conduct when attacked . But his life when he is undisturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has not nearly so often been observed . For my own part , in all the years I have spent in Africa , though I have covered hundreds of miles in search of him , I have never yet had the luck to be able to photographp150him or to study him thoroughly at close quarters . On the other hand , he has acquired , probablyon account of his huge size , his strength , his ferocious expression and his rage when attacked , an entirely unjustified reputation for fierceness which has led to his being sought by adventure-loving hunters . For some time his extermination made rapid progress , and even seven years ago it was estimated that only about eighty gorillas were left in the mountainous district which is his special haunt in Central Africa . Now he is protected , and it is a crime to shoot him without a special permit . Permits , however , are granted to scientific expeditions sent out by museums ? not for indiscriminate shooting , but for the shooting of a stated number ? andapart from that the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the process of extermination is now much slower than was the case a few years ago , it nevertheless continues . It is the fact that the gorilla is a very harmlessand peaceable animal . Admittedly , he does n't look it . An early explorer described him as " a being of that hideous order , half beast ,  |p151half  man , which we find pictured by old artists in representations of the infernal regions . " But , nevertheless , there is not a single recorded instanceof a gorilla attacking a man when attack has not been provoked . Though he is strong enough to strangle a lion , he lives on parsley and the wild carrot . All the stories of a beast that beats his breast and roars are of a harmless creatureonly roused to fury in defense of his home . The only natural use for the gorilla 's strength is the breaking down of branches with which to build a nest where his mate may rear her young . The Chimpanzee , in his wild state , is almost as difficult to photograph as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . The big forests are his home , and there he builds his nest in a treetopfar out of the reach of danger . Now and then a party will come down to raid the native plantations , but for the most part the observer will hear chimpanzees but will not be able to see them . To attempt to pursue them by tree climbing would be hopeless , for no man has thep152agility of a chimpanzee , and the creatures would have swung from bough to bough , passingfrom one tree to another , long before the camera could be brought into action . Once I thought that after long searching my chance for a picture had come , for I discovered a family of chimpanzees in the lower branches of a big forest tree . But , alas ! there was not an atom of sunlight , for the chimpanzee can not stand the heat of the sun in Africa ; and although I waited without the slightest movementthey did not come into a better light . If you stand in the shady forest in the early morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head . But just before noon all will grow quiet , for that is the hour when in the greatest heat of the day the chimpanzee , like all forest dwellers , takes his rest , either in a nest or on a sheltered branch . It is in the cool of the evening that he will bestirhimself , swinging from branch to branch , playing games with his brothers , and seeking the wild fruits of the trees . Stanley relates that Emin Pasha told him he once heard strange sounds from the tree-tops ,  |p153and  on investigation found that they came from chimpanzees who had stolen a drum from a native village and were trying to do what they had seen the natives do . I can well believe that , for nothing pleases the chimpanzee more than something with which he can make a noise . I have often seen ? and heard ? one of my chimpanzeesin England improvising on such an instrumentas an empty petrol can . But if you want to study the chimpanzee , it is not in the African forests that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have several times done , and adopt a young one ? a baby , perhaps , that has been found deserted on the ground after its mother has been killed by the poisoned arrows of the natives ? and take it to your camp or even bring it home to England . Then you will see that the chimpanzee is the most intelligent by far of all the animals . You will see his marvelouspowers of imitation , his friendliness , his wonderful capacity for play . His capabilities will be those of the wild chimpanzee , and from them you can draw conclusions of the life that his family lives in Africa . You will see his agility , his strength , his inquisitiveness , his nearnessp154to a much stronger degree of understanding ; and then you will realize how fascinating would be the study if only it were possible to watch him unobserved in his own home . Although in Central Africa there are almost insurmountable difficulties in studying the gorilla and the chimpanzee , there is no difficulty at all with regard to the Baboon . Wherever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as among the hills and forests . Often you will discovera lump of rock as large as a house projectingfrom a hill-side , and there you will see baboons at play ? twenty or thirty of them , or possibly as many as a hundred . Or you will meet a troop in the open , walking with a leader in front , the other males , the mothers and their babies behind , and one big old fellow to guard the rear ; and they will not be unduly afraid of you , merely walking quietly away for a little distance while the " rear guard " climbs a tree to make sure that you are not following too closely.  |p155If  you stay to watch a troop of baboons on a rock , you are certain to be reminded of scenes at the sea-side , with a group of mothers sitting together on a breakwater while their children play below ; and the similarity is so striking that you are bound to laugh at the thought . You will see half a dozen mother baboons sitting apparently deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time on their youngsters ; and you will see the little fellows playing a sort of " I 'm the King of the Castle " on an out-jutting rock , taking it more or less in turns to be pushed over the edge of the rock and then to scramble back . Now and again you will hear one of the youngsters give a little whimpering cry as the play becomes too rough , and immediately its mother will pick it up , cuddle it and soothe it , and then put it down while once more she turns to gossip with her friends . How often we have seen the same sort of thing at Margate or at Brighton ! The old leader of a troop appears to fulfill most of the duties of a tribal chief . He is the general in war and the judge in peace . If therep156is a suspicion of danger , it is he who will investigateit . And it seems that all sorts of problemsare brought to him by members of the troop . One day I watched at a water-hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big troop came to drink . When they were seventy yards from the pool they halted and the old leader came forward , right down to the water , to make sure that all was safe . I was secreted behind a hide-up which I had carefully built of stone , so he did not suspect my presence , and in a minute he gave a short bark which the baboonalways uses to signify " All Clear ! " Then the whole troop came down . After they had drunk they did not at once move off , but played among the rocks and sand of the river-bed or sat , apparently talking . Undoubtedly there is a baboon language , though I do not think it has a very large vocabulary . You can often see their lips moving as if in question and answer , and sometimes they seem in this way to carry on quite long conversations . On this occasion , one mother came with her baby perched like a little jockey onp157her back to where the old chief was sitting on a stone , elbows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very gently lifted the baby from her back and laid it on the ground almost at the old fellow 's feet , before she stooped to drink . While she was drinking the old baboon ? becoming , apparently , suddenly interested in his task as nursemaid ? picked up the baby , examined it , looked into its face and held it till the mother had finished . The mother , taking it from him , said something which I hope was a word of thanks , and then , with the child in her arms , sat down beside him , chatting brightly and telling him , I suppose , all about how her child cried in the night and the difficultiesshe had with it . Suddenly one of the baboons at the waterhole , hearing I suppose the noise of my camera , gave the alarm with a sharp , shrill bark . Instantly the whole troop , headed by the old leader , made a dash down the dried-up riverbed ? allof those fifty baboons , except one badly-scared youngster who ran madly to one side , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thorn tree only a few yardsp158from my hide-up . The others went down the river-bed , but very soon he was missed : I could see one of the mothers stopping to look to right and to left , and at last she came back to search . The news that a youngster was lost was passed to the old leader , and he came back with the mother , now no longer the family friend with whom the children could be left , but very much the protector of a tribe who knew that danger was around . Clearly , he had not come back to help the mother find her child , so much as to discover the disturber of peaceful scenes and possible abductor of wandering babes . The mother very quickly saw where her youngster was hiding , stood beneath the tree and held out her arms , so that the little one dropped into them and was carried away to safety . But the old chief stood glaring around as if challenging anybody or anything to " come on if they dared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare . That baboon would have topped the scale at one hundred and fifty pounds , and was strong enough to tear a dog to pieces in a minute ? or to do me a considerable amount of damage . And as he was but ten yardsP159away I took particular care to make no sound . Often the leader of a troop of baboons will have to exercise his skill and tact as a peacemaker . A troop consists of several families , and naturally in such circumstances there are rivalries and a good deal of quarreling . Young fellows or females or both together will have an argument , all chattering very fast and very loudly at the same time , until a blow is struck and a fight seems unavoidable . Then the old leader will come quickly down from a high part of the rock , step between the combatants , and put a stop to all that nonsense ! The quarrelsomebaboons will bolt to a safer place , but very soon the quarrel will be forgotten and all will play together , while the aged peacemaker will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh the pros and cons of the case and assurehimself that his judgment has been the right one . An old baboon squatting on his haunches with elbows on knees looks in the distance exactly like a native ; and indeed on more than one occasion hunters have shot natives when they thought they were shooting baboons . Dur/ing the war , in German East Africa , the alarm was often given by soldiers unused to African conditions when nothing more dangerous was advancing than a large troop of baboons ? a mistake which I can well understand , for although I have watched baboons for hours on end and can claim a considerable knowledge of them , I myself have before now been deceived . I well remember my amazement when , after I had spent some minutes watching with interestwhat I took to be a baboon sitting on a rock , a native quietly stood up and walked away ! Baboons seem to be on very friendly relations with most other wild animals . I have seen them joined by wart-hog , impalla , jackal and vulture at a water-hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , they have enemies who would make short work of them : and , in particular , they live in mortal dread of the leopard . Once , in camp , I was awakened in the early hours of the morning by a terrific noise of excitedchattering as a troop of baboons passed by : and in the midst of it I heard , farther off , the terrifying grunt of a leopard . Whether the ba-P161boons were merely fleeing from the evil sound , or whether one of their number had been caught and they were leaving the scene of the tragedy , I did not know ? and I certainly did not go to investigate , for , as I shall show in a later chapter , I respect the leopard , and I should have hesitated to approach him even if it had been daylight . At another time I saw several baboons hurryingamong bush and grass and rocks at the foot of a rocky hill-side , and I was struck by the way they moved , which clearly showed there was danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the explanation was at hand , for thirty seconds later a leopard crept past . He had ? fortunately  --  no interest in me , though I was but thirty yards away : all his eyes and all his appetite were for the baboons . Another enemy of baboons is the crocodile . When baboons go to a river , even though the water be shallow , they will be very suspicious and very much on the look-out for scaly dangerbefore they venture to drink or before the mothers bathe their very young babies , as they are said to do although I myself have never seenP162it . And even while they are at the water there will always be one baboon posted on look-out . The baboon sentry is a very important member of the troop . However exciting may be the games played beneath him , or however good the hunting for food , the sentry will never leave his post ? well , hardly ever . I have to make that qualification , for I did once see a baboon , whom I took to be a sentry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition I was standing with a companion on a rough track which was bordered on one side for two hundred yards by long grass , with one solitary tree . Suddenly my companion saw a movement in the grass and , gripping my arm , said : " Lion ! " As we were just on the borders of the lion countryI had no reason to doubt him ; but , nevertheless , he was wrong . Suddenly from the waving grass jumped a baboon , straight into the air , in an effort to reach a branch of the tree . There was fruit on the tree , and again and again he sprang , evidently thinking of nothing in the world but the chance of fruit . Knowing the baboon as I do , that seemed top163me very odd ; for , as I have said , the baboons live in troops , and never have I seen or heard of one baboon wandering by himself . But a few weeks later I camped on the same spot , and then I discovered that it was the home of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen must almost certainly have belonged . Of course , it is conceivable that he was but a truant ? but I can not help suspecting that he was a sentry who had forgotten his job ! Baboons are not migratory animals . They keep to one patch of country and usually adopt one piece of rocky hill as their home where they sleep at night , only leaving it in the daytime for long walks in search of food . They go leisurely then , but their search is diligent , for though they are interested in fruits , they examineeverything that attracts them , often peering carefully under stones for scorpions and insects . It is interesting to see this search , for their eyesight is wonderful and very little escape their attention . They are always attracted by anything unusual . I remember once sitting outside my tent near some big rocks while I played with myp164chimpanzee , Toto . Suddenly , out of the corner of my eye , I saw a movement about twenty yards away , and there , on the rocks , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What he saw evidently excited him immensely , and he seemed very much puzzled at what his little cousin was doing with a man . It would have been interesting to have let the two creatures meet ; but it would have been dangerous , for Toto 's conduct in my camp would not have had the old baboon 's approval , and a chimpanzee is no match for a baboon . The stories which I have told in the last few pages should have shown that it is when on the march ( as at the water-hole ) that the baboon is most watchful and wary . When you approach a troop on a rocky hill they will show very little fear , and will merely climb to safety , and sit there watching you , secure in the knowledge that you can not pursue them . Where they have not been molested they are not scared , and are indeed often remarkably interested in any humanbeing that comes near them . Even when disturbed , they are not routed : they merely stroll away to safety . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole troop would come to the rescue , fighting with hands and teeth . The life of baboons is somewhat precarious . The leopard takes his toll , young ones are very often taken captive by the natives , and I am sorry to say that the baboon is often shot by sportsmen . But there is nothing to be gained by killing these amusing creatures ; and it is far more worth while to study them , for they providean entertainment which is invariably amusing . I know of few sights more humorous than the chattering family at play , and few more interesting than the long procession of a large troop filing down to cross a donga ? an old man ahead , then fathers and mothers and youngsters and children and babies , with the watchful chief taking a last look round before bringing up the rear . There are many varieties of the monkey tribe in Central Africa , the commonest being theP166little gray fellows who play round the foot of trees on the banks of a river or near the lakes . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with basket traps , and many times when they have been brought into camp I have tamed them in two or three days while waiting for a chance to take them home and set them free . The more interesting varieties , however , are not easy to study , since they live in the big forests and quickly take alarm at man 's approach . The Black Colobus , for instance , will jump from branch to branch and from tree to tree , but rarely if ever will he be seen on the ground . The only way to observe him is to sit very quietly under a tree and look up ? and even then the task is a hard one , for although there is a considerable amount of white on his body and tail , he often lives among trees which are covered with lichen , when the white is not easily distinguishable . Besides the black colobus , there is a Red member of the family , whose habits are quite different for he is definitely a ground animal . He has bushy side-whiskers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black colobus . Incidentally , he is very much the rarer of the two . P170I HAVE implied in an earlier chapter that the pursuit of a Leopard through the African bush and forests is not an occupation which attracts me . Indeed , I regard him as one of the most dangerous creatures in Central Africa . He is above all things a killer . Not only will he hunt for his dinner and attack his enemies , but at times he will kill for the mere lust of killing . If I had to choose between facing a lion and facing a leopard , I should unhesitatingly choose the lion : for while of two hundred lions one might be a man-eater , there is a far larger proportionof leopards that are likely to kill a human being , and no one can say that a leopard will not kill on sight anything that attracts hisp172attention as a possible prey , whether it be dog , or pig , or guinea-fowl , or woman , or child . The leopard is always on the war-path , alwayswatchful , always ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lion , in a troop , but goes by himself , silent footed , gliding through undergrowthalmost with the sinister movement of a snake . You do not find him often in the open country ; his domain is the forest , where undergrowthgives him cover and trees give him a hiding-place , and where he can pounce upon his prey before it knows of his presence . He makes his home in a cave or small hole amongst rocks , and there he sleeps . There too he rears his cubs . But in the dusk and through the night ? and for that matter also by day ? he goes creeping along , alert for the baboon , the monkey , the smaller buck , or anything that may come his way . If he is near a settlement or a native village , he will very likely raid it and take a goat or a dog or a human baby . The leopard is bold and cunning , and he will go long distances hunting for his prey . I know of one instance where a leopard ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking from each a dog , a turkey or a fowl , although to do so he had to cover twenty miles between the first estate and the last . Often he will go to the feeding-grounds of native sheep and goats , and he seems to know the hours , in the early morning , when a member of the flock is most likely to stray . He will wait in a forest glade ( very likely lying , like one I saw last autumn , on an ant-hill ) for unsuspectinganimals to walk past . He will not fear to spring on to the verandas of houses , or even occasionally to enter the rooms : indeed he has been known to bound across a sleeping man in order to steal a dog . And when his appetite is whetted by a particular catch , he will come again and again for more . Often a settler 's dog has disappeared as if by magic from a veranda , and in the subsequent nights every dog on every settlement for miles around has suffered the same fate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend themselves than men , and childrenless likely still . Some years ago a leopard became interested in one native village . Eveningafter evening he went down to it , takingP174what he could find . Terror reigned there and a large reward was offered for the beast 's captureor killing . But still the nightly toll went on , and by the time the leopard was shot , no less than twenty-two children from that one village had been slain . It was a friend of mine who eventually shot him . In the forest one evening without a rifle , my friend discovered that his pack of dogs had brought a leopard to bay . He hurried back a distance of three-quarters of a mile for the weapon , leaving behind him his twelve dogs to hold the leopard . When he returned , two of the dogs met him . He found the mangled bodies of the other ten where the leopard had last been seen . That time the creature escaped , but not for long . My friend continued the pursuit , and eventually a bullet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : for although of course there was no direct evidence that the leopard which he shot was the marauder , it is certain that at its death the raids on the village came to an end . Much that I have said in this book shouldP175have made clear my strong objection to the takingof animal life except for man 's necessity for food . But to kill such an animal as this particularleopard is not wanton killing , and to it the objection can not be applied . One 's love for animals may be great , but it is not so great as one 's love for the human child and one 's duty to protect it , whether its skin be black or white . If I had discovered that murderous creature I should certainly have gone for a rifle . But I did not find him . The most that I heard of him was a terrible grunting in the night ? and of course I do not know that it came from this particular leopard , although when I heard later the story of the desolated native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was while I had with me my little fox terrier , Simba . I was asleep with the dog besideme in a little tin-roofed wooden hut , when suddenly I was awakened by a thud overhead and heard that ominous grunting . Simba was terrified , and so for the matter of that was I. There was no doubt that a roaming leopard had picked up the dog 's scent and was trying to force his way in . If he had succeeded ? well ,  |p176it  is most improbable that he would have stopped at the dog , and I had no weapon in the hut but a revolver , which is an entirely useless thing against a leopard . If I had gone outside to seek better protection the leopard would have sprung on to me from the roof directly I showed myself . There was therefore nothing to be done but to wait ? and to trust that the roof would stand the strain longer than the leopard 's interest . As things turned out , it did ; but that is certainly not an experience that I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of attack lies in his ability to climb trees and to jump . Sometimes he will spring against the bare trunk of a tree , grasp it with his claws and drag himself up to a branch : then he will lie on the branch , ready to leap down on some passing animal . When he has made a kill and eaten what he wants , instead of leaving the rest for scavenging jackals and vultures as the lion will do , he will hide it for less fortunate days . Grasping the remains of the carcass in his teeth he will spring into a tree and leave his kill in a fork between branches , taking infinite careP177to hide it where no other animal will be likely to discover it : although in that he is not alwayssuccessful , for once I proved that a lion had climbed the sloping trunk of a tree and come down again with a leopard 's kill . One evening whilst I was strolling down a river bank looking for pictures , I saw on the opposite side of the stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of a dead hippopotamus that lay in the water . Suddenly , as I watched the scene , I saw another movement on the bank about ten feet above the water , and then very silently a leopard crept to the edge . Apparently the appetizing smell of dead hippo , by then probably a trifle high , appealed to him , and he decided to take his share in the feast . Close to where he stood , a branch of a tree sloped down over the river and just above the hippo . Along this the leopard walked , lying down near the end of it , a flat , yellow streak against the darkness of the bank . Then he whisked his tail and began edging carefully forward till he was within two and a half feet of the carcass.  |p178With  three sets of claws firmly grasping the branch , he began to reach down with the fourth in a pawing movement with claws outstretched . But still he could not reach . His claws came to within a foot of the meat , so that I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap at it ; but the crocodiles were too busy tearing the hippo in pieces . For a time the leopard , making a peculiar noise in his eagerness , tried to reach farther down , but the attempt was hopeless and eventually he gave it up , lying on the branch for a while to watch in envy the more successful crocodiles . Then he crawled back to the bank , stood as if wondering whether he should take the risk of jumping down , and at last , as silently as he had come , crept back into the forest . Because the leopard is very much a forest dweller , it is comparatively seldom that he is seen by men . Sleeping by day among rocks , as he does , and either prowling in undergrowth or lying on the branches of trees , hunters find him one of the most difficult animals to shoot : indeedit is usually found far easier to catch him in a baited trap . For the same reasons , he is dif-P179ficult to study , and even more difficult to photograph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have secured his picture except in cases where he has been captured as a cub and reared to comparativetameness in captivity . Then , of course , the matter is easier , but even then , although in an enclosed space the leopard can be brought to bay before the camera , he is still exceedingly dangerous . I remember , for example , a man once offering to sell me a leopard which he regarded as tamed . Knowing what I do of the leopard 's character , I hastened to assure him that the creature is never to be trusted ; and in the middle of my lecture , the so-called " harmless " leopard suddenly sprang at its owner , and seized him by the arm between elbow and shoulder , while its hind legs tore his thigh and its teeth fastened in his shoulder . It is generally at a man 's throat that a leopardwill spring . The leopard attacks with lightningspeed , the man falls like a pole beneath the animal 's weight , and then unless assistance is immediately at hand , there is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , know of one instance in which a man when attacked performed the al/most incredible feat of grasping the throat of the leopard as they fell together with the beast underneath and , after a desperate struggle to keep the leopard 's claws from reaching his stomach , actually choking it to death ! But against that I could tell of many cases where a man was killed , and of many more where he was saved only in the nick of time . One friend of mine saved himself by throwing back his arm as he fell forward , so that it covered his neck behind him : and though , by the time his boys ' drove the leopard off , his arm was terribly mauled , it was undoubtedly this that saved his life . For my own part I have never yet come to more perilous quarters with a leopard than in the incident I have described . Frankly , I am shy of the animal because , apart from the danger of being killed , there is almost a certainty that a wound from his claws or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall continuemy efforts to study him and to secure his picture , I shall always go in pursuit of him with a prayer that at the least I shall see him before he sees me.  |p181In  appearance , the Cheetah is so much like the leopard , particularly when , crouching in grass or undergrowth , that mistakes are often made , the cheetah falling a victim to a bullet intended for his ferocious cousin . But it is in appearance that the resemblance begins and ends . The leopard , as I have said , is essentially dangerous and always a killer : the cheetah , on the other hand , is an entirely lovable and harmless animal , who never attacks man even when sorely wounded , and is indeed so peaceablethat it is even possible to take his kill from him , without his doing anything more than protest . Often , while wandering through short bush , I have suddenly seen a streak of spotted yellow bounding into the open a few yards ahead , and have pulled up short , ready if necessary to defendmyself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I have seen the very slight differencesand have known that I faced , not my enemy the leopard , but my friend the cheetah . And knowing that , I have stayed in admirationP182to watch this beautiful animal , with his coat bright in the sunlight , bounding in magnificent leaps across my path . Thinking of the leopard , one remembers his fierceness and particularly his terrible claws . But the cheetah has no claws , and only a softlypaddedpaw , like that of a dog . He hunts , of course , for his dinner , and therefore is not loved by the smaller animals . But to anything else he is in no sense dangerous , and one is bound to regardhim as a rather playful and entirely goodhumoredanimal . His home is not in the forests , but on rocky hills close to open ground . He hunts by daylight , and often you will see him perched on a crag in the early morning , looking down into the valley ? a beautiful silhouette . From a rocky escarpment he will sight a small gazelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he will rise and make off , down the rocks and into the plain . Few animals are swifter for a short distance , and if he can get a fair start , unseen , he will very soon run down his quarry ; but , like the lion , he lacks staying power and therefore willP183probably not overtake his prey in a protracted chase . If , however , he is successful , he will strike the animal oh its hindquarters with his soft paw so as to throw it out of its stride , and then leap for its throat . Unfortunately , the cheetah 's skill and speed in hunting will eventually be his undoing : for considerable numbers are now caught and exportedto India where they are trained to round up game . For that reason his numbers will decreasein Central Africa , and it seems likely that he will one day become extinct ? an eventualitywhich I , for one , should greatly deplore . In another book ' I have told of the games I have played with a half-tame cheetah in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . The cheetah in the wilds is not tame , but he is certainly not fierce , and no one who cares for animal life could possibly wish him harm.  |p187animal  photographer . Anyone else will keep , almost subconsciously , a look-out for them ; but the photographer is thinking of his pictures and his eyes are on his subjects . Many a time I have had the narrowest escapes , simply through failing to notice that a snake was withina few inches of me . Once I stood with my hand on the branch of a tree , and it was not until I happened to notice a movement that I detected a Green Mamba ( which is a deadly creature ) on the very branch that I was holding . Recently , too , I was photographing a big grass fire in Central Africa and thinking of nothing but getting myself and my camera into the best position for such a grand subject , when a mamba suddenly attacked me . Fortunately he hit a leg of the camera tripod instead of myp188leg ? otherwise I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing as I do the deadliness of snakes in many countries , I am constantly surprised at the very small number of fatalities from snake bite that occur in Central Africa , even among the bare-footed and bare-legged natives . Yet snakes are plentiful ; and if one is driving a car it is by no means unusual to see them wriggling across the track , or even for the wheels to run over them . Curiously enough , however , if is almostimpossible to kill a snake by running over him , whether he be large or small ? indeed , some will wriggle away afterwards almost as quickly as if they had never been touched . At the same time , it must not be thought that I am recommending my readers to put that to the test , for snakes , even if they are unhurt , are not likely to be pleased at being run over ? and sometimes they will retaliate . A lady of my acquaintancerecently ran into the tail of a mamba , and immediately the snake lashed back , missing her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a serious fright which was not lessenedWhen she realized that although she hadp189seen the mamba rise she had not seen him drop again , so that until she had made a thorough search she was uncertain whether or not he was still either on or in the car , waiting to strike again ! Another friend of mine lay down to sleep one afternoon on a camp-bed in his tent , and awoke later to see a mamba lying coiled up on his chest , asleep . Some people in such a position would have been kept still by sheer terror and would have waited , almost mesmerized , to see what happened ? probably with fatal results . My friend , however , was of a different caliber , and he leapt up with a shout , knocking the mamba to the other side of the tent , and then fled into the open air . Anyone who knows the wilds will shudder at that story , for whatever one may feel about snakes in the open , they are certainly not wanted in one 's tent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake in Central Africa . The Puff-adder is also very poisonous , but he is more easily dealt with because , if it is not the breeding season , he often lies perfectly still ( apparently with faith in his harmonizing powers or perhaps under the impression that he has not been seen ) , and only strikes as a last resort . He gets his name from his curious way of blowing himself out before striking . Much less often do you see the Python , a very large but comparatively harmless creature . Some people claim that he grows to a length of as much as thirty feet , but the longest I have ever seen was twenty-five feet . I do not think that the wild animals as a rule fear snakes in general , for they are not likely to be bitten unless they actually tread on one . But it is a very different matter with the python . A friend of mine once watched one of the most remarkable sights ever recorded ? a fight between a python and a hyena on some bare ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards of the scene , but neither combatant had any interest in him . It was a duel to the death , both creatures strugglingtill they were exhausted and then drawingapart for a breather until they were ready to begin again . A python 's strength is terrible , but he needs to get a purchase with his tail onP191some staple object so as to exert all his power . Here there was no tree to which he could anchorhimself , and consequently he was at a disadvantage . The python fought to get a hold for strangulation ; but the hyena bites , and when once his teeth close they are not loosened till they have brought a portion of his enemy away with them . That was exactly what happened in this case , and at last the hyena slunk away , leaving the python dead on the bare ground . I once saw a python stretched along the branch of a tree , watching animals that fed , unaware of his presence , below . For some minutes I watched without realizing that all the time the python was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly did he move ; but at last he started down the trunk on the farther side from the animals . Till then I had always imagined that he would strike from overhead , taking advantage of his position on a bough , but this python , at any rate , decided to attack from the ground . The threatened animals showed no knowledge of their danger but , by what I think must have been for them merely a very lucky chance ,  |p192they  gradually fed towards a patch of ground where the grass had been eaten short . There , the python would have had no chance of approachingthem unseen ; and accordingly he made no attempt to follow the animals , but very quietly went back to his old position on the branch , to wait for better fortune next time . P195WITH many animals , when you see several together , it is quite impossible to guess their relationships . But although you may often see one old Wart-hog by himself , when you see a number together , you may be quite sure that it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the children ? or possibly mother and the children alone . The whole of the life of this creature seems to be associated with his home . If he is disturbed he will not turn and fight , although he has very powerful tusks which could do a lot of damage ; he will make straight for the hole ( like a gigantic rabbit-hole ) in which he lives . But if he is pursued , instead of scuttling to safety and leaving the entrance of the home unprotected , as a rabbit would do , he willp196turn , however hot the chase , and go in backwardsso as to face his enemy with his tusks . The young ones , of course , are not so smart at making for home , and consequently they are preyed on by the leopard , the lion and the hyena . Once I discovered a family of warthogsand as I was staying some time in the districtI saw them repeatedly . But the first real meeting was unfortunate , for I came upon the mother and four little ones very suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolted for home , but the little ones very foolishly scattered in all directions . That time there were no evil results , but on other occasionsthose foolish children were not so fortunate ; for by the time I moved on , a week later , only two of them were left . At another time I photographed a family drinking at a water-hole and wallowing in the water just as the rhino does . I was carefully hidden and my presence was not suspected . After a while the mother left ? but she forgot to count her children . Four went with her but the fifth was enjoying himself and stayed be-P197hind . Suddenly he realized that he was alone and hurried out of the river-bed . He had not seen the family depart , and he seemed to imagine that they had gone on , whereas in fact they had gone back the way they had come . Off he went , in great excitement , and then in a minuteor two he came back , completely lost , lookingthis way and that , and listening , but quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he put his nose to the ground and tracked their scent till he found the path they had taken ; and then away he went at full tilt , overtakingthem a hundred and fifty yards from the water-hole . I have no doubt that his mother was very cross , and rated him soundly for gettinglost ; but I , the unseen witness , knew what she knew ? that the truant returned before she had even discovered his absence ! The wart-hog derives his name from the fact that he always has big warts on either side of his face . I think he is a short-sighted animalfor he seems to do a great deal of listening : and often , when , being out of the wind , I have stood perfectly still among some trees , warthogshave walked unsuspectingly to within fif/teen yards of me ? and then suddenly bolted at great speed for home . The Forest-pig is related to the wart-hog , but although the two creatures have in commoncertain characteristics of the pig species , they are different in appearance , the forest-pig being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the neck and round the shoulders . The forest-pig is by no means common : indeed , during many journeys I have only seen him on three occasions . Last year I stalked a couple for half an hour in fairly open country some distance from any forest . Then I saw that like all members of the pig tribe they would repeatedly stop to listen for a few seconds on the chance of locating enemies , and afterwards trot off again , to stop and listen once more a little fartheron . It would have been interesting to have followed them to their home , but they led me at last to some thick bush country which I found impenetrable . P201CENTRAL AFRICA is a paradise for birds both large and small ; and indeed there are so many varieties , particularly of small birds , that it would probably weary any but the scientific reader if I attempted to describethem all . On the other hand , many of them are intensely interesting to study , and these I must deal with . The Ostrich is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will invariably see a few of the birds dotted here and there , mixing peacefully with zebra , kongoni and gazelle . There is something infinitelyrestful , and at the same time beautiful , in the sight . Nevertheless , the life of the ostrich is by  |p202no  means the peaceful affair that one might expect . Although King Fashion 's latest decrees have ended ostrich farming , the bird has still many enemies , especially the lion , who will kill the full-grown bird , the cheetah , who eats the young birds , and the hyena , who eats ostrichchickens and has a passion for ostrich eggs . Consequently , the bird is extremely wary . He does not get alarmed at an intruder 's approach , for he knows the protective value of his great speed ; but he is always watchful , and as soon as he decides that it is advisable to move , off he goes ? steadily and without the slightest suggestion of panic ? to a distance of a hundred and fifty yards . That , apparently , is his idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it between himself and anything that he regards as dangerous or even suspicious . When the breeding season comes , the mother bird sits down and by turning herself round and round scrapes out a little hollow in the earth , flattening its surface with her wings . There she lays her eggs , from eight to sixteen in number . Occasionally two mothers will sharep203a nest , and then the eggs , which are very large , will make quite a display . The ostriches appear to be good parents ? so long as danger is not too pressing . The mother will put three or four eggs on the ground beside her , and the contents of these will be used as food for the young birds when first hatched out : and later the chickens will be moved out of the open and hidden for safety 's sake in the grass . I have been told of the remarkable action of the parent ostriches when a fire is raging and the grass burning immediately around the hollow in which lie the eggs . Then both birds will rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their wet wings on to the nest before stamping out the smoldering fire . In view of such facts as those , it is all the more extraordinary that these parents should at times appear to consider their own safety before that of their offspring . Yet that is undoubtedlythe case . When sitting , they stretch out the body with the neck along the ground so as to be as inconspicuous as possible : and when danger ? be it hyena or man ? approaches , bothp204parents desert the nest and the eggs , to reach a safe distance from the intruder . Some people imagine that the ostrich never drinks ( and I am assured that that is at any rate the case with the ostriches in certain zoological gardens ) : but years ago I took cinematograph pictures in Central Africa of three of the birds , a male and two females , drinking from a pool . Clearly the birds thought it a moment of particulardanger ( and in that I think they were right ) , so perhaps they think it wise to drink as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds certainly did . First the male stood on guard while the two females drank , and then while they stood on the watch , he began to drink ? and very daintily he did it . Then all three began to dress and trim their feathers by the edge of the pool : a quaint and amusing sight because , whether they realized it or not , the water reflected them exactly as a mirror would have done . A procession of ostriches running in single file is a particularly beautiful sight as their long legs move gracefully in a sort of prance . In black and white they stand out against thep205brownish green , like ballet dancers against a painted curtain . The Secretary Bird is not so much like anything else that we know in the bird world as like one of the thinner members of the PickwickClub in a swallow-tailed coat . He stands about four feet high , and always struts with his long thin legs coming high off the ground . When you first see him , you may think he is merely a simpleton showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his elegance , he is hard at work , searching the grass for the snakes , lizards , frogs , and other creatures that are his food . To and fro he goes , working over a suitable patch of ground , and when he sees anything that will go towards a meal , he rushes forward or jumps sideways , trying to secure it before it can dart into a hole . If he is lucky in that , he holds his wings high in the air and does a remarkable dance ? as it seems ? with the object of stampinghis victim to death . The secretary bird 's nest is usually made of twigs , on the top of a very thick bush or a tall thorn tree , and there the mother bird will liep206flat on her eggs , while the father continues his energetic search for food , no doubt becoming even more agile as he thinks of the extra mouths he will shortly have to feed . One of the enemies of the secretary bird is the Buzzard , who will try to rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two . Directly the secretary bird made a capture and rose in the air to fly to the nest , the buzzardattacked him . But when the secretary bird , presumably having been plundered of his gains , went to the ground again , the buzzard sat on a thorn tree and watched him , apparently decidingthat there was no sense in wasting more energy until the secretary bird had something fresh in his beak for him to steal ! I have little to say of the Greater Bustard , a bird that may weigh twenty pounds and often measures seven or eight feet from wing tip to wing tip . He is very trusting , and will wait quietly in the grass while you pass him ; and even when he is disturbed he will only move a short distance . Consequently he is easy preyp207when food is required for the pot ? and that , to most people , is his chief source of interest . The Ground Hornbill is a very unwieldy bird , not unlike a turkey . He is not at all shy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of you without attempting to fly , even if you come within twenty yards . He lives on a diet of fruits and berries , pleasantly varied with reptiles and insects . I have never been so fortunate as to find and photograph the nest of this bird in Central Africa , though I have often studied his relationsat close quarters in Borneo . It is likely that the habits of the two branches of the family are much the same , and therefore I would mention the curious behavior at nesting time which I have seen in Borneo . There , the bird nests in a hole in a tree , and when the eggs are laid the male bird plasters up the mouth of the hole to protect the mother bird and the eggs from the raids of monkeys , leaving only sufficient space for her to put out her beak so that he may feed her by regurgitation.  |p208Guinea  Fowl are usually found in numbers of from twelve to twenty-five , but recently in Tanganyika I saw as many as two hundred at a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a dazzling sight . There , too , I saw ? and for that matter photographed ? one of the terrible sights of the bush : the capture of a guinea fowl by a cheetah , who sprang suddenlyinto the midst of the flock , seized one of the running birds by the neck and made off with it . It is doubtless because of such incidents as this , that the guinea fowl will often give warning of any stealthy approach ; thereby ? since other creatures also act on the warning ? entirely ruining the chances of an observer who may have stalked a herd of zebra or a troop of baboons for nearly an hour ! You can always see Vultures in Central Africa in the early morning . They are the last of the scavengers . When the lion has left the remains of his kill , the hyena and the jackal start the scavenging in the night , but at dawnP209the vultures will be aloft , flying in great circles and at a great height . As daylight comes the hyena and the jackal slink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the feast . Sometimes at an early hour you may see a single vulture in the sky , but directly he sights the kill others will appear as if from nowhere : and soon a large number of the creatures will be driving off the lingering jackals and setting to work . The vulture hunts by sight , so that it is the lowest that finds the prey , and others , far aloft , who can not see the dead animal on the ground , see their brother wheeling down and quickly follow . They are not peaceable birds , and they squabble and fight over the meal , so that often a considerable number of feathers will be left on the ground when at last they fly away : but that is not till the bones of the animal are picked absolutely clean . Sometimes the birds will gorge themselves so heartily that they cannotrise from the ground , and even those who for one reason or another have failed to get the best of the meal have to take quite a long run before they rise into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an airplane about to take off . With the vulture at the feast you will see the Marabou Stork ; but he plays the part of the poor relation taking what crumbs can be spared . He is a grandfatherly-looking creature , with a big bill , a large pouch in the position ? more or less ? of a beard , large legs and powerful wings . But I always think he lacks spirit in proportion to his size . I have never seen more than three or four at a feast , and those few will strut in a stately way around the edge , apparently not daring to interrupt the vultures , who are only a third of their size , but popping in now and again to seize a piece of the meat when nobody seems to be looking . Then , when at last the meal is done , the marabou stork will go with the vultures to drink , and both types of scavengerwill stand or squat for hours in the warm sun till the time comes to go aloft again and search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meal . It is a curious sight to see the scavengers at a water-hole , side by side with zebra and kon/goni and other animals in whom they take not the slightest interest ? so long as they are alive . But by the next morning one of those very animalsmay have provided a dinner in turn for the lion , the hyena , the jackal , and lastly the marabou storks and vultures who are now sharingtheir watering-place ! Another scavenger is the Fork-tailed Kite . He , like the marabou stork , quite definitely plays second fiddle to the vultures and only gets a look-in when they have finished or while they are squabbling . He is chiefly interesting because of his curious flight , in which he manages his tail so that while flying in circles he can suddenlydescend to the ground in a fraction of a second , pick up a tit-bit , and fly off with it . With the business of scavenger he couples that of camp-follower , carrying off any food that may be thrown away . There is no difficulty in studying him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sit watching him . The Tick Bird is an eater of animal parasites . He is about the size of a thrush , but his actionsp212bear more resemblance to those of the woodpecker . He is always to be found on such animalsas the giraffe , the rhinoceros , the hippopotamusand the eland , and his mission in life seems to be to make a systematic search of these animals for the parasites . He works diligently , poking his beak into all sorts of corners and crevices , and apparently missing nothing . He will often be seen hanging , even , on the underlipof the giraffe , an animal which seems to carry parasites which particularly appeal to him ; indeed it is no exaggeration to say that I have seen as many as thirty tick birds on a single giraffe at one time . Of course , this sort of thing must occasionallyprove uncommonly ticklish for the animal , and now and again you will see him suddenlywhisk his tail to brush the birds off : whereupon the tick birds will lie flat to avoid the blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stalks big game has a particular interest in these birds , but not a very friendly one : for although their presence sometimes disclosesthe whereabouts of the animals , they givep213warnings to the animals also , and particularly to the more dangerous creatures such as the rhino . Many and many a time , as I have relatedelsewhere , I have stalked a rhino and felt certain that I should succeed in getting close enough for my pictures , when suddenly these birds have given the alarm , uttering a shrill harsh squawk which immediately put the rhino on his guard . Other birds , such as the Buff Backed Heron and the Egret , live particularly with the elephantand the buffalo when in swampy country , and often the sight of them is one 's first warning of the presence of these animals , who may be securely hidden in papyrus or elephant grass , until the fluttering up and settling down again of the birds gives them away . Group 4There are few hunting grounds for birds so good as the Great Lakes . There you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flamingo sometimes in millions , ' but thep214pelican usually in groups of two or three . Sometimes , on approaching one of the lakes , you will think , as you first see it from a distance , that the water has turned pink ? and then , as you arrive on the shores of the lake , you will hear an indescribable sound , and find that you are seeing the pink-like bodies of thousands upon thousands of flamingo . If the birds take to flight , the sound grows in volume as they rise , and at the same time you see one of the most marvelous sights to be observed in Africa . All that pink beauty will rise from the water , circle slowly , and fall again either on the same spot or perhaps a hundred yards away . I know of nothing that gives me so much cause to stand and stare , entranced . The pelicans are perhaps rather less attractive , but they are very interesting . Once , many years ago , I saw a group of as many as a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lake Naivasha , and I was fortunate in being able to get within fifty yards of them in a small boat ; but nowadays I think myself lucky if I see even a couple together . It is always interesting to watch pelican , be/cause they seem to have some method of communicatingideas , so that when they are in single file they all turn at the same moment , exactly like soldiers on parade . There are no fish in Lake Naivasha , and consequently you do not find there the big spotted African Kingfisher : but you do find countless other water-birds from the Cormorantto a very small Kingfisher . The birds seem to live chiefly on frogs , and I have spent many interesting hours studying the different methods by which they catch them : for example , the Heron will stand perfectly still until a frog comes to the surface , while the Stork will shuffle with his feet till the frogs are scared and jump . Although the Crowned Crane is usually found near water , I have also seen him many miles from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite common , living at peace with the natives , but not so easy to approach when away from the lakes . Three things will be noticed about this bird : his amusing way of dancing , his mournful cry , and his very grace-P216ful flight . Sometimes you will see forty or fifty sailing past you together , and you will be compelled to stop in admiration : but to appreciate the grace of the flight to the full you must see it in slow motion on the cinematograph screen . Then you will know the meaning of the phrase , " a poem in motion . " The White-headed Fish-eagle is a handsome bird , fairly common on Lake Victoria but otherwise seldom seen . By the side of the lake you will often see either one or two fish-eagles perched on a branch : you will hear them too , for , throwing back their heads almost to touch their bodies , they make a curious noise which in the distance might almost be mistaken for a laugh.  |p219ONE  afternoon , many years ago , while seekingfor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a sort of tunnel that ran through very thick bush ? the track , undoubtedly , , of one of the larger animals . Suddenly , as I crept forward , I heard a very faint pad-pad-pad directly ahead of me and coming swiftly nearer : and before I had time to do more than begin going backwards , I saw in the darkness ? almost filling the tunnel and only three yards in front ? the fierce head of a wild creature . For an instant I thought I was face to face with a lion in a position from which escape was impossible , and the sweat came on my forehead . Then , to my relief , I realized that this was no lion , but a Hyena.  |p220I  think he was as much surprised and startled as I was , and for two seconds we stared at each other . Then ? and probably it is fortunate that I gathered my wits earlier than he did ? I pulled myself together and let out so loud and terrifying a yell that he turned and bolted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the memory of his face staring at me out of the darkness haunted my dreams afterwards for many nights , it did not make me love him . Subsequent meetings have confirmed and even strengthened my dislike . Now , when I have known him for thirty years , I can only say that I consider him a most repulsive animal for whom I can not find a good word to say . His appearance is distinctly against him , and his habits and character are in keeping with his appearance ? or even worse . He stands about three feet high and ( withoutmeasuring his tail ) from four to five feet long . His front legs are longer than those at the back and his head sits on big shoulders , so that he always looks as if he is standing up to make a speech ? although that is certainly not the purpose to which he puts his powerful jaws.  |p221As  to his habits and character ? well , he is , among other things , a murderer , a thief , a bully and a coward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his home there is an added and almost worse smell . He has a reputation for being bold , because he will steal into the lighted streets of towns and will trespass into camps : but he will only do that in a slinking sort of way , ready to run at the slightest alarm . And on the other hand , while he will rarely attack anything that has power to defend itself , he will always attack such things as cattle , animalsheavy with young , women far from home , native babies , young animals , and young birds of any species provided that they are too small either to peck or to fly . He eats anything that smells like flesh , from an animal-hide strap to a dead rhinoceros ; it does not matter to him how old or tainted a carcassmay be ; and he prefers to come late to a feast when someone else has done the possibly dangerous work of the kill . Scavenging is his principal business and he does it thoroughly ? as long as darkness lasts , but seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Afri/can native , because most of the tribes , instead of burying their dead , leave them in the open for him to eat : and if he can find a sick man , incapableof wielding a weapon , that is as good for him as a dead one . No , I do not like the hyena ! I like neither the look of him , nor the smell of him , nor his habits , nor the sound of him . He is a pest , and a particularly evil one at that . He is the kind of creature on whom men do not waste good bullets , because poisoned food is both more effective and more appropriate . And I , animal lover though I am , can not blame them . Once when I was far from camp , night fell too quickly for me to return , and I decided to sleep on the ground . The spot I chose was in an open plain of short grass , almost level for four miles , except where a river had bitten deep into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . When I awoke just before dawn , I saw three hyenas with meat in their mouths , slinking forward in single file towards the river . Then I saw the remains of a zebra , and I knewp223that although I had heard nothing a lion had killed only a hundred yards from where I slept . Keeping perfectly still , I watched the scene , and saw four more big hyenas coming in the opposite direction , away from the river , but towards the dead zebra , doubtless for further supplies . An eighth animal came to meet them , carrying in his teeth a big lump of flesh , and one of the returning party appeared to offer to help in the carrying . At first the offer was refused , but five minutes later I saw the hyena put down his load for the other to pick up ; and then the meat-carrier and the ex-meat-carrier disappeared together towards the river . At that I got up to look into matters more closely . There was very little left by now of the zebra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vultures , soared overhead . Going to where , a little earlier , I had seen the hyenas disappear out of sight , I found almost a beaten path leading to a rocky place riddled by many tunnels . It might have been interesting to see still farther , for undoubtedly these tunnels housed a large family of the dreadful scavengers : but I was beaten to a re/treat by the absolutely appalling stench that arose from it ? the indescribable odor of certainlynot less than eight large hyenas and doubtless many youngsters . Hyenas sometimes work in large packs , as many as twenty together , and these packs often become very dangerous and fierce . Innumerable tales could be told to bear out what I have said about this animal 's indiscriminateeating and his cowardly habit of preying upon the weak . But two must suffice . I once met a hunter whose boy ' had left outside the tent an entire collection of heads and horns which had accumulated in several days ' shooting . In the morning , all that were found were a few mangled bits of horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks of a hyena . Six years ago , I was traveling with George Outram when it became necessary for one of us to stay behind with the bullock wagons while the other went ahead . Outram volunteered to stay , but he was beset by darkness and forced to camp , the bullocks being outspanned and allowed to feed . Directly afterwards , Outramp225heard a bellow forty yards away , and on rushing to the spot he found that one of the poor beasts , unable to run or protect itself , had been set upon by a hyena , and its inside had actually been torn out of its body . The hyena can travel very fast ? indeed I have known one to keep pace beside me only nine yards away when I was on horseback and the terrified horse was going at full tilt . I have no doubt that if the horse had been without a rider it would have been attacked ; but the hyena , as I have said , likes his victims to be helpless , and therefore would not be likely to attack even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The hyena 's method of business is to prowl round in the darkness till something comes easily his way . He will wait in the backgroundwhile the lion eats the best of the dinner , and then steal in for the less appetizing remains : and even then he will flee at dawn when the vulture comes . He will prowl round a camp till all is silent and then slink forward to gather up anything that anyone has left . Often , as you camp at night , you know that the hyena is not far away . As darkness comesp226on , he draws closer , and then he lets out a wail . And as he waits you will hear him again and again , for he is not made of the stuff which is patient . As hunger grips him , you may hear his laugh ? which is certainly no laugh at all : but more probably you will hear a sound like the terrible wail of a demented person , or , when it comes not from a single animal but from a pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Till half through the night , this awful sound will rend your ears . Then suddenly it will cease ? and you will know that at last the prowling hyenas have found something to satisfy them . Amid the wailing and laughing of the hyena , you will hear also the yelps of the Jackal . This creature is very common throughout Central Africa , but although he too is a scavenger , one does not condemn him as one condemns the hyena . He is much smaller , being about the size of a fox , and there is therefore some excuse for his not tackling animals stronger than himself.  |p227And  at any rate , he does put up some show of resistance when the vultures claim the remnantsof the lion 's kill . I once watched by one of these kills and saw the hyenas and jackals devouring what they could find , and one jackal tearing off a piece of meat and hiding it thirty yards away . The vulturescame at daylight and the jackals showed fight . But while the struggle continued , one vulture discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , so that when at last the vultures triumphed and that cute little jackal consoled himself with the thought of his buried treasure , he was to suffer a sad disappointment ! In a country as hot as Africa scavenging is doubtless necessary , for pestilence would quickly spread if bones were not picked clean . It is not an occupation which excites the watcher 's admiration , but at least it seems less distasteful with the fox-like jackal than with the evil-smelling and greedy hyena.  |p231THE  Eland is the largest of the antelope and truly a magnificent creature , standing nearly six feet high , the male having a fine set of horns , spiral at the base and often nearly three feet long . In the morning you may see these beautiful and very harmless animals browsing slowly in the direction of a shady spot where , unless they are disturbed , they will rest until the heat of the day has passed . In the afternoon , they will rise , mix with such animals as the zebra and the gazelle , and feed slowly towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen in a herd , and very lovely they will look . But at the water-hole the eland will be more watchful , waiting for their neighbors to go down first and moving quickly away at thep232slightest alarm . As darkness falls , they will become more and more alert , more and more suspicious , more and more ready to bolt . For the eland share another thing besides neighborhood and company with the zebra and gazelle : they too are hunted in the night by the hungry lion . The Oryx is also food for the lion , but not nearly so often does he fall a victim , for he is well armed and able to render a good account of himself . His two horns are straight and sharp , and over three feet long , and a charging lion could be impaled upon them : indeed , I think that the lion knows the danger and respects the oryx accordingly , for although there is no doubt about the hunting , it is comparatively rare for the body of a lion-killed oryx to be found . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only seen four south of the Line , although in the north I have known herds of as many as a hundred and fifty . Seeing a big herd keeping close together , you are rather reminded ? because of their horns ? of a company of soldiers marching with fixed bayonets . ButP233more frequently you will see the oryx mixing with Grevy zebra and smaller animals . I once crouched behind a tree whilst large herds of Grevy zebra and oryx thundered past amid a cloud of dust , within a few yards of me , in a stampede-a wonderful sight , and a thrilling one , since but for the tree I should have stood a good chance of being trampled to death . The oryx is yet another animal of whom it has been said that he can live without drinking ; but here I can refute the statement , for I have watched him at a water-hole every day for a month . Doubtless , as in other cases , the legend arises from the ability of the animal occasionally to go without water for long stretches . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized when I saw two oryx arrive late one afternoon at the water-hole , obviously in the last stages of distressfrom thirst . The poor creatures came straight to the water without troubling to look to right or to left , staggered in a sort of run to the brink , and drank as if they would never stop . In the ordinary way , I think the oryx is no more prepared to remain parched than any other creature . Nor is he always even willing top234wait his turn at the water , for at a water-hole where over-fed vultures obstructed the way I have seen the oryx push them off with their horns . And the oryx will not easily leave his drinking , once he has started , before his thirst is quenched : for if , when a herd is at water , one animal gives the alarm , although the whole herd will at once thunder up the bank to safety , they will then hesitate , and look down , and if the danger does not mature they will slowly move back . I once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family instinct . A herd of oryx was wandering across an open patch of ground , when a cow dropped behind . A bull stopped , looked at her , and then began slowly to circle round her , watching every point of the compass for a possible enemy . After a time a calf was born . Still the bull kept guard , circling round and round , until at last , in less than half an hour , the little calf had managed to get on to its feet . Then the mother . and her new baby started slowly in the directiontaken by the herd , while the bull , still watchful and alert , followed behind them.  |p237THE  natives call the Gerenuk " the little giraffe , " and certainly the name is appropriate . He shares with the giraffe the quality of being almost indistinguishable against a background of bush , and indeed , if it happened that your first sight of him was when he was feeding , you would probably be sorely puzzled to know what kind of creature you were seeing . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two feet above the ground , and a moving head some three feet higher , among the bushes . When the gerenuk feeds off the leaves of a bush , he stands on his hind legs , with his forefeetresting against the slender branch : and as his forelegs are exceedingly thin , it is probablep238that they either would not be seen at all or would be confused with the thinner branches of the tree . The long streak of white is on his stomach , and that shows clearly ; but his body and his long neck , like those of the giraffe , fade easily into a background of leaves . Gerenuk are often seen in the neighborhood of the giraffe , not associating with them , but sometimes only fifty yards away . They are comparativelyscarce and do not travel in herds : usually one sees a couple , either two females or a pair , although occasionally I have noticed four at a time . They are exceedingly shy , , and when disturbedwill at once make off , with heads held forward , looking rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult either to study or to photograph ? and indeed the picture here reproduced was only obtained after a stalk that lasted for three days ! But they repay study , partly because comparatively little is known of their habits . It is generally assumed , for instance , that they do not drink anything except the dew which they find on leaves . Whether this is so or not I can not definitelyp239say , but it is a point which I should very much like to make clear , for one so often hears that a particular animal does not drink and then is able to prove that that is certainly not the case . I have spent many hours in trying to see the gerenuk at water ; and once I thought I was about to succeed . I was waiting at a water-hole well north of the Equator where giraffe drank and I knew that several gerenuk lived close by . One day , one of the little creatures came feedingsteadily towards me until he was within twenty-five yards of the water-hole . Then he stopped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it interested him or not . Feeling confident that at last I was to obtain the proof I wanted , I trained my cameraon him and waited . But alas ! The sight of the water did not lure him nearer , and in a minute or two he turned and walked quietly away . I know that when a gerenuk was shot by a man who was collecting specimens for a museumover a pint of water was found in its stomach : and I find it hard to believe that that was entirely the result of drawing dew from240the leaves of trees . So I still hope to get that picture . The Water-buck is shy . He does not make himself conspicuous like many of the animals I have described , but lives in secluded corners such as little valleys near forests and rivers , or often in small open spaces . He is a fine-looking fellow , as large as our red deer , with a curious white ring circling his neck ? a design which has originated a superstition among the natives , who will not eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomson 's Gazelle ( known to his intimates as " Tommy " ) is a pretty little creature with a rich coat of pale brown decorated with a black stripe along the flank and a patch of white underneath . He is very tame and has beautiful ' limpid eyes , which make it painful to shoot him , even for food.  |p241The  same may be said of the Grant 's Gazelle , an animal distinguished by its beautiful horns ; but he is of very little use for food as his flesh is very often infested with parasites . But I think the most atractive of all the gazelles are the Impalla . Sometimes they are seen drinking among oryx , zebra and one or two jackal , and I have photographed them among a troop of baboons crossing a glade . But for the most part these creatures feed in herds , close to other animals , but not mixing with them . Like the zebra , the impalla do a good deal of fighting amongst themselves at the waterholes , and do it with gusto ; yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightheartedanimals , for they have a delightful habit of jumping when disturbed . You may see a herd numbering anything from eight to thirty-five , sometimes entirely of one sex and sometimes of males , females and youngsters together ; and whether they be in open bush or in wooded country , you will see them jumping . Last year , coming back to camp in a car after dark , I drove within twenty yards of a smallp242herd , so that the spot-light shone upon them . And in the light of its beam they jumped backwardsand forwards ? just like a party of elfin figures dancing in the moonlight  |p245ON  any open landscape in Central Africayou will see the Common , or Grant 's Zebra , probably in large numbers . Because of his broad and bright stripes , he is singularly picturesque , and certainly his presence is desirablefrom the pictorial standpoint . I am afraid , however , that most of the white inhabitantsof Central Africa would not admit that he has any other virtue . Personally , I like him , as any photographer must . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , for he is exceedingly destructive . Sometimes a lion will chase a large herd to the edge of an estate protected by triple barbed wire , and the zebra , in their terror , will destroy the entanglement by sheer weight of numbers , uprooting stakes so that the wire falls flat . Andp246later , before the wire can be re-erected , another herd will invade the estate , eating widely and trampling what they do not eat . Consequently , the zebra is shot practically at sight . Moreover , a use has recently been found for his skin , with the result that quite a numberof people are shooting large numbers of the animal in order to sell the skins for five shillingseach . The zebra is regarded as the settler 's worst enemy , and in my opinion it is only a matter of time before this beautiful animal which now appears common will become practicallyextinct . When that happens the plains of Africa will be almost unrecognizable to anyone who knows them as they are at present . Just as one looks at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lakes , so one looks at once for the zebra on the plains ; and against the green , or on the sky-line , one sees them ? beautiful both in pattern and in outline . To study the zebra , one must go to the waterholes . In the dry season you will find a riverbed , no longer carrying a torrent , but merely a sand-bottomed chasm with rocky sides . Alongp247this sandy bed , animals will have scraped holes , some two feet deep , others six feet deep , to reach the water . Dowh to these holes will come the animals to drink : zebra , kongoni , vultures , gazelles , wildebeest , eland , baboons and many other creatures . There the observer , having built himself a hide , can watch . Suddenly he will see a single zebra come down among the rocks to the river-bed ? a scout to see that all is safe . If this pioneer finds both water and safety , the whole herd will quickly come down to drink . But sometimes he will not find sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then three or four zebra will go down the river-bed in single file , showing a great deal of caution , and two of them will scrape new holes while the others keep watch . The hidden observer will see much to interest him when once a big herd arrives . There will be numerous fights as the animals squabble for the best positions round the water-holes ; or perhapsone crusty old fellow will be seen going to each hole in succession and kicking away the other animals from the water , until one boldp248youngster will smack him in the ribs to teach him better manners . It is a curious thing that although as a rule the stripes of the zebra make him very conspicuous , some conditions of light have exactly the opposite effect , so that on more than one occasion I have failed to see a herd of twentyfiveor thirty of the animals only a hundred yards away until they moved . When zebra sight a man , they will throw up their heads and trot off , half-looking back and apparently suspicious rather than actually scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path they have just taken , instead of going on to greater safety they will come back , passing in front of the intruder , in anxiety , presumably , to reach the spot which they know to have been safe rather than having to explore the unknown distance . The Grevy Zebra is a much bigger animal than his brother , with closer and more delicate markings and beautiful fluffy ears ? a fine/looking animal in every way . Like the oryx he is not much seen south of the Equator , and even for some miles north of it he is fast disappearing . It is not disease that is the cause of this , for , strange to say , the zebra is immune from the fly and many other ills which attack somewhat similar animals . His annihilation is the act of man . If you watch at a water-hole , you will see the Grevy zebra clattering down the rocky banks , often in a great hurry , because although they are friendly with other animals , they are very anxious not to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but even amongst themselves precedence must be observed , the males drinking first , then the mothers , and the youngsters last . Sometimes a greedy youngster , trying to drink out of its turn , will receive a gentle lesson and be made to wait until its mother has finished.  |p253ANYONE  who has read M. Maeterlinck 's book , The Life of the White Ant , will realize how impossible it is to give any idea of the activities of this amazing little creature in less than a dozen pages . I can therefore do little more than refer the reader to that fascinatingbook , give one or two general statements , and then describe some of the observationswhich I have myself made . In order even to begin to understand the white ant , ' it is necessary to grasp two points . ( I ) The white ants have many enemies who could quickly exterminate them in an open fight.  |p254Therefore  they build gigantic and almost impenetrable fortresses , wherein they live a life that is entirely self-contained , only occasionallymaking sorties in force to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done by individuals , but is left to one " queen " in each fortress , who produces eggs night and day at the rate of approximately one per second . Save for the existence and operations of this " queen , " the race within a fortress would quickly become extinct : and therefore the one act of paramount importance is her maintenance coupled with the preparation of her successor . Because of the first of these two points , the termites ( as the white ants are called ) have , among the large numbers that inhabit a single fortress , workers with allotted tasks of building , food supply , etc. , and soldiers to repel invadersand to guard the workers in the event of a sortie . Within the fortress nothing is allowed to be wasted : even the dead are used as food ,  |p255and  advantage is taken of the organs within the body of each insect so that excreta can be used both for building and for nourishment . Because of the second point , the cell in which the " queen " lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the work done in connection with it forms the central purpose of that activity . Much of the structure of the fortress is designed to preserve an evenness of temperature around the " queen , " and the elaboratearchitecture of rooms and galleries is mainly constructed to avoid disturbance within the " queen 's " apartment . The fortresses of the white ants are very numerous in some parts of Central Africa , and they rise to extraordinary heights above the ground . I have actually seen one that was twenty-fivefeet high ? and to appreciate what that means , one must remember that the height of its builders is approximately one-eighth of an inch . Thus the white ants build fortresses over two thousand times their own height , a feat top256equal which man would have to construct a building of a height of two and a half miles ! Moreover , these ant-hills are impervious to rain and are so firmly constructed that I have seen an infuriated rhinoceros try to smash a small one with his horn , and fail to make an appreciable impression on it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumps of thrown-up earth which they appear to be at first sight , but are exactly designed edifices containing rooms and galleries . When we build a house , its outside appearance interestsus almost as much as its interior : but the white ant builds his fortress solely for use . He rarely goes outside it , and in any case he is blind , so that its outside does not interest him . But on the interior he lavishes a sense of design and a constructive ability which even man can hardly equal . He has contrived , too , an amazingsystem of " central heating " of which no one knows the secret . Studying these marvelous creatures is a matterof the greatest difficulty , partly because of the strength of their homes , and partly because of their immediate reaction to changes of lightp257and heat . But nothing is more interesting . On my most recent expedition to Central Africa , I selected an ant-hill that was seven feet high and began to dig into the ground by the side of it . I made a hole four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked the base of the ant-hill until at last I had cleared the central nest which lies partly below and partly above the surface of the ground . Trying to do as little damage as possible to its surroundings , I lifted the nest ( which measuredrather more than a foot each way ) , and laid it on the ground . It was constructed of what seemed to be a finer material than the fortress above it , and through it numerous oblong galleries wound among pillars . Underneathit stood smaller pillars for its support . Then I took a giant knife and split the nest horizontally , taking great care to cut only through the covering so as not to damage its occupant . With this inner chamber of a temple at last laid bare before me , I gazed upon what is perhaps the most amazing spectacle of the many marvels of insect life.  |p258I  was looking into a bare chamber with a polished floor , oval in shape , and grooved so that the upper part of the covering fitted neatly on to the base . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " queen " ? or what Maeterlinck describes as " the enormous flabby inert greasy whitish mass of the appalling idol . " She was certainly not a pleasing sight . She had a bloated , helpless look as she lay face downwards while a myriad of tiny ants appeared to inject food into the small but insatiable mouth on her insignificanthead , or stroked her greasy sides , or picked up the eggs that came incessantly from her and carried them away ; and half underneathher , attracting nobody 's attention , lay her comparatively unimportant consort . In an outer ring around this busy scene were the soldiers of the fortress ( or a few of them ) , much more powerful-looking than the workers , heads outwards and armed with enormous pincersattached to their heads , ready to defend the mother of their race . Even as I watched the extraordinary scene , the " queen " began to show signs of a distress which was probably shared by all the smallerp259ants , for as I have said these creatures are peculiarlysusceptible to alterations either of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nest and replaced the whole in the space under the ant-hill from which I had taken it . And at the same time I carefully returned about a hundred ants who had strayed into open country through the hole . But that certainly did not end the adventure , either for me or for the white ants . No sooner was the nest restored , than an investigationwas made by its owners of the amount of the damage done to the galleries and other parts , and immediately an army of workers appeared and began to mend the gaps and to seal up those of the galleries which could not quickly be joined to the parts that ran into the rest of the ant-hill . Necessarily , the damageI had done to those galleries had been considerable : and yet in less than half an hour that part of the restoration was accomplished . There remained , of course , much for the ants to do . Everything had to be put to rights , and even the great hole which I had dug had to be filled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . No doubt it was partly the question of temperature which made matters so urgent ; but there was also another reason for haste , as I was very shortly to discover . Shortly before dusk , I left the hill for about an hour . When I returned , I found the fortress threatened with disaster . A large army of safari ants , the white ants ' hereditary enemies , had discovered the great breach in the fortifications and had launched a big attack with the idea of penetrating into the citadel . Numerous white ant soldiers , some with the pincer weapon which I have described and others armed with a sort of syringe through which they appeared to squirt what must have been the equivalent of poison gas , were defending the breach , literally with their backs to the wall ? or to the hole in the wall . Isolated battles between detached parties were in progress , but the main assault of the safari ants was clearly pressing back the defenders , so that very soon the white ants ' fortresswould have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no possibleright on my side , who had made that  |p261breach  and brought war and almost certain destructionto the white ants . So there was only one thing to be done , and I did it quickly . I entered the war myself on behalf of the white ants , coming up in the nick of time like the Prussian Army at Waterloo . I demonstrated the superiority in battle of the tank over the infantryman : and very soon the attacking army , or the remnant of it , was routed . Then I looked into the fortress , to see in what state the defenders were left . To my surpriseI discovered that all the time the battle had been in progress , the workers , behind the backs of the army , had gone steadily on with their task , so that a new layer of cemented wall already covered the bottom of the hole . Never , I think , have I watched anything so interesting as those hundreds of ants rebuilding their ramparts . It is a fact that the white ant is blind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of eyes unimportant . Each ant , bringing a morsel of material , knew exactly where to lay it down , and each knew by what route to reach his own position . By the morning a quarter of the gap was265THERE are several species of the Mongoosein Africa , all of which I have met . The white-tailed variety is comparatively large and not so very often seen . His color is gray and he has a long white tail . It is said that when bitten by a snake he rushes off to eat some herb which acts as an antidote : but I know of a case in which a white-tailed mongoosefought a deadly snake and was bitten twice before he succeeded in killing it and subsequentlydevouring it ? and he took no notice of his wounds , from which he had no ill-effects . The common mongoose is seen much more frequently . Sometimes as you approach the mound of earth in which he lives , he will see you thirty yards away and take cover in a great hurry ; but at other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within twelve yards of him when he was hunting without his being able to spare me a thought . He lives mainly on snakes and other small creatures , but I have photographed him nibbling at meat on the leg of a zebra after the scavengers had finished with a lion 's kill . The dwarf mongoose is my favorite : a jolly little chap with some cheeky tricks which rather remind me of those of the rock rabbit . On my last trip I came across a family of the dwarfs living , as this species often does , in a disused ant-hill . Directly they saw me , they bolted for home and disappeared . I waited for ten minutes , and then a head bobbed up , to be instantly withdrawn . Five minutes later , anotheryoungster took a peep . Then the mother looked out , and at last everyone became interested in me and confidence began to grow , until eventually two of the youngsters came right out and ran into the grass . That , apparently , was regarded as much too dangerous a place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and brought them scuttling back in a great hurry . But Ip267continued to keep very still in order to convince the family of my utter harmlessness , and again a feeling of confidence set in so that a lot more peeping was done , two o , f the little animalssqueezing their heads out of the mouth of a hole at the same time . By the time an hour had passed , father and mother had apparently agreed that after all I could hardly be as terribleas I looked , so that the whole family ? seven in number ? came out on to the ant-hill and the grass in front of me . The Rock Rabbit is such an amusing little fellow ; looking so much like a toy animal with a furry coat , that I always feel that he ought to run out to greet me as I approach his home , and ask to be picked up and petted . But he never does that . On the contrary , a sentinel stays continually on the watch for intruders ; and directly a warning is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of this habit , have never been able to locate him ; and I must say that thoughp262filled . By the second morning , the hole was only half its original size . Unfortunately I could not stay to see the operation completed ; but I trust that all was done before the army of attackers reappeared in greater strength . Such a scene as this arouses a hundred questionswhich are as yet unanswerable . What is the white ant 's sixth sense ? What controlling force regulates the actions of these workers and soldiers ? Did the ants rebuild their fortress out of a common instinct ? Are they free or slaves ? Is the wonderful design of their house a matter of chance , of instinct , or of thought ? It may be that one day some , at any rate , of these mysteries will be solved . For the present we can but watch ? and wonder.  |p29of  the lioness 's path . No ; quite clearly it was n't a game that could last forever . Sooner or later the lioness ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , unless by good fortunemy companions should arrive in time . Imagine then my relief ( for after all even the most ardent of animal lovers would draw the line at being eaten ) when on taking anothercautious peep over the top of the grass I failed to see even one of those five lions ! A minute before , they had been well within a hundred yards of me ; now they were completely out of sight . My heart gave a leap of sheer joy . But then doubt came . Did it follow that the lions were no longer there , merely because I could not see them ? Might not they too have sunk into the grass and even now be creepingcloser and closer ? Was n't it much more likely that the grass hid all five of those lions and that in another minute they would be withincharging distance ? Hurriedly , I lowered my head and , now without much care or caution , began once more to retreat . Suddenly I heard a new sound from a newP30quarter , and with renewed hope I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends . When these reinforcements came up , we went straight for the place where I had last seen the lions , but there was not a sight of them . Obviously , they must have stopped and have hidden in the grass as my friends drew near , and even as we all went forward they must have still been in the grass within a couple of hundred yards of us : yet we saw nothing . We went on , searching but seeing no sign , down into a Tiollow and up the slope of the farther ridge ; and then , as we looked again over the plain , we saw all five of the lions leisurely going along whilst a number of zebra and kongoni spread out to let them pass through . This incident illustrates also the fact that the lion is always an uncertain factor . You do not know in any given circumstances what he will do . He follows no rules . You never know when you can safely approach him , any more than you know when a lion will regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a distance , when he will come forward forp31a closer inspection of you , or even when he will attack . You can not distinguish a man-eater from a non-man-eater for certain until you are on the ground and he , with teeth bared , is above you . You can not even be sure that a lion which has never touched human flesh never will touch it . The behavior of a hungry lion will be quite different from that of one who is well fed , and the conduct of a lioness with cubs will be different from that of one without . And just as you can not tell by sight whether or not a lion is hungry , neither can you safely be certain whether or not a lioness is accompanied by cubs , for they may be hidden in the grass or bushes . A friend of mine once came within sixty yards of a lioness standing by herself near a small bush . He was prepared to take his chances with one lion but he was shy of a family , and he looked carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making up his mind that there was no doubt about it . Yet he was wrong . Out from under a bush into the grass came two cubs ; and out of slightly longer grass behind the bush came the old male lion . A lion in one district will not behave neces-P38lioness ) is cunning in his methods of attack . As a rule one or other of the two animals will act rather like a " beater , " prowling to and fro with terrifying grunts which scare the prey so that it runs almost into the jaws of the other . And sometimes , where three paths lead to a waterhole , excreta will be dropped across two of the paths so that the animals , scenting it , will fear the presence of lion and will go by the third path ? where the lion crouches in wait for them . There are many stories as to how he kills his prey , and it is usually thought that he springs suddenly and silently from the side on to the animal 's back , putting his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other catches the creature 's nose and with a quick jerk forces back the head , breaking the neck instantly . But no one knows this for certain , since the lion nearly always kills at night , when observation is difficult . Twice I have seen the kill , but neither time could I see with certainty how it was done . In any case , the animal has no chance of escapewhen once the lion has got his hold . NowP39and then you will see a zebra or a giraffe with terrific scars , and you will know that it has been attacked by a lion and has lived to show the marks : in these cases the animal in its terror has probably jumped at the moment of the spring , so that the lion has failed to land fully across its body . Once I saw a zebra with the signs of terrible wounds right down its hind-quarters . I can picture that scene : the lion springing , and the zebra starting at that very moment to run ? the lion falling so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hind feet landed on the ground ? and then the zebra , maddened by terror and pain , lashing out with its hoofs and probably striking the lion a terrible blow in the stomach , so that he let go his hold ? and finally the badly-wounded zebra making for safety as fast as loss of blood would allow it . But it is rare for such an incident to occur . Far , far more often the lion 's hunting will succeed , and in a minute or two the lion and lioness , with very likely other members of their troop , will be tearing at the carcass . It has been calculatedthat one lion will probably kill as many as three hundred animals in a year , and he will@@1560.txtp100No northern snail fills the place held by T. ligulata at , for instance , La Jolla .

Most snails retract into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemy , the hermit crab . No sudden danger finds him napping , for he can retreat and advance a dozen times while Tegula is doing so once . This animal and expanded specimens of the giant moon snails ( ? 252 ) are good for exhibition to whoever still believes that snails are mostly shell. ? 138 . A polyclad flatworm , Leptoplana acticola , has already been mentioned ( ? 17 ) as an inhabitant of the upper tide pools . Along the central California coast , the polyclads are not abundant in the lower tide pools , but in the south it is under rocks in this lowest zone that they will be found ? two of them , both probably unidentified , very commonly , and others occasionally . One of them we think of , for lack of any other name , as the " pepper and salt " flatworm . The other is an orange-red form . Two others , somewhat less common but more striking , have papillated furry backs and affix themselves to the rocks by means of suckers on their undersides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown form , up to 1/ " long . The second of them , probably a new species of Thysanozoon , the " scarf dancer , " is not an impressive sight when found attached by its sucker and huddled up on the under side of a rock , but when it stretches itself to get under way in the clear water of a tide pool it presents a different picture . It is brilliantly colored and swims gracefully , undulating the margins delicately but effectively , and justifying its name . The people about Naples , Dr. Heath says , call the Thysanozoon there the " skirt dancer . " Collectors who procure any of these undetermined forms will do well to preserve them carefully in six per cent formalin for forwarding to a specialist at present working with Pacific-coast polyclads. ? 139 . The most common habitat of nemerteans , or ribbon worms , is in the mud of bays and estuaries , so they are considered in some detail in that section ( ? 312 ) . However , a good many forms , some of them large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly open coast , and therefore require mention here . The most conspicuousof these , and indeed one of the most striking of all intertidal animals , is Micrura verrilli ( Pl . XXII ) , whose body is vividly banded with sparkling lavender and white . It may be up to 12 " long , and ranges from Alaska to Monterey Bay , but unfortunately occurs not very frequently . Paranemertes peregrina , purple or brown with white under side , is commoner , ranging from the Commander Islandsp101(Alaska) to southern California , in length up to 6 inches . Near the Big Sur , and at Laguna , La Jolla , and Ensenada , we have found a long , stringy , pinkish nemertean we take to be Cephalothrix major . Its slightly flattened body is only about 1/i6 " wide , but it reaches a length of 4 ' and is comparatively strong . The mouth is set back some 2 " from the tip of the head , and this two-inch portion is cylindrical . Still another rocky-shore form is Lineus vegetus , known from Pacific Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " long , brown in color , with numerous encircling lighter lines . In contractionthe body coils in a close spiral . This nemertean has been the subject of some interesting regeneration experiments reported in ? 312 . A good many other forms may occur , most of which will be found treated in Coe 's papers , but some unfortunately seem to be still undescribed . The brilliant Carinella rubra ( ? 239 ) of quiet waters will be turned up here occasionally. ? 140 . Some of the bryozoa have been treated previously , so that the collector who has come with us this far will recognize several common encrustations under the rocks as belonging to this group . Eurystomella bilabiata ( Pl . XXIII ) is characteristically old-rose coloredand always encrusts flatly on stones and discarded shells . A close examination even with the naked eye reveals much loveliness , but the esthetic appeal is much enhanced , as with other bryozoa , by the use of a binocular microscope or even a ten-power hand lens . Schizoporella insculpta ( Pl . XXIII and Fig. 52a ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation on sticks . When encrusting under rocks it may have an apparent thickness of several layers , rolled over at the margin . The living zooids of both these bryozoa can be seen , in fresh live colonies taken during the winter or spring , with the lowest power of a compound microscope . One of the so-called corallines , Phidolopora pacifica ( Fig. 52b ) , is a bryozoancolony . Small lacy clusters of this latticed calcareous form are not uncommon under rocks in the south . The large colonies , up to a size that would make a double handful , can be got by dredging only ' . Bilabiata ranges from the Queen Charlotte Islands to Pacific Grove , insculpta from Sitka to Pacific Grove ( and on to southern California as a subtidal form ) , and pacifica from Puget Sound to southern California . Attached forms include also the encrusting red sponges mentioned in ? 32 , some of which are more at home in this deep littoral than further up . One , Esperiopsis originalis , brownish red , not even remotely resembling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely occurs higher up . it encrusts the under sides of stones , but occurs also in crevices . A hard and pearly white encrusting form , thin and smooth , Xesto/spongia vanilla , characteristic of the entire Pacific coast , looks like cake frosting . The very lumpy , hemispherical , bright orange , woodyfiberedTethya aurantia may be taken at Carmel , far down in rocky crevices or on the under sides of rocks . If detached , the base with its radiating core structure should be noted ; this is diagnostic ; there is nothing else even slightly like it in the tide pools . This is a cosmopolitanform , almost worldwide in distribution , and more abundant than might be supposed at first glance , since many specimens are overgrown with green algae. ? 141 . Although the southern California cucumber , Stichopus parvimensis , has been treated ( ? 77 ) as a protected rock animal , it often occurs , especially when a low tide comes in the heat of the day , in the under-rock habitat . North of central California the white Cucumariaquinquesemita occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common in sheltered waters such as Puget Sound ( ? 235 ) . Thyonepsolus nutriens , a small , red , flattened cucumber that is remarkable for carrying its young on its back , is occasionally found in the Monterey region . Strangely , however , central California , a region otherwise very fecund , has no shore cucumbers comparable in abundance with Stichopus in the south or Cucumaria miniata in the north . Presumably more efficient animals just happen to have crowded them out . Another viviparous holothurian ( cucumber ) , red with white under side , is the small Thyone rubra . Either of these may come to light in the examination of kelp roots. ? 142 . A definite form of the starfish Pisaster giganteus , called capitatus ( Pl . XXIII ) , is a not uncommon under-rock member of the southern California fauna . It is by no means gigantic , despite its name , being usually smaller than the common Pisaster ochracear , and is certain to be taken for a different species even by collectors familiar with the typical P. giganteus of Monterey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it differs in habitat , shape , and color , as well as in size . The few spines are large , stumpy , and vividly colored a slaty purple on a background of ocher . The northern recorded range is about San Luis Obispo , and we have taken it as far south as Ensenada . With it may be taken an occasional Astrometis ( ? 72 ) or small Patiria ( ? 26 ) , most of the southern representatives of the latter species being stunted and limited to the under-rock habitat. ? 143 . The pistol shrimp , Crangon dentipes ( Pl .. XXIII ) , may be taken from under rocks in the lower extremity of the rocky intertidal and from the sponges and bryozoa growing in kelp holdfasts. l ! alikethe good children of a past generation , it is more often heard than seen . Very often the collector will hear the metallic clicking of these shrimps all around him without being able to see a single speci-P103men and , unless he is quick and industrious , without being able to take one . Captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause excitement if his captor is inexperienced . It is hard to believe , on hearing the inevitable sound for the first few times , that the jar has not been violently cracked . This startling sound is made by the animal 's snapping a thumb against the palm of the big claw , the suddenness of the force applied being made possible by a trigger-like device at the joint . Any attempt at a close investigation of the operation is likely to result in the investigator being left in possession of the detached claw , the denuded shrimp retiring to grow himself a new snapper . What purpose this snapping accomplishes , unless it frightens enemies , it is difficult to guess . Crangon is a rather cosmopolitan species in northern tropic regions , and occursalso , for some unknown reason , as far north as San Francisco , extending southward on this coast to Cape San Lucas . In similar environments the colorful shrimp Spirontocaris ( ? 150 ) of several species may be seen . Amphipods and isopods of several types occur , but none seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specialist. ? 144 . Two " soft corals " ( Alcyonaria ) occur , most amazingly for deep-water forms , along Pacific-coast rocky shores even where there is some surf . From La Jolla south , one of them , probably a species of Clavularia ( Fig. 53 ) , is present in the very low-tide zone along the sides of rocks just where they are buried in the substratum , or on the bottoms of rocks . Typically there is a brown , ribbon-like stolon , which is not easy to detach , networked on the under surface of the stone , with cartridge-like polyps / " or so high in contraction headed up from the stolon . Expanded ( and they expand readily in aquaria ) , the polyps may be high , spreading eight feathery tentacles . Because this typically alcyonarian polyp is abundant , easy to get , and hardy , it should be useful for experimental work . We have found it most abundantly in Todos Santos Bay , north of Ensenada . This is the animal which has been considered , at Laguna Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known from several hundred fathoms in Monterey Bay and that is related to a West Indian Telesto which may grow more than a foot tall , occurring on shallow bottoms like eelgrass . Miss Deichmann , however , refers it probablyto Clavularia , in spite of the resemblance of the polyps to those of our deep-water Telesto . In Monterey Bay there is a form similar to the Clavularia whichp104Dr . Hickson has very kindly identified for us as another and new species of Clavularia . , It is white , clustered like a tunicate , and certainlydifferent from the first-mentioned form . Both of these are related to the tropical pipe-organ corals seen in museums , but resemblethem in neither appearance nor habitat . Limited observation has failed to indicate any outstanding differencebetween the substratum faunae of the middle and lower tide pools . The ghost shrimps and blind gobies treated as substratumanimals in the middle tide-pool zone belong more properly here , but are considered in the higher association because the collectorwill find them there first. ? 145 . A larger and handsomer sipunculid , or peanut worm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XXIV ) , rich brown in color and having long plumed tentacles . It is this or a related species which is illustrated in Plate XXIV . The fully contractedspecimens , as taken from their under-rock burrows , will usually flower out very beautifully if allowed to remain undisturbedin a dish of fresh sea water placed in subdued light . Dendrostomamay be taken as far north as Monterey Bay , where it occurs in the lowest reaches of the intertidal zone , but a related species , D. zostericolum ( described as zostericola ) , occurs in some abundance at La Jolla and in northern Lower California under rocks and eelgrass . At the present writing , however , the animal is unaccountablyscarce . Our last three collecting trips into Mexico ( duringthe winter and spring of 1930 ) netted only a few specimens , although we specifically hunted the animal . Quite possibly the deep substratum under-rock Dendrostoma , of southern California and below , belongs to still a third species , pyroides , since it is thus ecologicallylimited , while zostericolum occurs in the matted roots of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the usual narcotization methods fail for some of the sipunculids : " the retractor muscles retainingtheir viability even after decay has set into parts of the softer tissue . " New light has recently been shed on this extraordinary vitality by Peebles and Fox , who report that experimentally treated D. zostericolum lived in evacuated Nujol connected to a 15 2W ' vacuum line for three days , and for more than a week in similarly conditioned sea water . It was determined that they could lose 43 per cent of their moisture content through desiccation , or 40 per cent of their total weight , without dying . One of the conclusions was top105the effect that the worms possess an oxidizing ( metabolic ) system with a higher reducing potential than the methylene blue which was used as the most delicate chemical indicator available , since living animals stained with this dye decolorized it after all the free oxygen had been used up , the color returning as soon as fresh oxygen was introduced . Specimens of this type live in the sometimes putrefying matter at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand through their intestines for the sake of the contained nutriment. ? 146 . The mantis shrimp , Pseudosquilla lessonii ( Fig. 54 ) , is a shrimp-like crustacean up to 3 " long , related to the mantis shrimp ( Squilla ) of Europe and the southeastern coast of the United States . It is a strictly southern form , not occurring north of Point Conception , and living so deep in the substratum beneath the lowest intertidalrocks that probably none but the most ardent collector will find it . When he does find it he is likely to be rewarded for his labor by so severe a nip that he will be glad to let it go immediately . The nip will have been delivered by a unique instrument quite different from the plier-like claw of a crab . The . last segment of the great claw has a row of sharp curved hooks which are forced , by muscular contraction , into sockets in the next segment . Thus if the animal lacks the sheer strength of a crab it compensates with greater mechanicalefficiency . Other mantis shrimps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find them , but it is safe to assume that their habitat does not differ greatly from that of Pseudosquilla . The similar Chloridella polity is known to occur even as far north as Monterey ay ( from one dredging record ) , but although the National Museum reports no occurrence in less than twenty-nine fathoms , this is probablyone of the forms dug occasionally by enthusiastic shore collectors in the Laguna ? La Jolla region . In such environments also , along the San Mateo County shore , occasional gigantic annelids ( up to several feet long ) will be dug out , Nereis bra.ndti ( ? 164 ) , probably the largest polychaet on the coast , in appearence similar to the mussel worm illustrated in Plate XXVI. ? 147 . Where the substratum is formed of stiff clay , packed hard enough to provide attachment for sessile animals , any of several pholids , or boring clams , may occur , their sometimes highly colored siphons protruding from their burrows . The smallest of the lot is Pholadidea ovoidea ( Fig. 55 ) , with a cleancut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tubercles . It ranges from the Bering Sea to the Gulf of California . Pholadidea penita ( ? 242 ) , the form that bores in concrete also , is a bit larger ? a littlep106larger than a man 's thumb ? and has a longer shell with leathery flaps or lips at the siphon end . Saxicava pholadis ( Pl . XXIII ) , a nestler , with red-tipped siphons , is chunky , often distorted , and ranges from the Arctic to Panama . The same plate shows Platyodon cancellatus , a relative of the soft-shelled clam Mya , which may honeycombwhole banks of stiff blue clay and is undoubtedly a factor in the disintegration of certain shores . On a recent trip to Santa Cruz we found a tremendous chunk of clay , weighing many tons , that had been broken off and up-ended by the waves which were slowly pounding it to pieces . Hundreds of these boring clams were being exposed and killed by this process of disintegration ? a process that they themselves had undoubtedly started . A few specimens of this species , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been found in low-grade concrete piles in Los Angeles Harbor . Another species , a giant red-siphoned form ( probably Parapholas californica ) , is abundant at Santa Cruz , but we have never succeeded in taking a specimen because of its occurrence on outer reefs where the continual surf makes the prolonged labor of digging out so large an animal impossible . A smaller species occurring with Parapholasin stiff blue clay is apparently Barnea Pacifica , although it is reputedly a mud-borer . After these forms have completed their burrows their muscle feet degenerate and the shell closes over them , in contrast with Zirfaea 0305 ) , which remains active throughout its life . The boring methods of the pholids are considered in ? 242 . The discarded burrows of dead borers furnish safe and comfortablehomes for various smaller animals . Among them are likely to be the crab , Pachycheles 0318 ) , and others ? the flatworm , Stylochoplana0243 ) , and the button shell , Gadinia reticulata . The latter ( Fig. 56 ) looks like a small limpet , but has lungs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snail. ? 148 . In the pools at the lowest tide level there is a wealth of life . Most of the individuals occur in other situations as well and are treated elsewhere , but some of the larger animals are entirely free-swimming and essentially pool inhabitants . Only by the rarest accidents are they stranded high and dry . The famous spiny lobster , Panulirus interruptus ( Pl . XXIV ) , which so often meets the fate of the innocent oysters that accompanied the Walrus and the Carpenter , belongs in this group . It is chiefly a subtidal form , but it so oftenP107allows itself to be trapped in pools that it may at least be said to have shore-loving tendencies . Our spiny lobster lacks the pinching claw of its Atlantic relative , but is nevertheless perfectly capable of making its own way in a world that is hostile , cruel , and unco-operative . Unless captured with a spear or trap it has a good chance to evade the path that leads to mayonnaise and seasoning . If taken with bare hands it snaps its broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to intimidate its captor , possibly driving home some of its spines . To prevent the extermination of the species by continual commercialfishing , the females under 1072 " in length and over 16 " are protected by law , the reason for the maximum being that the largest females lay the most eggs ? possibly as many as half a million at one time . The " leaf-body " larvae are delicate feathery creatures which seem to consist mainly of two large eyes , the rest of the body being highly transparent . After the larval and intermediate stages the lobster continues to grow , like the crabs , by a series of moults . The moulted shell is left in such perfect condition that it may easily be mistaken for a live animal . Spiny lobsters are omnivorous feeders ? almost anything will do , plant or animal , fresh or decayed ? and are themselves preyed upon by octopi and large fish , particularly the jewfish . They move by walking ? forward , sideways , or backward ? or propel themselves stern first through the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely southern form not authentically known north of Point Conception but occurring far down into Mexico . A similar lobster occurs off the Florida coast , where it is known as the Florida crayfish. ? 149 . Another enlivener of southern tide pools is the vividly gold Garibaldi , a fish known to science as Hypsypops rubicundus . Vertebrates have scant place in this account , as an adequate treatment of fish alone would require a separate book , but the Garibaldi is too common and too obvious to omit entirely . Another fish that merits passing mention is variously known as the tide-pool sculpin , the Rockpool Johnny , and Oligocottus vnaculosus . It is a small fish with a sharply tapering body , a large ugly head , and large pectoral tins . It is red-brown and prettily marked. ? 150 . A number of shrimps may sometimes be common in the lower pools . They are members of the common genus Spirontocaris , " broken back " shrimps , having the characteristic of bending their tails suddenly under and forward and thus swimming backwards . The Spirontocaris to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent ; to Monterey . S. palpator ranges from San Francisco to Magdalena Bay and S. cristata ( ? 278 ) from Sitka to San Diego , but almost invariably subtidally or in eelgrass in quiet water . Less commonly , any of half a dozen others may be found , S. taylori in the south and notably S. brevisrostris ( not illustrated ) . This large and beautiful white shrimp has been reported from Alaska , and it ranges at least as far south as the area between Carmel and the Big Sur , for we have found it there in some quantity , under rocks in pools where the water is very pure . The typical littoral specimens , however , are smaller than the large and robust " bastard " shrimps of the Alaska shrimp dredgers . These shrimps show a great variety of brilliant coloring which makes them conspicuous in a white tray but very difficult to see against the colorful background of a tide pool . There is no ready way of distinguishing the various species , reference to exact anatomicaldescriptions being the only method . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of Crago and Pandalus ( ? 283 ) may be trapped occasionally in the pools , but these must be regarded as rare visitors from another habitat. ? 151 . Some of the rhythms in nature are today as completely baffling as they have been since first they were observed . The palolo worm of the tropical seas near Samoa , living the year round in coral burrows at the sea bottom , for instance , is an entirely reliable calendar . To quote from an excellent English work , The Seas , by Russel and Yonge : " But true to the very day , each year the worms come to the surface of the sea in vast swarms for their wedding dance . This occurs at dawn just for two days in each of the months , October and November , the day before , and the day on which the moon is in its last quarter ; the worms are most numerous on the second day , when the surface of the ocean appears covered with them . Actually it is not the whole worm that joins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially modified to carry the sexual products . On the morning of the great day each worm creeps backwards out of its burrow , and when the modified half is fully protruded it breaks off and wriggles to the surface , while the head end of the worn shrinks back into its hole . The worms are several inches in length , the males being light brown and ochre in colour and the female* greyish indigo and green . At the time of spawning the sea becomes discoloured all around by the countless floating eggs . " The natives are always ready for the spawning swarms as theyP109relish the worms as food . The worms are eaten either cooked and wrapt up in bread-fruit leaves , or quite un-dressed . When cooked they are said to resemble spinach , and taste and smell not unlike fresh fish 's roe . " All of which is far from home but not entirely disconnected , for we have at least two similar annelid worms on the Pacific coast . One is Odontosyllis phosphorea , whose swarming periods have been plotted at Departure Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see them , for except in their brief periods of sexual maturity , when they appear at night in countless hordes , not a single specimen is to be found . In the tide pools of the California coast a smaller form , only a fraction of an inch in length , is more common than the above . At dusk they may be seen swimming actively at the surface of pools , appearingas vivid pinpoints of phosphorescence . The inevitable question with regard to such animals is : How do they know when the moon has reached a certain stage in a certain one of the thirteen lunar months ? The obvious answer would seem to be that they do not , but govern their swarming time according to tides , which , in turn , are governed by the moon . Unfortunately this answer will not hold . The tides are governed not by the moon alone but by the sun and more than half a hundred additional factors . To suppose that the worms can take all of these factors into consideration passes the bounds of credulity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spawned naturally at the usual times , although they had no means of sensing what the state of the tide might be . We are driven , then , back to the moon as the undoubted stimulus for their spawning , and confronted with a mystery beside which any of SherlockHolmes ' problems seem pale and insipid . Nor are such worms as these the only sea animals that follow amazing cycles . The grunion ( ? 192 ) is , if possible , an even more startling example .. ? 152 . The occasional sandy pools found rarely between rock outcroppingsa few feet apart , as at Carmel , more frequently along the outer coast of Washington , as at Queets and Mora , may be characterized by the cosmopolitan Boccardia natrix ( formerly Polydora californica ) , the commonest spionid worm on the coast , extending from Bering Sea to the Straits of Magellan , its two minute elongate tentacles protruding from the substratum . Here in these pools also will be found a few young edible crabs , Cancer magister , which strayinto the intertidal from deeper sandy bottoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that sportsmen vary their capture of razor clams on open sandy beaches with profitable excur/sions into these rockbound , sandy pools . As a commercial product , the life history of magister is known . The average life span is about eight years , the maximum ten ; specimens do not become sexually mature probably until the fourth or fifth year. ? 153 . A collector having sufficient strength and enthusiasm will find much of interest in pulling up , at extreme low tide , the holdfasts of various algae , or large clumps of eelgrass , roots and all . In a typical large holdfast or root he will find hundreds of individuals of dozens of different species . Nemerteans and occasional nestling clams live in the inner parts , while bryozoa , hydroids , sponges , tunicates , small anemones , holothurians 0141 ) , and chitons cover the outside. * Crawling over and through this living mass are hordes of snails , hermits , crabs , brittle stars , starfish , amphipods , and isopods.f Here is a perfect little self-sufficient universe , all within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holdfast inhabitants of various regions has been suggested as an index of richness for comparing different areas . Most of the forms occurring thus in the Pacific have been consideredin connection with other habitats . The few that do not occur elsewhere are forms so small as to fall outside the scope of this work , but if only for the sake of renewing a large number of old acquaintancesthe collector will find holdfasts and roots worth investigating . P111PRESUMABLY because of their usually limited extent , the sandy beaches of the protected outer coast are the most barren of all intertidalareas . They occupy a strange position , biologically speaking . They are distinct , on the one hand , from the typical Pacific sandy beach , which is completely exposed and subjected to violent surf but nevertheless supports a highly specialized fauna , although it is neither abundant nor greatly varied . In closed bays , sounds , and sloughs , on the other hand , we find the completely protected sandy beaches supporting a fauna both rich and varied . No doubt the total area availablefor colonization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for characteristic animals will not develop for a type of region that is represented by small and widely separated areas only , like the sandy beaches in question . Such beaches ordinarily occur in short stretches of a few hundred yards or a few miles , between outcroppings of rock , and are almost destitute of life . It might reasonably be asked why such areas are not colonized by the animals from surf-swept beaches ; the answer is , apparently , that the animals of surf-swept beaches will not tolerate the more sheltered conditions . The same answer , reversed , would apply to completely protected bay animals , for whom these areas would be too exposed . At any rate , barrenness is the rule , and we have but three animals to record from the semi-sheltered sandy beaches , ignoring those forms which may occasionally be washed up from other habitats. ? 154 . A giant beach hopper , Orchestoidea corniculata , is successfulin this barren environment , possibly because it lives high up , avoidingthe " old devil sea " to which it belongs . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at night to feed on decaying seaweed and storm wrack . Occasionally , however , it may be found during the day under piles of seaweed . This beach flea is probably the chief scavenger of the semi-protected beaches . When the waves bring it nothing it must find the food supply rather scanty unless , as is suspected , it turns with equal gusto to detritus originating on land . In appearance it is very similar to a still larger related hopper of surfsweptbeaches ( ? 185 ) , but its antennae are not so long . Smallwood , who has worked with an East-coast beach flea that is similar in form and habitat to our Orchestoidea , believes that the animals ' reactions to light do not account for their nocturnal habits , butp112that keeping out of sight in the daytime is simply a protection against birds. ? 155 . A second and much smaller beach hopper , Orchestoidea benedicti , is the only animal from the surf-swept beaches that is at home here as well . Unlike the larger hoppers , it can be found at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory unless its size or flavor are protective factors. ? 156 . So deep down as to be chiefly a subtidal form , especially where the sand is firm , with an admixture of detritus , but sometimes to be seen from the shore , is a lugworm that belongs more properly in the mud flats of protected bays ( Arenicola , ? 310 ) . It is a burrowinganimal that breathes by keeping two entrances open to the surface . About one of them characteristic castings of sand will be noticed . On these barren beaches it occurs , so far as we have observed , only where rocky outcrops divert the surf in such a way as to induce the depositionof some silt ? the situation to be expected , since the worm feeds by eating the substratum and extracting therefrom the contained organic matter.  |p115ALONG  the surf-swept open coast , the rocky cliffs of the ineptly named Pacific have developed associations of animals with phenomenal stayingpowers and endurance of wave shock . It is not the fact that these animals will not live elsewhere that makes them characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerate the rigorous conditions of heavy surf . Obviously the prime requisites here are the ability to hold on in the face of breaking waves and the possession of structures fit to resist the sudden impact of tons of water . Hence the development of the tough skins and heavy shells generally present , the strong tube feet of starfish , and the horny hairs by which mussels are attached . At first blush it seems amazing that in this surf-swept environment the same animals should occur almost unchanged all the way from Sitka to Point Conception ( a few miles west and north of Santa Barbara ) , for the long intervening stretch of coast works an irregular traverse across twenty-two and a half degrees of latitude ? across most of the North Temperate Zone . This range seems less remarkablewhen we consider that conditions are actually very uniform . Along the California coast there is an upwelling of relatively cold water such that the resulting water temperature is lower than would be expected considering the latitude , and in the north the Kuro Shiwo , the warm Japan Current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitude , with the result that the waters along the outside coast of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska are very nearly as warm as those along the California coast as far south as Point Conception . Also the summer-winter variation in the temperature of the water is one of only a few degrees . The water is almost constantly agitated , and throughout the Sitka to Point Conception range there are great depths close offshore and correspondingly uniform oceanic Conditions . Finally , even the weather is relatively uniform along this immense coast line , fogs and cool weather being the rule , with no great peaks of heat or cold.  |p116Perha|ps  a word of warning is in order here . Especially from centralCalifornia northward such completely exposed rocky points as are considered in the first part of this division are very dangerous places . It has been stated that in some regions any person within twenty feet of the water , vertically , is in constant danger of losing his life , and every year the newspapers report , with monotonous regularity , the deaths of people who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such loss of life is usually as unnecessaryas it is regrettable . To lie down and cling to the rocks like a starfish and let a great wave pour over one takes nerve and a cool head , but more often than not it is the only sane course of action . To run , unless the distance be very short , is likely to be fatal . As is likely to be the case with mundane hazards , the danger from surf largely disappears when its force is recognized and respected ; hence no one need be deterred by it from examining the animals on exposed points , always bearing in mind that a brief wetting is better than a permanent one . When collecting at the base of cliffs , we always keep handy a rope made fast at the top of the cliff . The force of the waves on stretches of completely open coast is so great that animals up near the high-tide line are wetted by spray on all but the lowest tides . Consequently there is not the relatively sharp zonation that we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly well distributed throughout the intertidal zone . Accordingly we shall depart somewhat from our usual method and shall treat these wide-ranging animals first , taking up the more definitelyzoned animals later. ? 157 . The most conspicuous of the open-coast animals is Pisaster ochraceus ( Pl . XXV ) , sometimes popularly called the purple starfish but more properly the common starfish ? an animal distinctly different from the common starfish of the Atlantic . Specimens varying f r in 6 " to 14 " in diameter and having three color phases ? brown , purple , and yellow ? are commonly seen on exposed rocks from Sitka to Point Sal ( near Point Conception ) . In the warmer waters below that pint a subspecies , segnis , extends at least to Ensenada . Up to one per cent of the pisasters seen between northern Californiaand Monterey Bay will be the more delicate and symmetrical P. giganteus ( Pl . XXVI ) , with beautifully contrasting colors ( which are lacking in ochraceus ) on and surrounding the spines . This starfishis improperly named , as the average specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the species was originally named from a particularly large specimen which was assumed to be typical . Pisaster neither has nor seems to need protective coloration . Anp117thing that can damage this thoroughly tough animal , short of the " Acts of God " referred to in insurance policies , deserves respectful mention . To detach a specimen from the rocks one heaves more or less mightily on a small pinch-bar , necessarily sacrificing a good many of the animal 's tube feet but doing it no permanent injury thereby , as it will soon grow others to replace the loss . The detached tube feet continue to cling to the rock for an indefinite period . An Eastern investigator finds that the tube feet of the common starfish of the Atlantic will live for several days in clean sea water and will respond to stimuli for two days or more . Histological examination shows deep sense cells and a net of material that is probably nerves . The action of the pedicellariae ? minute , pincher-like appendages that keep the skin of starfish and urchins free of parasitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allow the upper surface of a husky specimen to rest against the skin of your forearm for a few seconds ; then jerk it away . The almost microscopic pincers will have attached themselves to the epidermis in such a way that you will feel a distinct series of sharp nips . A classic experiment to demonstrate the function of pedicellariae is to drop crushed chalk on the exposed surface of a living starfish . The chalk is immediately ground to a powder so fine that it can be washed away by the action of the microscopic waving cilia in the skin . Considering that sessile animals must struggle for even sufficient space for a foothold , and that starfish live in a region where the water may be filled with the minute larvae of barnacles seeking an attachment site , the value of these cleansing pedicellariae is very apparent . It is even possible that they have some value in the obtaining of food , for despite their small size they have been observed to catch and hold very small crabs , which may eventually be transferred to within reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not definitely known , but it is assumed that the tube feet may play a part . There are , in addition , delicate , finger-like extensions of the body wall scattered over its upper surface . These extensions are lined , both inside and out , with cilia , and probably assist in respiration . Many small shore animals have not even this degree of specialization of breathing apparatus ? sponges , for example , getting what oxygen they need through their skins . In connection with the general subject of respiration , it is interesting to note the great number of marine animals , including some Aches even , that are able to get oxygen from the air as well as from the water . This is necessarily the case with a large proportion of theAnimals herein considered . Some , in fact , like the periwinkles , some I the pill bugs , and a fish that lives on the Great Barrier Reef , willown if they can not get to the air . Among the shore crabs the gillp118structure shows considerable progress toward air-breathing ? a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabs which have developed a true lung and return to the sea only to breed . We have found Pisaster feeding on mussels predominantly , less frequently on barnacles and snails , and rarely on goose barnacles and limpets . Its feeding habits , and the feeding habits of starfish in general , are noteworthy . The stomach is actually everted and thrust into the shell of the animal to be eaten , so that digestion takes place outside the body of the diner . This is an interesting adaptation to the method of food getting and the type of food utilized . On the Atlantic coast the starfish are very destructive to oyster beds , thereby achievingsuch economic importance that their natural history has been studied carefully . It was found that they open shellfish by attaching their tube feet to the two shells and pulling . Anyone who has tried to pry open the shell of a bivalve without cutting the muscles would be justified in believing that no starfish could have the requisite strength . A bivalve is , in fact , stronger than a starfish on a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starfish . Humped up over its prospective meal , the starfish exerts a slow steady pull that will eventually tire the muscles of even the largest bivalve and compel them to relax . The shell gapes open and the fight is over . The starfish 's humping-up process enables it to exert the necessary pull in opposite directions . It has been demonstrated that if a specimenis lightly compressed between two glass plates so that it can not assume the humped-up position it can not avail itself of food . Here on the Pacific coast at least one out of every fifty starfish will be found humped up over a mussel , either in process of opening it or with its stomach thrust in between the gaping shells . Nothing is known about the life history or rate of growth of this Pacific form . Atlantic starfish become adult in one season , but there is reason to suspect that Pisaster grows very slowly . There is no season of the year , so far as is known , when the representative specimensare larger or smaller than at any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions where there was a high percentage of small specimens . If growth were rapid , one would expect to find a high proportion of young specimens in the community , whereas if growth were slow the expectation would be just what we find only a few small specimens in a representative area . The sexual products are extruded from pores between the rays and on the upper surface , as with Patiria ( ? 26 ) , but probably not so frequently . Observations extending over five years , on several thou . sand Pisaster which were spread out prior to preservation , showed only five cases of extrusion ? one in March , one in June , two in  |p119ber  , and one in December . Then in the warm summer of 1931 we found sexual products extruding from more than a score of specimens in one lot of four or five hundred . At present Pisaster 's chief claim to fame lies in its abundance and vivid colors . If we would know more of its natural history we must hope that it will become economically important enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most obvious member of the triumvirate characteristic of this long stretch of surf-swept rocky coast . The others are the California mussel and the Pacific goose barnacle . The mussel , Mytilus calif ornianus ( Pl . XXV ) , ranging from Alaska to Mexico , forms great beds that extend , in favorable localities , from above the half-tide line to well below extreme low water . Here is another animal that is distinctly at home in crashing waves . Indeed it occurs only where there is surf , whereas some Pisaster may be found elsewhere . Each animal is anchored to the rock by byssal hairs , tough threads extruded by a gland in the foot . Contrary to the natural expectation , however , Mytilus is actually capable of limited locomotion , provided it is not too tightly wedged into position by other mussels . It can achieve a slight downward motion by relaxing the muscle which controls the byssal hairs , but it can go still farther than this by bringing its foot into play . By extendingits foot and gripping the rock with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few at a time , or even pull the byssus out by the roots . Once the hairs are all broken , it can move ahead the length of its foot , attach new hairs , and repeat the process . The mussel 's chief enemies are man and Pisaster , but we have caught the snail Thais in the act of drilling neat holes through the shells of small specimens preparatory to extracting the body bit by bit . It is possible that some fish feed on them also . The mussels themselvesfeed , like other bivalves , on minute organisms in the water . The California mussel is fine fare for humans as well as for starfish , but cases of paralytic poisoning following their consumption have been so frequent that it seems wise to refrain altogether or to tat them during the winter only . The situation has been investigated recently by the Hooper Foundation of the University of California , slid an incidental report with some references will be found in Science I or December 16 , 1932 , p. 574 ( 76 , No. 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which results from the ingestion Of certain planktonic organisms present during the summer only . The toxin is water-soluble and is destroyed by alkalis , such as boiling withIa . It has been suggested that the sand crab , Enierita ( ? 186 ) mayrve as an index for the guidance of public-health officials in estab/lishing quarantine areas and periods , since these small burrowing crustaceans of the open coast feed in a manner similar to Mytilus and are similarly afflicted with the poison , which can be experimentally demonstrated by injection in white mice . Unfortunately this toxicity is not restricted to mussels ; any open-coast bivalves may be dangerouswhen the particular type of floating organisms are running during the summer . The razor clam ( ? 189 ) may be dangerously poisonous , and even such specimens of the Washington and horse-neck clams ( ? ? 300 , 301 ) as occur in inlets adjacent to ocean shores had best be shunned during the summer months . Oysters , Venerupis ( Paphia ) , Mya , and most of the Washington and horse-neck clams are perfectly safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin ) , working up Alaska historical data at Sitka , found frequent references to mussel-poisoning in translating the accountsof Father Veniaminoff and other early Russian explorers . Baranoff lost a hundred or more Aleuts all at once in Peril Strait ; the stench arising from the stricken made even the others ill . One of Vancouver 's men is said to have died thus , and others nearly lost their lives similarly . The breeding season of Mytilus californianus has been investigatedby Stohler ( 1930 ) , who found July and December peaks in the proliferation of eggs and sperm . The sexes are separate. ? 159 . Accounts of the starfish-oyster association of the East coast are never complete without reference to the oyster crab . The corresponding starfish-mussel assemblage on the Pacific is completed by the commensal mussel crab or pea crab , Fabia subquadrata ( Fig. 57 ) , which is found in about three per cent of the full-grown California mussels . Curiously enough , only the female lives in the mantle cavity of Mytilus . It has been presumed to be the case , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the female and free-living , but until recently it was supposed that the male had never been seen . The situation became more and more curious when Wells discovered ( in 1928 ) that the male had been known for years but had been considered not only a different species but a member of a dif ferent genus . He is , as was expected , smaller and free-living , and it goes without saying that he bears almost no resemblance to the female , Pinnotheres concharum was his former name , which he must notrelinquish in favor of his wife 's . It has been deduced that the male visits the female after she established herself in a mussel , for the males of other species our Pacific Fabia have been found trapped between the shell val The male 's visit is not as hazardous as it might seem , for he has carapace tough enough to resist crushing by the mussel 's valves.  |p121sheltered  females , however , are soft and weak , and show none of the pugnacity that characterizes most free-living crabs . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , one investigator , working with a similar species , cut a window in the shell of a mussel . He found that a large crab usually sat in the middle of the bivalve , where she could most conveniently scrape food from her host 's gills ? food which was intended for the host 's own consumption . Small crabs were likely to be anywhere , but most commonlyon the gills . The pea crab is thus a true parasite , although it seems to do its host no particular harm . It is interesting to note that another zoologist found a parasite upon the parasite of a pea crab ? a striking confirmation of the lyrical flea-upon-flea idea. ? 160 . The Pacific goose barnacle , Mitella polymerus ( Pl . XXV ) , the third member of an assemblage so common that we call it the Pisaster-Mytilus-Mitella association , is fairly well restricted to the upper two-thirds of the intertidal zone . These three animals , " horizon markers " in marine ecology if ever there were any , are almost certain to be associated wherever there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific . The goose barnacle extends the general range of the association , being recorded from Bering Strait to the middle of Lower California , specimens on the open coast of Alaska , however , being comparatively few and scattered . Mitella is commonly chalky colored when dry , but there is a vividly colored subspecies which is restricted to caves or rocks sheltered from direct sunlight , identified for us by Dr. Pilsbry as M. polymerus echinata . In the Santa Cruz region clusters of this subspecies increase in brilliancy of markings as they range deeper into the darkness of the cave . Although the adult goose barnacles resemble but vaguely the squat and heavy-shelled acorn barnacles , they are closely related , and both have substantially the same life history featuring freeswimmingnauplii larvae outlined in ? 4 . The California Fish and Game Commission Publication for 1916 gives a recipe for preparing goose barnacles , which the Spanish and Italians consider a choice food . Usually only the " neck " or fleshy stalk is eaten . The name , " goose barnacle , " comes to us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended his large volume on plants " with this woonder of England , " " the Goosetree , Barnakle tree , or the tree bearing Geese . " After declining to vouch for the authenticity of another man 's report of a similar marvel , Gerard continued : " Moreover , it should seem that there is another sort heerof ; the Historie of which is true , and of mine owne knowledge : for travelling upon the shores of our English coast betweenp122attending on their husbandes returne from the sea ) we drewe ? out of160Dover and Rummey , I founde the trunke of an olde rotten tree , which ( with some helpe that I procured by fishermens wives that were therethe water upon dry lande : on this rotten tree I founde growing many thousands of long crimson bladders , in shape like unto puddings newly filled before they be sodden , which were verie cleere and shining , at the neather end whereof did grow a shell fish , fashioned somewhat like a small Muskle , but much whiter , resembling a shell fish that groweth upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : many of these shels I brought with me to London , which after I had opened , I founde in them living things without forme or shape ; in others which were neerer come to ripeness , I found living things that were very naked , in shape like a Birde ; in others , the Birds covered with soft downe , the shell halfe open , and the Birde readie to fall out , which no doubt were the foules called Barnakles . I dare not absolutely avouch every circumstance of the first part of this Historie concerning the tree that beareth those buds aforesaide , but will leave it to a further consideration : howbeitthat which I have seen with mine eies , and handled with mine handes , I dare confidently avouch , and boldly put downe for veritie . " Gerard was quite in accord with themodern tendency to popularize science . However , he perceived that pure scientists would desire certain definite information , so he added : They spawne as it were in March and April ; the Geese are formed in Maie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . Also hecatered to the likewise modern feeling that pictures can not lie : his graphic representation of the birth of barnacle-geese is reproduced in Figure 58 . The remainder of the wave-sweptrocky-shore animals lend themselves better than the foregoing to treatment according to tidal zones corresponding to the upper , middle , and lower tide ? pool regions of the protected outer coast.  | ? 161 . As in other regions , the first animals to be encountered will be the dingy little snails , Littorina , but whereas they occur a little above the high-tide line on protected outer shores , they will be found here twenty or twenty-five feet above the water . Littorina is famous for its independence of the ocean . Tropical species have taken to grass and herbage at the top of low oceanic cliffs , and even to trees bordering the water . Next in the downward progression , but still many feet above the water , come very small specimens of the barnacle , Balanus glandula ( ? 4 ) , whose sharp encrusting shells are likely to exact a toll of flesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high surf , however , they may be absent , not because they lack the ability to hold on once they have colonized the region but because the delicate , free-swimming larvae may never be able to get a foothold if there is high surf during the season when they should attach . A tremendousand epic struggle for existence comprises the daily life of the animals of this region where the only unfought-for advantage is an abundance of oxygen . Barnacles and mussels begin to feed within sixty seconds after immersion , and their great haste is understandable when one considers that they are covered , in this highest zone , only when a wave dashes up over them , and that there is competition for every passing food particle . They must fight for a foothold , fight to keep it , and fight for their food . Limpets occur here also , but not in the great numbers that characterizethe highest zone of more protected shores . The commonest form is Acmaea digitalis (   . I and Fig. 9 ) , but others will be found , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these open shores , ranges high up. ? 162 . From Alaska southward to Santa Cruz , a semi-land-living pill bug or isopod , Ligyda pallasii ( Fig. 59 ) , haunts the rocky cliffs , king found invariably above the reach of water , whatever the state of the tide . Specimens taken during July at Mora , on the open coast of Washington , had the brood pouch turgid with developing young and when handled roughly deposited hosts of newly born children in one 's hand . Another species of this landward-extending crustacean occurs on the protected outer coast south of Santa Cruz ( ? 2 ) .  | ? 163 . Here mussels and goose barnacles begin to occur in large beds which afford shelter to a number of animals not themselves adapted to withstanding surf . Probably the most obvious of these is the predaceous worm Nereis vexillosa ( Pl . XXVI ) , known variously as the mussel worm , the clam worm , and the pile worm . Certainly it is the most important from the standpoint of sportsmen , who seek it along thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possibly becauseof its proclivity for letting other animals provide its shelter from surf , Nereis is one of the few animals that may be found in nearly all types of regions , from violently surf-swept shores to the shores of bays and completely protected inlets , and in such varying types of environment as rocky shores , gravel beaches , and wharf piling . Not only does it occur from Alaska to San Diego , * but it seems to be abundant throughout its range , whereas other animals occupying so great a stretch of coast usually have optimum areas , dwindling away toward the north or south . Thus Nereis might be considered in almost any section of this handbook . It is treated in this particular place because the largest specimens are commonly found in the mussel beds of the open coast , where they vary from 2 " to 12 " in length . They are usually colored an iridescent greenbrown . The animals are very active and squirm violently when captured , protruding and withdrawing their chitinous jaws which terminate a wicked-looking , protrusible pharynx and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of delivering a business-like bite to tender wrists and arms , but in collecting many hundreds of them bare-handed we have rarely been bitten , always taking the precaution of not holding them too long . In its breeding habits Nereis is one of the most spectacular of all shore animals . In common with other segmented worms , its sexual maturity is accompanied by such changes in appearance that early naturalists considered Nereis in this condition to be a distinct animal , Heteronereis a name which has been retained to denote this phase of the animal 's life cycle . The posterior segments ( red in the female ) containing the gonads , swell up with eggs or sperm , and the append . ' ages normally used for creeping become modified into paddlesp125swimming . When moon and tide are favorable , the male heteronereis , smaller than the female , leaves his protective shelter , seemingly flingingcaution to the wind , and swims rapidly and violently through the water , shedding sperm as he goes . Probably a large proportion of the males become food for fishes during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the females , who follow the males within a short time , releasing their eggs . It has been determined experimentally in connection with related species that females liberate their eggs only in the presence of the male , or in water in which sperm has been introduced . If a specimen of each sex can be obtained before the ripe sexual products have been shed , the experiment can be performed easily . The female , in a glass dish of clean sea water , will writhe and contort herself for hours with frenzied and seemingly inexhaustible energy . Introduce the male , or some of the water from his dish if he has shed his sperm in the meantime , and almost immediately the female will shed her eggs . When the process is over the worms , in their natural environment , will return to the shelter of the mussel beds with collapsed and degeneratingposterior segments which drop off in time , to be replaced by new growth . Although we have many times found the large heteronereis of N. vexillosa in the mussel clusters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February and early March ? we have not yet found a single large specimen free-swimming ; but shedding specimens of a smaller wharf Nereis are common in Monterey Harbor ( see ? 320 ) . It can be assumed confidently , however , that N. vexillosabecomes free-swimming at some time during the breeding season , presumably at night , because daylight collecting has turned up specimensthat showed evidence of having shed eggs recently. ? 164 . A second Nereis , not as common as vexillosa but sufficiently startling to put the observer of its heteronereis stage in a pledgesigningstate of mind , is the very large N. brandti , frequently considered a subspecies of virens ( ? 311 ) . Specimens may be nearly three feet long , and are broad in proportion ? a likely source for local seaserpentyarns . To the night collector , already rendered a bit jumpy by weird noises , phosphorescent animals , and the ominous swish of turf , the appearance of one of these heteronereis , threshing madly about at the surface of the water , must seem like the final attack of deliriumtremens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freeswimmingstage , under the mussel beds at Moss Beach , San Mateo County . It has been reported from Puget Sound to San Pedro , and we have a specimen from southeastern Alaska. ? 165 . Associated with Nereis in the mussel beds are the scalep126worm , Halosydna brevisetosa ( ? 49 ) , the porcelain crab , Petrolisthes 018 ) , and , at times , the pill bug , Cirolana harf ordi ( ? 21 ) . In some regions the nemertean worm , Etirtiplectonenta gracile , is so common as to form tangled skeins under the mussels . This rubber-band-like animal is tinted a pale yellow-green on its upper surface , white on its lower . It is slightly flattened , but is rounder than most ribbon worms , and is from 1 " to 4 " long when contracted . We have found great masses of these at Mora , on the outer coast of Washington , and at Santa Cruz , California . Other nemerteans have the unpleasant habit of breaking up into bits when disturbed ; but this one ? a highly respectableanimal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorly developed and may be taken therefore with comparative ease . A fuller account of nemerteans is given in ? 312 . Another haunter of the mussel beds is a snail which in the past we have mistakenly supposed to be a young Thais ( ? 182 ) . This form , Acanthina spirata ( Fig. 60 ) , occurs higher up than Thais , however , occupying on surf-swept shores about the relative position taken by Tegula on the protected outer shores . It is recorded from Puget Sound to Socorro Island . Two small crustaceans will be found at this level . The minute amphipod , Elasmopus rapax ( Fig. 61 ) , is exceedingly abundant in the middle-zone beds of mussels . The much larger isopod , Pentidotca wosnesenskii ( Fig. 62 ) , up to 172 " long , ranges from Alaska to centralCalifornia . We have found it only on rocky shores , but it is said to occur also in sand . This is the commonest small crustacean at Santa Cruz , in numbers more than equivalent to the mussels which make up the clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeycombed colonies , often dome-shaped , of the , tube worm , Sabellaria calif ornica ( Pl . XXVI ) , may share available areas with the mussel beds . They are very likely to be found taking advantage of the slightest bits of shelter in the way of overhanging ledges and concave shorelines . The thin-walled tubes which make up the colonies are made , apparently , of sand cemented together . The worms themselves , rarely seen unless one chops into a colony , are firm , chunky , and dark , with a black operculum that stoppers up the tribes when the animals are retracted . The similar , more northern , S. cementarium has a rough , amber-colored dome . Like other tube win ma. these are dependent for food on what chance brings their way , although they can assist the process by setting up currents with the cilia on the protruded gill-filaments . The previously recorded range was from San Francisco to San Diego , but we have seen large colonies near Half Way House , between Tia Juana and Ensenada . The colonyshown was photographed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations similar to the above , but where the shore formationis tipped more horizontally , beds of the small aggregated anemone , Cribrina , often occur . They are not so characteristic here , however , as in the protected outer coast environment 024 ) . ? 168 . A fairly large barnacle , dull brick-red in color , conical in shape , and with the semi-porous consistency of volcanic slag , is Tetraclita squamosa rubescens . Average specimens are easily twice the size of the Balanus ( ? 4 ) found in the same association , and they are more solitary , rarely growing bunched together or one on top of another as is the case with the white barnacle. ? 169 . Nuttallina calif ornica ( Pl . XXVI ) is a small sea cradle or chiton , rarely more than 172 " long , that is pretty well restricted to the middle intertidal of fairly exposed shores . It can be distinguished by its rough uncouth appearance , spiny girdle , and color ? dull brown streaked with white . It may be found occasionally well up toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone . At Laguna ( leach and other places in the south this chiton lives in sculptured furrows in the rock . If these furrows are of the chiton 's own making , as they appear to be , they are comparable with the excavations made in rock by the owl limpet and the purple urchin . In all three cases the object is apparently to gain security of footing against the surf . The recorded range is Puget Sound to the Coronado Islands . Below the middle zone , Nuttallina 's place is taken by the larger Katharina ( ? 177 ) . Both of these chitons are perfectly well able to take care of themselves at times of high surf , for they are very tough and attach to the rocks so tightly that a flat , sharp instrument must be used to pry them away . Detached from their supports , chitons promptly curl up like pill bugs. ? 170 . Where there are rock pools at this level , congregations of purple urchins may be found , with occasional hermit crabs ( Pagurus , amuelis ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 27 ) , but these are all treated elsewhere , in the zones and habitats where they livid optimum conditions . Theoretically , any animals common in the middle tide-pool region of protected outer shores may be found also In these more or less protected rock pools , but they are scarce or local , not characteristic of the region in general as is the **34;580;TOOLONG , which finds its climax in this level. ? 171 . Plants are out of the province of this book , but in connection with methods of resisting wave shock it is worth while to mention the brown alga called the sea palm , Postelsia palmaeformis. is restricted to the temperate Pacific coast of North America , and occurs only where the surf is continuous and high . Along the central California coast great forests of these beautiful plants are found onP128rocky benches and flats . Instead of sustaining the shock of the toweringbreakers by rigid strength , as do most of the animals in the region , the sea palms give to it . Under the force of a powerful breaker a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to right themselves immediately and uniformly as the wave passes . This particular form of resistance is made possible by the sea palm 's tremendously tough and flexible stalk , which is attached to the rock by a bunchy holdfast of the same material . It will be noted that specialized individuals of a limpet considered previously , Acmaca pelts ( ? 11 ) , may be found on the swaying stalks of Postelsia , thus extending their range into an environment otherwise too rigorous on account of surf , were it not for the protection and amelioration offered by this plant 's flexibility. ? 172 . On violently surf-swept cliffs and tablelands where even the sea palm can not gain a foothold , bare rock constitutes the typical tidal landscape . A few scrawny laminarians may occur , but never on the boldest headlands , and not until the collector descends ( the surf permitting ) to the extreme low-tide level will he find any common plant . Even then he is likely to overlook it unless he accidentally knocks a bit of inconspicuous red crust from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lithophyton , under the surface of which most of the small animals of the region are to be found . The animals so occurring , however , are on the completely exposed shore only by virtue of the protection which this encrusting plant give ! . them , for all are protected coast forms ( and hence treated elsewhere ) . Many of them occur again in kelp holdfasts . The great green anemone is very much at home here , growing luxuriantlyto a size that makes it a close second to the anemones of the Australian Barrier Reef . This giant beauty will always he found , however , in situations where it is reasonably sheltered from the fug force of the surf . For this reason , and because it is quite likely to have been first seen in the tide-pool regions , it has been treated ta member of the protected outer coast fauna ( 04 ) . A more characteristic animal , occurring also under flat rocks a imbedded boulders , is P'entidotea stenops ( Fig. 63 ) , one of the large of the isopods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found under similar circumstances , and San Remo , below Carmel , we have taken both at the same pl ter. ? 173 . A great ostrich-plume hydroid , Aglaophenia struthionp129occurs in rock crevices , especially in large vertical crevices in the line of surf . This form is considerably larger than members of the genus found on relatively protected shores , and the largest clusters are so dark as to be nearly black . Otherwise there is little difference and the reader is referred to Plate XIV . This is one of the few hydroids that occur in bona fide surf-swept environments , except on the open coast at Sitka . There tufted coloniesof two great and coarse sertularians will be found . The ranker of the two , Abietinaria turgida ( reported as common in the Bering Sea ? Aleutian region ) , occurs in great coarse growths up to 6 " or 8 " high , with short branches ( which may be branched again ) almost as coarse as the main stem , and with the cup-like hydrothecae crowded close on stem and branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bering Sea to Puget Sound , has a straight heavy main stem ; but the branches , which take off at right angles , are slenderand without secondary branches , and the cup-like receptacles into which the tentacles are withdrawn are small and comparatively few . However , where the crevices are deep enough , even along the California coast , or where overhanging ledges simulate the semishelteredconditions of reef and tide pool , such other hydroids as Eudendrium ( ? 79 ) , Abietinaria anguina ( ? 83 ) , and even Tubularia marina ( ? 80 ) may occur , with the sponge , Rhabdodermella ( ? 94 ) , the ( hydro-coral , Allopora porphyra ( ? 87 ) , and the bryozoan , Bugula alifornica ( 0.13 ) , all of which are treated in Division I.In fairly barren rock formation off the coast of Alaska near Sitka , we recently turned up a magnificent red-encrusting soft coral , liunephthya rubiformis , at first taken for a compound tunicate , but ? once we had set out a mass in a tray of fresh sea water ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8-tentacledpolyps . This " sea-strawberry " is characteristic of high Arctic waters , and it was a surprise to find it so far south. ? 174 . Here the purple urchin , Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ( Pl . XXVII ) , is distinctly at home , having made one of the most interestngadaptations of all to the pounding surf . The animal will cornonlybe found with at least half of its bristling bulk sunk into an excavation in the rock . For more than a hundred years the methodproducing these excavations has been a subject of controversy , but is generally agreed now that Fewkes stated the situation correctly1890 . He believed that the teeth and spines of the animals , aidedmotions produced by waves and tides , were sufficient to account or the pits , however hard the rock and however frayable the urchins ' limes , for the latter would , of course , be continually renewed by owth . Sometimes an urchin will be found that has imprisonedP130itself for life , having , as it grew , gouged out a cavity larger than the entrance hole made when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedros Island , probably entirely on the outer coast , as opposed to the green urchin of Puget Sound and northern inside waters . The reproductive season at Monterey is during March and April at least . The food-getting , reproductive , and fighting habits of urchins have been discussed in connection with the giant red urchin ( ? 73 ) . A good many of the latter occur here at a level below the pits of the purple urchins . In fact , they are possibly as common here as in the outer tide pools of the more protected areas . All three of these urchins , red , purple , and green , have a number of hangers-on , both inside and out . An intestinal flatworm has alreadybeen mentioned in connection with the giant red form . In addition to the flatworm , Lynch finds practically one hundred per cent infestation of the intestine with one or more of twelve distinct species of protozoans , some of them comparatively large ( % mm . ) . For zoology classes near the seashore these would provide easy demonstrationsof living marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur nowhere except clinging to the spines of urchins . Mrs. Grant ( MS. ) notes that on the reef at Point Arena pits formerly occupied by purple urchins now contain dunce-cap limpets ( ? 117 ) by the hundred. ? 175 . The gigantic horse mussel , Volsella modiola , formerly Mediolus , up to 9 " in length , is no longer common , its depletion being the result , probably , of too many chowders , too many conchologists , and the animal 's presumably slow rate of growth . Although it occurs a bit below the low-tide line , the horse mussel 's brown shell , naked except for a fine beard , is very noticeable , especially by contrast with the California mussels alongside it . Such of the California mussels ( ? 158 ) as occur this far down are giants of the tribe but are never clean-shelled as are the colonies higher up in the intertidal . Man plants , from coralline algae to small laminarians , grow on their shells , providing almost perfect concealment .

The . smaller and more southern V. recta may also be seen , particular ) along less strongly exposed shores , as at La Jolla. * G. W. Otter ( " Rock-burrowing echinoids , " Biological Reviews , 7.69-I 1932 ) , reopening this question , confirms Fewkes ' findings except to ohsrrv ? tide and current have nothing to do with burrowing activities , which air mull voluntary through the agency of just such organs as would prevent thr arils from being whirled about . The start is almost invariably at a natural ? Iria and sudden storms undoubtedly dislodge many young specimens before they adequately bored in.  | ? 176 . In the Monterey Bay region , beds of the foliose coralline Cheilosporunti ( the coralline being stiffened by the same encrusting red alga that grows on rocks in this zone ) are certain to harbor very tiny cucumbers , Cucumaria curata , that look like bits of tar . The animals are so small that they can be mounted whole on micro slides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not know of their occurrence anywhere except in the region mentioned , where , in addition to their coralline habitat , they are occasionally found under mussels in this lowest zone . We have found ovigerous specimens in December , the eggs being brooded on the under side as in Thyonepsolus ( ? 141 ) . On the same coralline there occurs also a very similar but much larger species , Cucumaria lubrica ( Fig. 64 ) , which is often more than an inch long . Size alone will distinguish the two , but an additional difference is that lubrica has ten large tentacles , while curata has eight large and two small ones . We have specimens of lubrica from the vicinity of Juneau and from Puget Sound ( the northern specimens being larger and lighter in color ) , as well as from Monterey Bay ; hence it will probably turn up at various places along the intervening coast line. ? 177 . Katharina tunicata (   . XXVII ) , whose dead black tunic has almost overgrown the plates of its shell , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even sunlight , and next to the " gum boot " ( Cryptochiton ) it is the largest of the family . In the low-tide area Katharina assumes the position held in the middle zone of the same surf-swept regions by Nuttallina , but Katharina shows more definite zonation , occurring , in suitable locations , in well-defined belts a little above the zero of the tide tables . In Alaska Katharina is the most abundant intertidal chiton , and it ranges plentifully as far south as Point Conception , where there is a great colony , and less commonly below there to the Coronado Islands . On the most exposed parts of the open coast Katharina 's eggs are shed in July , at least in the central California region , but in Puget Sound sexual maturity comes a month or two earlier . Strangelyough , on at least one occasion Katherina was found to be not only he commonest chiton but one of the most prevalent of all littoral forms , in a British Columbia locality almost completely protected from wave shock ( but directly fronting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalling the remarks of the ecologist Allee ( 1923 ) to the effect that if the search is long enough one can turnt very nearly any animal in any environment , however far-fetched. ? 178 . Where laminarians or other algae provide the least bit ofelter , the sea lemon , Anisodoris nobilis , one of the largest of allp132nudibranchs , may be found . The average length is around 4 inches , but 8-inch specimens have been taken . Their usual vivid yellow color sometimes tends toward orange . All have background splotches of dark brown or black , while the knob-like tubercles that cover the back are yellow . In common with other dorid nudibranchs , especially the yellow ones , Anisodoris has a fruity , penetrating , and persistent odor . This species ranges from Vancouver Island to Laguna Beach . MacFarlandwrote , in 1906 , that it occurred on piling in Monterey Harbor ; but it disappeared from there , along with many other animals , with the oil fire of 1925 . We have seen these hermaphroditic animals depositing strings of eggs in November. ? 179 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXVII ) , prefersmore surf than its red cousin or , more likely , tolerates more surf because it finds food-getting conditions more to its liking on surfsweptshores . Some abalones , this black form in particular , seem to derive much of their nourishment from plankton ? a fact which explainswhy the black abalone is so often found in the crevices of barren rocks where there is no visible food in the way of fixed vegetation . Again unlike the red form , which invariably carries a small forest on its back , the black abalone keeps its shell clean and shining . The latter is definitely smaller and with 5 to 8 perforations ; the legal size is 5% inches . It makes quite as good steaks or chowder as the red abalone provided that it is pounded a little more energetically . Ranging from Oregon to Lower California , the animal is always most at home in vertical fissures in the rock , where tide and surf provide heavy currents for respiration . On the outer coast of British Columbia and Alaska is another abalone , whose thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lot ; this is H. kamtschatkana ( ? 74 ) , commoner in semi-protected waters. ? 180 . The largest of the keyhole limpets , which are related to the , abalones and no more than a family or so removed from them in the phylogenetic scale , is Megathura crenulata ( Fig. 65 ) , known also as Lucapina . A good-sized specimen is 7 " long and massive in proportion . The flesh of the under side of the foot is yellow , and the oval shell , which has many fine radiating ridges , is nearly covered by the black mantle . Many animals lose their color after death , but this giant keyhole limpet is unique in that its black will come off in life if the mantle is rubbed . The range is from Monterey to Lower California , and we have found specimens particularly common in Todos Santos Bay. ? 181 . Diadora aspera ( Pl . XXVIII ) , another of the keyhole limpets , is small by comparison with the above , but still la ' a for limpet . Large specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recur dP133range is Alaska to Lower California . Any specimens found should be examined for the commensal scale worm Acholoe vittata , formerly Halosydna lordi , which has been mentioned as occurring with Cryptochiton ( ? 76 ) . In 1866 , Lord , in British Columbia , wrote interestingly of this commensal . He remarked that the position of the worm ? like a ribbon on edge ? prevents its being crushed when the host clamps down to the rock . The length of the worm , considering the size of the host , is remarkable , and the worm often has to curl around the mantle so completely that its ends almost touch . A third member of the group , the volcano-shell limpet , is the smallest of the lot , but is handsome nevertheless . It has been treated ( ? 15 ) as a protected ? outer-coast form , but it is practically as commonin this environment. ? 182 . The leafy horn-mouth snail , Purpura foliata ( ? 117 ) , is occasionallyfound in surf-swept areas where there is a bit of shelter just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular to cause comment , is the prettily marked ring top shell , Calliostoma annulatum , up to an inch in diameter and ranging from Alaska to San Diego . The body is salmon pink , and the yellow shell has a purple band following the beaded spiral . The larger C. canaliculatum will be found similarly , but on bare rock , and far down in this zone and well into the sublittoral . Occasional C. costatum ( ? 215 , Pl . XXVIII ) will also be taken in this environment , but this is most characteristically a Puget Sound quiet-water form . These rather similar species of Calliostoma can be differentiated most readily by means of Figures 2 , 5 , 6 , and 7 of Plate 36 of Packard ( 1918 , cited on our p. 289 ) , but illustrations on page 548 of Johnson and Snook ( 1927 ed. ) are fairly diagnostic . Most characteristic of all is the short-spired purple , Thais emar'nata ( Pl . XXVIII ) , which is not only abundant on rocky shores here the surf is fairly heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1871 , Verrill and Smith said that a whelk similar our Thais ( Purpura lapillus ) " is seldom found living much belowlow water mark , and prefers the exposed rocky headlands on the an shores , where it flourishes in defiance to the breakers . It lays eggs in smooth , vase-shaped capsules , attached to the sides or der surfaces of stones by a short stalk , and usually arranged inCoups . " If they had been describing our purple , they could not have t it more closely . We would only add that the egg cases , called n oats , " are yellow , and are likely to be mistaken at first sight for course sponges . Purple snails are so named not for the color of their shells ( usulyblack and white ) but because they are reputed to be the snailsp134from which the Tyrian dye of ancient times was made . Irreverent modern investigators find the dye to be a rather dull purple that fades badly . It is suspected that the color sense of ancient peoples was based on standards that would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient Romans would arouse contempt in a schoolboy artist of today , since the civilization of Tiberius knew nothing of our lacquers and brilliant coal-tar dyes . Eniarginata is usually a uniform white , gray , or brown in color , and ranges from Alaska to Mexico . It is a voracious animal and will sometimes be caught in the act of drilling , with its radula , through the shell of a mussel . In connection with Thais , a mild dissertation on birth control , prenatal care , and race suicide seems to be almost mandatory , for the tribe of Thais persists in spite of the most arrant cannibalism . The adults eat snail eggs indiscriminately , including their own , and the larval Thais eat each other while still in the egg capsule . Instead of there being a single egg , with a sufficient supply of nutritive yolk , there are many eggs in each capsule , with not enough yolk to carry the embryos through to hatching time . Consequently they eat each other until only one ? and that one presumably cock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a world where its chances of survival are still poor. ? 183 . Two encrusting forms which have puzzled us until recentlymay puzzle the amateur collector also . A roughly circular growth that looks like a tightly adherent mass of corallines is composed of tiny-tubed annelid worms , the serpulid Filograna ( XXVIII ) . They are not unlike intertwining tubes of Serpula or Sabellaria , but on a pin-point scale . At first sight the mass may appear dingy , but on closer examination it will be seen to have an encrusted . dainty , filigree pattern . En masse the gills are a rusty red , individually a brighter red and rather attractive . The other form , occurring in similar situations on vertical cliff faces almost at the lowest-water mark , is the sponge Hyvneniacidotl sinapiurn , which may thinly encrust areas of several square feet . This is the yellow-green , slightly slimy form , with nipple-like papilla ; recognizable by the European observer as similar to Axinella , andoriginallyso called in this area . De Laubenfels notes that the open . coast habitat is rare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , on oyster shells , etc.  |p135the  animals living on surf-swept rocky shores have solved the problem of wave shock by developing powerful attachment devices , the inhabitants of surf-swept sandy beaches achieve the same end by burying themselves in the sand . Some , like the mole crab and the razor clam , are able to burrow with extraordinary rapidity . Others ( Pismo clam ) burrow more slowly , depending on the **29;616;TOOLONG of their hard , rounded shell . These have achieved the necessary great strength and resistance to crushing , not through the development of such obvious structural reinforcements as ribbing , with the consequent economy of material , but by means of shells which are thick and heavy throughout . Ribbing would providefootholds for the surf-created currents which could whisk the animal out of its securely buried position in a hurry . Natural selectionpresumably has " bred out " a race of thick- and smooth-shelled clams over which the streaming and crushing surf can pour without effect . In addition the actively burrowing forms particularly , such as Emerita ( ? 186 ) , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sight . That the problems faced by sand dwellers on an exposed coast are reasonably baffling is indicated by the fact that few animals are able to hold their own under such conditions . While these beaches are not the barren wastes we found the smaller sandy beaches of the protected outer coast to be , they are still sparsely populated in comparison with similar rocky shores . Actually we know of only six or seven common forms that occur in any abundance on heavily surf-swept sand beaches , and two of them are already well along toward extinction as a result of human activities . This reflects a situation quite different from that assumed by most amateur collectors , who would have one but turn over a spadeful of beach sand to reveal a wealth of hidden life. ? 184 . We have already cited several examples , notably the periwinkles , of animals with marked landward tendencies . On the sand beaches of the open coast there is another , the little pill bug , Alloniscus perconvexus , about 5/8 " long . This isopod is an air-breathing form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , therefore , in the highest zone , above the high-tide line , and because of the obvious nature of its burrows it is often one of the first animals to ' be noticedp136in this environment . The mole-like burrows are just beneath the surface , and in making them the animal humps up the surface sand into ridges . Another air-breather , the isopod Tylos punctatus , a 1/4/ " to 1/2 " oval form resembling Exosphaeroma ( ? 198 ) , is restricted to the southern California beaches. ? 185 . During the night , or most noticeably at dusk or at dawn , the foreshore seems to become alive with jumping hordes of the great beach hopper , Orchestoidea californiana ( Pl . XXIX ) . They are pleasant and handsome animals , with white- or old-ivory ? colored bodies , while the head region and long antennae are bright orange . The bodies of large specimens are considerably more than an inch long , so that , adding the antennae , an over-all length of 21/2 " is not uncommon . Like the other beach hoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always retreating up the beach a little ahead of the tide . These hoppers seem always to keep their bodies damp , however , and to that end spend their daylight hours buried deep in the moist sand , where they are very difficult to find . Night is the time to see them . Observers with a trace of sympathy for bohemian life should walk with a flashlight along a familiar surfy beach at half-tide on a quiet evening . These huge hoppers will be holding high carnival ? leaping about with vast enthusiasm , pausing to wiggle their antennaeover likely looking bits of flotsam seaweed . They will rise up before the intruder in great windrows , for all the world like grasshoppersin a summer meadow . Too closely pursued , they dig rapidly into the sand , head first , and disappear very quickly . Ovigerous females have been taken in March in Monterey Bay. ? 186 . Emerita analoga (   . XXIX ) is the mole crab or sand crab , the " sand bug " of the beach-frequenting small boy . The shell is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift ing sands where the surf is high , since the pressure is distributed too evenly to throw the animal out of balance . Most of the crabs characteristically move in any direction ? forward , backward , or sideways ? but whether the mole crab is swimming , crawling , or burrowing , it always moves backward . Crawling is apparently its least efficient mode of locomotion , but while its swift burrowing is its chief accomplishment in that respect , it is also a fairly good swimmer an action achieved by beating its hindmost , paddle-like appendages above the after margin of the shell . The same appendages assist in burrowing , but most of the work of burrowing is done by the other legs . When in the sand , the mole crab always stands on end , head end " up . Characteristically the entire body is buried , while the eyes tiny knobs on the ends of long stalks ? and the feathery antennae project ,  |p137above  the surface of the sand . The film of water receding after each wave provides the animal with minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave brings the next course . The projecting antennae , which are withdrawn after the water has receded , serve a double purpose , for they also direct a stream of water to the gill chambers . The same film of water that brings food and oxygen , however , betrays the mole crab 's presence by forming a Vshapedripple in the sand where the water 's straight course has been deflected by the projecting eyes and antennae ? a fact that is taken advantage of by hungry birds as well as by curious collectors and bait-gatherers . The latter use the animals in their soft-shelled stage , that is , just after they have moulted . Emerita lives at about the half-tide line , but shifts its base of operations somewhat according to changes in the tidal level . Often it occurs in great beds , so that turning up a single spadeful of sand may reveal a large number . The females average a little less than an inch in length , and the males are at least a third smaller . This form ranges from Oregon to South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elsewhere . One investigator ( Mead ) * has thrown some light on Emerita 's methods of orienting itself . He found that its strongest direction instinctis to move down a slope ? an action that would normally take it to the sea . On a level plot of ground a group of specimens still moved toward the sea , even though some distance removed from it and unable to see it ; but on a steep slope slanting away from the sea they headed inland . On a landward-slanting slope of about 7 per cent their oceanward tendency and their downhill tendency just balanced , so that they moved in all directions in complete confusion . When first captured , the mole crab " plays ' possum , " lying perfectlystill on its back . Ordinarily it comes to very suddenly , rights itself , and attempts to burrow . Frequently , however , according to the same experimenter , one never comes out of its death feint but continues to play dead until it is killed by the sun 's heat . It is a weird defense mechanism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spiny sand crab , Blepharipoda occidentalis ( Fig. 66 ) , may occur with Emerita . It is larger , with a carapace up to 2 " long , and is by no means as common . It has a recorded range of Monterey southward , and recent reports say that it is abundant outside Morro Bay. ? 187 . At about the mole-crab 's level are minute , shrimp-like crusceans , Archaeomysis maculata , called opossum shrimps because , like the other mysids , they retain the young in a marsupial pouchp138under the thorax . Gills are attached to the legs and hang down in the water . There is a trick to finding these animals , for they are so transparent that they can not be seen directly with the naked eye . On a sunshiny day , however , they cast shadows on the sand below the smooth runoff of waves dammed back momentarily by a shovel , and so can be located and captured . This form is related to the more visible mysids of the tide pools ( ? 60 ) . ? 188 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is common from the San Luis Obispo region to Mexico . This small wedge-shaped clam , averaging an inch in length , is said to have been so common at one time that it was canned commercially at Long Beach . For many years it has not been available in commercial quantities , but the individual collector can still find enough for a delicious chowder by combing the sand just beneath the surface . The bean clam 's hiding place is commonly revealed by tufts of a hydroid that grows on the shell and protrudes above the surface of the sand . This elongate hydroid , Clytia bakeri , related to Obelia , and occurring also on the Pismo clam , is the only hydroid found on exposed sandy shores. ? 189 . A razor clam , Siliqua patula ( Pl . XXIX ) , corresponds ecologically , on the open sand beaches of Washington , to the differentlookingPismo clam of similar stretches in California and Mexico . Siliqua is long ( shell up to 6 " ) and thin , with fragile shiny valves  --  just the opposite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it depends on speed of digging for protection from wave shock . A clam that was displaced by a particularly vicious wave could certainly be reburied under several inches of sand before the next comber struck , for specimens laid on top of the sand have buried themselves completely in less than seven seconds . The foot , projected half the length of the shell and pointed , is pushed into the sand , Below the surface the tip expands greatly to form an anchor and the muscle , contracting , pulls the clam downwards . The movement is repeated several times in rapid succession before the clam distil ) . pears . A digger must work quickly to capture the animal before it attains depths impossible to reach . Along the Washington coast , from the mouth of the Columbia northward , there is a stretch of thirty-eight miles of beach that worked by commercial diggers for local canneries , and the avers annual pack , from 1915 to 1927 , was 37,000 cases . In Alaska , t the canning of razor clams is an industry of some importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , Cook In and Kukak Bay . It is estimated that tourists take from the Wington coast at least a third as many clams per year as the cannel use . Many are taken also for crab bait and for consumption by IP139residents . All together the drain on the beds is too great for an animalthat takes ( in Washington ) three and one-half years to attain its legal size of 4/ inches , and the supply is decreasing steadily . At Cordova the clams require six years or more to reach the same size . A Bureau of Fisheries Bulletin ( Doc . 984 ) records some further interestingdifferences between the northern and southern clams : In the south ( Washington , etc. ) the time of spawning is simultaneous , all the clams along several miles of beach spawning on the same day when there is a sudden rise in water temperature . This usually occurs at the end of May or early in June . Sometimes the set of young is enormous , but in other years the animals almost fail to spawn at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suddenly and not simultaneously , and the set of young is more uniform . Spawning is usually in July and early August . The larval stage for both regions lasts for eight weeks . The average maximum age in Washington is twelve years ; in Alaska specimens up to seventeen and eighteen years old are known . Fraser ( 1930 ) examined nine year-classes on Queen Charlotte Island beaches . Eighty-six per cent of the three-year specimens were mature or maturing . Spawning took place from late July on , dependingon the minimum temperature of 13 ? C. The following is from Weymouth and McMillan 's ( 1930 ? 31 ) summary of a statistical study of fourteen thousand individuals of the four species of razor clams recognized : " Over the wide range of the species a high correlation is found between the relative growth rate , age , length , and geographic position . Under the conditions of the southern beds there is initially a more rapid relative growth rate which , declining more rapidly , reaches a low final level , and the clams show a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern beds . " This situation was found by the same authors in another paper to apply to Washingtonand Alaska cockles ( Cardium corbis , ? 259 ) . The species illustrated , ranging from the Bering Sea in the north , is said to extend as far south as San Luis Obispo , but it is rarely seen along the central California coast . In this connection it should be noted that specimens may be lethal for food at times during the summer , owing to mussel poisoning ( ? 158 ) . Up to 80 per cent of these clams , according to canners , carry an Internal commensal , the nemertean worm , Malacobdella grossa . The percentage of clams so accompanied increases toward the north . MacGinitie , in a verbal communication , reported this or a related form from clams at Humboldt Bay . We have taken it also , but sparsely ( only one was found in a lot of several dozen Siliqua ) , along the open sand beaches near Queets , central Washington . These flatp140nemerteans , up to 1% " in length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucker and feed on minute plankton in the water passing through the gills . Seemingly they have no harmful effect on the host. ? 190 . The Pismo clam , Tivela stultorum ( Pl . XXIX ) , does not merely tolerate surf ; it requires it . Clams removed from their surfswepthabitat to lagoons and sheltered bays to await shipment live but a few days , even though tidal exposure , temperature , and salinity are the same . Apparently Tivela has accustomed itself , through generations of living in an environment so rigorous that it would be fatal to most animals , to the high oxygen content of constantly agitated water , and has carried the adaptation to such an extreme that it can no longer survive under less violent conditions . An interesting featureof the clam 's adaptation is its inhalant siphon . Most clams live in relatively clear and undisturbed waters , but the Pismo clam , living in waters that are commonly filled with swirling sand , must provide against taking too much sand into its body with the water that it must inhale in order to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very fine net of delicately branched papillae across the opening , forming a screen that will exclude grains of sand and yet permit the passage of water and the microscopic food that it contains . Many years ago , when the Pismo clam was as common on exposedbeaches in southern California as are sand dollars on bay and estuary beaches , teams of horses drew plows through the sand , turningup the clams by the wagon load . Now adults of the species are almost unobtainable in the intertidal zone . Experienced diggers with rakes or forks work at low tide , wading out waist deep or eve ? shoulder deep , where the surf frequently breaks over them . It IS hazardous work , for the diggers must feel their way along bars that are separated from the shore by deeper channels , and now and theft the surf claims a victim . Because of this clam 's commercial importance , a good deal known of its natural history , particularly through the work Weymouth and . Herrington . During stormy weather the clams down to considerable depths to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depth about equal to the length of their shells . T ' show a strikingly constant orientation in the direction of wave action being found always with the hinged side toward the ocean . Wh they are not as active diggers as the razor clams , they can , especially when young , move rather rapidly , and given a reasonable chance dig themselves back in from the surface . Weymouth observed the " the ordinary action of the foot in burrowing appears to be supplemented in the Pismo clam by the ejection of the water within thep141mantle cavity . . . . recalling the method of jetting ' a pile , .... an important factor in moving such a bulky shell though the sand . " It is a very slow-growing form , requiring from four to seven years to reach its present legal size of 5 inches , and continuing to grow , but not so rapidly , until it is at least fifteen years old . The rate of growth varies according to a definite seasonal rhythm ? rapid in summer and slow in winter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the shell . The animal is hermaphroditic , spawns in late summer , and produces eggs , after it becomes sexually mature at the end of its second or third year , in direct proportion to its size , a large clam producing an estimated seventy-five million in one spawning season . The Fish and Game Commission takes an annual census of the animals , based on test counts in strips of beach running from the upper limit of the intertidal zone out to the water line at extreme low water . The results indicate that , despite the present restrictions ( fifteen 5-inch clams per person per day , certain areas closed , and all shipments prohibited ) , the species is in danger of becoming extinct unless still more stringent restrictions are applied and enforced . With the exception of man , the Pismo clam 's natural enemies are few . Starfish do not frequent sandy beaches , and boring snails are unable to penetrate the hard thick shells of adults . Gulls will devour small specimens that are turned up by diggers and left lying on the stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their normal buried habitat . The nearest relatives of this clam are tropical forms , and it can be considered subtropical . It ranges from Half Moon Bay to Socorro Island , off Mexico , but is not common in the northern part of its range . In Monterey Bay it is well known , but still not abundant by comparison with its occurrence on the southern beaches . The most fatuous region for Pismos at present is south of San Luis Obispo , where several towns depend chiefly for their support on tourists lured by the possibility of capturing this large delicacy . There is reason for believing that when our own beaches are depleted the coast of Lower California can be called upon to supply large quantities of Pismos . It is to be hoped that the Mexican government , which has shown itself to be wide awake in the matter of conserving wild life , ill enact and properly enforce legislation that will help Tivela to holdown .

Although we ourselves have never taken them , E. and C. Berkeley report ( 1932 ) from Long Bay , an exposed beach on thep142west coast of Vancouver Island ( in addition to abundant specimens of a nephtys , N. caeca , similar to those treated in ? 265 ) , an annelid worm which merits consideration . It is Ophelia mucronata , previouslyknown only from southern California , and is said to occur " in vast numbers whole stretches of sand being tunnelled bycountless millions . Judging by the complex system of furrows on the sand beds they inhabit , they seem to emerge from their burrows and crawl on the surface of the sand , but none were found exposed . Large flocks of sandpipers are frequently seen at low tide , extracting these worms and feeding on them . " This was decribed as a slender ophellid , 35 X 1 to 25 X 2 mm. , with triangular head , and bearing gills on the lower middle two-thirds of the body . In certain exposed sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig out the nereis-like Nainereis laevigata , which may be had sometimes by the shovelful . Except for its smaller size , this so nearly resembles Nereis vexillosa ( ? 163 ) that bait-collectorsconfuse them , swearing up and down that it is the height of folly to dig under mussels when the desired worms occur so availably in easily dug sand. ? 192 . A good many favorably known food fish , notably striped bass , are found along sandy shores just outside , or even within , the line of breakers . The live-bearing surf perch occurs similarly , but is usually too small for food . Athough these can scarcely be consideredintertidal forms , one interesting southern fish ( which has been reported in Monterey Bay also ) actually comes high into the intertidal zone for egg deposition . This is the famous grunion , Leu  --  resthes tenuis , a smelt about 6 " long . The egg-laying time of the grunion is holiday time for tremendous numbers of southern Californians . Along the coast highways cars are parked bumper to bumper for many miles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . The fish are caught with anything available , from hats to bare hands , and are roasted over the fires , making fine fare indeed . The grunion 's extraordinary spawning habits are as perfectly timed as those of the palolo worm of the South Seas , and the timing force is as mysterious . On the second , third , and fourth nights alter the full moon ? in other words on the highest spring tides ? in the months of March , April , May , and June , and just after the tide has turned , the fish swim up the beach with the breaking waves to the highest point they can reach . They come in pairs , male and female . The female digs into the sand , tail foremost , and deposits her eggs some three inches below the surface . During the brief processe the male lies arched around her and fertilizes the eggs . With the wep143of the next wave the fish slip back into the sea . Normally the eggs remain there , high and dry , until the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash them out of the sand .. Immediately on being immersed the eggs hatch , and the larvae swim down to the sea . It is an astounding performance . If the eggs were laid on any other tide , or even an hour earlier on the same tide , they would probably be washed out and so destroyed . If they were laid at the dark of the moon they would have to wait a month to be hatched , for the full-moon tides are never as high as those of the dark of the moon . But the interval between two sets of spring tides is the proper period for the gestation of the eggs and the period that the grunion contrives to utilize . Incidentally , the succeeding lower high tides actually bury the eggs deeper by piling up sand . The fish mature and spawn at the end of the first year , and they spawn on each set of tides during the season . During the spawning season their growth ceases , to be resumed afterward at a slower rate . Only 25 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 per cent the third , and none the fourth. ? 193 . The storm wrack and flotsam cast up on sandy beaches is sure to contain the usually incomplete remains of animals from other kingdoms ? representatives of floating and drifting life and of bottom life below the range of the tides . Both of these great life zones lie outside the scope of this book , and the stray specimens thrown inshore can be given but scant mention . Shells of deep-water scallops , snails , piddocks , and other clams re very commonly washed up . While perfect specimens of this sort are adequate for the conchologist , to the biologist they are merely evidence that the living animals probably occur offshore. 1n the spring of 1927 the junior writer , aboard a sailing ship a few hundred miles off the coast of central California , sailed for several ( lays through incalculable numbers of purple-sailed " floats " ? phonophores , that are locally but incorrectly called Portuguese man1-war . Often the beautifully iridescent animals were so thickly distributed that there was , by extremely rough estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea as far as the eye could reach in every direction . A little later , storms drove tremendous numbers of creatures , Velella lata ( Fig. 68 ) , ashore along the California coastperformance that is repeated once in every few years . Specimens picked up on the beach are usually dismal objects compared with the damaged living animals , but occasionally a perfect one may be found , with purple zooids trailing below the disc and even with a title goose barnacle attached . A transparent triangular sail surmounts the relatively firm body , which averages 3 " to 4 " in diameter ,  |p144so  that a very light breeze will keep the animal ( really a colony of specialized animals ) moving through the water . " Gooseberries , " the " cat 's eyes " of the fishermen , are occasionally cast up on the beach , where succeeding waves roll them around until they are broken . These are comb jellies or ctenophores , usually Pleurobrachia bachei ( Fig. 69 ) . The nearly transparent spheres , usually 1/2 " to 3/4 " in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have picked up fresh and living specimens so perfect that the iridescent paddles of the plate rows started to vibrate the moment the animals were placed in sea water . Great blubber-like masses of the jellyfish Aurelia ( ? 330 ) are often cast up in the fall , but usually so wave-torn as to be scarcely recognizable . A smaller dome-shaped jellyfish , Polyorchis ( ? 330 ) , with tentacles along the open margin of the bell , may sometimes be found in great numbers . Perfect specimens of this form will often revive in fresh sea water , swimming around vigorously by kicking the kneelikemanubrium inside the bell.  |p147THE  chief environmental factor that marks off the animals of bays , sounds , sloughs , and estuaries from all the others so far considered is the complete , or almost complete , protection from surf . This single factor , it is true , will segregate only a few animals , for of the many already mentioned a scant half dozen actually require surf , however many may tolerate it . The absence of surf , however , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidental standpoints a coherent treatment of the animals living on completely sheltered hores is desirable . For one thing the tides in such locations arevariably later , often , as in parts of Puget Sound and the insideaters of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska , many hourster . The result is that the intertidal areas are bared during the heat of the day or the chill of the night , necessitating the ability on thert of the shore animals to withstand temperature changes farcater than animals in corresponding positions on the outer coaster have to meet . The " completely protected " shore animals must so tolerate more variable salinity , which is decreased by fresh-waterreams and sometimes increased to a considerable degree by evaporationfrom quiet shallow areas . All together , the animal communitiesthis environment are characteristic and very different , howevermuch of a potpourri they may be from a geographical and ecologicalstandpoint . Such previously encountered environments as rocky shores and dv beaches will be found in these sheltered waters and , in addition , gravel beaches and mud flats . Each type of shore has an assemblage specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost anywhere and a few strays from neighboring environments.  |p148HERE  we shall find many animals that will be recognized as having occurred outside , plus many that , finding no rigorous wave shock , creep up from deeper water . The fauna of such environments is particularly well developed on the reefs and cliffs at the south end of Newport Bay , along the railway embankment in Elkhorn Slough , in the San Juan Islands and other parts of the Puget Sound region , and in hundreds of places in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska . Although , as on the outer coast , the highest fixed and lethargic animals are barnacles , limpets , and littorines , it necessarily follows from the lack of surf that their absolute level ( allowing for tidal differences ) is lower . That is , since spray and waves will not ordinarilycome up to them , they must go down to the water , and instead of ranging several feet above high-tide line they will be found at or a little below it. ? 194 . An extremely common small barnacle of fully protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glandula , which has already been discussed ( ? 4 ) as the dominant acorn barnacle of the protected outer coast . As was pointed out in the previous account , this great variability of habitat bespeaks ; a tolerance and generalization that is uncommon among marine invertebrates . In the outer-coast environment there are wave shock , low temperature , high salinity , and plenty of oxygen . In bays and estuaries the animals must put up with variable and often high temperatures , variable and often low salinities ( because of the influx of fresh water ) , and relatively low oxygen content in the water , gaining no apparent advantage except escape from wave shock . To make the situation even more puzzling , glandula actually thrives best , according to Shelford et al . ( 1930 ) , in such regions as Puget Sound , . in enclosed bays where these apparent disadvantages are intensified , avoiding the more " oceanic " conditions of rocky channels that havep149swift currents and more direct communication with the sea . And the term " thrive " translated into figures means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there may be as many as 70,000 individuals per square meter . Another barnacle , the much larger Balanus cariosus , comes very near to reversing glandula 's strange predilections . In Puget Sound this form prefers steep shores , with strong currents and considerable wave action , that is , the nearest approach to oceanic conditions that these waters afford . When this same barnacle moves to the protected outer coast , however ( and it is fairly common as far south as MontereyBay ) , it avoids oceanic conditions most assiduously , occurring only in deep crevices and under overhanging ledges in the low zone where it finds the maximum protection available . The net result , of course , is that whether it occurs in Puget Sound or in Monterey Bay it maintains itself under the nearest possible approximation to identicalconditions ? a much more logical procedure than that of glandula . The young of cariosus have strong radiating ridges in a starry pattern and are beautifully symmetrical . An adult specimen that has not been distorted by crowding is conical , sometimes has shinglelikethatches of downward-pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter and slightly less in height . The largest specimens are found to the northward of Puget Sound , but under ideal Sound conditions the animals sometimes grow in such profusion and are so closely packed together that " lead-pencil " specimens develop which reach a height of 4 " with a diameter of less than half an inch . Test counts have shown 15,000 of these per square meter . Cariosus occurs , as a rule , at a lower level than glandula , and where the two are intermingledglandula will often be found attached to the larger form rather than to the rock . Still a third barnacle , Chthamalus dalli , occurs abundantly from Alaska to Puget Sound , filling in that region the position held by Chthamalus fissus in the south , and even extending , though not in great numbers , as far south as Monterey . It is the smallest of the lot , being about / " in basal diameter and half as high . It is a definite and cleancut form , never crowded and piled together like cariosus , although one test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square meter . In the Puget Sound region it will be found chiefly interspersed with B. glandula , rarely or never competing with the lower cariosus . It is very hardy , however , for it can tolerate , at one extremity , high salinity , and at the other small enclosed bays where there is so much fresh water or decaying vegetation that no other barnacles can survive . Only in the latter environment will it ever be found in pure stands . This small form shows particularly well the sixp150equal plates or compartments of which the shell is composed . The various species of Balanus have six also , but they are unequal in size and overlap irregularly , so that it is often difficult to make them out . Many species of barnacles resemble each other so closely that it is usually hopeless for the beginner to try to identify them surely . However , the collector who is sufficiently interested to dry the specimensand separate the valves can probably determine their species through the use of Pilsbry ( 1916 ) , listed in the bibliography. ? 195 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acmaeapelta olympica is foremost , a variety of the shield limpet mentioned in ? 11 , by far the commonest limpet in southern Puget Sound and often the only one , on rocks , on gravel , and on piling . Great colonies of small specimens occur high up with the small barnacles , on smooth rocks and on the shells of mussels . Farther down ? and these animals occur at least to the zero of tide tables ? they are solitaryand larger . The dingy little A. digitalis 06 ) occurs also , but only in the more exposed parts of the Sound , and both the plate limpet 025 ) and the low-tide dunce-cap limpet 0117 ) exceed it in abundanceaccording to the published lists . A common Puget Sound periwinkle , especially in the quiet waters where the barnacle B. glandula and the quiet-water mussel thrive , is Littorina sitchana ( Fig. 70 ) , usually under % " in diameter and havinga gaping aperture . In the less protected parts of the Sound , with the Balanus cariosus ? California mussel association , the small , crossstitchedsnail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common form . Farther north a few of the cosmopolitan L. saxatilis ( formerly rudis ) will be seen . Recent tagging experiments indicate that the littorines are great stay-at-homes , never migrating from the immediate neighborhood of the pool in which they happen to have been born . The purple shore crabs ( Hemigrapsus nudus , ? 27 ) cavort around rocky beaches in Puget Sound , and on gravel shores mix with their pale and hairy brothers , H. oregonensis ( ? 285 ) . The latter , however , distinctly prefer regions where there is some mud , while the former are equally partial to rocks . In San Francisco Bay oregonensis is the common form. ? 196 . Small hermit crabs with granulated hands , Pagurus granosimanus , appropriate the shells of the northern periwinkles . These hermits , which we have previously noted as occurring in the minority among the dominant P. samuelis ( ? 12 ) in Monterey Bay , differ from their very similar relatives in a few slight anatomical characters . Their external characteristics , however , may serve to identify them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , granosimunus lacks the more southern form 's slight hairiness , and in the second itP151is typically the smallest intertidal hermit to be found in Puget Sound . Beyond that lies color ? and confusion .. Not only is there likely to be great color variation in a large number of the animals herein listed , but it is apparently impossible to find any two persons who will use the same color terms in describing an animal even if they are looking at the same specimen . As an experiment we submitted one specimen to three people and got three sets of color terms with almost no overlapping . One writer describes this particular hermit as " bully olive to olive " with " porcelain blue " granules on the claws . Our own description , boldly set forth in the first-draft manuscript of this book and now offered dubiously , is " dull red to bright red in all-over color . " The harassed amateur collector can do no better than find an undoubtedspecimen and make his own color chart ? a chart that will very likely have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. granosimanus ranges from Unalaska to Todos Santos Bay , but is relatively uncommon below Puget Sound. ? 197 . The animals mentioned so far differ only in species from comparable forms familiar to the reader . The same thing is true of the mussel , Mytilus edulis , but it is an exclusively quiet-water animal and notable for its wide distribution ? literally around the world in North Temperate regions . The rich beds along the coasts of England and France provide great quantities for food and bait for commercial fisheries , and on the west coast of France they are cultivated very much as oysters are cultivated in other places . When " farmed " they grow larger than in the typically overcrowded natural beds . M. edulis is wedge-shaped and rarely more than 2 " long , and the shell is smooth , whereas that of californianus ( ? 158 ) is ridged . Sometimesthe battle for living space drives it to establish itself on gravel beaches . We found a particularly fine example of this in Hood Canal , a long arm of Puget Sound , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The byssal threads were so closely intertwinedthat one could tear the bed away from the gravel in a solid blanket-like mass , exposing the hosts of small animals that lived beneath it . In Puget Sound and northward to Alaska this mussel occurs in tremendous quantities . It may be expected also in nearly every quietterbay southward of Puget Sound as far as Lower California , buter as commonly as in the north . A few anemic-looking specimensn he found on gravel banks and rocky points in San Francisco Bay , but most of those that have survived the Bay 's contamination occur on wharf piling . A parasitic copepod , Modiolicola gracilis , has recently been reported from the gill region of Elkhorn Slough specimens.  | ? 198 . Under the crust formed by mussels on gravelly shores there is an important and characteristic assemblage of animals . There are few species , but tremendous numbers of individuals ; and of the larger forms the commonest , to the eternal joy of bait-gatherers , is a small and quiet-water phase of the segmented worm Nereis vexillosa ( ? 163 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bug , Exosphaeroma oregonensis ( Fig. 71 ) , less than 1/4 " long , flaunts its belief in large and frequent families . The averageunder-crust population of this squat isopod with its widely separatedeyes will run many dozen to the square , foot in Puget Sound , and it is the commonest pill bug in San Francisco Bay . Heretofore it has been recorded from Alaska to Pacific Grove only , but we have found specimens in the shelly substratum as far south as Lower California . There are several ribbon worms , notably our acquaintance , Emplectonemagracile , the pale yellow-green rubber-band nemertean ( ? 165 ) from under open-coast mussel clusters , and the purple or brown form ( Paranemertes peregrina , ? 139 ) that occurs under rocks . Small individuals of the northern blenny ( Anoplarchus cristigalli , ? 240 ) will be seen . The infrequent bare spaces on the sides of mussel-covered stones , but chiefly the crevices , may be occupied by an encrusting sponge , Haliclona rufescens ( similar to the outside form treated in ? 31 ) , describedoriginally as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the starfish , Pisaster ochraceus ( ? 157 ) , haunts the mussel beds in completely sheltered waters as does its rough-water relative the beds of larger mussels on the open coast . Confertus may be found in the lower zone as well as in the middle zone , but we have never seen it below the low-tide line a fact entirely consistent with its unfriendly relationship with mussels . On certain quiet-water gravelly and rocky shores in Puget Sound and British Columbia , to which region the animal is restricted , most of the specimens are colored a vivid violet. ? 200 . The common quiet-water snails are the purples ? various species of Thais , especially Thais canaliculata ( Pl . XXX ) , the channeledpurple , and Thais launellosa ( Pl . XXX ) , the highly variables wrinkled purple . These two replace here the Tegula of protectedp153outer-coast rocky beaches . Both range from Alaska to Monterey Bay and are common in the Sound and in San Francisco Bay . Thais is the snail whose progeny practice cannibalism while still in the egg capsule , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its great variation in shell structure . Specimens living on rough rock surfaces where there are currents or where there is some wave action have their projecting plates coarse , rugged , and relatively abbreviated , while specimens from rocks in quiet backwaters develop exquisite ornamentations . This is an interesting correlation between habitat and structure . Animalsliving in swift currents would be at a disadvantage in the possessionof projecting flat surfaces ; thus utilitarianism appears to be , in this case , the determining factor in limiting what is presumably the animal 's natural tendency toward ornamentation . Locally , Searlesia dira , the elongate " dire whelk , " may be abundant , especially to the north , where in the quiet pools and channels of northern British Columbia it becomes the commonest littoral snail . A murex , P. foliata of ? 117 , also occurs in these northern waters ? surprisingly for a relative of these tropical shells ? as one of the three very common snails in certain locally rich pockets , as at Fisherman 's Cove , south of Prince Rupert. ? 201 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hairy hermits , Pagurus hirsutiusculus ( Pl . XXX ) , which , in quiet northern waters , attain great size . At Friday Harbor specimens have been taken with 2-inch bodies and an over-all length of more than 3 inches . The animal 's extreme range is Alaska to Lower California , hut south of Puget Sound the specimens are smaller and less hairy . They are fairly plentiful at Elkhorn Slough , however , and are the common hermits of San Francisco Bay . To one whose acquaintance with hermits has begun with outercoastforms , those found in Puget Sound and northern inside waters will exhibit a strange trait ? a trait which we deduce to be a direct result of the great difference in environment . The outer-coast hermitswill never desert their shells except when changing to another or when dying . Usually they can not be removed by force unless they are caught unawares ( a difficult thing to do ) or are literally pulled apart . In Puget Sound , however , the animals will abandon their shells very readily ? so readily , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself holding an empty shell , the hermit having deserted in mid-air . Our unproved inference is that the presenceor absence of surf is the factor determining how stubbornly a soft-bodied hermit will cling to its protecting shell. ? 202 . The ubiquitous warty anemone , Cribrina ( aggregated phase ,   ? 24 ) , is found in the quiet waters of Puget Sound as an attractive red and green form . This anemone , with its many variants , is certainly an efficient animal , for it is universally characteristic of the north Pacific . A recent visitor from Japan reports it to be common there , where they know it as Anthopleura ( still another title for this already over-burdened form ! ) , but he considers the center of distribution to be on the American coast , since it is more variable and more highly developed here . On erect rocks of the inner waters at Sitka , an anemone that we have been provisionally considering to be Charisea saxicola is very abundant . It grows fairly high up , colonizing rock crevices and verticaland sharply sloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than it is thick , and generally dingy white to buff in color . We found it nowhere else , and Torrey ( 1902 ) records it only from " the shore rocks at Sitka , " where it was taken abundantly by the Harriman expedition. ? 203 . Everywhere on the Puget Sound rocky shores the purple shore crab , Hemigrapsus nudus ( ? 27 ) , replaces the rock crab , Pachygrapsus , of the California coast . Conditions in Puget Sound would lead one to expect Pachygrapsus there also , but for some reason , possiblythe somewhat lower winter temperatures , it does not extend that far north . The purple crab modifies its habitat somewhat with the change in regions , occurring on the California coast chiefly in the middle zone and below Pachygrapsus , but reaching considerably higher in Puget Sound . Northern specimens , however , at their best are smaller than those on the California coast , and the highest specimensare very small . Hart ( 1935 ) records females in " berry " ( ovigerous ) in April and May at Departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoeal stages and one megalope . Numerous other species already treated are frequent in Puget Sound , such as the lined chiton ( ? 36 ) and the keyhole limpet Diadora ( ? 181 ) . Small and undetermined polyclad worms similar to Leptoplana ( ? 17 ) are very common . The estuary fauna in the south derives largely from open-coast constituents . In Newport Bay great twisted masses of the tubed snails Aletes ( ? 47 ) may almost cover the rocks , and the rock oyster Chama ( 126 ) grows so thickly that it appears to form reefs. ? 204 . Along the shores of Hood Canal we have found great hordes of the tiny crustacean Nebalia ( Fig. 72 ) occurring in pack of silt among the rocks and in the organic mud under half decay masses of seaweed ( Focus and Enteromorpha ) . This is one of tit. ' weird " in-between " animals that is " neither flesh nor fowl nor red herring . " The semblance of a specimen might he made syntp155cally by slipping a small beach hopper into a clam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts are left outside . This simile is not preposterously farfetched , for Nebalia is rather closely related to the amphipods . It might be likened also to a barnacle that has never settled down , for , being a crustacean , it is of course related to the barnacles as well . The bivalved shell is attached at the very front only and is under muscular control . From the body at the hind part of the shell four pairs of swimming legs project , and to cap the animal 's idiosyncrasies it has stalked eyes like a crab . Sars remarked that these animals are " very resistant to unfavorableconditions , thriving in water which is foul with decaying matter , " and a recent investigator , Cannon , has studied their feeding habits . 1 le finds that Nebalia is another of the filter feeders , utilizing a complicatedsystem of inhalant and exhalant pumps and creating currents by oscillating certain of the body appendages , but that it feeds also on large particles . He concludes that Nebalia is not a primitive animal , as has been supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mud living . Dr. Schmitt reports specimens of this circumpolar form in the United States National Museum collections from the Pribilof s , Victoria , Friday Harbor , Catalina , and Corona del Mar , shore to sixty fathoms. ? 205 . Under the rocks there are the usual pill bugs and worms , occurring in such variety and such abundance as to distract the specialist . As in other environments , the algae provide homes for numerousisopods , the predominant species being Pentidotea resecata ( common also on eelgrass ) and Idothea urotoma ( Figs. 73 and 74 ) . The former is a yellow-brown form , just the color of the kelp to which it often may be found clinging with great tenacity . Forcibly removed , from its kelp , it seems lost until it can regain a similar position . The body is long ( nearly 2 " ) and narrow , and terminates in two jaw-likepoints . We found a particularly rich culture near Port Townd , and it occurs from British Columbia to southern California. e second species mentioned is usually less than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be noticed wherevera bit of substratum has no covering rock can usually be traced to clams , often to the chalky-shelled Venerupis ( formerly Paphia ) staminea , the rock cockle ( Pl . XXXI ) . This well-rounded clam ( celled a cockle because its strong radiating ridges suggest the true cokle ) is also known popularly as the little-neck clam , the hard-shellm , the Tomales Bay . cockle , and the rock clam . As the number ofpolar names would suggest , it is well known and is widely used for pod . In suitable localities it occurs so thickly that the valves oftenp156touch , and on the level gravel beaches of Hood Canal and such southernPuget Sound places as Whollochet Bay we have found it in such superabundance that two or three shovelfuls of substratum would contain enough clams to provide a meal for several hungry people . In October 1931 , however , we found the clams of all market species considerably depleted in the Sound country , partly , at least , because the prevalent unemployment had driven many more people than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletion had become very marked ; it was then difficult to find any large specimens . The rock cockle is a poor digger , and for that reason never lives in shifting sand where rapid digging is essential . It will be found in packed mud or in gravel mixed with sand , but seems to prefer clayey gravel , where it usually lies less than eight inches below the surface . Where these favorable conditions exist it grows almost equally well in isolated bits of the protected outer coast . At several points , especiallyTomales Bay , the clam assumes some commercial importance , and at many other places it is an attraction to tourists . Open-coast specimens should be used warily during the summer , on account of " mussel poisoning " ( ? 158 ) . Typical specimens seldom exceed 3 " in length , although larger ones may be taken from below the low-tide level . In the vicinity of Sydney , British Columbia , at least , according to work done by Fraser and Smith , spawning takes place in February and March , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of growth , being determined by the extent and constancy of the food supply , seems to depend on the animal 's position in relation to tidal currents and on the degree of protection from storms , rather than on the character of the beach . Growth is relatively slow ; at the end of the second year , when about half of the animals spawn , the average length is only 25 mm. , and , when the balance spawn , a year later , only 35 mm . Psephidia lordi ( Fig. 75 ) is a small secondary clam of some importance in Puget Sound and to the northward , having a total range of Unalaska to Lower California . It has a polished and gleaming white or light olive shell that is somewhat triangular in shape , flatter than that of the rock cockle , and usually only a fraction of its size . In the Puget Sound area the most obvious and abundant animal . of the low-tide rocky channels are a large starfish , a green urchin , aP157tubed serpulid worm of previous acquaintance , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The starfish Evasterias troschelii ( Plate XXXI ) can , it is suspected , be considered as a mainly subtidal animal , but in quiet waters , too stagnant even for Pisaster , it is very much a feature of the low intertidal zone and therefore deserves consideration here even though its proper habitat is below our scope . Elsewhere , it takes up the starfish burden where , in the matter of vertical zoning , the commonPisaster drops it . Except that in a large number of specimens the average Evasterias has a smaller disc , more tapering arms , and a slimmer and more symmetrical appearance than the common starfish , the two are much alike and are sure to be confused by the amateur collector . Since both occur so frequently in the same region , the interestedobserver will want to differentiate them .. This can be done readilywith a pocket lens , or even with a keen naked eye . On the under side of the rays , and among the spines just bordering the groove through which the tube feet are protruded , Evasterias has clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common Pisaster . At Departure Bay , and elsewhere on the inside coast of VancouverIsland , this starfish occurs in great numbers , but although it is recorded from Unalaska to Carmel Bay the shore collector will seldom see it south of Puget Sound . Dr. Fisher , the final authority on starfish , distinguishes several forms , but considers the animal to be one of the most variable of starfish . Specimens with a diameter of 2 ' or more are not rare . Sexual maturity comes in June , July , and August . A good many Evasterias have polynoid worms living commensally in the grooves under the rays . Johnson noted , more than thirty years ago , that several of these , Arctonoe ( formerly Halosydna ) fragilis , might be found in a single specimen. ? 208 . The very fragile starfish Orthasterias koehleri , also chiefly subtidal and occurring probably less than one per cent as frequently as Evasterias , may occasionally be found in the lowest intertidal zone at Departure Bay and Friday Harbor . It is a striking and brilliant form . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are white or light purple and are set against a background of red marked with yellow . Strangely , this apparently quiet-water animalis fairly common in the subtidal zone in Monterey Bay , straying , on rare occasions , just above the lowest of low tides . Even more strangely , it has been found there in surf-swept regions , but probably creeps up into the influence of waves only when the surf is light . Dr. Fisher records the range as Yakutat Bay , Alaska , to Santa Rosa Island , off southern California , and remarks : " Northern specimensp160Purpura foliata ( ? 117 ) , may be found this far down also , associated with the Oregon triton , but its center of distribution is thought to be higher in the intertidal . Only the correspondingly largest intertidal hermit crab on the coast would have any use for so huge a shell as the Oregon triton 's , and we find such a hermit in Pagurus beringanus . The only other large hermit common on shore in the Puget Sound region and lower British Columbia is the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 201 ) . The former has granules and short scarlet spines on the hands , but no true hair . The general color is brown with scarletand light green markings. ? 215 . Two other common shelled snails , Trichotropis cancellata , the checkered hairy snail , and Crepidula nivea , the northern slipper shell , are illustrated in Figures 77 and 78 . The blue top shell , Calliostoma costatum , with contrasty yellow shell , ranging from Alaska to San Diego on the protected outer coast , occurs in these quiet waters also , and is particularly abundant in Puget Sound , under overhangs and in rocky crevices fairly well up , and thence clear into the subtidal ( Pl . XXVIII ) . ? 216 . The tunicate Cnemidocarpa finmarkiensis ( Fig. 79 ) , formerlyStyela stimpsoni , has an extraordinarily bright red test ( shell ) that makes it one of the most conspicuous animals in the Puget Sound region . The crater-like projections ? the excurrent and incurrent siphons that provide the animal with water for respiration and for the contained food particles ? are rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these orifices have considerablepower of contraction , closing almost completely under unfavorableconditions . We have found eggs in August . The stalked Styela gibbsii , as found under rocks at Pysht ( near the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca ) and probably in many other places , is a small and short-stalked edition of the tunicate so well developed on wharf piling ( Fig. 107 ) . The former is interesting in that it plays host to several other animals : a commensal pea crab ; the parasitic and degenerate cirripede Peltogaster , one species of which is sometimes found on hermit crabs ; and a vermiform copepod , Scolecimorpha huntsm.ani , which more nearly resembles a degenerate isopod . Halocynthia haustor (   . XXXII ) , another large Puget Sound tunicate ( often several inches long ) , has a bumpy test covered with all sorts of foreign material ? a veritable decorator crab among tuni cates . Its counterpart in Newport Bay , and more rarely at Elklhorn Slough , is the similar H. johnsoni ( ? 335 ) , common under and along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many commonly , but for their sometimes difficult determination the reader must be referred to the scattered literature. ? 217 . The rock oyster or jingle shell , Pododesmus macroschisma ( Fig. 80 ) , occurs fastened to Puget Sound reefs just as a similar but smaller jingle , Anomia peruviana , occurs in the quiet bays of southern California . Curiously , both of these are associated with similar-lookingbut widely differing tube masses , Serpula in Puget Sound and Aletes in southern California . Pododesmus is one of various animals that are called jingles presumably because of the sounds made by dead shells on shingly beaches . The valves are thin , and the adherent valve has a notched foramen or opening through which passes the byssus that attaches the animal to its support . Large specimens may be more than 3 " in diameter . The range is from Bering Sea to Lower California . Below Puget Sound specimens will be found on wharf piling almost exclusively . Old shells of this and other mollusks , north of Puget Sound and clear into Alaska , are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pores , evidences of the work of Cliona celata , the boring sponge . Break apart one of the shells so eaten ? they are fragile and crumbly if the process is well advanced ? and note how the interior is composed almost entirely of the yellow spongy mass . In the Monterey Bay region Cliona attacks the shells of abalones , but usually only those growing in deep water , and the sponge is not in any case the important littoral feature that it becomes up north . Oyster shells in southern California estuary regions may be overgrown exteriorly with a sponge , Hymeniacidon ( ? 183 ) , encounteredalso in wave-swept crevices. ? 218 . Enclosed in Newport Bay is a stretch of fully protected reef that is the counterpart of Puget Sound reefs . In its unfortunatelysmall area at least two Panamanian animals , neither of which it known to occur commonly elsewhere along the California coast , maintain an extreme northerly outpost . The first is a rather beautiful gorgonian , Muricea californica , that is related to the " sea fans " and " sea whips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the vertical cliff face . The minute zooids that extend from thenches when the animal is undisturbed are in pleasantly contrastingkite . Clusters may be more than 6 " in length and as large aroundone 's fist . The second is the pale urchin , Lytechinus pictus , about 172 " in meter , a light gray form that occurs abundantly in the Gulf of lifornia . This Newport Bay region appears to be more plentifully pplied with urchins ( as to number of species ) than any otherp162similar area on the United States Pacific coast . Both the purple urchin and the giant red urchin may be taken along with this palegrayform on the same rocky reef , and on the neighboring sand flats the ubiquitous sand dollar occurs , and an occasional heart urchin or sea porcupine ( ? 247 ) . ? 219 . The small native oyster , with its irregular white shell , is familiar to most coast dwellers from Sitka to Cape San Lucas . Ostrea lurida ( Fig. 81 ) occurs characteristically in masses that nearly hide the rock to which the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food because of its small size , and even now this is probably the chief factor in preventing the animal from being used for food as extensively as it deserves . People acquainted with its delectableflavor , however , often pronounce it more delicious than the larger Eastern oyster , and probably its virtues will come to be more generally appreciated . Already the cultivating of O. lurida forms a considerable industry in Puget Sound , where it is known as the Olympia oyster . It is marketed up and down the Pacific coast and is shipped to the Eastern market under refrigeration , the value of the total pack amounting to about three-quarters of a million dollars a year . In Oyster Bay , near Olympia , the method of cultivation is as follows : Low concrete dikes are built , partitioning off many acres of mud flats , which are carefully leveled , the object being to retain water when the tide goes out , so that the growing oysters are never exposed . Since oysters would smother in mud , quantities of broken shell are scattered over the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or free-swimming young attach . Nelson studied the method of attachmentof the Eastern oyster and found that a larva moves about over the selected area , testing it out with its foot . They will not settle onshellsthat are badly riddled . After choosing an attachment site one circles about , wiping its large and turgid foot over the area and extrudingenough cement to affix the left valve . The cement , which hardens in ten minutes , is secreted by a gland similar to the one which in the mussels produces the byssal hairs. * After two years the " spat , " as the young oysters are called , are transferred to more extensivebeds , and after five or six years they reach maturity and a diameter of about 2 inches . Then they are ready to market . It takes from 1,600 to 2,000 " shucked " oysters to make a gallon , solid pack . The native oyster is cultivated in Tomales Bay also , and therep163seems to be no good reason why oyster culture on this coast should not eventually rival the thriving East-coast industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Snails eat the young oysters , as elsewhere ; starfish exact some toll , and stingrays prey on the adults where the beds are not protected by wand fences . In the Puget Sound beds the oysters have accidental enemies in " crawfish " ? the mud shrimp , Upogebia , and the ghost shrimp , Callianassa ? which bury many oysters with the mud carried out from their burrows and which so riddle the ground that at low tide much water drains out from the diked areas . Starfish , however , the chief liability of Eastern beds , find the combination of mud and shells not to their liking , and have never taken to raiding the West-coast beds in hordes . The introduced Eastern oyster , Ostrea virginica ( Fig. 82 ) , has never established itself on this coast , although considerable quantities are grown in San Francisco Bay , Tomales Bay , and Puget Sound from imported spat , usually in subtidal beds . A third oyster is being grown commercially from imported spat of the Japanese oyster , O. gigas . Both of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . With the Japanese oyster came a cosmopolitan anemone ( ? 224 ) , which seems to thrive somewhatbetter than the oyster ; and with the Eastern form came the oyster drill , a snail with a voracious appetite ( ? 286 ) . The sexual vagaries of the oyster are worth detailed mention . It has been known for some time that a European oyster changed its sex , and recently it has been discovered that our Eastern oyster also is what is known as a protandrous hermaphrodite . Still more recently Coe , working at La Jolla , has shown that Ostrea lurida belongs in the same category . It is never completely male or completely female , but goes through alternate male and female phases . The gonads first appear , showing no sexual differentiation , when the animal is about eight weeks old . At twelve to sixteen weeks the gonads show primitivecharacteristics of both sexes , but thereafter the male aspect developsmore rapidly until , at the age of about five months , the first spermatozoa are ready to be discharged . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have begun to change to female , and immediately after the release of the sperm the first female phase begins ? a phase which reaches its climax when the animal is about six months old . Coe reports : " Ovulation then occurs , the eggs being retained in the mantle cavity of the parent during fertilization and cleavage and through development until the embryos have become provided with a bivalved , straight-hinged shell ? a period of approximatelyten to twelve days , perhaps . It is not improbable that ovulationtakes place only when the animal is stimulated by the presencep164in the water of spermatozoa of other individual . As before , the phases overlap , so that the second male phase has begun while the embryos are still developing within the mantle cavity . The second male phase produces vastly greater numbers of sperm than the first . When they are discharged ( except a few clusters that are retained , as always ) the body of the oyster is " soft , flabby and translucent , presenting a marked contrast to its plump whitish condition preceding the discharge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the assumption of the next female role . Apparently this cycle of female , male , and recuperative phases is continued throughout the animal 's life . It is definitely affected by temperature , a lowered temperaturecausing a particular phase to be arrested or prolonged . Coe remarks : " It is not unlikely that in the colder portion of the range of the species a single annual rhythm or even a biennial rhythm may be found to occur , as is the case with the European oyster in some localities . " In Puget Sound sexual maturity comes in early summer , but in southern California , where Coe worked , spawning takes place during seven or more months of the year . The period from the fertilization of the egg to the time when the shelled larva leaves the parent is sixteen or seventeen days . The freeswimmingperiod lasts for fourteen days , after which the larva settles down , as previously described . In summing up this situation , Coe ( 1934 , American Naturalist , 48 : 236 ? 51 ) rates the Pacific oyster as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with one or the other temporarily ascendant ) , of larviparous habits , and invariably passing through the male phase first . The oviparous Eastern oyster is stated to be dioecious , that is , with sexual alternation but ordinarily lacking the side-by-side development of the gonia of both sexes , and in 3 to 30 per cent of the cases passing directly to the female phase without having first become a male . But even within the species there is much variation , the sex-differentiating factors being in a condition so labile that even a small impetus , such as food or temperaturedifferentials , may effect a drastic change . The fact that in O. virginica " most of the relatively small numbers of females are among the largest of the age group " indicates to Coe ( 1932b ) " that the female is metabolically the more active sex or that she requires better nutritive conditions in order to mature , or that sex in this species isp165so labile that the nutritive conditions of the individual at the critical period of sex differentiation determine which of the alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? 220 . In the Puget Sound area another edible shellfish , the scallop , Pecten hindsii , and other species , forms the basis of an important industry . Motor and steam trawlers sweep the bottom with nets , scooping up hundreds in a single haul . Although scallops in commerciallyvaluable quantities occur in deep water only , the collector along rocky shores will be certain to see them in the intertidal zone and below the low-tide line . All scallops are characterized by projecting " ears " on either side of the hinge and by prominent radiating ridges on the handsome shells . The species mentioned , which ranges from Bering Sea to San Diego , is rather similar in outline to P. circularis ( ? 255 and Pl . XXXVII ) , but has finer and more numerous radiating ridges . Also the left valve is a darker pink than the right . P. hindsii , like most other species , remains symmetrical throughout its life . Scallops have but one large muscle for closing the shell , instead of a large one and a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually this single muscle that is marketed , the rest of the body being thrown away , although the entire animal , as with the oysters , is edible , indeed , delicious . Next to the octopus , the scallop is the " cleverest " of all the mollusks . It is quick to take alarm , being warned of impending danger by a row of shining functional eyes along the mantle fringe , and darts away by clapping the two valves of its shell together . The motive power for this peculiar swimming is provided by two jets of water which the sudden closing of the shell drives out through openings in the mantle . Necessarily , then , the motion is hinge-first , or backwards , a reversal of the usual movement , which is slower and in the direction of the shell opening . This emergency reversing of the normaldirection of movement is characteristic of several other animals also , including the octopus . De Laubenfels remarks that very few Pecten in the Puget Sound area lack the symbiotic sponge , Ectyodoryx parasitica ( formerly Myxilla ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these occur only on scallops , and no other sponges occur thus . The Mycale " may be distinguished by comparatively coarser structure , and best by this : when torn , it reveals prominent fibers thicker than thread , absent in Myrilla " ( personal communication ) . ? 221 . Of chitons , the black Katharina 0177 ) can be expected on relatively exposed shores . The giant brick-red Cryptochiton ( ? 76 ) occurs also , but the specimens are smaller than those found on the central California coast . One or more species of Mopalia will also bep166found , as differentiated in ? 128 . M. muscosa is known to occur in such sheltered localities as Elkhorn Slough ( in the subspecies hindsii , according to MacGinitie , 1935c ) and San Francisco Bay , with a total range extending from the Shumagin Islands to Lower California . Puget Sound specimens are sexually mature in July and August. ? 222 . Not many crabs will be found walking about on top of the rocks in this low zone ? a situation quite the opposite of that existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every square foot of rock surface . The small Oregon Cancer may be taken occasionallyon the rocks , but is commoner in the under-rock habitat ( ? 231 ) . A lanky " all legs " spider crab ( Oregonia gracilis , ? 334 ) , that occurs more characteristically on wharf piling , strays into this rocky-shore region also . Another small spider crab , Pugettia gracilis , the graceful kelp crab , seems to be characteristic here , but it occurs also in eelgrass and in kelp . It looks like a small and slim P. producta ( Pl . XV ) . Like that larger kelp crab , which also is occasional in this association , the graceful one keeps its brown , yellow , or red carapace naked and smooth , not deigning to disguise itself with bits of sponge , bryozoa , or algae , as the more sluggish spider crabs do . These kelp crabs , being very active and having hooked and clawed legs which can reach almost backward , are amply able to defend themselves without recourse to such measures as masking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back , but the safe belt in the kelp crabs is narrow , and he who misses it on the first try will pay the penalty . P. gracilis ranges southward from Alaska as far , though rarely there , as southern California. ? 223 . The only other noticeable exposed crustaceans are barnacles . Except in Puget Sound and comparable waters to the northward , barnacles are rare in the very low intertidal zone , although they are everywhere tremendously common in the higher zones . It would be expected that these low-zone barnacles would be of species different from those previously treated , since the relative periods of exposure and immersion are so different . Until recently this has been assumed to be the case , but it seems to be well established now that the commonestbarnacle of this low zone is Balanus cariosus ( ? 194 ) , the same form that occurs in such tremendous numbers in the upper zone of quiet-water regions , although field identifications of barnacles are so uncertain that some of these may turn out to be Balanus nubilut ( ? 317 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve its greatestdevelopment on fairly exposed wharf pilings .. On Puget Sound rocks , however , the largest examples reach the considerable size of 3 " in basal diameter by 2/ " tall. ? 224 . Anemones , abundant on all the quiet-water rocky shop167from Alaska south , are especially noticeable in Puget Sound . Elsewherein the Pacific , the white-plumed Metridium dianthus ( ? 321 ) occurs only on piling and in deep water , but in the Sound it occurs not infrequently on the lowest intertidal rocks and ledges and in the pools , just as it does on the coast of Maine . North of Nanaimo , BritishColumbia , we have seen large numbers of them hanging pendent from the under side of strongly overhanging ledges . The large red tuberculated Tealia ( ? 65 ) is occasional , and the small semi-transparent Epiactis prolif era ( ? 37 ) , with its eggs and young in brood pits around the base , certainly attains its maximum in size , though probably not in abundance , in these quiet waters . One of the common Japanese and cosmopolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is safe to assume , along with oysters , for it has appeared at or near places where Japanese oysters are known to be grown . We have seen it above the Strait of Georgia , on Puget Sound floats with Metridium , and it has appearedsuddenly in Elkhorn Slough , in central California . It is a small form , usually under 1/2 " in diameter , but it is attractively colored ? dark green , with 4 to 48 orange stripes . If the form in question is identical with the Atlantic luciae , a good deal of information is availablein Hausman ( 1919 ) . A circumboreal form , it appeared suddenlyat Woods Hole , Massachusetts , and owing to its competitive ability and rapid asexual reproduction colonized very quickly in areas where its colors and small size conceal it effectively . Hausman found it to be a voracious feeder on small crustacea and annelids. ? 225 . Reaching its apparent southern limit at Pender Harbor , British Columbia , a large erect sponge occurs ( Pl . XXXII ) that is similar in appearance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vancouver Island . Specimens from Refuge ( ' ove are up to 8 " long . They are brightly colored with reds or lavenders that fade immediately in preservative . Forests of these upright sponges , growing at or below the lowest tide line , add something of a coral-reef atmosphere to this northern fauna . Although we have not been successful in finding it along the shore , a most interesting sponge , Choanites suberea var. lata , the home of the hermit crab , Pagurus dalli , is recorded from Puget Sound and northward as occurring in the low-tide zone as well as in deep water . Clusters of this yellow " cheesey " or carrot-like sponge may be 3 " in diameter , and are said to be pierced almost invariably with an opening that harbors the large hermit . The mutual advantages are obvious : the crab gets a protective covering , and the sponge gets plenty of food and oxygen by being so much on the move . De Laubenfels remarks that the slimy , papillated sponge Hymeni/acidon ( ? 183 ) occurs abundantly in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay , and we have noted it also in connection with oyster shells. ? 226 . In this low zone of the quiet-water rocky environment sea cucumbers are common in the south , entirely absent in Elkhorn Slough , and occasional in Puget Sound . Under rocks , however , they are common in the northern regions ( ? 235 ) . One of the strange , slug-like , creeping cucumbers , Psolus chitonoides ( Pl . XXXII ) , is a fairly frequent migrant into the intertidal zone from deep water . If seen below the surface , and unmolested , Psolus will be noted and recognizedat once . There will be a crown of gorgeously expanded tentaclesat the head end , often in rosy reds or purples contrasting with the yellow or white of the scales that cover the back , and on the soft belly are the tube feet that provide the not overly rapid locomotion. ? 227 . Terebratalia transversa ( Fig. 83 ) represents a group of animals not previously mentioned and that will be met only once again in this account . The brachiopods , bivalved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comprise a line tremendously important in past geological ages but now restricted to a few hundred species , most of which occur in deep water . The hinged valves of clams are right and left ; those of brachiopods ( sometimes called " lamp shells " ) are upper and lower and unconnected except by muscles . Again unlike clams , brachiopod shells are dissimilar in size and shape . The upper is the larger , and through an opening in its overhanging margin protrudes the fleshy peduncle by which the animal is attached to the rock . Although brachiopods of this type are usually ( and correctly ) assumed to be sessile animals , we observed that specimens taken in British Columbia were able to rotate the shell considerably on the contractile peduncle . A cluster of the living animalswill show all the shells slightly agape but ready to snap shut immediatelyat the least sign of danger . They feed on minute organic particles brought to them by the tidal currents or the slight currents created by waving the hairy tentacles on the lophophore ? a " coil spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , like other plankton-feeding forms , they must keep constantly on the job , opening their shells the instant they are unmolested . Terebratalia is restricted to the lowest part of the low intertidal zone , where it is a feature of the rocky fauna of British Columbia . It is taken occasionallyas far south as Friday Harbor , and in deep water it extends to southern California . In the summer of 1932 we found a great colony of these in a land-locked marine lake , Squirrel Cove , in southcentralBritish Columbia . This unusual environmental condition was reflected in the great size of the individual brachiopods , in their largep169number , and in the dark color of their shells . Interestingly , the very abundant Stichopus californicus ( ? 77 ) taken in this rocky lagoon were also more blackly purple than usual , higher in the littoral ( this species is more common subtidally ) , and small , climbing all about the tops and sides of the rocks . Dermasterias ( ? 211 ) taken in this assemblagewere also darker than usual. 228 . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there are no other records ) the observing amateur will sooner or later find a group of ivory-white polyps , each about half an inch long , attached to a rock on the side sheltered from the current . If disturbed , they immediately contract into stalked translucent lumps less than half of their normal length . These tiny unspectacular polyps are the parents of highly spectacular pelagic animals ? the great jellyfish ( the scypho-medusae ) that are sometimes stranded on the beach . It will be remembered that there is an alternation of generation between the relatively large and plant-like hydroids and the small freeswimmingjellyfish . The giant jellyfish also have an alternation of generation , but the attached polyp is small and rarely seen . It is this polyp , the scyphistoma of Aurelia or similar species , that will be found at or below the lowest tide line at Elkhorn Slough . We have transferred a good many examples to aquaria , where they live well , being extraordinarily tough and resistant , and have watched them with interest . They are accomplished contortionists . Fully relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of the polyp . At such times the mouth forms a raised crater in the center of the tentacles . At other times the internal anatomy will , for no apparent reason , be everted through the enormouslystretched mouth . When the animal contracts , the tentacles almost disappear , and the scyphistoma becomes merely a ball at the end of the stalk . In producing its " children " jellyfish , the polyp is modified into a " strobila " by constriction so that it is topped by a " saucer " or stack of saucers which , when budded off , become the free-swimming young , the " ephyrae , " of the giant jellyfish . The jellyfish , normally to be seen only offshore ( except in northern inside waters , ? 330 ) , produce eggs which are liberated as ciliated larvae , the " planulae . " These larvae , frequently drifting inshore , settle down to become polyps , and the cycle is complete . Several of the scypho-medusae are famous for the stinging powers of their long tentacles , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acute deductive powers of Sherlock llulmes to solve. ? 229 . Along these sheltered rocky shores there are , finally , many hydroids and bryozoa and occasional sponges , mostly of types alreadyp170mentioned .. Some of the ostrich-plume hydroids ( Aglaophenia , ? 84 ) , but more frequently the " sea firs " ( Abietinaria , ? 83 ) and the delicate , almost invisible Plumularia ( ? 78 ) will be seen . Collectors from the south will recognize a sponge cluster , Leucosolenia nautilia , similar to the California species considered in ? 93 . In the Puget Sound area we have found the erect , tree-like bryozoan , Bugula pacifica ( ? 114 ) , with some of the exposed clusters coloreda vivid salmon pink , but the more flabby European form , Bugula murrayana , restricted , in the Pacific , to this region , may be seen more commonly . The white crinkly bryozoan Menipea ( ? 112 ) occurs in these northern sounds on the roots and holdfasts of marine plants just as it does in less-sheltered areas along the California coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shells , rocks , and worm tubes as a leafy encrustation . It ranges from Alaska to central California and is common in Puget Sound . The white Membranipora ( ? 110 ) encrusts on kelp , as do the small and dainty-tubed colonies of Tubulipora flabellaris . Colonies of the latter are / " to Y2 " across , and the tubes are as hard as those of serpulid worms . This form ranges from the Sound to San Diego . A southern form , known from San Diego Bay only , is the soft Zoobotryon pellucidum , which forms great , flexible , tree-like masses . The listing of bryozoa might go on indefinitely , for more than 150 species are known from Puget Sound alone . In the Strait of Georgia Dr. O'Donoghue took some 76 species in a single dredge haul , and almost half of the total may be taken inshore . Most of us can scarcely hope to recognize more than a few . Exceedingly common in the Nanaimo region , but restricted apparentlyto such areas ( unless this is the animal taken rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gelatinous masses of a rare and curious , worm-like form , Phoronis vancouverensis , related to but not resembling the solitary phoronids ( ? 297 ) . It would be expected that bay and estuary regions in the south would have their rocky-shore fauna pretty well concentrated under rocks as protection from sun and desiccation , and that is what we find . In Puget Sound also , however , the under-rock habitat is well populated ? a fact probably attributable to the late ( diurnal ) titles which bare the intertidal areas during the heat of summer days. ? 230 . The energetic upturner of rocks will find that in sheltered waters the most obvious under-rock animals are crabs , worms , andP171sea cucumbers , and , in the north , nemerteans . Other previously encounteredanimals are the eye-shaded shrimp , Betaeus ( ? 46 ) , and the small and active bent-in-the-middle shrimp , Spirontocaris ( ? ? 62 , 150 ) , that occurs throughout our territory . Another shrimp , Hippolyte californiensis ( Pl . XXXIII ) , is fairly well restricted to quiet waters and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in crevices . At night it may be seen in great congregations swimming about among the blades of eelgrass . Like the form mentioned above , this graceful , green ( quickly turning white after preservation ) , and excessively slender shrimp has an absurd rostrum , or forward projection of the carapace . It is known from Sitka to San Diego , but is common only as far south as Elkhorn Slough . The sometimes bulging carapace is a pathological condition due to infection by a parasitic isopod , Bopyrinastriata. ? 231 . The Oregon cancer crab , C. oregonensis ( Pl . XXXIII ) , the roundest of the family , is the commonest Cancer of the Puget Sound region and is almost entirely restricted to the under-rock habitat . Its extreme range is from the Aleutians to Lower California , but it is rare south of Washington . The black-clawed Lophopanopeus bellus ( similar to L. heathii , Fig. 50 , but with slimmer big claws ) can not be mistaken , as it is the only member of its genus in the Puget Sound region and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eggs are carried in April , hatching May to August , as determined for British Columbia specimens by Hart ( 1935 ) . Northern specimens of both of these crabs are apt to be parasitized with the obvious Sacculina ( ? 327 ) , and at Sitka possibly 25 per cent of the tide-pool specimens will be so afflicted . A quiet-water porcelain crab , Petrolisthes eriomerus , may be taken in Puget Sound and in Newport Bay . It differs only slightly in appearance from the outer-coast form shown in Plate III . A reddish or brown , hairy crab , Hapalogaster mertensii ( resembling H. cavicaudaof Pl . XX except that it has tufts of bristles instead of fine hairs ) , also occurs in the under-rock environment to the north , rangingfrom the Aleutians to Puget Sound. ? 232 . Tube worms of several types will be found here , some with pebble-encrusted , black tubes up to 10 " long . Dark-colored , almost purple , specimens may be turgid with eggs , or , if light-colored , with sperm . Amphitrite robusta ( similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest and commonest . Field directions for distinguishing the several genera will be found in ? 53 ; but only a specialist , interested also in ecology , could straighten out this situation . The varying environmentshave undoubtedly exerted a selective influence on the ? 233.  |p172various  species . We ourselves have noted differences in tube constructionand in appearance of the worms predominating in waveswept , cold-water California habitats , and in quiet-water sounds , but have not been able so far clearly to correlate the data . Any of the several scale worms may take to living in the tubes of these larger and more self-reliant worms . Our friend Halosydna ( ? 49 ) , of the profitable degeneracy , is frequent ; Polynoe tuta ( ? 234 ) also occurs . Meticulous search will also reveal , in practically every tube , one or more of several pea crabs ? Pinnixa tubicola ( ? 53 ) or P. franciscana juveniles . P. schrnitti juveniles , the echiurid commensal ( ? 306 ) , have also been taken , but tubicola is by far the commonest pea crab found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quiet and in open-coast situations . The combination of tube builder , polynoid , and pea crab is , however , particularly characteristic of quiet waters . The smaller commensals apparently have adapted themselves to gathering the proverbial crumbs . There is a nice economy about the situation , for what one animal rejects as too large or too small exactly suits one of its partners. ? 233 . For a number of years we have been taking a gray , sluggish " bristle worm " from the muddy interstices of rocks dredged up from below forty fathoms in Monterey Bay . During the summer of 1930 we were surprised to find this Stylarioides papillata , apparently perfectly at home , at several points along the shore in Puget Sound . Here is another case of an animal quite competent to live in the intertidal zone once the menace of surf is done away with . It has often been said of Pacific-coast invertebrates that northern-shore forms may be found in the south , but in deep water ; and it has been assumed that the determining factor is temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature that these animals must tolerate at low tide is greater than the maximum along the Monterey shore at any time , and the northern winter temperatures are correspondingly lower . It is easy to believe , therefore , that the absence of wave shock permits a normally deep-water animal to migrate upward until it has establisheditself successfully in the lowest intertidal zone. ? 234 . Many worms will be turned up here . Nereis virens ( ? 311 ) makes semipermanent burrows where the substratum is readily penetrable . Physcosoma ( ? 52 ) occurs , and , under Puget Sound mussel beds on a gravel substratum , Nereis vexillosa ( ? 163 ) , and a variety of the proboscis worm ( ? 280 ,   . XXXIX ) , the slaty blue Hemipodus patagonicus ( formerly Hemipodia borealis ) . But of the enumerating of worms also there could be almost no end . Certainly more than a hundred could be taken , and the unfortunateaspect of the worm situation is that any of them might prove top173be common at some of the good collecting places that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty little polynoid must be mentioned , although until recently we had not known its name : this is called Polynoe tuta . It has a serpentine gait , and will literally wiggle itself to pieces when disturbed too persistently . When first molestedit will protestingly shed a few of its beautifully colored scales ; lifted from its favorite under-rock surface it immediately breaks in two , and before the transfer to jar of water or vial of alcohol can be completed the disappointed collector is left with a number of short fragments that continue the characteristic wiggle . We have never been able to keep a specimen intact long enough to photograph it . It occurs frequently also as a commensal with various tube worms ( terebellids , ? ? 53 , 232 ) . ? 235 . The large reddish cucumber seen so abundantly under rocks in Puget Sound , or between the layers of friable shale ledges , is Cucumaria miniata ( Pl . XXXIII ) , a form that reaches a length of 10 inches . The tube feet , which are arranged in rows paralleling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock very efficiently , but seem to be used rarely for locomotion . Surrounding the mouth are long and much-branched tentacles that are drawn in when the animal is disturbed or when the ebbing tide leaves it high and dry . In an aquarium they will flower out beautifully . The animal 's color varies , in different specimens , from yellow and red to deep purple . C. miniata has been variously considered as synonymous with an Oriental cucumberand with a cucumber occurring on both sides of the Atlantic , but in any case it is the North Pacific representative of a circumpolar and almost cosmopolitan form . The pentamerous symmetry that marks cucumbers as relatives of the starfish , brittle stars , and urchins is rather apparent in miniata . We were greatly surprised to find , in the spring of 1931 , several specimens of this northern animal in rock crevices near Carmel. *A smaller white cucumber , Cucumaria quinqueseznita ( see ( Pl . XXXIII ) , may be considered as living primarily under rocks , since it is rarely found elsewhere in the intertidal , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . The two double rows of long tube feet give the animal a bristly appearance . This form and miniata differ from the Stichopus we have considered earlier inp174having the tentacles around the mouth fairly long , branched , and yellow- or orange-colored . C. quinquesemita is very temperamental about evisceration . Specimens we took in the summer of 1930 at Pysht , in Juan de Fuca Strait , achieved a record of one hundred per cent evisceration in a few hours and before we could get them into anesthetizing trays . This is the more surprising when it is realized that the temperatures in the seaweed-filled buckets could not have been appreciably higher than those customarily tolerated on the tide flats during the late midsummer lows , when the sun and wind dry the algae to the point of crispness . This white cucumber ranges from as far north as Sitka to Pacific Grove , but at the latter point it occurs infrequently and then so far down as to be practically a subtidal form . In Puget Sound it is often found associated with the reddish C. miniata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new species of Cucumaria ( described by Deichman ) , which has heretofore been known from subtidal depths only . It is scarcely distinguishable from the more southerly-ranging white cucumber except that it is thinnerskinned , so that in preservation it partially constricts itself , producing many ringed wrinkles in the body wall . C. miniata has recently provided laboratory material for some preliminarystudy of invertebrate muscle tissue . The powerful retractor muscles that pull the tentacles back into safety at the least disturbance have been histologically examined , and it has been shown that , as one has always suspected , invertebrate muscle tissue differs radically in minute structure and in physico-chemical nature from comparable muscle tissue in the vertebrates . This is a field that we believe should be more thoroughly investigated . Mammalian and lower-vertebrate muscle tissue has been studied microscopically and experimentally ; chemical relaxants and contractors are known . Even crustacean muscles have received some attention . But the fascinating , unbelieveablyresistant , and apparently highly specialized muscles of such forms as Cribrina , scyphistomae , Glycera , sipunculids ( cf. Physcosoma ) , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disintegrate , are wholly unknown . In many cases it is not known whether the muscle is smooth or striped , or whether the type of innervation is automatic or voluntary . Cucumaria vega is a small black holothurian taken from low tide rock crevices at Auk Bay , north of Juneau . Another occasionally intertidal form in the Puget Sound area ( but pulled up at Pacific Grove in subtidal holdfasts of kelp only ) is the white " pepper andp175salt " Cucumaria piperata . Large and light-colored C. lubrica ( ? 176 ) may also occur here . With the northern cucumbers and elsewhere under rocks , a really gigantic flatworm , tough and firm , will sometimes be turned out , large enough to be the paternal ancestor of all the polyclads the southerncollector will have seen . This Cryptophallus magnus , which we have taken at Sitka , in British Columbia at several points , and on the rocks near Port Orchard , is reported to be common in the San Juan region by Freeman , its describer ( 1933 ) . Individuals are reported up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo-negative ? light-shunning ? andC. magnus , taken on the under sides of rocks or in deep crevices , is no exception , although a diver working in these rocks at high tide or at night no doubt would find them crawling about on the upper surfaces actively enough . A specimen taken during the summer of 1935 seems to have attempted to engulf the soft parts of a limpet when , en route from tide pool to laboratory , it and others were placed in a jar of miscellaneous animals . A colored illustration of this form appears as Figure 4 , Plate IV , in Johnson and Snook ( 1927 ) . Another smaller ( to 4 X 1 cm. ) , thinner , and more delicate polyclad , often secured with the above , is probably the Notoplana segnis reported by Freeman as abundant around Friday Harbor . The brittle star , Ophiopholis aculeata ( ? 122 ) , occurs frequently enough in beds of C. miniata , especially north of Puget Sound , so that the presence of one can almost be considered an index of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned up colonies of large examples , up to 5 " in diameter , literally by the hundreds , and associated with Cucumaria so that several individuals would be found clinging to each cucumber . Mixed up into the assemblage characteristicallyare dozens of the " peanut worms , " Physcosoma ( 02 ) , larger and darker in color than the possibly more numerous individualsavailable at Monterey. ? 236 . Along the California coast south of Los Angeles , octopi ( ? 135 ) have moved into estuaries where there are suitable pools containingrocks arched over the mud . Living in such mud-rock caverns in quiet waters they attain , when unmolested ( which they rarely can be in this heavily populated country ) , sizes that are large for their usually small species .. Wherever numerous enough , they might be considered dominant animals , for their size , strength , and cunning put them pretty well in control of their surroundings. ? 237 . In the northern waters there are several under-rock chitons that we have met before , noticeably the small , red-marked Ischnochiton tnertensii ( ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska to Lower California , it is listed here as well as in ? 36 because it seems to be characteristic of the quiet-water , underrockassociations in Puget Sound . It is a broad oval in outline , is colored a dull olive green , and is rarely more than an inch long. ? 238 . Under rocks in such varied quiet waters as those of DepartureBay and Pender Harbor , British Columbia , and Elkhorn Slough and Newport Bay , California , we have found a flat encrusting sponge described originally from the central California estuary as Mycale macginhtiei , yellow , smooth , and slightly slippery to the touch , although it has stiffening spicules and is marked by furrows . An additional characteristic is that it adheres closely to the rock , probably by slightly penetrating the pores . Also , just by way of passing interest to zoologistswho have seen the true slime sponge elsewhere , a species of Halisarca , H. sacra , is known to occur at Elkhorn Slough , along with Mycale , but always below low water . Since there are various additionalspecies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters alone , could be confused with the above and with previously treated species , the value of careful laboratory work should be kept in mind . For the necessary technic , see de Laubenfels ( 1932 ) , page 4. ? 239 . The rubbery nemertean worms will often be seen under rocks in the north . Two fairly common forms especially are sure to be seen sooner or later and will occasion excited comment . Both are brilliantly scarlet , brighter than most reds even in the brilliant tide pools , large ( to 3 meters , although the average will be no more than a couple of feet ) , and both occur under loosely imbedded stones , especially on gravel substratum , from Dutch Harbor clear into Puget Sound . But they may easily be differentiated . Carinella rubra is soft and rounded , very distensible , sluggish , and apt to be coiled in angular folds . The head is wide and rounded , pinched off from the rest of the body . We have found this to be one of the very common and characteristicunder-rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Deep Cove , for instance , in the summer of 1935 , almost every suitable stone upturned revealed one of these brilliant worms in an apparently fabricated mild depression . Cerebratulus nzontgorer yi , however , is ribbon-like and flattened , with longitudinal slits on the sides of the head , which is tipped with white , and with lateral thickeningsextending to thin edges ( probably correlated with its swimmingability ) running the entire length of the body . Cerebratulus is famous for fragmenting at even the slightest provocation ; but this species , Coe remarks , lacks that trait to the extent that specimens may be killed whole by immersion in hot formalin. ? 240 . At least one vertebrate belongs with the under-rock fauna from Puget Sound clear into Elkhorn Slough ? the grunting fish ,  |p177Porichthys  notatus , possibly better known as the midshipman , for its pattern of round sense organs is reminiscent of the buttons of a naval uniform . At night these " buttons " are luminescent . The eggs , each the size of a small pea , are deposited in handful clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . On one Puget Sound beach , in the summer of 1929 , we found a small boy capturing the fish for food , using a method that must have seemed , to the fish , to violate Queensbury rules . He poked a slender stick under each likely rock and listened . If a midshipman grunted , he reached under with a heavier stick made into a gaff by the attachment of a large fish-hook . A quick jerk , and another betrayed grunter was added to his string . One of them came off the string , however , after certain negotiations , and was added to our chowder , with satisfactory but not phenomenal results . Blennies will also be found commonly in this zone under rocks in Puget Sound ? Anoplarchus cristigalli and similar forms ( see Epigeichthys , Pl . IX ) , such as will have been seen higher up ( ? l9S ) . ? 241 . In a few features the animals of the under-rock substratum , and also the animals living on the rocks , differ in quiet waters from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often completely honeycombed by the burrowing date mussel , Lithophaga plumula ( Pl . XXXIV ) , which we have never seen on the exposed coast . Quite possibly the answer in this case is temperature . The date mussel is a tropical form and might reasonably be expected to find the warm , sun-steeped climate of Newport Bay more to its liking than the climate of the colder , wave-swept shore outside . The date mussel is a close relative of the common mussel , but has two important differences directly connected with its mode of life . One is that it produces an acid which attacks calcareous rocks , such as limestone . By means of this acid , secreted by a special gland , the animal excavates a home having a high degree of protection . It maintainscommunication with the outside world through its siphons , obtainingits oxygen and microscopic food , like all of its relatives , from the stream of water that flows in and out of the double siphon . Obviously this chemical boring involves another problem , which might be stated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mussel 's acid secretion attacks calcareous matter . Minor premise : The date mussel 's own shell is calcareous . Conclusion : The date mussel 's acid secretion attacks its own shell . The factor so fatuously overlooked is the animal 's second difference from related forms . P178Covering the date mussel 's shell is a thick brown layer of horny materialwhich is resistant to the acid . It is the color of this protective layer , as well as the shape of the shell , that has given the animal its popular name. ? 242 . Another bivalve , Pholadidea penita , the common piddock or rock clam ( Pl . XXXIV ) , drills into rock so hard that nothing short of a sledge hammer powerfully swung will break into the burrows , and it apparently drills without the aid of chemicals , using mechanical means only . The animal twists and rocks itself on its round muscle foot ( which takes the form of a suction disc that grips the rock ) , pressing its rough valves outward at the same time so as to bring them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of drilling is necessarily slow in direct ratio to the hardness of the rock , partly because the continual wearing away of the shell by the grinding process must be compensated for by growth . In their recent book , The Seas , Russell and Yonge express the opinion that although no acid-forming gland can be found in the piddocks there must neverthelessbe some chemical action , for while the head of the burrow is unquestionably excavated by mechanical action the outer part of the burrow , too , through which the soft siphons protrude , is enlarged . They sometimes bore , however , in rock , such as sandstone , that is immune to chemical action . This rock clam or piddock occurs , in deep water at least , throughoutits range from Alaska to Ecuador , but it seems to colonize in the intertidal zone in quiet water only . It has caused considerable damage to concrete harbor works on this coast . One investigation revealed the fact that more than half of the concrete-jacketed piles at four differentplaces in Los Angeles Harbor were being attacked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some cases the animalshad turned aside after penetrating the concrete jacket , in order to avoid entering the wood . The rock-boring clams are sometimes used for food , but he who gets a meal of them will have earned it. ? 243 . The burrows of dead rock-borers are likely to be appropriatedby any of several homeseekers . The most numerous of these is the porcelain crab of wharf pilings ( ? 318 ) , but it has not adapted itself as completely to the borrowed home as has a large suckered flatworm ( probably Stylochoplana heathi ) which resembles Planocera ( Fig. 6 ) in outline . This worm has the gray-brown color so common to retiring animals , and is very sluggish . It is firm in texture and outline , but when routed out of its quiet nest it curls itself up ever so slowly . Most polyclad worms crawl about and eat detritus that works into rock crevices . It would be interesting to determine if this one ? 244.  |p179de|pends  for its food on what the slight currents may bring it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something to eat. ? 244 . In the substratum between rocks , and ranging in its circumpolardistribution at least as far south as Puget Sound , is the burrowinganemone , Edwardsiella sipunculoides , which is similar to the Edwardsiellaof Figure 95 . It is a dull-brown form , with long transparent tentacles , and shows but faintly the eight longitudinal bands that are reputed to distinguish it from other anemones . A more readily apparentdifference is that it has no attachment disc , living simply loosely buried in the soil. ? 245 . Nearly any of the animals that occur in the low-zone substratumin protected outer-coast areas may be taken here also ? a state of affairs that would be expected from the obvious fact that in the substratum the degree of protection does not vary greatly between the two regions . Because of their abundance , mention should be made of the transparent , worm-like cucumber , Leptosynapta ( ? 55 ) , the soft blue burrowing shrimp , Upogebia ( ? 313 ) , and the clam Venerupis(Paphia) ( ? 206 ) , that spouts from between tide-pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimp , Pseudosquilla ( ? 146 ) , is taken infrequently far under loosely imbedded rocks . There are in the fully protected waters of Alaska ( as at Jamestown Bay , Sitka , and Auk Bay , Juneau ) such characteristic forms as the echiurid , E. pallasii ( treated in ? 306 with mud-flat forms ) , the ubiquitous peanut worm ( ? 52 ) , and a slimy , apodous cucumber , Chiridota albatrossi . This last slim and slug-like form , covered with peppery black dots , may be 5 " or 6 " long , the otherwise smooth skin bearing the calcareous white particles ? " anchors , " mentioned already in connection with Leptosynapta ( ? 55 ) .  |p180IN  quiet-water beaches of fairly pure sand , where there is no eelgrass , we find a type of region that , from the point of view of many animals , must seem Utopian . The usual environmental problems are almost entirely lacking ? a fact which undoubtedly accounts , in part , for the extraordinary richness of the sand bars in Newport Bay and parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be withstood ; the substratum is soft enough so that feeble burrowing powers will suffice and yet not so soft as to require special adaptations to avoid suffocation ; there is no attachment problem , for a very little burrowingis enough to secure the animals against being washed out by the innocuous currents ; and a little more burrowing protects them from sunlight and drying winds . These pure sands are likely to contain little organic food , by comparison with the rich stores of mud flats and eelgrass beds , but every tide brings in quantities of plankton , and such predaceous animals as require firmer food can prey on each other . There is usually , however , something wrong with apparent Utopias . In this case the elimination of the struggle against natural conditions results in proportionately keener competition among the animals , and overcrowding is the rule . There is no obvious zonation in areas of pure sand , but the region corresponding to the lowest zone of other shores is , for most of the animals , the only one that is habitable . The crowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sparsely inhabited it is scarcely worth while to explore sand flats except on tides below the zero of the tide tables. ? 246 . The sand dollars definitely belong in this environment , and occur in tremendous numbers . Their round shells are 3 " to 4 " in diameter , very flat , and colored so deep a purple as to be almost black . At first glance they seem to have little resemblance to other urchins , but urchins they are . The spines , instead of being 3 " or 4 " long as in the giant red urchin of the outer coast , are about 1/1s " long and so closely packed as to make the animal look and feel as though it were covered with velvet . The tube feet are there , too , visible to the naked eye if one looks closely enough . In motion the spines and tube feet give an impression of changing light rather than actual motion , The five-pointed design on the back , another urchin characteristic , is vis/ible in the living animal , but is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast up on exposed beaches as to lead many people to believe that the living animals must occur near by . They do ? in deep water . The sand dollar avoids surf at all times , and will seldom be found alive by the shore collector except on these completely sheltered flats . When a low tide leaves the animals exposed , they will ordinarily be found lying flat , partly or completely buried . When still water covers them , they stand vertically , with two-thirds of the disc buried in the sand ; but when there is a current , they lean away from it at an angle that is uniform throughout the entire bed and apparently in direct proportion to the strength of the current . Sand dollars scour the sand for minute edible particles , selecting particularly tasty grains covered with diatoms and using the tube feet to pass them into the mouth ? a food-getting process in contrast with that of many other sand-living forms , which pass great quantities of sand through their intestines in order to extract from it whatever nourishment it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eggs and sperm being extruded from different individuals for chance union and the development of free-swimming larvae that bear no resemblance to the adults . In Puget Sound sexual maturity comes in late spring , and in Elkhorn Slough specimens with ripe eggs and sperm have been taken in August . Two species occur on this coast . The common form from Alaska to Lower California is Dendraster excentricus ( Pl . XXXV ) , with the star design off center and consequently a bit lopsided . We have seen great beds of them in southern Puget Sound , Elkhorn Slough , NewportBay , San Diego Bay , and in El Estero de Punta Banda , just south of Ensenada . The other species , Echinarachnius parvna , is even flatter and is more symmetrical , the pentamerous design centeringat the apex of the shell . It is a circumpolar form , known on this coast from Alaska to Puget Sound . Working with the latter , Parker and Van Alstyne ( 1932 ) found that burrowing and most locomotion is a function , not of the tube feet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of co-ordinated spine movements , " the cilia being " concerned only in feeding , cleansing and respiration . " ? 247 . A red to rose-lavender heart urchin or sea porcupine will be found occasionally on the southern sand flats , where it lies half buried near the extreme low-tide line . This Lovenia cordiformis ( I'l . XXXV ) , while by no means common in the intertidal , still occursoften enough to provide an excellent argument against barefootedcollecting , and unless handled carefully it can inflict painful wounds on bare hands . Ordinarily the long sharp spines point back/ward , their thrusting effect aiding the animal to walk through the sand ; but they bristle up in a formidable manner when their owner is disturbed . We have seen specimens during the winter at Newport Bay , which probably represents the northern limit of their range. ? 248 . Renilla kollikeri ( formerly called R. amethystina ) , the sea pansy , is one of the most obvious animals of the southern mud flats . When seen in their natural habitat , sea pansies seem misnamed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their stalks buried . A specimen should be transferred to a porcelain or glass tray containing clean sea water and left undisturbed for a time . The disc will there enlarge to three times its size when taken from the sand , and scores of tiny hand-shaped polyps , beautifully transparent , will expand over the purple disc . Not the least of the sea pansy 's charms is the blue phosphorescent light which it will almost invariably exhibit if mildly stimulated with a blunt instrument after being kept in the dark for an hour or so . In Newport Bay sea pansies occur by the hundred , in El Estero de Punta Banda by the thousand . They are said to have been plentiful in San Diego and Mission Bays also before the days of commerce and industry . Southern California is the northernmost part of the range . The similar broad , kidney-shaped , true R. amethystina extends at least to Panama . The eight-tentacled polyps of Renilla are nearly always infested with minute parasitic copepods , Laniippe sp . The same genus is said to infest all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar species , living parasitically on fish , are known as fish lice. ? 249 . The three true crabs that occur on sand flats ( Pl . XXXV ) are found nowhere else in the intertidal zone . Heterocrypta occidentalismight , lacking any other name , be called the elbow crab , for its large forelegs , which terminate in absurdly small claws , suggest an energetic customer at a bargain counter . This very weird creature is the only northern representative of a group of crabs well represented in tropical and equatorial regions . We have taken it , with the other two , at Newport Bay , and it is known from deep water elsewherealong the coast . Randallia ornata has the round , bulbous body and gangly legs of a spider , but it is not closely related to the " spider " crabs . The carapace is mottled purple , brown , or dull orange , and the legs are usually curled underneath it as the animal lies half buried in the sand . The third , Portunus xantusii , is a swimming crab and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legs are paddle-shaped , and with them the crab swims sideways rather rapidly , keeping its big claws folded . Two long spines , one at each side of the shell , are effectivep183weapons of defense , and in addition the crab is unduly hasty about using its sharp and powerful pincers , so that a collector who capturesone without shedding any of his blood is either very lucky or very skilful ? probably both . Portunus is a relative of the muchprizedblue crab of the Atlantic , but is too small to be used for food . None of the three is likely to be found in the intertidal above Balboa. ? 250 . One of the starfish , Astropecten armatus (   . XXXVI ) , occurs on sand flats from Newport Bay to Panama , usually below the water line but occasionally exposed . Now and then a specimen will be found having an arm spread of more than ten inches . They are beautifully symmetrical animals , sandy gray in color , and with a beaded margin and a fringe of bristling spines .. Normally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snails and at least one nudibranch are members of the sand-flat assemblages . In El Estero de Punta Banda we once saw tremendous hosts of the nudibranch Pleurophyllidia californica ( Pl . XXXVI ) , which were living , peculiarly for nudibranchs , half buried in the sand ? another of the interesting adaptations to this fruitful environment . Thin , white , longitudinal stripes alternating with broader stripes of dark brown or black make Pleurophyllidia a conspicuous animal . In aquaria it has been observed to feed on sea pansies , and it undoubtedly does the same thing in its natural habitat , for the two always occur together. ? 252 . The moon snails or sand-collar snails are common inhabitants of sand flats throughout the whole stretch of coast from Alaska to Mexico . The form illustrated ( Pl . XXXVI ) is Polinices draconis , which ranges from Alaska to Catalina Island . The average shell length is between 3 and 4 inches , and a fully expanded animal is several times larger than its shell , almost completely covering it . When alive and expanded this species is scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell somewhat longer in proportion to its diameter and occupies about the same range , except that the latter is possibly more common in regions where there is a good admixture of mud . The average shell length of lewisii is more than 4 inches . The strictly southern moon snail , P. recluziana , is much smaller ? usually less than 2 " in shell length ? and , like lewisii , shows a preference for muddy sand . It can be distinguished from the other moon snails by its occluded umbilicus ; that is , the " navel " is grown over so that that part of the shell is smooth . Frequently the shells of recluziana , which ranges from Crescent City to Chile , are occupied by a giant hermit crab ( ? 262 ) . Any of the three will commonly be found partially buried in the substratum , through which they plow with apparent ease . All arep184capable , also , of so contracting the immense fleshy foot as to stow it away completely within the shell , which is then closed with the horny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ejection of considerable quantities of water from perforations around the edge of the foot , and the animal can not live long when so contracted , since it can not breathe . The moon snail 's method of food-getting is varied , but generally consists in clamping the foot around a clam , mussel , or other mollusk and drilling a neat counter-sunk hole through the shell with its radula . Through this hole it inserts a pair of razor-edge jaws , with which it hacks its prey to pieces and removes it bit by bit . Shells so perforated , by the moon snail or some of its relatives , are often found along the beach . A less spectacular method consists in suffocating the victim by holding it inside the foot until dead , or by sucking the foot over the siphon of a clam . In this case the proboscis is merely inserted between the shells of the dead animal and the contents are cut out . Apparentlythe great snail will feed also on any dead flesh that comes its way . Cannibalistic members of its own tribe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only natural enemies . In an aquarium a sunflower star has devoured two moon snails within three days . The egg cases of these giant snails are , to most laymen , one of the puzzles of the intertidal world , for they look like nothing so much as discarded rubber plungers of the type plumbers use to open clogged drains . Many years ago the junior writer of this book squandered a great deal of nervous energy in a fruitless search through unfamiliar literature in an attempt to find out what manner of animal they might be . It was some consolation to him to learn eventually that for a long while naturalists had made the same mistake . Certainly there is no obvious reason for connecting the rubbery , collar-shaped egg cases with the snails that make them . The eggs are extruded from the mantle cavity in a continuous gelatinous sheet , which , as fast as it emerges , is covered with sand cemented together with a mucous secretion . The growing case travels around the snail , taking its shape from the snail 's foot as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , releasing a half million or so free-swimming larvae . There is some poetic justice in the assumption that many of the minute larvae will provide food for the mussels , which later on will be eaten by adult moon snails. ? 253 . The beautifully marked and polished Olivella biplicata ( Pl . XXXVI ) , the purple olive snail , leaves a betraying trail on the sand , although it is itself out of sight , by plowing along just underp185the surface . Sometimes the shell is above the surface , the foot below . This form ranges from Vancouver to Lower California , and O. pedroana , a smaller , slimmer species , will be found most commonlysouth of Point Conception , although its total range is about the same as the plumper olives . The fragile bubble shell may be first noticed in pools on bare sand flats , but it is much more at home in beds of eelgrass ( ? 287 ) . ? 254 . Two edible animals are found ? a shrimp and a scallop ? usually in pools in the sand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigricauda ( Fig. 84 ) , the black-tailed shrimp , is a literally flippant little fellow that positively can not be captured without a dip net unless it is accidentally stranded on the sand . It has , even on its legs and antennae , " pepper and salt " markings that make it extremely difficult to see against a sand background . This is one of the common market shrimps in California , along with several others got from deep water only . Shrimp-dredging boats net these animals from depths of from a few fathoms in San Francisco Bay to more than a hundred in Puget Sound , and it is in such depths that Crago presumably finds its optimum conditions , since only occasional specimensare found in the intertidal . The black-tailed shrimp ranges from Alaska to Lower California . Market specimens will be found occasionally with the carapace swollen out on one side into a blister , the result of infection with an asymmetrical isopod ( bopyrid ) , Argeia pugettensis , especially common on commercially netted Crago cornmunisin Puget Sound , where one out of possibly every twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thick scallop , Pecten circularis ( Pl . XXXVII ) , frequentlyfound buried in the sand , is fairly common . The peculiar swimming habits of the relatively " intelligent " scallops have been mentioned before , as have their toothsome qualities . In addition to this sand-flat form , which ranges from Monterey to Peru , and the rocky-shore form ( P. hindsii ) , another scallop will be found in eelgrass ( ? 276 ) . There is nothing new or different about this diversity of habitat in closely related animals , but it is nevertheless interesting to note another example. ? 256 . Although all the sand-flat animals so far considered burrow somewhat , or at times , the remainder are strictly burrowing forms . Perhaps the most obvious of these , when it occurs at all ( and it is never found north of southern California ) , is a great burrowing anemonesimilar to Cerianthus aestuari , which lives in a black , parchmentliketube that is covered with muck and lined with slime . More energeticdiggers than the writers have taken specimens with tubes six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pointed andP186adapted to digging , and at the upper end there are two concentric sets of tentacles ? a short stubby series about the mouth , and a long wavingseries around the border of the lividly chocolate-colored disc . We have found a much smaller Cerianthus , probably a different species , in the sand flats at Ensenada. ? 257 . Another burrowing anemone , common in southern California , is Harenactis attenuata ( Pl . XXXVII ) . * It is a tubeless form , sandy gray in color . The long , wrinkled , worm-like body is largest in diameter at the disc , tapering downward until it swells into an anchoring bulb . When annoyed , Harenactis pulls in its tentacles in short order , retracts into the sand , and apparently sends all its reserve body fluids into this bulb , thus swelling it so that it is impossible for a hungry bird or an avid human collector to pull the animal out . The bulb of a large specimen may be eighteen inches below the surface , so that digging out a specimen with a spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole almost as rapidly as it is made . While the excavation is in progress the anemone retractsstill more and makes its bulb even more turgid . Having done that it can do nothing but sit tight and rely on Providence ? a fatalisticphilosophy that in this case is usually justified . Only if the sand can be shoveled away from the side of the bulb can a specimenbe secured uninjured. ? 258 . To the extreme north of our range is a third anemone , the substratum Cribrina , possibly Cribrina artemisia ( Pl . XXXVII ) , that is related to , and by some thought to be identical with , the great green anemone of the lower rocky tide pools . This form occurs in flats of rather pure sand , but only where small cobblestones or cockleshells are available underneath the surface for basal attachment . At low tide they retract completely beneath the surface and are to be found only by raking or shoveling as for cockles . The contracted specimens are white or gray  --  green , and may easily be mistaken for Metridiuni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea water they soon flower out beautifully , their long wavy tentacles colored with lovely greens and pinks , and their discs semi-transparent . We took the specimens shown in the photograph in British Columbia near Comox , not far from Discovery Bay , from which the animals were originally described in 1846 in the report of the United States Exploring Expedition. ? 259 . According to Weymouth there are nearly 500 species of bivalves on this coast . Many , of course , are too small or too rare to be considered in this account , and in order that the volume mayp187not grow out of all proportion we must further limit ourselves to the large , the obvious , or the interesting forms . After the scallop , with its peculiar flapping-swimming proclivities , the basket cockle , Cardium corbis ( Pl . XXXVII ) , is the bivalve that is most likely to be noticed in this environment by the casual collector . Reaching its maximum development in British Columbia and Puget Sound , the basket cockle extends southward in decreasing numbers as far as Lower California and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found very frequently in flats of " corn meal " sand that would be very shifty if surf could ever get to it . Basket cockles are occasionally found entirely exposed , but they are active animals and can dig in quickly with the large foot . They burrow shallowly , however , for they have no siphon tubes , the siphon holes being merely openings in the margin of the mantle . This cockle makes excellent food , although rather tough , but is too scarce to be used extensively . Specimens will frequently be captured with tiny cornmensalcrabs , Pinniza littoralis ( ? 300 ) , in the mantle cavity . Dr. Fraser ( 1931 ) has reported on the natural history of this form in British Columbia . Most of the 760 specimens examined were three or four years old , and none were more than seven years . Cardium is hermaphroditic , with ova and sperm shed usually simultaneously , sometimes the ova first , during a long spawning period in the spring which affects all animals two years old or more . Fraser suspects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving inshore with age , which possibly explains why so few small individualsare found alongshore . The ? 189 data on the growth rates of northern and southern razor clams is known to apply also to the races of Cardium. ? 260 . One would scarcely expect to find a clam throwing off a part of itself as a crab throws off a leg , but Solen rosaceus ( Pl . XXXVIII ) , one of the jackknife clams , actually autotomizes rather readily . Solen 's siphon , too large to be entirely retracted within its pink-tinged , nearly cylindrical shell , has prominent annulations . If the animal is roughly handled , or if its water gets somewhat stale , it drops off its siphon bit by bit , the divisions taking place along the lines of annulation . Presumably this autotomy was developed as a defense against the early bird in search of a worm and not averse to substituting a juicy clam siphon . This clam , which averages around 2 " in shell length , ranges from Santa Barbara to the Gulf of California , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 279 ) , occurs occasionally in mud flats and commonly in eelgrass roots as far north as Vancouver Island . The two may be distinguished by the fact that the latter has a slightly bent shell , colored ap188glossy yellow . Both species dig rapidly and well , but not as efficiently as their cousin Tagelus of the mud flats . Other common sand-flat clams , which may be identified with the aid of the photographs in ' late XXXVIII , are Chione , of three species , all known as the hard-shell cockle and all ranging from San Pedro into Mexico ; the purple clam , Sanguinolaria nuttallii , another southerner ; and any of several small tellens , Tellina bodegensis , etc. , most of which extend throughout the range considered in this book . The similar-T. tennis is one of the characteristic components of the Scottish fjord faunae , hence its natural history is well known . Stephen ( 1928 , 1929 ) , investigating the distribution , found small indidividuals ( but in great numbers , up to 1000 per quarter square meter ) at the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens , however , was higher up , toward high-water mark , where there were fewer individuals ? an interesting zonation that reversesthe usual situation . He found also that growth is more rapid higher up ( probably a function of the lessened intra-racial competition ) , that it decreases in regular progression with the age of the animal , and that it almost stops in winter . There were four age groups , representing four annual spawnings , the males becoming sexually mature in May , the females in June . Specimens were found to feed on plant detritus , in the spring exclusively on diatoms . These data on growth rates coincide with what is known of razor clams ( ? 189 ) . Still another sand-flat clam ( not illustrated ) is the white sand clam , Maconia secta , which reaches a length of 4 inches . It rather closely resembles its mud-flat relative , the bent-nosed clam ( ? 303 and Pl . XLIII ) , but is typically larger and lacks the " bent-nose " twist in the shell at the siphon end . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right . This species makes very good eating , but as the intestine is invariably full of sand the clams should be kept in a pan of clean sea water for a day or so before eating . The range is British Columbia to the Gulf of California. ? 261 . A mole crab occurs in this environment ? Lepidopa myops ( Pl . XXXVIII ) ? that never under any circumstances subjects itselfto the pounding waves that delight its surf-loving cousin , Ercrita . Visitors to the sheltered sand beaches at Newport Bay and southwardwill find it well submerged in the soft substratum but with its long hairy antennae extending to the surface to form a breathing tube . This form burrows rapidly in the shifting sand , but not with the skill of Emerita , whose very life depends on its ability to dig in quickly enough to escape an oncoming breaker. ? 262 . One December afternoon we found , in the unpacked sandp189along the channel in El Estero de Punta Banda , thousands of hermit crabs , Holopagurus pilosus ( Pl . XXXIX ) , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were giants of their tribe ? larger than any intertidal hermits we have seen south of Puget Sound ? but the really remarkable thing about them was their habitat . Many of them , probably most of them , were completely buried in the sand . Above the water line they could be detected only by their breathing holes , below the water by occasional bubbles . These very hairy and rather beautifully colored hermits have been known heretofore as an offshore form only , in water up to thirty . fathoms deep between San Francisco and San Diego . Here hosts of them could be turned out by merely raking one 's fingers through the sand. ? 263 . At the same time and place , and in the same manner , a considerablenumber of brittle stars were taken . Occasionally a wavingarm showed above the surface , but the vast majority were completelyburied . These were Arnphiodia barbarae , also formerly thought to be exclusively deep-water animals , having been reported as ranging from San Pedro to San Diego in depths up to one hundredtwenty fathoms . Except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pl . VII ) . ? 264 . A large cucumber with a most un-holothurian appearance , Molpadia arenicola ( Pl . XXXIX ) , is taken now and then at NewportBay , in El Estero de Punta Banda , and probably other places . Habitues of the Newport intertidal regions call it the " sweet potato , " and the name is rather appropriate . A sweet potato as large and wellpolishedas one of these animals , however , would be a sure prize winner at a county fair .. The first specimens we saw were dug near Balboa and put in an aquarium for the edification of a collecting party . We took them to be giant echiurid worms , and certainly there is little about them to suggest their actual identity . The mottled , yellowish-brown skin is tough , smooth , and slippery . There are no tube feet and no obvious tentacles . Molpadia feeds by passing continuousmasses of sand through its digestive tract for the sake of the contained detritus . As it lives in sand that appears to be fairly clean and free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inert matter to get a little food . We have no notes on the speed with which the sand mass moves through the animal , but the better part of the weight of a living specimen and much of its bulk is in the contained sand . Remove the sand , and the rotund " sweet potato " collapses . Molpadia has one cucumber trait , however , in that it always has guests in its body cavity , the pea crab , Pinnixa barnharti , occurring so commonly as to be considered almost diagnostic . When specimensp190are being narcotized with epsom salts for relaxed preservation , the pea crabs are likely to come out just as the pea crabs Opisthopus escape from Stichopus ( ? 77 ) under the same circumstances. ? 265 . Sand flats support the usual host of segmented worms . The tubed Mesochaetopterus taylori is a striking and cleancut solitary form which , unfortunately , breaks so readily that it can rarely be taken whole , the hindmost segments being the parts first shed and the least often seen . For so delicate a creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Departure Bay , British Columbia , and a similar or identical form at Elkhorn Slough , Morro Bay , Newport Bay , California , and El Estero de Punta Banda , Lower California ? points representing a considerable range of temperature , humidity , and sunlight conditions . It is somewhat similar in appearance to Chaetopterus ( Fig. 102 ) . The tubed and sociable " jointworm , " Clymenella , occurs in this environment , but it is more characteristic of areas of hard-packed muddy sand ( ? 293 ) . Every shovelful of sand turned up in search of lancelets ( next paragraph ) will rout out one or two specimens of a third segmented worm , a small and nereis-like species of Nephtys . The collector intenton snatching the swift lancelets the instant they are exposed will often grab a specimen of this smaller and slower form before he can check the motion of his hand . A similar shorter form taken in similar environments of loosely packed sand is Armandia brevis , the former Aninaotrypane . MacGinitie ( 1935c ) says ( p. 693 ) : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds one somewhat of Amphioxus . . . . can swim through loose sand as rapidly as some worms are able to swim in the water . " ? 266 . The lancelet , Amphioxus , a famous animal that is seldom seen , comes into its own on this coast in southern California and ( at least ) northern Lower California . Where there is a low-tide sand bar opposite the mouth of a sheltered but pure-water bay , and far enough in to be protected from wave shock , these primitivevertebrates are likely to be found . Our form , Branchiostoina calif orniense ( Fig. 85 ) , is reputed to be the largest lancelet ' in the world , adult or sexually mature individuals being up to 3 " long , Specimens of that size will very rarely be taken , however , and the average size is less than half of the maximum . Violent stamping on the packed sand in just the right area will cause some of thep191animals to pop out . They will writhe about for a moment and , unlesscaptured quickly , dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to turn up a spadeful of sand , trusting to one 's quickness and skill to snatch some of the animals before all of them disappear . Until one has actually seen them in the act , it is hard to believe that any animal can burrow as rapidly as does Amphioxus , for the tiny eel-like creatures are as quick as the proverbial greased lightning . They hurl themselves head first into the sand ? veritable living projectiles . Seemingly they can burrow through packed sand as rapidly as most fish can swim . They will lie quietly on the bottom of a dish of sea water , but if disturbed will swim rapidly with a spiral motion . While the drawing shows the shape of the animal , it is utterly impossible for any illustration , with the possible exception of a motionpicture , to convey a clear notion of the appearance of a living lancelet in its natural habitat . Amphioxus has achieved unique fame in the last half century through being interpreted as a form ancestral to the other vertebrates . An important theory of craniate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the higher animals . We have taken it at Newport Bay , at San Diego Bay , and in El Estero de Punta Banda . It is known from the Gulf of California also , and is no doubt common in deeper water below the effect of waves , as it has been dredged off San Diego and in the Gulf . Off the coast of China a similar species is dredged by the ton for food , and the Chinese , with their epicurean palates , consider it a great delicacy . Probably Amphioxus is not as rare as has been supposed , even on our warmer shores , for its small size , retiring habits , and great speed in escape make it a form easily overlooked . Living submerged in the sand with Amphioxus is a small fish , Gillichthys mirabilis , the sand goby . We have no data concerning its habits. ? 267 . The worm-like and degenerate acorn-tongue worm , Dolichoglossuspusillus , shares with Amphioxus the honor of being an ancestral vertebrate , or at least of coming from the same primitive stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay and what is now Los Angeles harbor , but suction dredging and industrial wastes have very materially changed the shore lines where it was once found . Ritter , when working up the embryology of the animal , wrote of taking more than a hundred on one tide ; but now even the most proficient collector must be locally familiar in order to procure any in the southern region . It is reported to occur in Puget Sound , but we have never found any there.  |p192The  males are pale orange , the females brighter . Various observersdiffer as to whether the animals do or do not have castings at the mouths of their burrows and whether they do or do not protrudetheir orange or red probosces at low tide so that they lie flaccid on the surface . Probably the conflicting statements arise from the fact that there are several species , all of them undescribed , which have different habits and habitats . We have never taken a whole specimen , but we have seen fragments of a size to indicate an animal at least 24 " long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The excessively soft bodies are long , round , and very likely to be broken , and the animals secrete more than their share of slime . The various species of acorn-tongue worm have a not unpleasantbut extremely pervading and persistent " estuary " odor that will scent the hands of the successful digger for several days. ? 268 . In their upper reaches , estuarine sand flats offer an added obstacle to prolific colonization by marine animals ? the matter of fresh water . Where this occurs abundantly or sporadically the faunal aspect is correspondingly changed . But a good many of the crabs and some of the shellfish tolerate greatly lowered salinities , and Reid ( 1932 ) has shown that fresh water , even if actively flowingover the flats , has little effect on the sea water contained in sand below the surface , so that even minimal burrowing ability would protect a sessile form so situated until the return of the tide.  |p193Since  the eelgrass , Zostera , occurs on flats of many types , from almost pure sand to almost pure muck , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before going on to the mud-flat forms . The start of a bed of eelgrass is an important step in the conversion of a former ocean region into wet meadow land and , ultimately , into dry land . The matted roots prevent the sand from being readily carried away by wind and tide , provide permanenthomes for a less nomadic tribe of animals than inhabit the flats of shifty sand , and enrich the substratum with decaying organic matter until it can be classed as mud . The grass supports a rather characteristic group of animals that live on the blades , about the bases , and among its roots in the substratum. ? 269 . In El Estero de Punta Banda we have found small and delicate sea urchins crawling about on the blades of eelgrass , possiblyscraping off a precarious sustenance of minute encrusting animalsbut more likely feeding upon the grass itself . They are so pale as to be almost white , but with a faint coloring of brown or pink . This urchin , Lytechinus anavnesus , is known from shallow water in the Gulf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The largest recorded specimens are just over an inch in diameter . Ours are less than half an inch . They resemble bleached , miniature , purple urchins. ? 270 . In an adjoining eelgrass pond in the same region were many thousands of small snails , the high-spired Nassarius tegula ( Pl . XXXIX ) , also known as Nassa and Alectrion . Apparently these dainty little snails lead a precarious life , for about half of their shells were no longer the property of the original tenant , having been preemptedby a small hermit crab , probably a new species of Pagurus . These snails and hermits , and the urchins mentioned in the previousparagraph , were all seen in the winter . The summer sunlight and temperature conditions in this region being decidedly unfavorable , it is likely that every animal able to do so would move downwardbeyond the chance of exposure . It is quite possible that El stero , which we have not visited in hot weather , might then be a relatively barren place . Many of the little Nassarius shells , whatever their tenants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coralline bryozoan ,  |p194Idmonea  californica . On a superficial examination the erect , calcareousbranches of this form can not be distinguished from tiny staghorncoral . It is fairly common in southern California , and it will be quickly noted wherever found and almost certainly mistaken for a coral . When it encrusts on Nassarius it makes the shells at least half again as heavy. ? 271 . Any of several hydroids will be found attached to eelgrass ? Aglaophenia , Plumularia , or Sertularia , as previously mentioned , or in forms specific to this environment . The cosmopolitan Obelia dichotoma is common in situations of this sort all up and down the coast , and , in fact , in temperate regions throughout the world . Compared with other delicate and temperamental species of Obelia , dichotoma is very hardy and obliging . It stands transportation well even when its water becomes somewhat stale , lives for several days under adverse conditions , and expands beautifully when its proper conditions are approximated . The delicate white clusters of this and of O. longissima ( ? 316 ) are conspicuous on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judging from specimens determined by Dr. Fraser , it is this form and dubia ( ? 332 ) which have frequently been called gracilis locally ; the differences in any case are slight . O. dichotoma ranges on this coast from Alaska to San Diego ; there is a good description , with an illustration of a living colony , in Johnsonand Snook , pages 59-60 , which we need not repeat here . We have not so far taken this form on the outer coast , but it occurs on Puget Sound wharf pilings with longissima , etc . At least some of the eelgrass hydroids taken at Jamestown Bay , Sitka , turn out to be the ubiquitous longissima , and it may be that the two are mingled there in the same habitat as they seem to be at Elkhorn Slough . A minute nudibranch , Galvina olivacea , lives among these hydroids , presumably feeds on them , and tangles them up at certain times of the year with its white , jelly-covered egg strings . Some of the Obelia nudibranchs are among the smallest occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch in length and identifiableonly with a binocular microscope . It is an interesting fact that by a peculiar symbiosis , or by partial digestion , nudibranchs fed on hydroids soon get to bear living and functioning nerdatocysts ( the poisonous , barbed defenses borne by hydroids , jellyfish , sea anemones , etc. ) in their gills . These transplanted barbs work so well that nudibranchs so protected can not be eaten by larger animals. ? 272 . Associated with the eelgrass of Elkhorn Slough , and probablyelsewhere where the bottom is compact , sandy mud , there is a skeleton shrimp , Caprella scaura . It is large , even by comparison with C. kennerlyi ( ? 89 ) of the rock-pool hydroid colonies . Some/times great numbers of them may be seen at night in the beam of a flashlight , under the surface of the water . Occasionally they will be found even on shores of pure mud . We take them also from mud bottom at 60 or 70 fathoms in Monterey Bay . As would be expected , this muddy-water form lacks the bright colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eelgrass beds of Puget Sound we know of one west of Port Townsend ( and there are undoubtedly others ) that supports a tremendous population of the fixed jellyfish Haliclystus ( probably stejnegeri ) ( Fig. 86 ) . This form is actually one of the large ( scyphozoan ) jellyfish such as are seen offshore in summer , pulsating lazily at the surface of the sea , and yet it is small and has lost almost all power of motion . The small , stalked attachmentdisc has some power of contraction , and the tentacle-studded mouth disc is able to fold somewhat , but the animal swims not at all . We have never seen any of them so much as change their position on the grass blades , but it is presumed that they can glide about slowly on a smooth surface , like an anemone . Specimens detached from their grass will get a new hold with their tentacles and bend the stalk down until it can be reattached . An interesting feature of the digestive system is the presence of filaments which mix with the food in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzymes can act upon . The animal 's colors are subtle rather than striking , but it is large enough ( up to an inch in diameter ) to be seen without difficulty . Originally described from the Commander Islands , Alaska , Haliclystusis known to occur in the Friday Harbor region and may be expected in many other places in Puget Sound and to the northward . Some years ago Dr. Fisher took a single specimen at Point Joe , near Monterey , but its occurrence there was presumed to be accidental . No others were reported until , in May , 1931 , we discovered to our amazement that the animals had suddenly colonized at Monterey almost as abundantly as we found them in Puget Sound . They have continued to appear at Monterey each spring , have already been seen in Carmel Bay , and very likely have established themselves in other unpolluted spots where it is to be hoped they will become a permanent part of the fauna . Recent experience with this form , and the fact that it is not reported from the Nanaimo region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires fairly oceanic water. ? 274 . Necessarily small snails of several kinds frequent the slender leaves of eelgrass . Lacuna porrecta , shaped like Littorina hot only one-fourth to one-half its size and having an aperture thatp196takes up most of the front of the shell , may be found either on the grass or by screening the soil about the roots . MacGinitie remarks that this form waddles like a duck . It ranges from Bering Sea to San Diego . The related L. variegata , of zigzag markings , may be found similarly on Zostera in the Puget Sound ? Georgia Strait region . Haminaea vesicula is a small , white , bubble-shell snail , up to almost an inch in shell length but usually about half of that , ranging from Vancouver Island to the Gulf of California . Like the great Bullaria ( ? 287 ) with which it sometimes occurs , it can scarcely stow away its comparatively large body in its fragile shell . In some specimensthe beating heart can be seen through the shell . The eggs of this form are laid in deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 " long . These two snails , with the minute black Philine , found at Elkhorn Slough , are tectibranchs , related to the large and shell-less sea hares . Philine always moves through a slime envelope of its own secreting . The larger Navanax ( ? 294 ) is a feature of the southern eelgrass beds , as well as of the adjacent mud flats , feeding on Haminaea . Another tectibranch , which looks much more like a nudibranch than like its relatives already mentioned , is a pretty green form with India-ink lines of stippling . It is probably Phyllaplysia taylori , which has been reported from Nanaimo and has recently been found in Elkhorn Slough as well . Ovipositing individuals of Nassarius fossatus ( ? 286 ) will be found among blades of eelgrass during the late summer , depositing encapsulated eggs . Even an annelid worm , the small Nereis procera , known more commonly from dredging in Monterey Bay , will be found at home here on the Zostera ( and on Enteromorpha ) , where it constructs permanent membranous tubes on the blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically restricted to this habitat ? Acvnaea depicta , the painted limpet , not at all obvious , but readily discoverable if one runs a quantity of eelgrass through one 's hands . In the extensive and rich Estero de Punta Banda , below Ensenada , Lower California , we have taken this animal very abundantly during the winter . Possibly every tenth blade of grass is inhabited by it . Also at Sitka in the summer of 1932 we found a similar limpet ( Amfortunatelynot determined ) equally abundant on the quiet-water Zostera of Jamestown Bay . Mrs. Grant describes it as having " Externalsurface smooth and highly lustrous , marked only by concentric growth lines , and color pattern of fine brown lines upon a white surface , " and records a common distribution of from Santa Barbara to Lower California , with one doubtful Monterey record . A large specimen is9X4X3mm.  | ? 275 . Chioraera ( known also as Melibe ) leonina , a large nudibranchof eelgrass areas , seems to be in the process of becoming a pelagic animal ? that is , a drifting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially during cloudy weather , this queer creature puffs out its hood with air , thus floating to the surface where its tentacles rake in small crustacea for food . It is common in some years in the Friday Harbor region , particularly on Brown Island . In 1928 approximately 1000 appeared at one time , and of these an estimated 150 pair were in coitu , mostly mutual coitus . Guberlet wrote : " During the act of copulation the animals lie side by side , or with the bottom of the foot of each together , with their heads in opposite directions , and the penis of each insertedin the vaginal pore of the other . . . . and the animals so firmly attached that they can be handled rather roughly without being separated . " After they have spawned the animals take on a shrunken appearance , and many , if not all of them , die , the indicationsbeing that they live only one season and spawn but once . The eggs are laid during the summer in broad spiral ribbons 3 " or 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego , but south of Puget Sound it must be rare or sporadic. * In southern Puget Sound we have found occasional solitary forms only , but in central British Columbia we once came upon a great host of them about one of the rare eelgrass beds in this ordinarily precipitous region. ? 276 . The southern scallop , Pecten latiauritus , is commonly seen at Newport Bay and southward , attached to eelgrass clusters or swimmingabout their bases after the peculiar manner of the scallop tribe . It differs from P. circularis ( Pl . XXXVII ) in being flatter and in having wider " ears " at the hinge line. ? 277 . A massive and most amazing sponge , Tetilla ( ? 298 ) , is sometimes attached to eelgrass clusters , but it is more common on the mud flats , where it leads an apparently normal life under abnormal conditions. ? 278 . In and about the roots of eelgrass lives a pistol ( snapping ) shrimp , Crangon cali f orniensis , that differs from its relative of the outside pools ( Pl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly smaller snapping claw of somewhat different shape . Another quite different shrimp to be found here , and also in mudflatpools , is the lovely transparent Spirontocaris paludicola ( Pl . IX ) . The specimen photographed was taken in a rock pool on the pro/tected outer coast , but the species is far more common in this environment . It is scarcely distinguishable from the S. picta described in ? 62 . In the Puget Sound region , Hippolyte californiensis ( ? 230 ) occurs commonly in this association even in the daytime , its green color matching so well that of the eelgrass to which it clings that the observer may be working in a colony of them without realizing it until one of the graceful animals swims away . Pentidotea resecata also ( ? 205 ) will be found clinging lengthwise to the blades , often abundantly , without its presence being suspected . Farther north other crustacea may be found ; at Sitka , in addition to the forms above mentioned , Spirontocaris cristata ( Pl . XXIV ) and S. camtschatica have been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solen sicarius , is , for its kind , an extremelyactive animal . It digs so rapidly that it can bury itself in thirty seconds with only four or five thrusts and draws of its foot . But it has even more striking accomplishments , for , according to MacGinitie , it can jump a few inches vertically and can swim by either of two methods . Both involve the familiar " rocket " principle . By the first method water is forcibly expelled from the siphons , thus propellingthe clam forward . By the second , water is expelled from the mantle cavity through an opening around the foot , and the resulting darting motion is accelerated by a flip of the extended foot , the combinedforces sending the animal some two feet through the water in a reverse direction . S. sicarius has a glossy yellow , bent shell , reaches a length of a little more than 3 inches , and ranges from Vancouver Island to Lower California . Like its somewhat smaller , straight-shelled relative of the sand flats , S. rosaceus ( ? 260 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may at times be found together in the sand flats , but S. sicarius , although it is occasional in mud flats also , is far more common among the roots of eelgrass. ? 280 . Of many of the worms that writhe about in the roots we freely confess our ignorance . Of others , which we can recognize , so little is known that a full list would " little profite the Reader " and of them all only three will be named . The first of these is the slender and iridescent Glycera rugosa ( Pl . XXXIX ) , which looks not unlike a Nereis with a pointed head . The difference becomes obvious when Glycera unrolls a fearful and wonderful introvert almost a third as long as itself ? an instrument armed with four black terminal jaws which obviously are made for biting . It will be noticed in the illustrationthat when the introvert is extended the head loses its characteristic pointedness . Specimens occur singly and may be 8 " or even more in length.  | ? 281 . The second worm to be mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose body is tapered to fit the slender , coneshapedtube which it builds of sand grains cemented together . This worm digs by shoveling with its mouth bristles , which may , as in the case of one specimen that we dredged from the mud bottom of PenderHarbor , British Columbia , be of brilliant gold . A model woven of cloth of gold could not be more striking . We have specimens from the vicinity of Juneau also , and they occur in Elkhorn Slough . The minute and highly specialized pea crab , Pinnixa longipes ( ? 293 ) , widest of the lot , is a common commensal . Watson worked with Fabre-like patience on these animals , and his observations , hidden away from popular reach in an English biologicalperiodical , seem to us as popularly fascinating as those of that French entomologist . " Each tube is the life work of the tenant , " he writes , " and is most beautifully built with grains of sand , each grain placed in position with all the skill and accuracy of a human builder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that projecting angles will fill hollows , and one appreciates the nicety of the work when one perceives that the finished wall is only one grain thick . Furthermore , no superfluous cement is used . Suitable grains for building are selected by the mouth and applied to the " two papillated lobes of the cement organ , .... after which the worm applies its ventral shields to the newly formed wallings , and rubs them up and down four or five times , apparently to make all smooth inside the tube The moment when an exact fit has been obtained is evidently ascertained by an exquisite sense of touch . On one occasion I saw the worm slightly alter ( before cementing ) the position of a sand grain which it had just deposited . " Only very fine grains are used , from 1/1000 " to 1/500 " in diameter , but one specimen in captivity built 3/4 " of tube in two months . Pectinaria lives head downward , usually with the tube buried vertically in the substratum , although sometimes , and especially at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube may project above the surface . Digging is accomplished in a vigorous manner by means of the golden bristle-combs which project from the head , " tossing up the sand by left and right strokes alternately . " The worm eats selected parts of the sand which it digs : that is , passes sand through its body for the contained food . The digging therefore creates a hollowabout the head , and frequent cave-ins result . Thus the worm is not only able to dig its way to new feeding grounds , but is able to remain in the same place for a time and make its food fall to within reach of its mouth . There are strong hooks at the hind end of the , body which enable the animal to keep a firm grip on its tube whilep200digging . For respiration and the elimination of waste matter , two currents of water are pumped through the tube in opposite directions . Pectinaria is able to repair breaks in its tube , appears to be lightsensitive , and probably has a tasting organ. ? 282 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least common , is a magnificent species , D. perimeces , of the tropical Dendrostoma . Large specimens of this slim sipunculid are almost 10 " long when expanded . Except for its slimmer body and usually larger size it does not differ greatly from D. petraeum ( the species illustrated in Pl . XXIV ) . Closer examination will reveal the fact that the tentacles of D. perimeces branch clear to the base , whereas the lower part of the smaller form 's tentacles is bare . The delicately branched and beautifully flowering tendrils presumably gather food particles and transfer them to the intestine by rolling in the introvert . This form has been taken at Elkhorn Slough only. ? 283 . In a good many of the quiet-water channels of Puget Sound , the subtidal gravel shores support a variety of eelgrass that is always at least partially submerged on even the lowest tides . The characteristicfauna that belongs to these deep plants can scarcely be considered intertidal , but the shore collector will fringe this zone and will surely see , among other things , the hydroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful little bell-shaped medusa ( / " to 3/4 " in diameter ) , almost invisible except for an apparent cross inside the bell formed by its reddish-brown gonads , has some sixty to seventy long , slender tentacles with which it stings and captures small fish and crustaceans . It seems to be restricted to these particular growths of deep eelgrass , but every such location that we have examined in summer has , without exception , turned out a few specimens . When they are not at first visible , thrusting an oar into the eelgrass , or merely wading slowly through it , will send some of them pulsing toward the surface . On overcast days , however , they will be found near the surface , often in considerable numbers . In the winter , judging by one collecting trip in 1931 , there is not a single specimen to be found . Watching and timing the life cycle of this form through the hydroid stage is one of the many tasks that await some enthusiast who has the requisite time and patience . In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years been the classic type of its group for teaching purposes . Some work has been done in this connection . It is known , for instance , that the fertilizedegg develops into a ciliated , free-swimming larva that is oval in shape and somewhat drawn out at one end . The larva settles down on its broad end , and develops at its drawn-out upper end first ap201mouth and , a few days later , four tentacles , two at a time . In this hydra-like , hydroid stage the animal is scarcely more than 1/16 " high with its tentacles expanded . Additional hydranths are budded off , but how the medusae are produced is not known . Rugh has shown , after extensive experimentation with an Eastcoastspecies , that under normal conditions Gonionemus never lays its eggs in the light , although light is probably necessary for the maturation of the egg cells . During the breeding season the animals prepare to discharge their eggs within one minute after being placed in artificial darkness . Apparently the eggs are laid in installments , certain numbers each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the experimenter does not mention . He thinks there are many eggs , and that the individual egg is large for so small an animal . Also in this environment , occasional visitants from deep water may sometimes be seen . Stichopus calif ornicus ( ? 77 ) is common underfoot . Shrimps occur , especially at night , including such commerciallyimportant forms as the " coon stripe , " Pandalus danae , but rarely , and solitarily . While considerations of this nature are beyond the scope of this work , it may be interesting to note the answer , worked out by Berkeley ( 1930 ) , to a question frequently asked by shrimp fishermen . They have wondered why it is that the only males taken of a given species are small , while all the females are large . The rather spectacular answer is that the five species investigated by Berkeley invariably undergo a sexual metamorphosis . Young specimensare always male . At the age of from 18 to 40 months , depending on the species , they become females and spend presumably the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of respiration and food-getting in mud flats and the lack of attachment sites make for a rather specialized fauna . The skin breathing of starfish and urchins makes them unsuited to this environment , and , with the exception of an occasional Pisaster brevispinus , none occur . There are only one sponge and one hydroid , and there are no chitons or bryozoa , but the many worms , clams , and snails make up for the scarcity of other animals . Even in the south the animals extend farther up into the intertidal on the mud flats proper than they do on the sand flats anywhere on the coast . Some of them , like the fiddler crab , seem to be changing into land dwellers ? a tendency that reaches an extreme in Japan , where one of the land crabs has worked up to a point almost two thousand feet above sea level. ? 284 . The little fiddler crabs , Uca ( Pl . XL ) , are characterized , in the males , by the possession of one relatively enormous claw which is normally carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seems never to be used except in combat with other males of the same species and as a secondary aid to digging . In battle the two contestants lock claws , each apparently endeavoring to tear the other 's claw from its body . Sometimes , according to one capable observer , a crab loses its hold on the substratum and is " thrown back over his opponent for a distance of a foot or more " ? a performance that suggests a jujitsu wrestling match . At breeding time , and particularlywhen a female is near by , the males make a peculiar gesture , extending the big claw to its full length and then whipping it suddenlyback toward the body . One might conclude , with some logic , that the big claw is a distinctly sexual attribute comparable to the horns of a stag . The Japanese call the fiddler crab siho maneki , which is translatedas " beckoning for the return of the tide . " It is too picturesque a name to quibble over , but one might reasonably ask why MahometP203does not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its burrow as far away from the tide as it can get without abandoning the sea entirely . There it feeds , like so many other animalsoccurring on this type of shore , on whatever minute plants and animals are contained in the substratum . Instead of passing quantitiesof inert matter through its body , however , the fiddler crab selects daintily such morsels as appeal to it . The selecting process begins with the little claws ( the female using both claws and the male his one small one ) and is completed at the mouth , the rejected mud collectingbelow the mouth in little balls which either drop off of their own weight or are removed by the crab . Dembowski , working with the sand fiddler of the East coast , made careful observations of the animal 's behavior and came to the interesting conclusion that its behavior is no more stereotyped than that of man . He found that in their natural habitat the fiddlers construct oblique burrows up to three feet long that never branch and usually end in a horizontal chamber . In sand-filled glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging their burrows along the sides of the jars . Apparently it was an advantage to be able to see what they were doing , and although such a condition had never existed in nature they made use of the opportunity when it did occur . They dig by packing the wet sand between legs and carapaceand pressing it into pellets which they then carefully remove from the burrow . The smallest leg prevents loose grains from falling back while the pellet is being carried . Sometimes hours are spent in the very careful work of making the end chamber , the depth of which Dembowski thinks is determined by how far down the fiddler must go to reach sand that is very moist but not wet . In pure sand water would filter into the burrow at high tide , but the fiddler crab always takes care to locate in substratum that has so high a mud content as to be practically impervious to water . Furthermore it lines its burrow ? a process that probably adds to its airtightness ? and plugs the entrance before each high tide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in an airtight compartment . Under experimentally unchanging conditions the crabs showed no signs of periodicity such as might be expected in an animal that stoppers up its burrow against each high tide . Evidently the doorclosingprocess is due not to memory of the tidal rhythm but to the stimulus of an actually rising tide which would moisten the air chamberbefore the surface of the ground was covered . If a little water was poured into the jars the crabs became active as soon as the moisturereached them , carrying pellets to build a door . If the water was loured in rapidly the crabs rushed to the entrance and pulled pelletsp204in with great haste , not pausing to construct a door . If the jar was then filled up carefully , so as not to damage the burrows , the crabs would stay in their air chambers and not stir for a week . Dumping water in , however , filled the burrows and caved them in , burying the animals . Their response this time was to dig out and wait on the surface of the sandy mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high " high tide destroys part of the burrow , and the animal must dig itself out by somewhat reversing its former operations . It " causes the chamber to rise slowly in an oblique direction , still keepingits volume unaltered , as the sand is always carried from the roof of it to the bottom , " again by means of pellets . The procedure varies widely with the " individuality " of the animal . Dembowski insists that this and other reactions are plastic , very little being automatic . Thus the fiddler crab has to adjust not merely a pellet of sand but " always this single pellet with all its individual particularities . " The animal 's nervous system ( including its nearest approach to a brain ) is too simple to account for such a variety of reactions . To further quote the investigator : " We are compelled to admit a plasticity of the nervous centers ; they must possess a certain creative power that enablesthem to become adapted to entirely new situations . The number of possible nervous connections is limited , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be avoided only by admittingthat each nervous center may perform an infinity of functions . " Under natural conditions the fiddlers are probably never out of air longer than is necessary to moisten their gills , and they can live in air for several weeks without changing the water in their gill chambers . Nevertheless several animals lived for six weeks in sea water with no apparent ill effects . Dembowski concludes that they are true water-breathers , not air-breathers , but have interesting landlivingadaptations , the gills probably being filled with sea water rather than with nearly fresh water as has been assumed . Uca crenulata , if not the only fiddler crab on the coast , is at least the only common one north of southern Lower California , and it is known only as far north as Anaheim Bay . A second species of Uca is reported from Vancouver Island ! One learns to be cautious in making definite statements about intertidal animals , but this is somethingtoo much . It is most certainly either an outright error , the recordof an exceedingly rare animal , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetation on a boat bottom until it dropped off , half dead , at this point . High on the shore south of the highway along Mission Bay we used to find colonies of crenulata , but lately we have failed to find a single specimen . The shore line has beenp205artificially built up there , and the animals probably have been buried . There are plenty , however , at Anaheim Slough . It has been remarked that specimens are common only in summer . We got an inkling of why that should be , in January several years back , when we persistently dug out a burrow in the estuary south of Ensenada . The living animal was at the 40 " level in a tunnel that extended to a measured 48 " from the surface . The water in the pool at the bottom was bitterly salt. ? 285 . Pretty well throughout Newport Bay , extending almost as far as the slough reaches and ranging from the high-tide zone well down into the zone of low tides , is a small burrowing crab , Speocarcinustali forniensis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carapace about an inch wide ) will often be mistaken at first glance for a fiddler . Both bristle up at the mouths of their burrows to intimidate an intruder , and both scurry down into the security of their burrows before danger comes near . The lively fiddler crab never goes much below the hightideline , however , while the less active Speocarcinus roams through the whole intertidal region . The latter has fringes of hair on its legs and carapace edges , and short eye stalks , while the fiddler is hairless and has long and prominent eye stalks . North of Speocarcinus ' range , which is Los Angeles to San Diego , the common mud-flat crab of the higher tidal reaches is Hemigrapsusoregonensis ( Fig. 89 ) . This form looks like a small edition of the purple crab of rocky shores ( H. nudus ) that has been bleached to a uniform light gray or muddy yellow on top and white underneath , deprived of its under-side spots , and given , in compensation , a slight hairiness about the walking legs . Night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish the ideal combination for seeing an impressive panoply of crab armor . Hordes of these aggressive yellow shore crabs rear up in formidable attitudes , seeming to invite combat . The gesture is largely bluff , for if hard pressed they resort to that comforting philosophy which says that he who runs away will live to fight some other time when he is more in the mood . H. oregonensis ranges southward from Alaska , and is the common shore crab of San Francisco Bay . In Puget Sound and British Columbia it is extraordinarilyabundant . Hart ( 1935 ) , investigating the development , found that the young are hatched from May until August at Departure Bay . The purple shore crab occurs to a limited extent along the clay banks in the upper parts of sloughs , but will generally be found pretty closely associated with rocks.  | ? 286 . The channeled basket shell , Nassarius fossatus ( Pl . XL ) , also known as Nassa and as Alectrion , is the commonest of the large predaceous snails on suitable mud flats between British Columbia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incidentally it is one of the largest nassas known , large specimens being nearly 2 " long , and the cleancut beauty of its brown shell makes it a very noticeable animal . Ordinarily it will be seen plowing its way through flats of mud or muddy sand , probably in search of food . MacGinitie found that the animals are attracted by either fresh or decaying meat and will reach up for meat held in the air above them . When feeding , one wraps its foot completely around the food , hiding it until it is consumed . In August , at least , many individuals may be found depositing eggs in " shingled " capsules on the blades of eelgrass . The same investigatorwatched this process . The snail first explores with its sensory siphon the surface to be utilized , and then cleans a spot with its radula . Next it forms a fold in its foot to connect the genital pore with the pedal gland , and through this fold the naked egg mass is passed . The lip of the pedal gland is pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . When the eggs have entered the pedal gland , the infolded tube disappears , and the foot is used to form a water chamber , presumably for aerating the egg capsules already laid . During this nine and one-half minutes both the body and the shell oscillate , for some unknown reason , and after this period " the anterior part of the foot is lifted upward and backward , and , as the capsule is now cemented to the object to which it is being attached , it pulls out of the pedal gland as a completed egg capsule . " The entire process has occupied twelve and one-half minutes , and the animal is ready to move on and repeat the operation on a newly cleaned area just ahead . One typical string a little more than two and one-half inches long contained forty-five capsules and was nine hours in the making . The flattened capsules , averaging just over 1/8 " long , are laid with the base of one overlapping the base of the next , producing the " shingled " effect mentioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urosalpinx cinereus ( Fig. 90 ) , a snail which was accidentally introducedfrom the East coast along with the Eastern oyster . It is an inoffensive-looking animal , like a small dingy gray Thais , but once it gets established it can work considerable havoc with the oysterp207beds . Its method of attack ? the same as that employed by Thais and the great moon snail ? is to drill a hole through the bivalve 's shell and hack out the soft body. *Southern mud flats have several characteristic snails . The tallspiredhorn shell Cerithidea californica ( Fig. 91 ) extends to the upper reaches of such sloughs as Newport Bay even where there is some admixture of fresh water , and Acanthina paucilirata ( Fig. 92 ) occurs in the stretches more frequently washed by ocean water . The shell of the former is dark brown or black ; that of the latter is Thaislike , with 4 to 6 whorls which are crossed by broad black longitudinalstripes and narrower white stripes , giving a somewhat checkered appearance. ? 287 . In the south a large tectibranch , the bubble-shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shell some 2 " long , is the commonestof all gastropods in the Newport Bay and Mission Bay region ? so common that whoever has been there must surely have seen it . The paper-thin shell is mottled brown , and the body , which is too large for the shell , is yellow . When the animal is completely extended and crawling about in the mud , the mantle covers most of the shell . One observer says that the bubble-shell snails eat bivalves and smaller snails , swallowing them whole . The long strings of eggs , lying about on the mud or tangled in eelgrass , are familiar sights in summer . A pea crab of the ubiquitous species known also from Cryptochitonand the cucumber Stichopus is sometimes found in the mantle cavity of Bullaria . A much smaller snail that we believe to be the barrel shell , Actaeon punctocoelatus ( Fig. 93 ) , is sometimes common well up in the slough at Newport Bay . The animal is less than / " long but is so striking that it is sure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the whorls around its white shell. ? 288 . Mud flats would seem to be the most unlikely localities of all to harbor hydroids , but the tubularian Coryrnorpha palma ( Fig. 94 ) is famous in the Newport ? San Diego Bay area . Specimens attainingthe ( for a shore hydroid ) very great size of 3 " have been taken , and in some areas whole forests of these delicate fairy palms grow on the flats . The solitary individuals fasten themselves to the substratum by ramifying roots that come away as a chunk of mud . The animals are watery and transparent , and therefore will often be overlooked if the light is poor . When the ebbing tide leaves themp208without support they collapse on the mud , there to lie exposed to sun and drying winds until the tide floods again . It is remarkable that so delicate an animal can survive such exposure , but it apparentlysuffers no harm therefrom . Around the single flower-like " head " of the animal ( the hydranth ) the tiny jellyfish are developed , which , although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently never succeed in freeing themselves from the parent hydroid . There they stay until they reach maturity , deposit their eggs , and wither away . The eggs may be transported some distance by currents , but wherever they touch they settle and begin to grow as hydroids , so that there is no free-swimming stage whatever . Corymorpha is one of that minority of Pacific-coast intertidal animals that has been closely observed and studied . In aquaria it remains erect with spread tentacles so long as a current of water is maintained , but begins a slow and regular bowing movement as soon as the current is stopped . During each bow it sweeps the mud with its tentacles ; then , as it straightens up again , it rolls up its long tentacles until its short tentacles can scrape the food from them and pass it to the mouth . The animal is well known for its remarkablepowers of regeneration . If the entire hydranth is cut off , a new one will grow within a few days , and sections cut out of the " stem " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corymorpha has its associated sea spiders . Near Balboa we once found , in August , a bank of muddy sand that supported a Corymorpha bed about which were strewn large numbers of straw-colored and quite visible gangly pycnogonids , Anoplodactyluserectus , occurring also with southern Tubularia ( ? 333 ) . Presumablyit was a seasonal occurrence . The sea spiders had probably just grown to an independent stage and released themselves from their hydroid nurses ? quite likely by eating their way out. ? 289 . The most noticeable substratum animal in the Newport Bay flats of sandy mud is certainly the sea pen , Stylatula elongata (   . XL ) , but whether or not it should be considered as a burrowing animal will depend on the observer 's reaction , which , in turn , will depend on the state of the tide . The collector who appears on the scene between half tide and low tide will be willing to swear before all the courts in the land that he is digging out a thoroughly buried animal . But let him row over the spot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water beneath his boat a pleasant meadow of wavingp209green sea pens , like a field of young wheat . The explanation comes when he reaches down with an oar in an attempt to unearth some of the " plants . " They snap down into the ground instantly , leaving nothing of themselves visible but the short spiky tips of their stalks . Like the anemone Harenactis , they have a bulbous anchor that is permanently buried deep in the bottom . When molested , or when the tide leaves them exposed , they retract the polyps that cover the stalk and pull themselves completely beneath the surface . When cool water again flows over the region they expand slowly until each pennatulidlooks like a narrow green feather waving in the current . Pennatulids as a group are notably phosphorescent , but whether or not Stylatula runs true to form we can not say . It would be interesting to row over a previously marked-out bed on a dark night . The animals occur so thickly that if they are phosphorescent they should provide a brilliant display . Another task of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count the number of these slender stalks in a test square . There must surely be more than a hundred in a square yard . The next step would be to dig up such a proof square , remove all the individuals , dry them , and weigh the product . The per-acre production of fruit , grain , or live stock on various types of farm land is well known ; but until recently almost nothing has been known of the productivity of the sea except in " farmed " beds of oysters and the like . The fact remains that the oceans are the great primal sources of food . Many food chains start or end in the sea , and others are indirectly tied up with this great motherland , which provides by far the oldest and greatest areas of production in the world . Based on estimates made in the English Channel , the annual yield of primal foodstuffs ( diatoms ? primitive , one-celled organisms ) has been calculated to be five and a half tons per acre of water surface . The account* from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield of an acre of laboriously cultivated land ? where the average is less than five tons . The mathematically inclined reader can easily , by determining the number of acres of ocean surface , compute an estimated total production . It is safe to predict , without indulging in the thankless labor of that multiplication , that the resultingfigure would be so large as to be meaningless to those of us who are accustomed to thinking in terms of one nickel and two dimes. ? 290 . Even in this middle intertidal zone there are many burrowinganimals besides the spectacular Stylatula . Another relative of the hydroids , jellyfish , and corals is the burrowing anemone ,
