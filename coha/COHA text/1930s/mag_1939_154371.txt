It is an axiom in the insurance business that insurance is not bought but sold . In 1935 Franklin Roosevelt sold Congress and Congress sold the U. S. the Social Security Act , the biggest , most comprehensive , most expensive mass insurance policy ever written . Since then its purchasers , the nation 's taxpayers , have had occasion to read their policy carefully and , if they have detected no outright jokers , their reaction has been such that practically every politician in the U. S. from Franklin Roosevelt down has put revision of Social Security at the top of his must list . Last week , as the House Ways &; Means Committee began hearings on proposed ways &; means to make the Act work better , the revisers officially got down to business . <P> Ways &; Means ' old Chairman Doughton , his spectacles quizzically pushed up on his forehead , presided over as rowdy a show as he has seen in his 28 years in Congress . The hearing room was jammed with Townsendites and other pension peddlers , for on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis E. Townsend himself . Far more unruly , however , were Congressmen anxious to outdo one another in doing for the old folks . Massachusetts ' broadbeamed Republican Allen Treadway , whose State party leaders made an election alliance with the Townsendites , showed what was likely to happen when Congress receives the committee 's report . Trying to shout down a group of Democrats , Republican Treadway and his party members made so much noise that Chairman Doughton almost broke his gavel pleading : " Order ! Gentlemen , Gentlemen , we will have order ! " <P> Old Folks . The political failure of Social Security is that after more than three years of the Act designed to eliminate the insecurity of the aged , insecure oldsters are still making and breaking politicians , still rank as a prime U. S. political problem . By &; large another provision of the Act , its program of unemployment insurance , has functioned to the satisfaction of participants who have drawn out $400,000,000 in unemployment benefits since the program started operation . But for old folks , Social Security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those over 65 until 1942 , is still pie in the sky . The business of the witnesses before the Doughton committee was to show how the pie could be brought down within reach without wrecking the nation 's economic structure . <P> Altmeyer . First witness was the Social Security Board 's scholarly Chairman Arthur J. Altmeyer . Chairman Altmeyer 's job was to present to the committee the revisions proposed by President Roosevelt 's official Advisory Council on Social Security and additional suggestions of the board , which were received and approved by the White House last month . With little elaboration , Mr. Altmeyer passed on a recommendation that the coverage of the Act be extended to seamen , domestic servants , employes of educational and charitable institutions and other groups that would add 6,000,000 to the board 's present clientele of 42,500,000 ; that the board increase its subsidies to the States for dependent children and the blind . Then Chairman Altmeyer outlined his , and the White House 's , three-fold plan to give more to the old :        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
