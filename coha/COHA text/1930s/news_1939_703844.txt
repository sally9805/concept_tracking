txt On Avoiding Depressions Price Regulation Before They Start Advocated as Preventive You state in an editorial that " Dr. Means implied that industrialists had a choice of meeting the depression either by cutting prices or by curtailing production , and that they chose the latter . One assumption involved in this view is that , in general , reduction in price necessarily results in maintaining the levels of consumption , production and employment . " One error made in applying this assumption  --  and it is a very common thing for economists and others to think of what happens after a depression is under way ? is that belated price reductions will restore consumption and thereby maintain production and employment . Economists are probably only too correct in believing that price reductions made after a depression sets in have relatively little power to stop the process of decline . Unfortunately , no business men or economists have given any serious attention to the maintenance of proper pricing before a depression sets in . Yet it is easy to show that small changes in price before a depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing power and the building up of credit commitments which are unpayable . It is these unpayable credits which change the whole outlook of industry and business and force the decline . It takes enormous price reductions to make any impression at all on such a situation . Economists generally recognize that a depression usually continues " until certain necessary adjustments are made , " yet none of these men say much about what such adjustments are , how they may be made , whether " curtailing production " in any way aids in adjustment , or whether such curtailments merely delay the fatal day . If adjustments are needed after a depression starts , obviously the depression might be avoided by making the necessary corrections as we , go along , without waiting for them to pile up until a depression becomes necessary . Unfortunately , this point of view has not been popular with either economists or business men . The deductions of Dr. Means and the National Industrial Conference Board are subject to the limitations imposed by the " after depression starts " effect . Your discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That some effect of price lowerings should be observed is to be expected , but no general correlation applying to all industries and products . I should expect little real information from such pointless studies . This writer recently made some contributions to the theory of price regulation as a means for avoiding depressions . That theory also shows what " adjustments " are , how large , who must make them , and such pertinent information . It also shows that " curtailment " merely delays the evil day , while inflicting unnecessary losses on the community as a whole . Unless Dr. Means and the National Industrial Conference Board , and any others , interpret their facts with due regard to that theory , such facts must remain rather pointless . The contribution will be found in Vol. 7 , No. 1 ( January , 1939 ) , of Econometrica , a paper entitled " Controlling the Nation 's Business . " If maladjustment does not arise , the gloomy point of view of depressions will not lead to curtailments in consumption , because it , also , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDWARD ADAMS RICHARDSON .

Inauguration Reminiscence Ceremonies for President Harrison in 1889 Took Place in Rain To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am reminded that just fifty years ago , March 4 , 1889 , I witnessed my first Presidential inauguration . It marked the termination of the first term of Grover Cleveland and the entrance of Benjamin Harrison into the White House . I had served as a page in the Senate the previous session and went to Washington from Baltimore for the occasion , being permitted to take my old place " on the hill . " The inauguration ran against about the worst weather ever  --  a downpour of rain that scarcely eased up a moment , that almost forced a postponement and made the scene look like a sea of umbrellas . The inaugural proceedings were carried out as scheduled , none the less , by the drenched actors . President Cleveland and President-elect Harrison and their families were escorted to the Capitol in the midst of a ceaseless rain . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison and Mr. Morton were announced in the Senate , where I was , but the Senate of the Fiftieth Congress was not ready to quit sine die until 12:25 . Old Captain Bassett moved the hands of the clock back with a long pole several times to help the Senators fool themselves into believing that the time on the official records for adjournment had not yet arrived . Then the Vice President was sworn in by President pro tern . Ingalls and the newly elected Senators took the oath of office , after which the procession formed to march to the uncovered platform outside the building on the east . At 12:45 General Harrison reached the place of honor , was sworn in by Chief Justice Fuller and began his inaugural address . Standing with uncovered heads in the midst of a pelting rain , the Chief Justice and the President-elect , surrounded by high officials of state and in full view of an immense multitude of citizens of all classes of society , faced each other with bared heads while the former administered the oath of office in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery of his address and was partially protected from the rain by Sergeant-at-Arms Canaday " much after the manner in which Oriental potentates are attended by their umbrellabearers , " noted one of the reporters in his description . At the close of the address there was another outburst of applause , during which the President turned and kissed his wife and daugh ? ters . ' With the rain still coming down , and the beautiful decorations all bedraggled , the procession took its way back up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House . Soaked to the skin , I got away , carrying with me a vivid memory of the event that was to make history . VICTOR ROSEWATER . Philadelphia , March 3 , 1939 . More About the Murphys The O'Leary , No Less , Pays Tribute , With a Pat on the Back for the Finns To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I agree with " Friend of the Family " that Murphy is and has been a very useful citizen , who has contributed much to the material progress of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real reason why that fact is not better known and why THE TIMES or an individual might ask " Who is Murphy ? " It is that Murphy and us other " harps " have been so much inclined to live in the past in so far as our public utterances and demonstrations have gone ; too much devoted in our protestations of affection for the land from which we and our forebears came , and too little inclined to stress or even mention our contributions to and our affections for this country as to warrant suspicions that we are an alien people , interested only in a land across the sea , and not the constructive force we are and have been in this country . I have n't the slightest doubt that Brian Born was a great man and a twofisted fighter . We heard it , oh , so many times , but to me , a New Yorker , it is far more important to name but one example , that New York owes beautiful and useful Battery Park to another fighting man , the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name " Battery Dan " by single-handed and alone preventing the steamship magnates of his day taking over the park for piers . The list could be extended ad infinitum ; were it good form to do so , one could name numerous " Battery Dans , " who today are doing their full bit . So here 's to you , whoever you may be , hiding behind the false whiskers of " Friend of the Family , " for trying to keep the record straight . More power to your elbow , more punch to your pen ! THE O'LEARY . Washington , March 2 , 1939 . Murphys Were Fighters To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : " Friend of the Family , " in his laudation of the Murphys in THE NEW YORK TIMES , did not go back far enough . To find a goodly representation of Murphys he should look up the records of the Revolutionary War . There were 494 of them , and their names and other particulars of their services to their country are all listed in Dr. Michael J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American History . " JOHN P. MURPHY .

Farmer Green Waxes Wicked To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In my younger days I knew a young man who was so thrifty he would n't drink or smoke and did n't even realize the beauty of graceful feminine curves until I took him to a burlesque show . And , parenthetically , I 'd die content if I could once more hear Maggie Cline sing " Throw Him Down , McCloskey . " Well , anyway , by all manner of seltdenial , as well as being favored by luck , this man managed to accumulate sufficient for his old age , taking the advice of bankers and investing his savings in shares of certain financial institutions . Then , partly through worrying and fretting , he suddenly passed out of the picture , leaving his family , as he imagined , amply provided for . About eight years ago three of his pet financial schemes blew up , with the last folding up quite recently . And so I surmise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few things he would n't do , had disregarded the advice of that discredited bunch preaching " Always consult your banker , " and had gone to farming , for instance , he 'd now possibly be writing little pieces to editors telling all about the joys of this here agricultural game , by heck .

Wagner Amendment Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The time for one to prevent depredations in one 's home is when the wouldbe predatory intruder first thrusts his foot into the partially open door One should push it out and close the door . Senator Wagner 's proposed amendment to the Social Security Act is that foot . He has cunningly omitted compulsory health insurance in this initial thrust . But if that foot is allowed to stay in the door ajar , the leg and the body are sure to follow .

CHARLES B. SLADE , M. D. New York , March 2 , 1939 . Postal Rate Held Excessive To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIDIES : In THE TIMES of Feb. 26 Henry Ware Allen calls attention to the excessive domestic postal rate of 3 cents an ounce , first class . Allow me to call attention to the foreign rate of 5 cents for one-half ounce to Great Britain , while letters from there to the United States are carried for 3 cents . It is improbable that either country furnishes this westbound service at a loss . Perhaps these overcharges are the clue to Jim Farley 's socalled surplus . ALAN D. BELL .
