txt WASHINGTON , Dec. ** the job given Frank C. Walker by the President today evaporates  --  as other big ones have  --  in a confusion of unrelated effort , it is in many respects the most important office that has been created under the legislation of the New Deal . As executive director of the bewildering and multiple forms of Federal relief , Mr. Walker 's task will be to coordinate the coordinators . Ever since the government 's relief and recovery activities began reaching out in all directions , the most difficult Presidential problem has been to fit them into a harmonious pattern . The President has tried to do it himself , but he has n't the time . Then he formed his Executive Council , at which he presides and attempts by report and discussion to determine whether relief and recovery measures are being handled consistently and interdependently by all Federal agencies . The Executive Council , known disrespectfully to its members as the " Town Meeting " and " Of Thee I Sing , " did not solve the problem of coordination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body with legal and defined powers , under an official with prescribed authority . For this office he chose the secretary of his " Town Meeting , " the treasurer of the Democratic National Committee , the aforesaid Mr. Walker holding both these assignments already . If the new set-up draws upon the powers mentioned by the President in his order creating it today , if it functions smoothly and Mr. Walker 's eminent associates turn over to him on occasions such of their authority as he may seek , no Cabinet Minister or administrator will be as powerful as Mr. Walker . No one but the President is given the right to disapprove his actions . Will Coordinate Coordinators . As I read his commission , Mr. Walker could say to PWA. or CWA or AAA or NRA : " You are doing thus and so . It is out of harmony with our general relief policy . You must stop doing it . " And unless the President disapproved , the practice would have to cease . Not only is Mr. Walker appointed to coordinate the coordinators and administer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great government bureau of information the like of which has never yet been seen . This bureau is to supervise the distribution of all official facts relating to relief ; and it is to get such data for the newspapers and others as it may be asked for ( or see fit to reveal ) . It will have branches everywhere . In searching for a man with real power , what better example could be found than the director of all government relief and the steward of all information about those vast activities ? " Relief " is such a large and flexible word that practically everything the government is now doing under the emergency powers could find lodgment in the category . What is NRA but relief ? What is the purpose of the gold purchase but relief ? Doubtless the President has no thought of making Mr. Walker supreme over such major concerns as these . But it could be done under the text of the Executive order . And if the Grand Coordinator does his job successfully , no voice will be more powerful than his in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day conclude that NRA . is out of line with policy and is complicating and augmenting relief problems , it would be a body blow to that administration . Not Imperial at First Glance . But meanwhile the new office does n't seem to be as imperial as all that . It is n't quite a close second to the Presidential power itself . If it works , however , it is bound to grow . A glance at the names of those who will assist Mr. Walker in an advisory capacity and whose powers are on occasion to be assigned to him gives a general idea of the project : Secretary of Interior Ickes and Harry Hopkins of the Emergency Relief Administration , who between them have been given more than $3.000,000,000 to spend and can get more. ; Secretary of Agriculture Wallace and Administrators Peek , Myers and Fahey , who have hundreds of millions to spread over the farms and suburban communities ; Secretary of Commerce Roper , the official chart-watcher , and Secretary of Labor Perkins , who has a hand in everything around here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dove  --  General Hugh S. Johnson . The man who can harness all these together and make them run at the same pace in the same direction would be cheap at a million a year . His salary is fixed at $10,000 .. Whether he can or he ca n't , Mr. Walker is out to try . The latest Who 's Who and other rosters of the great and the near-great in America available in this office do not give the name of Frank C. Walker . He came to prominence recently as one of the engineers of the pre-convention Roosevelt movement . He is a soft-spoken and modest man who keeps in the background whenever he can . He is a trifle portly , with a fresh-colored face and the ability to keep still in all the languages he knows . So still are his waters that one must assume they run deep . That will develop , if Mr. Walker 's new job endures and is permitted to be what it purports to be . Sometimes the President junks one of the coordinating ideas and tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from Butte , Mont . He looks no more like a Westerner from that region is supposed . to look than does Bruce Kremer , who comes from Butte also .
