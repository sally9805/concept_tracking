SEAL TREGARTHEN 'S COUSIN A STORY BY MARGERY SHARP r-rattE , island was off the coast of Corn-I wall , the smallest and most outlying of a small group three hours from the mainland , and all through the spring , autumn , and winter its inhabitants , who lived by fishing and flower-growing , numbered exactly a dozen ; but in summer this number was augmented by the arrival of the Cattletts to fourteen . On every 1st of August Mr. and Mrs. Cattlett set out from their home in Chelsea to make the tedious journey by train , steamer , and rowboat ; and on every 2nd , as he stepped ashore , George Cattlett said the same thing . " Back , " said George Cattlett , " to Nature ! " There was no doubt that the island was very natural indeed . Apart from the one narrow strip of flower gardens it was completely uncultivated . Its weather-beaten rocks , its cliffs cushioned with sea-pinks , knew not the hand of man . The jetty was little more than a tongue of loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cattletts  --  like all the rest  --  had outdoor sanitation only . But the Cattletts did not care , they were simple-lifers of the old school , and but for the exigencies of George Cattlett 's position as art master at a girls ' college , would willingly have lived on their island all the year round . They always thought and spoke of it as theirs , for as George Cattlett so rightly said , Appreciation is Ownership ; and it often seemed to them that its actual inhabitants hardly appreciated the island at all . They were always too busy fishing or planting bulbs , and when they had nothing to do had the curious habit of going inside their houses to do it , Maud Cattlett , who took a great interest in arts and crafts , once tried to interest them in weaving , but with a complete lack of success . That was on her first visit , in 1930 , and though she carried down her handloom again in 1931 , in 1932 she left it at home . By the summer of 1938 she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Cattletts were able to make the journey encumbered only by one suitcase , two easels , and their personal supply of canvases , brushes , and paints . " Back , " said George Cattlett , " to Nature l " At the end of the jetty , awaiting them , stood Seal Tregarthen . As the keel of the rowboat grated on the pebbles he stooped down , with one hand grasped the bows , with the other helped Mrs. Cattlett ashore . George Cattlett , disdaining assistance , leaped lightly out into four inches of water , but only laughed at the mishap . As his wife often said the island turned him into a perfect schoolboy . " Home again ! " cried George gaily . Seal Tregarthen nodded . He was a heavy giant of a man , too blond and big-boned for the true island type , of which his beautiful wife was the dark and perfect flower . Mary Tregarthen stood a little behind her husband , smiling gravely . Her presence gave the landing a touch of ceremony ; always she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up to their tiny cottage , and to make them a cup of tea ; and the Cattletts were always sorry to see her go , since this was almost their only social contact with island life . She spoke briefly of the weather and the flower crop , waited until her husband had carried up the baggage ? all under one gigantic arm  --  and courteously took her leave . " I sometimes wonder , " said Mrs. Cattlett suddenly , " whether they really like us . " " Of course they do , " said George . " They simply are n't demonstrative . They 're too close to the soil . " " I know , George . That 's why I 'm so fond of them . But  --  it does seem so hard to win their confidence . You go fishing with Seal , for instance , but you never bring back any . . . gossip . " The word was misplaced , and she knew it . George frowned . " Gossip ? Thank God there is n't any . You painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to , " said Maud , with genuine humility . " And you did n't get any gossip out of her . If you wanted gossip we should have gone to Bournemouth . " " I did n't , " said Maud , more humbly still . " Come and look out of the window , dear . . . . " As always , the sight of so much sea at once restored peace . For some minutes the Cattletts stood side by side , breathing deep breaths as they had been taught to do in a course on Physical Culture . Then they turned to their unpacking , and as soon as it was finished walked down toward the quay . They passed a row of three cottages , housing respectively three Penruddocks , two Jasper Penruddocks , and three Ambroses . A little farther on came the cottage of the Tregarthens and down by the shore the cottage of the two Ambrose cousins . The whole population of the island wasconcentrated in that one hamlet , but not a soul could be seen . The day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Cattletts passed each window a curtain flickered . Peacefully , monotonously the days slipped by . The Cattletts set up their easels , George before a pool in the rock , Maud before the easier outline of a cliff , and worked with diligence . Their talents were worse than mediocre , but they had a lot of fun . George also watched seabirds through his field glasses , and went trawling for pollock with Seal Tregarthen . On one occasion he stayed out all night . He did not feel very well next day , and Maud had to clean his jacket with turpentine . In the evenings they played bezique and backgammon , or George read aloud to his wife . He was reading Ulysses , and had been reading it for some years . In this way all of August passed and the first week in September ; and then one day , as she strolled alone toward the jetty , Maud Cattlett received the surprise of her life . Leaning against the extreme point of the wall was a stranger . He was neither a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Mrs. Cattlett had ever seen . He was bigger even than Seal Tregarthcn : he was monumental . His shoulders were like the shoulders of an Atlas , his legs , clad in rust-colored trousers , were like twin pillars . It seemed marvelous that the wall could support his weight . A long shadow fell between Mrs. Cattlett and the sun . She turned round and saw Seal Tregarthen . " Who , " gasped Mrs. Cattlett , " is that ? " Seal Tregarthen , as usual , took his time about answering . He looked at the leaning figure and looked at Mrs. Cattlett , and finally looked at the sea . " Cousin , " he said at last . " When did he get here ? " " Last night . " " But how . . . ? " " Off a fisherman , " said Tregarthen . He shifted his gaze from the ocean to Mrs. Cattlett , and with an obvious effort gave the next piece of information unasked . " Come back to lend me a hand , " said Tregarthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be out to-night " Thus dismissed , Maud hurried back to find her husband , whom she had left sitting on his favorite rock at an angle of the path . It was not often that the island provided such a piece of news ; to a community of a dozen persons the addition even of one was highly important . Mrs. Cattlett arrived at the rock so obviously excited that George sprang up to meet her . " What is it , Maud ? " he cried . " Has anything happened ? " Mrs. Cattlett nodded violently . " Look , George ! Look on the end of the jetty ! " George unslung his glasses and focussed them . His reactions were all that could be desired . " Good heavens ! " he exclaimed . " What a terrific fellow ! Who is he ? " " Seal Tregarthen 's cousin , " said Mrs. Cattlett proudly . " How did he get here ? " " Off one of the fishing boats , last night . He 's come to lend Seal a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Moved by a quite disproportionate interest , the Cattletts stood to watch . With very long , very slow strides Seal Tregarthen 's cousin walked the length of the jetty , nodded to Tregarthen , and disappeared behind the angle of the waIl . A moment later his head and shoulders were again visible , moving steadily above the hedge as he mounted the cliff path ; presently only a dozen yards and a corner separated him from the Cattletts ' seat . His advance seemed as slow and as irresistible as the advance of the tide ; and suddenly , as the waters overrun the last inches of sand , he was upon them  --  bigger than both the Cattletts put together . " Good morning , " said George . " You 're Seal Tregarthen 's cousin ? " The man nodded . He did not exactly stop , but he slowed his long strideand swayed toward them . His big head was thatched with tow-colored hair , his face was deeply tanned , and as his long-sighted blue eyes rested on her husband 's face Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolently over a sparrow . She put the thought from her at once ; but it was strange how Seal Tregarthen 's cousin always suggested , right from the start , analogies with the cruder forms of nature . " It 's a fine day , " said Mr. Cattlett . Seal Tregarthen 's cousin nodded again , and the rhythm of his stride carried him past the rock . But the Cattletts were left with no sense of having been treated discourteously ; they rather felt pleased with themselves , as though they had been noticed by someone in a procession . They also felt the slight blankness that comes after a procession has passed . " There , now ! " exclaimed George Cattlett . " We never found out his name ! " They neverdid . To them , as ( it seemed ) to everyone else on the island , the newcomer remained Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin . He slipped easily and naturally into the island life , fished with Tregarthen , worked in Tregarthen 's garden , and lodged in the Tregarthen cottage . Maud Cattlett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-knitted sock and went down to ask the beautiful Mrs. Tregarthen how one turned heels  --  after which it was only natural to comment on the new arrival ; but Mrs. Tregarthen 's manners were equalled only by her discretion . " Your visitor looks like a strong man , " hazarded Maud . Mary Tregarthen nodded . This universal taciturnity was one of the local characteristics the Cattletts most prized ? " Our dear silent island ! " as they used to say to each other  --  but there were times when it could be irritating . Maud tried again . " Do you know , I do n't think we know his name . " " He 's my husband 's cousin , " said Mary , raising her dark eyes in a steady gaze . " Watch now , Mrs. Cattlett , while I start the narrowing . . . . " Maud obediently watched . That was another thing about the islanders ; they had the faculty of making themselves obeyed . Mrs. Cattlett learned how to turn a heel if she learned nothing about Seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nature , " she told her husband admiringly , and made several attempts to paint his portrait  --  but only from memory , since there was something about him which made her reluctant to ask for sittings . Not that he was in the least fierce , or rough ; on the contrary , his manners were marked by their gentleness , he did everything very quietly , and never raised his voice ; but Mrs. Cattlett felt that to sit opposite him , in silence , for hours on end , would be too much . She felt she might become hypnotized , as one can become hypnotized from gazing too long upon the sea or upon a high hill . She did not mention this idea to George , but she noticed that Mr. Cattlett himself , after each of his fishing trips with the cousins , was always unusually ready for a game of backgammon or a hand of bezique or some other bright domestic employment . A week of pleasant days passed ; never , as the Cattletts told each other , had they felt nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Cattlett fished for pollock and worked at his pool ; and then came Saturday and the weekly bunch of papers from the mainland . Apart from the headlines the Cattletts always read the art criticism first , then the literary supplements , then the dramatic notices , then any items about the Royal family ; so that it was quite often several days before they got round to the body of the news . George , on this occasion , got round first : by Tuesday night he had reached a quite obscure paragraph dealing with a rowdy episode in a French cafe . The name of the cafe was Le Coq Rouge , it was situated on the waterfront at St. Malo , and the facts were simple : on the night of the fifth a Frenchman , known only by his sobriquet of Le Petit Danilo , had in the course of an argument struck his woman companion across the mouth ; whereupon an anonymous Englishman lifted him from his seat and threw him out on to the quay . On the cobblestones of the quay Le Petit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been found at all , and it was believed that he had made good his escape in one of several fishing boats then putting out . He was variously described as a sailor and as a fisherman ; but all witnesses agreed that he was blue-eyed , fair-headed , and of gigantic size . " Maud , " said George Cattlett . " Read that . " Maud read , then she too sat staring at the paper . " The fifth , " pointed out Mr. Cattlett . " The day you saw him was the seventh , and he 'd been landed the night before . From St. Malo to here by fishing-boat would take just about twenty-four hours . " There was no need to explain whom he meant ; the gigantic figure of Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin was present in both their minds . " And he was wearing French trousers , " went on George unhappily . " Those tan-colored canvas ones . We 've seen them on the French fishermen at Penrythen . He is n't wearing them any more . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint-box . She was deeply troubled . " You really think ? ? " " Do n't you ? " " Whatever I think , " said Maud , " I do n't see that it 's our business . His description will be circulated . The police must have it already . " " The police ! " repeated George grimly . " The police do n't come here ! " This was true . There were police at Penrythen , on the mainland , there was one solitary constable on the largest of the islands ; but in practice the islanders lived outside the pale of the Law . They were noticeably casual about such things as gun- and dog-licenses ; if they were no longer wreckers , they were certainly smugglers ; their attitude to their own policeman was one of live and let live . If he did n't trouble them they would n't trouble him ; and since their instincts were sporting rather than criminal , the system worked very well . It was not , however , a system designed to co-operate with international Iaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said George . " A man has been killed . . . " " I know , dear . That 's terrible . And yet , to set the police on anyone  --  that seems so terrible too . After all , we are n't sure . " George looked at her , and her eyes fell . Quite apart from the physical description , the whole story fitted . It was so exactly what Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin would do : no word , no reproof , simply the contemptuous removal of an offensive object . That death had followed was the merest accident . " It would n't be murder , " said George . " It would be manslaughter at the most . That 's only imprisonment . " " Let 's think it over ! " pleaded Maud . " A day or two more wo n't matter . After all , he 's here , under our eye ! " That was the trouble . Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin was there , under their eye . He moved about them , tranquil , stately and benevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not speak much , but all his words were grave and kindly ; and the two I'enruddock children followed him like puppies . " I ca n't help it , " said Maud . " Whatever he 's done , it would be so dreadful to shut him up . It would be wrong . " " I wish I knew what to do , " said George . In the end they did nothing . The soft island air , the quiet routine of the island life , seemed to lull their civic instincts . They let day after day slip by , and presently the whole matter seemed to lose importance . After all , it was only an accident . Whoever killed him , the Frenchman had obviously deserved to die . Whoever killed him . . . At the end of September the Cattletts returned to Chelsea and were at once caught up in their other life . They were very busy ; George had his teaching , Maud had the flat to run , and in addition they belonged to innumerable societies for the spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended a course of lectures on Anglo-Saxon Poetry , and another course on the French Drama , and a course on Impressionist Painting . Their minds were so fully occupied that gradually all holiday memories faded together , until one night George brought home a fellow-artist who had just returned from France . He had returned , to be more exact , from St. Malo . It was Maud who asked the first question . She could n't help herself . " Did you hear anything of a  --  a disturbance there last summer , at a cafe called Le Coq Rouge ? " " When Lc Petit Danilo was thrown out on his neck and killed ? Certainly , " said the artist . He smiled , pleased to display his familiarity with water-front life . " They talk about it still . Where did you hear of it ? " " My wife read a paragraph in the paper , " said George uneasily . " It made headlines at St. Malo . The Englishman seems to have been the biggest chap ever seen . Un giant blond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maud , " catch him ? " The artist shook his head . " They did n't and they wo n't . There were three fishing boats putting out just as it all happened , and he could have tumbled straight off the quay into any one of them . The police gat hold of the skippers later of course , and collected a lobster apiece but no information . The sailormen were n't talking . " " Have some more coffee , " said George . The next day , as though to occupy their minds still further , he put down his own and his wife 's name for yet another course of lectures , this time on Citizenship . It was the most unfortunate thing he could have done . Every other Wednesday night through April , May , and June the Cattletts sat in a church hall and were exhaustively instructed in their civic duties ; with the result that after the last lecture George Cattlett came home and drank three whiskies-and-sodas in quick succession . He had never done such a thing before , and Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " exploded George . " I have thought and thought ! I have been thinking day and night about Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin ! " Maud 's face grew troubled . She could guess what was coming , " I have failed in my duty , " continued George wretchedly . " Out there on the island it all seemed different ; I do n't know what happened to me . I do n't know why I did n't go straight to the authorities at once . Because if the man is guilty he must be punished , and if he is innocent no harm will have been done . " " Yes , it will , " said Maud quickly . " Even if they do n't take him away and lock him up there 'll be police and detectives and  --  and journalists , George , writing up our island , turning it into a murder-mystery , spoiling and vulgarizing it all . . . " " Stop ! " cried George . He sat in silent misery , his head in his hands , a conscientious beauty-lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Maud firmly believed , which that night saved his reason by overpowering it . When she spoke to him again it was apparent that he was three-parts unconscious . " I must think , " he muttered , as Maud tenderly helped him to bed . " I must go on thinking . . . . " For another month the struggle continued . Neither of them mentioned the subject again , but it was continually present in their minds . On the first of August Maud , half-fearfully , packed as usual the easels and the suitcase and the boxes of paints . George made no demur . They caught their usual train from Paddington ; and then it was , during that sleepless night passed sitting upin a third-class carriage  --  that the long dilemma at last resolved itself . Physical discomfort no doubt had its effect : they were too tired to struggle any more . When they got out in the morning on to Penrythen platform they knew , without exchanging a word , that the die was cast . George 's mind was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well check the baggage , " said George . Maud nodded dumbly . She knew what he meant : they had to tell , but they could never go back to their island afterward . They would have to seek out some other , some inferior spot . With hearts heavy but resolved , they turned their steps toward the Police Station . At its portal Mrs. Cattlett drew back for the last time . " George , " she whispered , " there wo n't be a reward ? " " I should n't think so , " said George ; " if there is , of course we sha n't take it . " " They could n't make us ? " " Of course not , " said George . A little assuaged , Maud followed him into the presence of the Sergeant . The Sergeant was small and sandy , and not in the least imposing ; but he represented the Law . When he asked what he could do for them both the Cattletts instinctively displayed all the signs of guilt . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an island there , called Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin . " The Sergeant looking at him with interest . " Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin ? " " Yes , " said George . " And I think you ought to know . . " " He 's dead , " said the Sergeant . The Cattletts stared stupidly . " Drowned , " said the Sergeant . " Drowned ? " repeated George . " Dead ? But that  --  that 's incredible . / beg your pardon , but are you sure ? " " I 'm afraid so , sir . The body was identified by all his folks on the island . He was lost with his boat and washed ashore . " " But  --  when ? " " Matter of four months back . We lost a ketch from here at the same time , It 's a cruel coast in a storm . " " I still ca n't believe it , " said Maud . " I mean  --  he was n't the sort of man to die . " The Sergeant did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? That 's what the coastguard said : a proper Hercules . What was it you wanted him for ? " Between the Cattletts passed a quick glance . Then George cleared his throat nervously . He was n't used to lying . " As a matter of fact , it was simply that he  --  er  --  owed me a small debt . But it 's of no account now . " The Sergeant nodded sympathetically ; and the Cattletts went out . They could still go back to their island . At least it was n't spoilt . Tragedy had touched it but not squalor . They retrieved their baggage and boarded the steamer as usual , and on reaching the largest of the islands transferred themselves as usual to their accustomed rowboat . Everything was the same  --  the salt of the sea , the softness of the air , the sudden quietness that always marked this last stage of their journey . Everything was the same until they reached the island . At the end of the jetty , awaiting them , stood Seal Tregarthen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pebbles he stooped down , with one hand grasped the bows , with the other assisted Mrs. Cattlett ashore . Or such was his intention ; but Maud , uttering a loud cry , dropped down again into the arms of the boatman . The craft rocked violently ; George Cattlett jumped , landed in the water , and stood there transfixed , the wavelets lapping round his ankles . " Mr. Cattlett , you 'll be sopped , " said Mary Tregarthen . She had been standing a little way up the jetty , the usual grave smile of welcome on her lips ; now she advanced , ready to receive Maud Cattlett as the boatman thrust her out . Sheer force of habit enabled George to pay the man his fee ; then the boat was run out again , and the sound of its oars diminished over the water . " But you 're drowned ! " cried Mrs. Cattlett violently . Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin slowly shook his big head . " That was my cousin , " he said . " But we asked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin ' ? and they told us he was dead ! " The big head nodded . " That 's right : my cousin . I 'm Seal Tregarthen . " Maud turned almost wildly to the woman . " Seal Tregarthen . " " This is Seal , " said Mary steadily . " They were cousins , Mrs. Cattlett , and they had the same name . Like the Ambroses and the Jasper Penruddocks : we 've all the same names around here . " " Then it 's your husband , " said Maud , pity struggling with bewilderment , " your husband who has been drowned ? I 'm so sorry . " " He went as he 'd have wished , " said Mary Tregarthen . The words were like an epitaph . She lifted her head and looked up at the giant beside her . " Seal 's my man now , Mrs. Cattlett , we 're to wed soon as we can come at a parson . " M aud 's mouth opened and There are as a rule no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulation ; but this was a case to which the rules did not apply . Mary smiled . " We 're not blood-kin , Mrs. Cattlett , " she said kindly , " and a woman ca n't abide here alone . " She went up with them to their cottage and made them a cup of tea and spoke of the fishing and the flower-harvest , and then left them to their startled thoughts . " I can understand , " said George Cattlett at last . " I can understand in a way . When Seal turned up there was a Seal Tregarthen here before him ; so he was Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin . And when Seal Tregarthen was drowned he  --  the cousin  --  came into his name again . And the man who was drowned was Seal Tregarthen 's cousin . . . I admit it 's confusing . " " And yet in another way , " said Maud thoughtfully , " it 's so simple . So natural . You can see how his mind worked . And the minds  --  I suppose  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policeman , came to investigate and asked who the man was , they just said Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin . " " And he was . In a way , " said George , " he undoubtedly was . " He took a turn or two round the room , and came back to his wife . " What troubles mc , Maud , is this : Seal Tregarthen 's Cousin  --  the man we knew as Seal 's Cousin  --  had , I am more and more convinced , every reason to change his identity . And he has changed his identity . As you say , he 's done it in the simplest , most natural way possible . And I ask myself , was it so  --  so unconscious after all ? Was it the act of a child of nature , or the act of a clever criminal ? " " George ! " " And then I ask myself , " continued George , " are we still justified in letting the matter rest ? " The words were firm enough but the tone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoiled before the inevitable complications of a putative charge against a potentially dead man . The whole island , without a doubt , would swear to Seal Tregarthen 's identity . The islanders might be cunning , or they might be simpleminded , but without doubt they were loyal . Also , they did n't want trouble . . . " Look , George , " said Maud gently . " Look out of the window . " Seal Tregarthen was coming up the path . Slowly , steadily , he mounted toward them , their baggage packed easily under one arm . The evening light magnified his figure , his shadow stretched gigantic ; on his huge face was an expression of profound peace . Either he had no crime on his conscience or he had no conscience . The Cattletts were never to know which . " Of course we 're justified , " whispered Maud , " because we ca n't do anything else . He 's too much for us , George , we ca n't cope with him . No one could : not with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
