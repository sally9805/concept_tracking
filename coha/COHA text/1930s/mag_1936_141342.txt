In Norfolk , Va . one day last October , a musician named George E. von Schilling was idly playing an accordion in his sitting room while his son Stanwurt , 3 , toddled nearby . On a chair lay an euphonium , a tuba-like brass horn which Mr. von Schilling had borrowed from a friend . Suddenly Father von Schilling heard a soft beep from the big euphonium , saw that Son Stanwurt was not only blowing into it but blowing correctly from the solar plexus rather than from the chest . Von Schilling leaped to a piano , struck an F and B flat which the child immediately echoed . Musician von Schilling cried to his wife : " Mother , I 've got a euphonium player ! " <P> Father von Schilling , on &; off relief , coached small Stanwurt until the youngster could play a man-sized repertoire without fatigue to his peewee chest , throat , lips , cheeks . In December Stanwurt played the euphonium at a policemen 's entertainment in Norfolk City Auditorium . Then he graduated to the biggest wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From H. N. White Co. in Cleveland , Father von Schilling obtained a King Giant Sousaphone with a 28-in. gold bell and the standard-sized mouthpiece . The Sousaphone was mounted on a rack so that Stanwurt could crawl into it , huff &; puff , while his father accompanied on the accordion . Convinced of his offspring 's commercial possibilities , George von Schilling copyrighted the name " Master Stan and His Sousaphone , " induced a costume firm , Lilley Ames Co. of Columbus , Ohio , to provide a $100 cream- gold uniform for Stanwurt . Father von Schilling got engagements for Stanwurt and himself at Norfolk clubs , at the local Navy Yard Y. M. C. A. , and at nearby Virginia Beach . Last week , with Stanwurt 4 years old , George von Schilling announced that his sole job from now on was to be his son 's manager . Turning up at a music store in Utica , N. Y. , where the von Schillings ' act was supposed to boost sales , he declared that he and Sousaphonist Stanwurt were bound for Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The von Schillings pleased Utica . Father George furnished most of the melody on a piano-accordion while Master Stan oom-pahed bass runs for Down the Field , Ragging the Scale , Christopher Columbus . Accustomed to learn his pieces entirely by ear , Stanwurt appeared completely at ease when Mr. von Schilling tried to confuse him by varying the rhythm and tempo of Dixie . Expert musicians pronounced Stanwurt 's embouchure ( placing of the lips on the mouthpiece ) as good as his father had claimed it to be . As they moved on through music stores in Syracuse and Rochester , Mr. von Schilling reminded interviewers that his son also plays the trumpet and trombone , proudly declared : " Stanwurt just loves to smear those runs .
