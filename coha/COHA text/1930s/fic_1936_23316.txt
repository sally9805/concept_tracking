OK* MARIANA A STORY BY NANCY HALE S HE is there now , on her knees on the S soft dry earth , with her fingers groping into the earth for the roots of the little tender weeds . The sun is so warm and yellow and gentle in the late afternoon and , lower down the slope , in the swamp , the frogs are beginning to sing from their secret pools at the roots of the sumach and the joe-pye weed and the dogwood trees . Where she is kneeling the land is all hot and gold , and down there the swamp is purple and red and deep gray and dark yellow . She can hear the new breeze that comes at four o'clock when it begins to sift through the needles of the two black pine trees at the top of the hill . She can hear the Readville train go by six miles away , beyond the sunny fields and the August woods and the roads and the orchards full of bright green apples ; too far away to see its floating streamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far , far away , and the small , sad sound of its whistle ? " Ah  --  Ali  --  Ah-Aaaah . " She is moving very slowly on her knees between the carrot rows . She leans on the flat of one of her hands , and the other burrows into the powdery earth to take hold of the roots of the weeds . The sweet-smelling dirt has packed in under her finger-nails ; she pulls the weeds out one by one and drops them on the soft gray pile of dying weeds , plantain and tansy and a little weed that looked like the carrots , but limper and not so green or so brave . Two long rows of carrots , and their tops spurt up like green fountains ; under the earth her fingers feel their globes growing hard and regular . Beyond the carrots are the squash-plants with their leaves like elephant ears , and beyond , the purple-veined beets , and beyond , the low woven lattice of climbing peas , and beyond , the bush-beans , and beyond , at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up them round and round and round to the top . The sun is going down . The sun hangs over the swamp , and it has turned wild red and purple down there ; the frogs sing louder and louder from under the reeds and the furry sumach . They swell together , high and sweet and shrill into the sunset air , so sweet and lonely over the fields . The garden is in shadow , and the little wind slides through the pines and down the hill , and the dry earth turns cooler between her fingers . She starts to her feet as if her heart had beat triple . But there is no one walking down the slope or even standing at the top of the hill , between the black pine trees , looking down at her . No one has been standing quietly behind the bean-poles to surprise her when she should stand up , nor comes walking across the fields , nor waves to her from the road , nor comes at all . She climbs the little hill to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing louder and sweeter from the swamp at her back , and the crickets begin from the long fields and the country rolls out over the hills in the pale dusk behind her , beautiful and lonely . It is only on the verge of night , but she walks through the grasses thinking of those other nights . . . . He had said he would take the first plane back to New York after he had finished talking to the men . That might be the one that left in the evening or it might be the one that left sometime in the early morning , getting him back for breakfast . " It will be the first one , I hope , " she had said . " You 'd be so tired if you had to take one at five o'clock in the morning , darling , because you would n't think it was worth while to go to bed beforehand , would you ? Anyway , I hope it 's the first one . I 'd like having you wake me in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take the bad one , " he had said . " I want to get back to you too . Anyway , I 'll wire you which . " After he went she thought of meeting him at the airport when he got in . If it were the first plane it would be queer and exciting out there , and he would not be expecting it , and they would come back home together on the bus in the weird early morning and go to bed together with the thin dawn beginning to come in through the windows . Or if it were the later plane , she would go to bed early the night before and get up early with plenty of sleep and looking well and meet him out there in the morning sun and smile at him and not talk too much on the way home , and give him a big breakfast and then put him to bed with the shades drawn down , and that would be exciting too . She thought about it all day and found out how to get to theairport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But none had come by nine o'clock , and she put on her hat and went out into the hot , exhausted streets . Women in white dresses sagged along the sidewalks and children screamed in the alleyways and cripples sold shoestrings and pencils along the curb . She walked very slowly in the evening heat and watched the dirty papers blow , and the grocery-wagon horses clop wearily by , and sang to herself , and made herself lonely and sad by singing . She wondered how she had ever used to be happy alone . She ate things that she used to like in a place that she used to like , but it was not any good at all . People came in and dropped down at tables and ate disinterestedly and went away again , and they were all ugly and foreign to her . She took his picture out of her purse and looked at it while she ate ; all the beauty in the world belonged to him and was dispensed by him , and when he was not with her it was all locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this all at once clearly , and she started to walk home thinking of it : he was the key to beauty and sanity and happiness , and that was all of it  --  simply she must never be frightened because when he was away everything went flat and there was nothing to think or feel about anything . It clarified everything to know that ; it only meant that she must always have him to be able to live at all ; she must always give him everything she had , for him to give back to her explained and beautiful . At times like this there was nothing to do but wait for him to come back and make her alive again . But she was frightened again when she went into their room and turned on the light and was all alone in it . She closed the door and hurried into bed and lay listening to the lonely night noises , the children calling and the subways and the rattle of the elevated trains . She was childishly afraid of the dark until she fell asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that she had heard someone move in the room ; her heart beat wildly . After a long time she went back to sleep , without pleasure , lonely , and as though she were in a strange bed . The doorbell waked her in the morning . It was a telegraph boy , and the wire said , " Had to stay over taking evening plane get home three . " That day was all different because she knew that when she was asleep he would come back and wake her up and then he would be there at last . In the evening she got some things ready for him to eat and put them on the table in the bedroom and went to bed and to sleep without any fear ; the next thing she would know would be his presence . And he was there , and it was the middle of the night , and he was bending over the bed and kissing her awake ; she held on to him tight with all her loneliness solved . She sat up in bed and watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she had never seen him before , but not that : she knew his face and the silhouette of his head and his shoulders and his legs stretched out so well ; it made her throat ache to get him back and have him there where she could see him . She wanted to get up and go and sit on the door and put her arms round his legs and her head on his knees and say that she loved him over and over and over into a frantic monotony of repetition . But she knew that he would not like that then when he was eating ; when he was through he would come and put his arms round her himself . When he had come to bed and was beside her with his arms round her it all calmed down : there was no nervous eagerness or anxiety any more , onlyvery deep calm and peace and completeness . She was drowsy , and then he was speaking to her . on the porch at this club . Only a very little bit , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all grotesque and like a nightmare , and then she did understand and it was even more grotesque . She had n't thought before of that : he had n't suffered that pain from missing her that she had had  --  of course he was complete and life had sanity for him still without her ; he had gone on living his life in consciousness progressively from the moment he left her , and he had been in this place and there had been this girl , and he had been able to think of her as actual , as being a live personalized human being , and he had been able to direct conscious thought toward her , and he had wanted to kiss her and he had kissed her . Somebody else whom she had never even seen . She thought , suddenly , I have not really been alive or had any consciousness of reality in the whole time that he was away . She found that she was crying , bitterly , somehow separately from her thoughts , and he was talking into her ear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant absolutely nothing . There was n't any meaning in it . I kissed her a little , but I did n't give her anything of me that you have , and she knew I did n't . Do n't you see , my telling you . . . do n't you see how absolutely nothing it is ? " She felt her tears run all over their faces , and was tired of crying , but she could not stop . She could not say anything of what she felt ; she tried to talk , but she could not say it so that it meant what she was feeling . " Oh , but ... you do n't understand ? it 's that you wanted to , .. oh , you have everything when you 're away from me and I have n't got anything amooki . . . you can go on thinking . . . you wanted to . . . I mean you thought about her and you wanted something .. you do n't know what it 's like when I miss you . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't use up all of you , do n't you see ? . . . you 've got desires for other things , you can think about other things . . . you do n't understand . " " But you do n't understand . I did n't have any desire for her at all , ca n't you see ? I simply kissed her once or twice . It was nothing at all , you do n't under-stand . " " You thought about her ... she was alive for you . . . oh I ca n't make you understand ! " " For God 's sake . Why ca n't you understand ? " She is there now , watching the lonely country street light flicker down the road . She has taken off her hot shoes and the bricks of the porch floor are cold under her feet ; she moves her toes a little over their roughness . In the darkness she can smell the honeysuckles that hang in ragged festoons from the clapboards of the house . The frogs are still sawing , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the fruit and vegetables and the earth and grass and mold and the deep pine woods over all the country send up shivering waves of sweetness into the hot evening air , into the night in August . Suddenly so sharp and unbearably , one cricket far out in the deep grasses cries out alone . Dark slumberous fields , and the far hills , wide and quiet and black under the black August sky , with no stars ; only still , thick , heavy darkness , and the one yellow street light quivering in the hot night air , She watches it , and sometimes it swells bright and shines like a great four-pointed star whose rays sharpen out and out until she can not be sure wherethey disappear , or if they disappear ; then the star recedes . It is no bigger than a point of light , contracted tiny as the dot glittering at the end of a long black tunnel ; she watches it shrink and shrink , and waits for it to blare out again into the great star . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing shrill and sweet and rhythmic as the beating of a heart ; round the bend of the dim road the blaze of a car'sheadlights swings up and cuts a white path through the darkness ; the leaves of the trees that overhang the road shine out bright and feathery for a moment , and the car comes on , with a solid , purposeful noise that drowns the frogs . The lights sweep off the road as the car makes the turn toward the house , and they run across the front of the porch , across the steps , hurrying up and down the striped clapboards and off down the side of the lawn and back onto the road . The car never stops . The white lights go away up the road , and the sound goes farther and farther and farther ; they are all gone , and they never stopped . She hears the frogs again and the sharp , occasional cricket in the lower fields . She smells the sweet and sorrowful August night and sits still , and watches that one yellow street light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a responsible time , to be blamed for so much later pain , or was it only that there she had thought too much , patched together too much , lain there aching in her heart and put together in her mind little fragments of this , snatches of beauty , foreign beauty that seemed to endanger her precious and , pray God , eternal peace ; little tired , bored sentences of his made during daytimes out of that , surely , satiation with that terrible , consuming hunger and thirst and itching of hers for him that she could not help . Or could she help it ? She had never seen how she could , but there was that question : must n't she try , with all her strength , to keep it still inside herself and confront him with a calm and smiling normality ? . . . " You are the man I love ; of course , I love you very much ; but then also I have to eat and have my hair done and interview servants , things like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even thinking about you for the nonce ; for the nonce , my dear ! although when I am through I will meet you somewhere with my calm and smiling face that you can calmly admire , not all contorted and trying for you , with madness for you , just that : madness for you and about you . " .. . There had never been any question at all but that that was the practical , wise , right , successful way to be ; but how did one do it ? All the hundred thousand times she had tried , put on that face and tried being calm , working from the outside in , trying to make her heart as calm and wise as she could make her face look when she tried  --  when she made herself remember to try . Pitiful attempts that only lasted just so long , only a little , little while , even though she could see so clearly how rightly directed those efforts , even pitiful , were : his relief , his pleasure ; of course he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up , those attempts ( and she never could learn to suspect them ; those attempts were as childishly insecure as a big plumed hat vainly perched on top of a little girl 's head ; puff ! and anything untoward could blow them away ) . He would let his gaze , lately so happily relieved by seeing her calm , and leaning back in her chair at their caf ? table , wander , oh , about , anywhere , why not , in Heaven 's name ? But always , somebody ; dark , or fair . " Look , that one over there ; she is pretty , is n't she ? " And with the exactly last gasp of strength of her heart she would manage to say , " Yes , she really is pretty . " And then the mask was oft , the guard was down , the whole silly attempt was off , ruined by a little thing like that . The next thing , he would look back at her , beside him , and find that all her calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all the exasperating torture and that madness were back in her face , and she was leaning forward , burning up with fever inside , looking and looking and looking , at his turned face , his close , warm ears , his lovely strong throat . She wanted him so , and there was no way in the whole world to surround him , own him , grow around him enough to suit the way she wanted him : more and more , and nothing was ever enough . So there seemed to be nothing to do but try him , poor , poor normal patient one , with the reflection of all that wanting in her face , and in her hands that she could hardly keep in her lap ; they were always trembling to lie against his cheek and slide down his throat , or feel his shoulders under the cloth of his coat . She would have given her soul to be calm , and not to five that reaching . imploring life . Naturally , if she had been calm she could have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more ! No wonder those fantastic big black hats blew off in the littlest breeze . . . Or not even a breeze at all ; in their room , alone , dressing or undressing or sitting or anything at all , quietly , in the small corners of her mind caution would set to work to save her yet : be gay , be inattentive , be friendly as if he were just a human being to you , be calm ! So she would make him repeat something twice  --  as if she did n't hear every word of his on the instant , always ! ? and crack a joke , and go over to the window and look out as though the world outside , the garden , or the house-tops held additional interest for her , something that made them worth looking at . And it always worked ; his relief , again his pleasure , sweet pleasure , that she was not in that eternal , inexplicable , exhausting pain . And then  --  without even a breeze to blow it all away too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those other , mad eyes , the sweetness of his warm temples where tiny soft hair grew tenderly , or hear with those other , mad ears , the deep lovely timbre of his voice , or simply look , suspecting nothing , at him from across the room , his broad fiat shoulders , or the elegant , columnar rise of his ankles from his feet . And then , one more time , any bravery , any attempt to let him alone to be himself , give him the freedom of separateness , was absolutely , crash ! ruined . The ache back in her heart and the fever in her hands , and at once she was back beside him , too close , far too eager , not caring , not aware of being a separate person , herself , any more at all , only wanting to kiss , to touch , anything  --  to knee ! very quietly down on her knees beside him and hold his hands to her mouth and to cry and cry because there was nothing in the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why ? Because that was n't what he wanted . Of other nights : After he had taken her home he moved about restlessly , and after a while he said he wanted to go out again , he was n't sleepy ; and , putting on one of the silly hats of separateness that never stayed on , she told him to go , to come back as soon as he really was tired and wanted to go to bed . That time it was all ruined , the bravery , just as he was going out the door ( relieved and happy at her pleasant sanity ) : " Darling , darling , you will come back , wo n't you ? " With so much too much real pain and desperation in it ; When there was nothing whatever to be hurt and desperate about ; all the peace went out of his face . His shoulders , naturally , went up . " Of course I 'll come back . " Of course he would ; where else would he go ? But she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Simply , never leave me , never live at all without me . But even that was n't all of it . And when he did come back , very , very late , it was all true , all of the nightmare between his going and his coming back ; all the frightful , unbearable dreams , the pure horror of those hours that could not possibly be true but was true . And again : " But do n't you understand , darling , it did n't mean anything at all ? You do n't see : a man can do that with a woman and not give anything , not a single thing . Darling , why must you mind so much ? You know all of me belongs to you . " She did try to understand what those words meant , to credit them with a sense that certainly must exist somewhere , but far , far away , and not for her . Just  --  that unbearable , lovely thing , him , wanting the woman and having her , and she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a miracle . But his wanting her ! Over and over and over : his wanting her , putting out his  --  beautiful  --  strong ? hands , and touching her , and leaning with his lips to her so that she , that woman , could smell his smell . . . . Over and over and over , in the sharpest and most bitter pain , incredible pain that after a while became almost the whole of it , the origin forgotten , just frightful pain that eased a little bit and then she thought , Oh God , it 's stopped hurting , thank  --  but there it was again , so incredible , like dying in severe anguish ; what is there to do , how can this be stopped , this pain can  --  not ? con ti nue . But it could , in the heart ; and her heart beat and beat , faster and faster , so much more like a trembling than like beating , but a strong , hard , bitter trembling that she felt in her throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain came , rhythmically ; she forgot , by mercy and exhaustion , and then , the minute she had a little strength , back it came , so far beyond screaming at , such terrible , old pain . " I ca n't stand it , " she said . That was a great deal later . " Listen , darling , " he said . " There is n't anything , ca n't you see , to stand , as you call it . It is n't anything at all , it means less than nothing . You do n't understand . " " You do n't understand , " she said . " I ca n't help it . It happens to me . I do n't want it . You do n't understand . " " If you could just see that there is n't anything to hurt you . Nothing at all . " " I ca n't stand it , " she said . She believed that it was impossible to stand it . And so she is there now , awake , and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not sleep . The month might be June instead of mid-August , the birds sing so light and high up in the branches , and the fine dew spreads the morning country with a deceptive haze , as pale and delicate as spring . The dust is damp and settled along the road ; far out in the meadows a cicada shrills tentatively , then ceases . She stands out by the edge of the road , and the wet grass cools her ankles . The morning Lies very still , waiting for the opening roar of heat that opens up the August day . Back in the fields the cows are walking , and one of them wears a bell that rings , faint and far , across the early day ; and farther yet , the morning trains go out from Readville , beyond the hills and the morning woods , but the whistle sound drifts over ? " Ah  --  Ah  --  Ah-Aa a a h . " Everything is very hushed and cautious ; the leaves in the trees lie still and damp , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves at all ; everything smells sweet and languorous , of summer . Round the curve in the road the postman comes , with his leather pouch swinging from his hand , slapping against the calf of his leg as he walks . She puts her hand against the sharp rough bark of the elm beside her and leans on it and watches the postman dragging up the road . He comes on and on , and there are bright blue patches under the arms of his blue cotton shirt ; she sees them brighter as he comes on . As he walks past , she sees the wrinkled creases in his dim blue trousers and the dust that lies on the brim of his old straw hat . He nods at her , a tired nod that is only an exaggeration of the rhythmical bobbing of his head in time with his walking ; but he goes by , with the leather bag banging listlessly against his leg . And he goes out of sight with the road , down under the hill where the black pines stand up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves that she can see , only the country beginning to quiver a little with the coming heat , the loud birds hushing with weariness as the air grows hotter , and the sharp , increasing cicada that shrieks from the lower meadows . She turns and walks a little , walks a little , hack toward the house . There is nothing at all except the hot yellow day coming on , rolling in from the horizon , turning the far fields dusty . There is nothing at all but the screaming , furious noon , and the sad , hot afternoon , and the lonely evening . All the country is sweet , and far , and sad in the throbbing sun . There is nothing to hurt her , nothing that tears apart the monotony of her heartbeat , nothing to endure . .. . She walks across the grass and feels it drying , dusty against her ankles ; she wanders through the grass , all alone , all safe , and wishes she were dead .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
