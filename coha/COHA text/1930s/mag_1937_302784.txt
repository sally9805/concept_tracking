In 1809 , Miss Nancy Vanuxem , pretty debutante daughter of Philadelphia City Councilman James Vanuxem , swathed herself in cheesecloth draperies and stepped up on a model stand holding a stuffed bittern by the right leg . It was a unique occasion in the history of U. S. art . William Rush , the first native wood carver of sufficient ability and reputation to be known as a sculptor , was at work on the first public fountain figure ever erected in the U. S. , using , so far as records show , the first living female model . Years later the scene was painted by famed Thomas Eakins in one of his better canvases . <P> This week the fountain of Miss Vanuxem and her bittern ( known officially as the " Spirit of the Schuylkill " ) was on view at the Philadelphia Museum of Art , and with it something unique in the history of art exhibitions : every known surviving work by Sculptor William Rush . Preparing for the show for ten months , Curator Henri Marceau raised the list of known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it entailed a raid on Independence Hall itself for a statue of Washington , all of them were finally made available for this week 's show . <P> Sculptor Rush , son of a ship carpenter , started his career as a carver of ship figureheads and as such was neither unknown nor unrewarded . Besides being a ship carpenter his father was also first cousin to famed Dr. Benjamin Rush , best known American physician of his day , signer of the Declaration of Independence . Rush figureheads were in such demand that he employed apprentices to help him chop them out . Among shipowners he was famed for reintroducing the vertical figurehead , a figure that stood upright on the cutwater instead of hanging horizontally over the sea . British ship carpenters stood teetering with sketch pads in little boats to copy the latest Rush figureheads when new U. S. clippers reached the Thames , and one , a " River God " for the Ganges , was greatly admired by impressionable Hindus . Though the original figurehead for the Constitution was carved by a Boston carver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . <P> William Rush was not long satisfied with figurehead carving . Bemoaning the fact that he never had time to learn marble cutting , he did portraits of Washington , Franklin . Voltaire , Rousseau , Tilliam Penn , Lafayette , even carved a huge wooden crucifix for the Catholic Church of St. Augustine in Philadelphia . In 1844 an anti-Catholic mob destroyed it . <P> Artistically , the most important Rush statue in this week 's show was the George Washington borrowed from Independence Hall , which can hold its own with any Houdon . Interesting are a number of large anatomical models carved from wood for the University of Pennsylvania more than a century ago , so accurate that they are still used in lectures to medical students . <P> Sculptor Rush 's use of a female model shocked and outraged Philadelphia Quakers , but they soon forgave him . He was a member of the City Council for 22 years , a founder of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts , a member of its board until his death in 1833.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
