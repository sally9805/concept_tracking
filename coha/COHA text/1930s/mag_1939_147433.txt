What is propaganda ? Once the word meant nothing more than the legitimate promulgation of ideas . World War I and the methods of totalitarian governments later gave the word a new meaning , linked it to organized , wide-scale lying , the deliberate manufacture of atrocity stories , misrepresentation of enemy aims , minimizing of enemy successes , exaggeration of enemy defeats , the conscious manipulation of sentiments to arouse war spirit , hatred of the enemy at home and sympathy among neutrals abroad . The pattern of propaganda remains the same , though varying in degree and accent according to the country it comes from . The threefold task of propaganda ministries will still be in World War II as it was in World War I : 1 ) to undermine enemy morale ; 2 ) hearten home forces ; 3 ) give neutrals the very best impression possible . <P> Great Britain and Germany came out of World War I with diametrically opposed attitude toward propaganda .

Manifestoed Hindenburg : " The enemy . . . seeks to poison our spirit . . . . His airmen throw down leaflets which are intended to kill the soul . " <P> British situation was the reverse . Great Britain came out of World War I with a group of battle-scarred veterans of propaganda and a world-wide reputation for amazing cleverness in molding public opinion . For many a post-War year the seediest remittance man in South America was judged a secret agent ; the hungriest British novelist lecturing to the U. S. was thought by many to be a Foreign Office spokesman . Britain 's propaganda office was not organized until long after the invasion of Belgium , nevertheless reaction gave neutrals an enduring suspicion of Britons bearing news . <P> Shadow .

When Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made Baron Macmillan of Aberfeldy Britain 's Minister of Information , he gave the 66-year-old peer one of the toughest , one of the most delicate , of Britain 's wartime jobs . It was one of the undeveloped " shadow ministries . " Lord Macmillan had to organize a staff to sift and relay war news after war news had already begun to come in .
