About the cause &; cure of drunkenness doctors know little . But recently many of them have swung around to the theory that every drunkard is a spineless neurotic , driven to drink by some psychic gnawing . <P> Last week this theory got a bucket of cold water thrown right in its face . In the New England Journal of Medicine , hard-headed Psychiatrists Robert Edward Fleming and Kenneth James Tillotson denied that there is any such thing as an " alcoholic personality . " Anyone , they said , " can become an alcoholic if he drinks long enough and heavily enough . " <P> The doctors had followed like hawks the zigzag progress of 124 drunkards ( 100 male , 24 female ) in McLean Hospital , Waverly , Mass . " A more variegated collection of personalities , " they wrote , " would be difficult to assemble : some were sociable , some seclusive , some stubborn , some easily influenced , some cyclothymic manic-depressive , some schizoid ingrown , some intelligent , some dull and so on , ad infinitum ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addiction to the excessive use of alcohol . " Why they drank , the doctors found it impossible to discover . <P> The feelings of inferiority which plagued a number of the patients were caused by " wife 's , parents ' and friends ' exhortations , threats and so forth , and it is , we believe , these influences which . . . are largely responsible for those personality trends which alcoholic patients have been supposed to possess in common .
