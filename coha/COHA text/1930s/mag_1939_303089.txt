In the hills of Devon , in western England , some 30 years ago , " Black Monks " + of the Benedictine order pulled aprons over their rough black robes , began a task which would have stumped most men . They undertook to rebuild Buckfast Abbey , crumbled to ruins in the 360-odd years since Henry VIII had dissolved England 's monasteries . <P> Laying up stone by stone under the direction of their German-born Lord Abbot , Dom Anscar Vonier , the Benedictines-never numbering more than a half-dozen at a time-labored for 25 years . Their abbey was consecrated in 1932 . But the scaffolding on the great tower of Buckfast was not removed until last December . A few days later death came to wise and kindly Abbot Vonier , 63 . <P> Benedictines-an order midway between the other-worldly Franciscans and the activist Dominicans and Jesuits-are vowed to " Stability , Conversion of morals 2nd Obedience .

Their choice was a German-born monk ( now a British subject ) named Dom Bruno Fehrenbacher , who 28 years ago became a Benedictine upon hearing of the work in progress at Buckfast . Dom Eruno , at his election , was laboring at a task assigned him by the Abbot General-teaching Uniat ( Eastern Catholic ) Syrian priests in the Holy Land . <P> Last week the Buckfast monks and lay brothers busied themselves redding up the abbey as well as performing their usual work at their beehives and their huge wine casks ( they sell honey , market a " Buckfast Tonic , " the latter described by rival Benedictines as " good port spoiled by adding something or other " ) . This week Buckfast expected 1,000 visitors for the ' Blessing " of Lord Abbot Fehrenbacher by the Bishop of Plymouth .
