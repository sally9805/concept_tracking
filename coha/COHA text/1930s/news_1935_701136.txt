txt Chattanooga bade a sad farewell to Adolph S. Ochs today with a simple , moving tribute in keeping with the unassuming kindliness of the man himself . As a final service was being held for him in the Julius and Bertha Ochs Memorial Temple , which he gave to Mizpah Congregation , almost every form of activity in this normally busy city came to a halt as Chattanooga 's last token of respect . Street cars stopped ; banks closed their doors ; public buildings were dark ; merchants shut their shops , and in homes throughout the city and on the slopes of the surrounding mountains residents unable to attend the service prayed silently for the man who had been the benefactor of this community . Temple Is Thronged . Within the temple every seat was taken and scores stood along the back and sides of the beautiful auditorium as the majestic words of the psalmist , " For He giveth His beloved sleep , " were read . Rabbi Abraham Feinstein of Mizpah Congregation and the Rev. Dr. Thomas S. McCallie of the Central Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , two and a half hours before the opening of the ceremony , old friends and admirers of the publisher of THE NEW YORK TIMES and The Chattanooga Times had visited the temple to view his features for the last time . He lay in a simple gray coffin at the foot of the pulpit . Through the night and early morning hours twenty young men of the Hai Resh Fraternity , a Jewish youths ' organization , had kept faithful watch beside the bier and at the doors of the temple . They guided in those who had been unable to pay their respects to the dead philanthropist during the four hours yesterday when the body lay in state . Shortly before 9 o'clock the coffin was closed and the stream of visitors of every age , creed and walk of life was directed to the seats of the edifice . It quickly filled to its capacity , while a dense throng remained outside the doors seeking entrance . Roses From White House . Floral offerings in profusion filled the forward end of the auditorium . Shortly before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House containing a spray of red roses and snapdragons , accompanied by the cards of the President and Mrs. Roosevelt . The members of the Ochs family who were able to be present occupied seats at the front of the auditorium on the right side and the honorary pallbearers were on the left . . The members of the family present were Colonel Milton B. Ochs , his brother , and Mrs. Milton B. Ochs ; Mrs. Harry C. Adler , his sister , and Mr. Adler ; Colonel Julius Ochs Adler , nephew , and Mrs. Adler ; Miss Marian Sulzberger , oldest granddaughter of Mr. Ochs , who accompanied him to Chattanooga on Sunday ; Adolph Shelby Ochs , nephew , and his wife and son , Martin Shelby Ochs ; Harry Wise , brother of Mrs. Adolph S. Ochs , and Mrs. Wise , and Mr. and Mrs. Harry Wise Jr . A group of Negro family servants were seated immediately behind the family . Some of them had served Mr. Ochs in his home here at 415 West Fifth Street , now the residence of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New York , almost forty years ago . Music Opens Service . As those in the gathering were taking their seats Miss Emily Relfe , organist , played , and at 9:30 o'clock she opened the service with Chopin 's " Funeral March . " Rabbi Feinstein came forward to the pulpit and read the ritual of the service and the Ninetieth Psalm , which was a favorite of Mr. Ochs 's . Handel 's " Largo " was played on the violin by Lester Cohn , who had frequently in past years played that composition , one of Mr. Ochs 's fa- vorites , at services attended by the publisher on his visits here . Then Dr. McCallie , an almost lifelong friend of Mr. Ochs and the official chaplain of the city of Chattanooga , as well as pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church , stepped forward . In his tribute to Mr. Ochs , Dr. McCallie said : " It takes nothing from the bitterness of our grief to know that in ' all the corners of the earth today there are those who share it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join with us , as we , his friends , have gathered here to pay tribute to the memory of Adolph S. Ochs . " It is not the province of the minister of God to attempt to assay the achievements of man . The history of our times will do that . It will record the progress , the assistance that he contributed to our civilization . But it is for me rather to speak of the qualities that made the true man . " Mr. Ochs went through none of our great universities , but he went through life with open eyes , while so many keep them closed . There came to him constantly great visions of the potentialities inherent in man . He realized early in life that what others had done it was possible for him to do , and he did that which so many men fail to do . " We all dream , we all indulge in visions of greatness at times , but we build our castles in the air . He began underneath , down on the earth where men live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own character , to lay a base upon which his dreams might rise . " Adolph Ochs began in those early , formative years by tireless energy , willingness to sacrifice , willingness to live . He craved not the luxuries of life but only the luxury of effort , for , after all , that is the sweetest luxury of man . " He cultivated all the things that go to make up a real man  --  above all , a sense of honor . This young man underwent trying sacrifices to fulfill every obligation he had undertaken . Here in Chattanooga , as eventually in all the world , his word was his bond and he lived up 1 to it as to his sense of honor . " But a man needs even more than that to make his life complete . He needs the knowledge that he must share his wealth with other men . He began early in his life to share with those who aided him , to divide what God had given him with others . " As God gave him increasing wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal desires but to help build up a better day , a better civilization . " A man must not look only at the interests of his own ; he must have a deep sense of consciousness of God . I remember looking into his face when this temple was dedicated to the worship of God , and at a reference to his father his face wreathed with smiles , but his eyes were dimmed with tears . And those who saw him then knew that whatever he did was not for personal aggrandizement but in the service of God . " This was the life of Adolph S. Ochs . " The hush that followed Dr. . McCallie 's tribute was broken by Miss Isabelle Friedman 's singing of the Twenty-third Psalm , " The Lord Is My Shepherd . " Rabbi Feinstein 's Eulogy . Rabbi Feinstein then delivered his eulogy , in which he said : " We are assembled in this house of God to bid final farewell to Adolph S. Ochs , Chattanooga 's cal1 zen emeritus , one of the few immortals of this century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Israel , the beloved friend of thousands in every station and walk of life , the personal and concerned friend of all those many who ever worked with or for him . " The first thought to which I wish now to give expression , a thought which must have come to the mind of every resident of our city as soon as the sad intelligence of the passing of the foremost and best loved citizen and benefactor of Chattanooga reached his ears , is that it seems to all of us providentially meet and right and a fitting f4nale to the busy , useful and distinguished life of Adolph S. Ochs that he was gathered to his fathers in this city , which was his first love and where he truly began his epic and romantic career ; that he rested in peace in the home of his parents , the home where he spent his boyhood days , the home to which he was deeply attached ; that he should lie in state , and that this reverent and simple service should be held in this temple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bertha Ochs , the parents , but also as an everlasting witness to the parental devotion , the piety , the simplicity and the imagination of Adolph S. Ochs , the son , who built this holy house in love and in humility to honor his sainted parents . " We are told by the biblical sage that when Joseph made himself known to his brothers he tried to reassure them by saying to them : ' So now it was not you who sent me hither , but God . ' " Similarly , do I have the faith that God , in His wisdom and love , saw fit to bring Adolph ** here so that here he might breathe his last , in peace and in confidence , in a community that loved him , and all of whom looked to him as their exemplar , their hero and the inspiration of their children . Yes , God was with him and blessed him in death as in life . " A Part of History . " " Thousands , the world over , have eulogized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a business genius , as an ideal philanthropist , depicted by one of our ancient sages , whose left hand did not know that his right hand had given ; as a just and considerate employer , as a genuine friend , as a man whom governments , universities , Kings and Presidents were delighted to honor ; as a public servant , a benefactor of high causes , as a conservative yet liberal-minded leader and molder of public opinion in the direction of truth , righteousness , progress and civic decency . " It would be vain for me , nor have I the time now , to enlarge upon the many excellencies , talents and achievements of our noble deceased . They are a part of history . They are well known to you . " But some of you may not know that there was a great and eternal principle that directed him and guided him in all his activities and relationships , a principle that explains not alone the success that he attained in the world of business , but also the success with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . " At the invitation of Adolph S. Ochs and his lovable wife , I visited them two years ago at their home in Lake George . The first thing that impressed me when I met them was their geniality , their simplicity , their utter detestation of all show or display , their friendliness and proNFerbially Southern hospitality . The second thing that struck my attention when I entered their living room was the biblical text en1 graven in large and bold letters on the wall over their fireplace . " ' Unless the Lord build the house , they labor in vain that build it . ' " I expressed to my host my delight with the beauty and appropriateness of these words from the psalmist prominently blazoned to all who enter his home . He turned to me and said : ' Rabbi , I have always believed in the truth of these words and I have tried to apply them . ' " Profoundly Religious Man . " " Here , my friends , you have the 1 principle and the explanation , at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained ) , of the life and character of this great man . " He built his newspapers , his family life , his philanthropies , all of his ventures , interests and purI poses on the highest and deepest foundations of truth , honor , right , patriotism , loyalty and human welfare , and , therefore , did he not labor in vain . " Adolph S. Ochs was a profoundly religious man , possessed of deep and broad religious convictions , a rich and abundant faith that was his through the precept and example of his parents . He was a loyal and ardent Jew , who was happy in his inherited faith and proud of the history and contribuItions of his people . I am convinced that it was his grief over the tragedy that has befallen our people in Germany , a tragedy that he could not shut out of his mind and heart , that shortened his days and saddened them . " God and his moral law , Israel and humanity were ever present with him . On them he builded his entire life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was and did . Therefore , did he not live in vain . It was his faithfulness to the great principle , voiced by the biblical poet of old , plus his profound reverence for the memory of his parents and the natural goodness of his heart , the genius of his mind and native gentility and humaneness , that explain and define , in part , the man Adolph S. Ochs , the great American and the great I Jew . " Because his life was builded upon these firm foundations , because God was ever speaking to him , therefore was he humble , modest , unassuming . He knew by name thousands of humble men and women . His employes loved him because they felt that he was their friend and that he did not think himself too great or too high to be I with them or speak with them . He was a man who had as many friends among the great as among the lowly , among the famous as among the meek , and among all he walked as an equal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart , therefore , did he love all of his fellow-men . " The life of Adolph S. Ochs was not in vain . He lived an eternity . He became immortal in life . He shall surely ascend the hill of the I Lord . For he was clean of hands and pure of heart . He never inclined his soul unto falsehood . Nor did he swear deceitfully . He will surely enjoy the blessing of God and the favor of the God of his salvation . Amen . " Rabbi Feinstein closed the service by reading the Kaddish , the ritual prayer for the dead . Departing , the members of the family party and the honorary pallbearers left by a door at the side of the temple , from which the coffin was carried . It was covered , ) as it had been through the service , by a pall of red roses and gardenias , the gift of The Chattanooga Times . Meanwhile , the others present were leaving by the main entrance of the temple on McCallie Avenue . The funeral cortege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned into McCallie Avenue , then into Douglas Street and Vine Street , in order to stop in front of the synagogue of the orthodox Congr , gation B'nai Zion , which had especially requested that this be done . A double row of saddened men and women were waiting on the steps of the synagogue as the funeral procession stopped . Above them the menorahs were lighted at each side of the doorway . Rabbi Israel Gerstein of the congregation delivered a prayer . Standing at attention , with bared heads , across the street was a delegation of about fifty khaki-clad youths from Camp Adolph S. Ochs of the CCC , which occupies a site on Lookout Mountain overlooking the Lookout Mountain National ' ' Park , for which Mr. Ochs gave almost all the land . Resuming its progress , the funeral cortege turned into Georgia Avenue , passing the Hamilton County Court House , which was closed in honor of Mr. Ochs 's memory . It continued past the building of The Chattanooga Times . hung with mourning , where still another group of sorrowing men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration felt for Mr. Ochs by all ranks of his former fellow townsmen were manifest throughout the progress of the funeral procession . At its approach traffic policemen bared their heads and stood rigidly at attention ; pedestrians humbly lowered their glances ; almost every business establishment had closed its doors . The funeral procession turned into Market Street and arrived at the terminal station of the Southern Railway , where it disbanded . The coffin , still covered with flowers , was placed aboard a special funeral car , which was filled with other floral tributes . Members of Mr. Ochs 's family and a few close friends accompanied the body north on the train leaving here at 11:20 , which will arrive in New York tomorrow . They were Miss Marian Sulzberger , Colonel Milton B. Ochs , Colonel Julius Ochs Adler and Mrs. Adler , Adolph Shelby Ochs , Harry Wise , Dr. McCallie , Mayor E. D. Bass of Chattanooga , Z. C. Patten and Mr. Ochs 's nurse , Miss Cunningham .               @ @ @ @ @ @
