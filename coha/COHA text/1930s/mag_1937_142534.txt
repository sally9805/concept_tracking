The sixth anniversary of the founding of the Spanish Republic was celebrated by Leftist Spain last week with many a fervent vow " to redouble labor for victory . " To Spanish President Manuel Azaa came a cable of good wishes from Japan 's Emperor Hirohito , indicating that Japan has no intention of recognizing the Insurgent regime of General Francisco Franco . Unperturbed , General Franco wiped the anniversary from the Rightist calendar , decreed a fiesta for May 2 to mark " the first triumphal year " of his revolt which began last July . The discrepancy of two months he overlooked in order to offset the " Red " May Day events which will be observed elsewhere in Europe . <P> Though the Leftists had the best of last week 's fighting , the Rightists showed no sign of cracking and the end of the war seemed as far off as ever . Most critical battle of the week was to the southeast of Bilbao , the Basque capital which Rightist General Emilio Mola was determined to storm or starve out . Backward and forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarding the plains five miles from the key city of Durango . Besieged by land , blockaded by sea Bilbao 's war-swollen population of 350,000 was reported eating cats and seagulls . Gritting his teeth , Basque President Jos Antonio de Aguirre y Lecube declared : " We are in good shape . " <P> In southern Spain , 80 miles from the Portuguese frontier , 1,500 Rightists who eight months ago shut themselves up in the Sanctuary of the Virgin , a convent atop Mount Cabeza , last week scaled the granite walls of their fortress to escape . They were fleeing not from the Leftist siege but from two officers of their own side , Captain Cortes and Lieutenant Ruano , who had set up a rule of military terror in the convent , throwing into musty cells the starved and sick who wanted to surrender . During the siege , 21 children were born in the Virgin 's Sanctuary . <P> On Madrid 's siege-front 3,000 Rightists , bottled up amid the wreckage of University City , were in bad shape . With little or no drinking water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for General Franco 's main body on the other side of the Manzanares River to come to their aid . General Jos Miaja , Leftist commander in central Spain , by loudspeakers ordered the trapped Rightists to surrender or be annihilated . They received the ultimatum with grim defiance , and by week 's end were still holding their ground , besieged within a siege . <P> One spark of humanity relieved the savage horror of the civil war last week . With Rightist corpses strewn over the El Pardo sector , just northwest of Madrid , General Franco passed word from trench to trench to ask the Leftists for a brief truce during which he might bury his dead . The Leftists gave the cease-fire order and Franco 's stretcher-bearers gathered up crumpled bodies while guns in other sectors boomed a gruesome requiem . <P> Next day the Leftists alleged that they had uncovered " the largest spy ring found in the capital since the war started " : 55 spys , including " a number of monks paid by Italian religious organizations " and twelve women ostensibly fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madrid over to General Franco .
