" So that was it , " he said finally , " you dragged Bill Jones at the end of your rope . " " Eet ees no matter for laughing , " Tony said aggrievedly . " Theese Beeljones , I catch him stealing one of the patr  --  n 's horses . Like I say , I am hot of the temper . I theenk I teach heem a lesson when I drop my rope around bees shirt and drag him over the groan ' . I teach heem lesson , all right . He nearly die . The patr  --  n was ver ' angry , saying I should have let Beeljones have the horse in a country that has so many . But the feelings of me are injure ' .

I see Teresa . I 'm theenk I am stay here  --  at leas ' for long time . I 'm think I ai n't nevair go back to the Rancho Sicamoro . " Tony beamed proudly on Teresa , passed one arm about the girl 's shoulders . " You ai n't blame me  --  no ' ? My Teresa eet ees who ees learn me to spik the so-good Americano language . I 'm think I could not do without my Teresa . " Teresa blushed . Followed swift whisperings between the pair that heightened her color and Dilliard 's embarrassment . Dilliard said , " Say , if you do n't mind , cut out  | the turtle doving and tell me about Don Salvadore , will you ? " The pair separated reluctantly . Tony said , " Ah , the patr  --  n . I 'm wish sometimes I hav ' nevair leave heem . I tell you , Se  --  or Branch , nevair have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ees as beeg as hees rancho " An ' it is time , " Teresa said , " that Tony should return to the patr  --  n 's house . Plenty of trouble have come to him . It is to be regret that nozzing can be done . " " And I reckon , " Dilliard said , " he 's got more trouble due . Unless , " grimly , " I take a hand . " " What is this ? " Tony asked quickly . " Castameto has a daughter , has n't he ? " Tony nodded vigorously . " I remember her before she goes to the East  --  to your Boston . Ah , " enthusiastically , " she was beautiful ! Almos ' hastily , " ? almos ' so beautiful as my Teresa . Is it not so , Teresa mia ? You hav ' seen her once . " Teresa augmented Tony 's information . " It is true like you say , Antonio . The Se  --  orita Castameto is like  --  like ? " English was n't sufficient ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver flame in the dusk . " " Or a pale yellow rose of Monterey , " Tony said softly . Branch nodded slowly . " She 's all of that . " " What ? " from Tony . " Where have you seen the se  --  orita ? "  | " Here  --  in Santa Lozana . She arrived by carriage from San Pedro , late last night  --  early this mornin ' , rather . Tomorrow morning , shortly after dawn , when she has rested , the journey to the Rancho Sicamoro will be resumed . " " And thus she could join her padre by tomorrow night ? " Teresa commenced . Tony broke in quickly , " How is it you know all this , Se  --  or Branch ? " " I overheard some talk in the Cantina of the Golden Cock a spell before I came here ? " Teresa 's disgusted sniff interrupted , " Bah ! Small wonder we could not find you when we searched . To think of you entering that den of vileness . Do you not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs and dogs ? Murder and gambling takes place ? " " That joint is all that you say , " Dilliard agreed . He did n't add that he had gone to the Cantina of the Golden Cock to escape the thanks of Tony and Teresa , knowing they would never dream of looking into the place for him . " No matter , I just wandered inside . I heard two men talking . They 'd been drinking and did n't have enough sense to keep their voices down . I heard certain plans being made . Tony , do you know two hombres in this town named Bisbee and Corill ? " Tony swore in Spanish and nodded vigorously . " This Bisbee is a bull of a man with red whiskers ?  | Si , Wirt Bisbee . And Clem Corill , a small black snake with poisonous eyes ? " " You called the turn , Tony . " " Si , I know them . Hombres muy malo ! Ver ' bad ! Corill is of the worst . In the town of El Vaca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in El Vaca while Drake Scabbard is in control . Both men worked for Scabbard at one time . A week ago they arrived in Santa Lozana " Drake Scabbard ? Seems like I heard his name too , " Dilliard frowned . " Is he here ? What about him ? " " Scabbard rarely rides out of El Vaca . If he is here I have not seen him . Of all black-hearted men he is the blackest . It is Scabbard who would ruin Don Salvadore Castameto . " Tony 's eyes flashed angrily . " Ah , I would like the chance to t'row a rope aroun ' Drake Scabbard 's shirt . " " Tony , " Teresa said , " the Se  --  or Branch was telling us something . " Dilliard went on , " I was telling you I heard Bisbee and Corill talking in the cantina . They got pretty careless in their habla and I heard a good deal more than was intended for an outsider 's ears . But here 's the bad news : there 's a plot afoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked . " Kidnap ? What is this kidnap ? Nap ? Sleep  --  no ? The se  --  orita is no longer what you call the kid , but what is this scheme to make her to sleep ? "  | Dilliard explained in Spanish . Tony and Teresa gained their feet , gesticulating angrily . Teresa spouted indignant Spanish , intersprinkled with mouth-filling words of American profanity of whose meaning she was completely ignorant . " Por Dios ! " from Teresa . " It must be stopped ! " Tony gulped , " Madre de Dios ! Madre de Dios ! " Dilliard finally succeeded in calming the pair and bringing them back to a sober realization of the necessity of sane thinking . Tony cooled down after a time , offered Dilliard a cigarro , lighted its companion for himself . Dilliard 's teeth clamped down on the cylinder of tobacco . Silence fell on the room , fragrant smoke weaving graceful patterns above the dish-cluttered table . Tony broke the silence first . " What is to be done ' ? I think I shall ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack time for that , " Dilliard said . " There 's a deputy-sheriff some place in Santa Lozana . " Tony swore softly . " No good , eh ? " from Dilliard . " No good at all . Cowardly , a cheat , a robber , a bully . " Further silence between the three . The cigarro was half consumed before Branch Dilliard reached a decision : " Well , I reckon it 's up to me . Now , I got to figure out how to do it . " Tony 's eyes widened . " What ? You would the rescue attemp ' ? You  --  yourself ? " " I do n't see any other way . "  | Tony sighed , looked longingly at Teresa , shrugged hopeless shoulders . " Then , " he announced dramatically , " you mus ' count on my body also . But we shall be kill ' . That is certain ! Already , Se  --  or Branch , you hav ' make the enemies in Santa Lozana . When you save my so worthless skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide of yourself . Those men had frien 's . Two of those frien 's are Bisbee and Corill . " " It is gossiped about the plaza , " Teresa spoke slowly in Spanish , " that by his actions last night , the Se  --  or Branch has made himself a renegade from his own people , that he aided a Mexican against Americanos . There has even been talk of a reprisal . The talk smolders hotly , only that , but a move in defiance of Corill and Bisbee will be sure to fan into life the fierce flames of revenge . " Dilliard scowled impatiently . " I heard somethin ' of that talk , myself , this mornin ' . That renegade talk does n't bother me . I 'm not worryin . ' All I 'm thinkin ' about right now is the Se  --  orita Castameto ? and the job ahead . We 've got to make plans , and make ' em fast ! "  | The sun commenced to shift , throwing a broad patch of yellow light through the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time . Tobacco smoke drifted lazily through the window in the side wall to seek the outer air . Once Teresa departed and returned with a bottle of wine . The conversation gradually picked up ; various plans were discussed , examined for flaws , discarded . The situation appeared more hopeless every minute . The patch of sunlight on the floor , near the doorway , commenced to assume diagonal lines . The shadows in the street lengthened . Somewhere near the corrals a horse neighed shrilly and a dog started barking . While the three talked , the sun dropped below the low hills far to the west of Santa Lozana . An evening breeze stirred the air , bringing a chill touch from the coast lands . Tony shrugged hopeless shoulders and fell silent . Dilliard 's mind felt tired , worn . Teresa looked from man to man , before speaking a trifle timidly : " You can think of nothing ? " Dilliard slowly shook his head . " Nothing that might work with any degree of certainty , Teresa . " " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The buen Dios will not allow us to fail . " " Look you ? " again Teresa hesitated before  | continuing , " it may be I have thought of a plan that might succeed . " Tony looked hopeful , " My Teresa , she is ver ' smart . I think we should give the heed " By all means , " from Branch . " Let 's hear it . " Teresa commenced to speak , at first , slowly , then as she gathered courage , the words came swifter and swifter , as though she , herself , were already convinced her plan was the sure way to success in rescuing Castameto 's daughter . In silence , Dilliard and Tony heard her through to the end . As the girl talked , the frown lifted from Dilliard 's features . He swore softly under his breath . Tony commenced to look anxious , but he kept his mouth closed . Finally the girl fell silent . There was an odd , triumphant light in Dilliard 's eyes now . " By gosh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped suddenly , his face fell , he shook his head in abrupt decision . " Nope , nothing doing . I ca n't let you run that sort of risk . " " The Se  --  or Branch is right , Teresa mia , " from Tony . " Your idea is a courageous one , but " Antonio ! Silencio ! Be quiet ! It is for us to decide the best way  --  not the safest . Besides shrugging her slim , brown shoulders , " where is the risk ? " Teresa 's white teeth flashed an encouraging smile . " Of danger , there will be none , " she insisted . " Antonio could follow behind , and see all that takes place . It is you , Se  --  or Branch , who will have the most danger  | " I 'm not worrying about my part , " Dilliard said anxiously . " It 's you and Tony  --  you and Tony will have to decide . " Teresa turned on Tony . The two talked excitedly for several moments , crackling Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word or two . Tony 's protestations became more and more feeble as the girl 's voice became stronger . Finally , Tony turned to Dilliard , shrugging his shoulders , throwing his arms wide in a gesture of surrender . " I geeve up ! Se  --  or Branch , you see before you the example of the so beautiful woman making the defeat to the inteligencia of the male animal of the breed . Of the certain we shall all be kill ' " Tony , hush ! " from Teresa . She turned to Dilliard . " It is settled then ? " Dilliard nodded slowly . " It 's all right with me , if Tony is satisfied . " " I am satisfy ' , " Tony conceded . Teresa rose to light a candle placed in a bottle . It was dark outside now . " Just a minute , Teresa , " Dilliard said . " Do n't light up yet . Maybe it will be better if nobody looks in here and sees me talkin ' to you two . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to-morrow ? " Teresa nodded . " Perhaps it is better to leave the room dark . But for the neighbors , have no fear . They know you to be our friend . Tomorrow morning ,  | not one of them will be about to see anything . Should any of the Americanos come asking questions , our neighbors will have seen nothing . That part , Tony and I shall take care of , after you depart . But a little light we must have . " The girl threw some mesquite knots on the embers in the fireplace . Dancing flames flickered against the white walls . Teresa regained her chair . The three talked earnestly for some time . Teresa brought out some cold beef and brewed coffee at the fireplace . An hour passed . Finally , Dilliard rose to his feet . " Well , it 's all settled then . " His tone held grim decision . " My horse is in the stable , at the rear of the hotel . You 'll have another horse all ready , eh , Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or Branch . All shall be in readiness . " Dilliard turned to the girl , putting on his hat and saying , " Teresa , I wo n't be forgetting this . You 're white  --  white all through . " " It is nothing , Se  --  or Branch . For my Antonio , you have already done much more . " " That 's open to argument , " Branch told her , " but we wo n't talk about it right now . " He turned back to Tony . Gold coins clinked between them . " I 'll pro'bly need another six-shooter . Buy yourself a gun too . No , you wo n't be able to get a ca'tridge gun , like I 'm totin ' , in Santa Lozana , but I reckon I have n't forgotten how to handle a cap-and-ball . I have n't any too many ca'tridges left , anyhow . I 'd hate to run short of loads . "  | " Tomorrow morning , then , " Tony 's voice came through the flickering lights in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " Adi  --  s . " " Adi  --  s , " Tony answered . Teresa 's soft voice came from just over Tony 's shoulder , " Vaya con Dios . " Dilliard returned slowly to the plaza . A few Mexicans still held down the benches , huddled in their serapes . Rectangles of light glowed from the adobe buildings surrounding the square , and scattered about the plaza , beneath flaming torches , chili and tamale vendors dispensed their wares to highsombreroed Mexicans . Smoke and a pungent odor of burning wood floated on the chill night air . Voices in various tongues drifted softly through the gloom to be broken now and then by the raucous tones of boisterous Americanos . Dilliard slowly circled the plaza , lost in thought . Prompted by some sudden impulse , he directed his steps toward the Cantina of the Golden Cock and stepped inside . Loud voices assailed his ears . The small barroom was packed with the scum of Santa Lozana . The odor of stale liquor , tobacco and unwashed bodies , made Dilliard 's nostrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscuring the low ceiling . The floor was thick with cigar and cigarette butts and dust . The place was dimly lighted with three kerosene oil lamps suspended on rusty brackets about the walls . In one corner a  | Mexican plucked listlessly at a guitar , his notes being drowned in the din made by the cantina 's customers . Opposite the bar , at a table , a group of Mexicans waxed noisy over their dicing . At a second table five Americanos of hang-dog aspect quarrelled , in whining tones , regarding the merits of various poker hands . The bar was lined with men . Near the front door , Dilliard spied the two men known as Bisbee and Corill . Bisbee was bulky-shouldered , the lower half of his face covered with matted red whiskers . Corill was slim , swarthy , with beady , shifting eyes . Both wore boots , sombreros and the rough clothing customary to the country . Dilliard noted the cap-andball six-shooters swung at their belts , and wondered , idly , just how proficient the two were in the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the loud , swaggering manner of Wirt Bisbee , Clem Corill was the more dangerous man of the two , the one to whom , on the morrow , if worst came to worst , should be devoted the closest attention . The pair were deep in conversation with a stranger who stood between them at the bar . Dilliard slowed his pace to look the stranger over . He heard Bisbee call him " Mister Scabbard , " and decided this must be the Drake Scabbard mentioned by Tony as being the boss of a town named El Vaca . Scabbard was clothed in the style of the day affected by the more well-to-do Californians  --  a long , square-cut coat , tightly fitting trousers that  | narrowed at the ankles of his boots , high-cut vest and the whitest of linen . Dilliard put his age at somewhere between thirty-five and forty . On one of Scabbard 's hands , holding a long , slim , black cigar , gleamed a diamond ring . Dilliard pushed up to the bar , next to Corill . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . Dilliard tasted the fiery rotgut that served as whisky , set his glass down unfinished . No one paid him any attention . A few vagrant words from Scabbard caught Dilliard 's ears , then Bisbee 's reply . " I tell you , Mister Scabbard , there wo n't be any slip-up . You just leave matters to me and Clem . . . . What ? . . . " Then a short laugh , " Now , do n't you worry about what happened to them two that met her . We already took care of them , tonight , ' bout half an hour before you got here . Shucks , no ! You need n't to have made that long ride . Just you trust us .... " Scabbard interrupted in sharp tones . Bisbee lowered his voice . Corill glanced cautiously around , started to turn back , and his gaze fell on Dilliard standing unconcernedly at his shoulder . Abruptly , Corill left the bar and passed behind Scabbard 's back to say something to Bisbee . Dilliard heard Bisbee rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scabbard for several moments , their voices too low to carry to Dilliard 's ears . Then they departed abruptly with quick goodbyes  | to Drake Scabbard , leaving Scabbard at the bar a scant couple of feet from Dilliard , who was , apparently , lost in his own abstractions and unaware of anyone around him . Dilliard heard Corill and Bisbee at the doorway . Their steps died away . A customer started to step in between Dilliard and Scabbard . Scabbard elbowed the man out of the way and closed the distance between himself and Dilliard . " Stranger in Santa Lozana , are n't you ? " Dilliard looked up to find Scabbard surveying him with cool , appraising eyes , eyes that to Dilliard did n't seem quite natural . They were pale blue , hard , glassy in the feeble light cast by the lamp behind the bar . Dilliard nodded . " I reckon . " " I thought you were . I had n't seen you in town before . " Dilliard asked , " You live in Santa Lozana ? " Scabbard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormally pale , the skin stretched tightly over the high cheek-bones . Beneath his highly-arched nose , a thin black mustache drooped below either corner of a thin-lipped mouth . " No , " Scabbard was saying , " but I come to Santa Lozana quite frequently . I make my home in El Vaca  --  southeast of here , a half day 's ride  --  if you push turd . . . . Have a drink ? " Dilliard refused , gesturing to the nearly-full glass standing on the bar before him .  | Scabbard laughed softly . " I do n't blame you . This dive is pretty low . The liquor is poor . It just happened that I had to come in here tonight , looking for a couple of men who work for me on occasion . You probably heard me talking to them . " " Ca n't say I paid any particular attention , " Dilliard said easily . He was n't sure , but he thought a wave of relief flitted across Scabbard 's white features at the reply . Scabbard said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps sheep as well . I 'm not certain it will go through , but I refuse to stay in Santa Lozana until it does . I 'd rather make the ride again than stay at that measly hotel . " " I find it tol'able , " Dilliard said . " You might . " There was a faint sneer in Scabbard 's tones . " Cow man , are n't you ? " " When I work at it . " " Bring a herd through to California ? " " Not this time , " Dilliard replied . " I delivered a herd at San Diego three years ago , then went back . At present cattle prices in this country , there is n't much profit in trailing a herd here . By the time you figure certain natural losses on the trail , then fork over to the soldiers at Yuma four-bits each for wagons and ten cents a head for cows to rope-ferry you across the Colorado  --  well , like I say , the way stock prices are at present , it do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could swim your cows across the river . "  | Dilliard laughed . " Yes , if the river was n't high . I swam some across , and lost them . After that , I paid my ten cents a head , like any sensible man would do . " " I suppose , " Scabbard nodded . " What part of the country you hail from ? " " Texas . " " What brings you to California this time ? " Dilliard stiffened a little , then said easily , " I 'm just ramblin ' around . " " Do you expect to stay ? " " I have n't made up my mind . " " Like California ? " Scabbard persisted . Dilliard shrugged . " What have you got against us ? " Dilliard smiled , faced Scabbard squarely . " I ai n't so sure I like the people . " Scabbard nodded . " Yes , the country is overrun with greasers . " " I was n't referrin ' to greasers . It 's what you call the Americanos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere you go , it 's the same . They 're never satisfied until they 've turned you inside out . Where do you come from ? What are you doing here ? How much money have you got ? What 's your business ? Back home , folks take you at face value , and mind their own business . " Scabbard 's white features flushed faintly . Dilliard 's thrust had penetrated in no uncertain manner . Scabbard forced a short laugh . " You 've got to  | admit I did n't inquire as to the state of your finances , " he pointed out . " Grant me that much anyway . . . . But California 's a great country  --  cattle , sheep , land . Too many greasers , of course , but we 'll run them out in time . " " I suppose so , " Dilliard said shortly . " Look here , there 's no use our quarrelling about something that does n't matter . I 'd like to call you friend . I 'm Drake Scabbard . Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stuck out one hand , but Dilliard , engrossed in rolling a cigarette , affected not to see it . " Name 's Dilliard , " Branch said noncommittally . Scabbard drew deeply on his black cigar , held it for Dilliard to get a light , then said , " Dilliard , eh ? You must be the man I heard about . " " Hope it was somethin ' good ? " Dilliard 's eyes were steady on Scabbard 's . " We-ell , " cautiously , " that depends on how you look at it . " " What did you hear ? " " About that little ruckus you staged , last evening , in that cantina across the plaza . They tell me you shot up some white men in taking the part of a greaser " Who told you ? " " Why , I just do n't know . I guess it might have been those men I was talking to when you came in here . "  | " I reckon they spoke the truth . I sort of hated to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're too sensitive , " Scabbard laughed . " The sooner the greasers learn that this country was intended for white men , the better it will be all around . " " Y'know , " Dilliard drawled , " I always figured the Spanish were white . " " Depends how you look at it . Not the Mexi-cans " " I figure they 're Americans if they were born here . " Scabbard commenced an impatient exclamation , checked himself , and ordered two drinks from the bartender . Men talked noisily all around Dilliard and his companion . The drinks were set out . Dilliard made no move to accept his glass . Scabbard downed his liquor quickly , made a wry face . Drawing a white linen handkerchief from his pocket he wiped his thin lips , saying , " Well , if you wo n't drink , I wo n't hold it against you . Do n't blame you in fact . It 's poor stuff . Come to El Vaca and I promise a different brand of mouthwash . But I do want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't resent . " " Hop to it , " Dilliard invited . " Look here , Dilliard , you 're new to this country . California is n't Texas . Conditions , customs , are vastly different . But it 's just this . I hate to see you starting off on the wrong foot . You ca n't buck white  | men with Mexicans , and get away with it . You 'll be run out . " Then Scabbard added , " If not killed . " Dilliard laughed easily . " Yeah , I saw it tried , once  --  last night . " " You were lucky . Next time you may not come off so well . If you stay , you 'll have to conform . It 's a rich country , as I said . A man can follow any line  --  cattle , sheep , minerals , land , farming . I 'm interested in all of ' em . I 'm getting rich . You could , too . You look brainy " " Thanks , " ironically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I 'd do the same for any white man I took a liking to . You know cattle . I understand you handle your gun well . I can use you . " " For my cattle  --  or gun  --  knowledge ? " Dilliard asked quietly . " Maybe both . Look here , I 'll be frank with you . The greasers must go . They 're dirty , they 'll steal you blind , they 're lazy ? " " No American push and go , I suppose . " Scabbard missed the sarcasm . " You 've hit it ! " he exclaimed . " Now , you come to El Vaca . I 'll give you a job ? " " I might get to El Vaca one of these days , " Dilliard said , " but I would n't promise to take a job with you . " " I 'd put you in the way of getting rich . I can use a man of your ability . But you 've got to give up  | this idea that a greaser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " Dilliard 's eyes narrowed dangerously . Scabbard hesitated , then , bluntly , " That 's the long and short of it , Dilliard . You 'll have to come to your senses , if you stay in this country . " Dilliard laughed scornfully . " Scabbard , no man yet has dictated how I 'll think or how I wo n't think . I 'm too old now to change my habits , and even if I was n't  --  you 're not the man to give me orders . Get that just as straight as you know how . " Crimson spots of angry color appeared on Scabbard 's high cheek-bones . He swallowed heavily , but managed to hold his voice nearly normal : " I see I 've made a mistake . I withdraw my offer . " Now his voice was low , venomous : " I ca n't advise you to come to El Vaca . In fact , I 'd advise you to stay just as far away from my town as the devil will let you . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats , " Dilliard said grimly . " Take that as you like . I 'm telling you . You 're not due to last long in this country , Dilliard . You 'd Netter get out . " Dilliard smiled contemptuously . What he said next he had a certain purpose in saying , " Scabbard , I 'm planning to leave tomorrow , but you and your kind are n't scaring me out . I ai n't never yet been snake. - shy . But you mark my words , it 's you and men  | like you that are due to get out  --  and aces to tens you 'll go out feet first ! " Cold flames of rage glittered in Scabbard 's eyes . He made a quick motion toward his right coat pocket , then checked the movement . Dilliard laughed coolly . " Derringer , eh ? " Scabbard held his right hand well wide of his pocket and commenced to edge away from the bar . His words came through grated teeth , " Dilliard , it 's a good thing you 're leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'd settle right now , except that I 've got to start back to El Vaca tonight . If you ever cross my path again , watch yourself . You 'll ? " Dilliard said , " Oh , hell ! " and pushed contemptuously past Scabbard . At the doorway of the cantina he paused , glanced back over one shoulder . Scabbard stood as before , white features contorted with angry passion . Dilliard laughed and stepped outside . Two doors away , Dilliard stopped and sat down on an unoccupied bench . Two minutes later , he saw Scabbard leave the cantina , mount a waiting horse that stood in front of the building , and take a southeasterly course across the plaza , riding hard , to disappear in one of the streets that led from the square . " So much for Scabbard , " Dilliard laughed softly . " So he 's got to get started for El Vaca tonight . He might have spoken the truth at that . Scabbard  | would n't want to be around here tomorrow morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder where those two snakes disappeared to . " The plaza was nearly deserted now . Dilliard got to his feet , started across to see to his horse in the shelter back of the hotel , before turning in . Halfway across the square , he halted and glanced toward a certain window in the building . The shutters were closed but a thin sliver of yellow light penetrated between the boards . The words of his Mexican friends recurred to Dilliard now ; he thought , " A pale yellow rose of Monterey ; a silver flame in the dusk . ' Castameto 's daughter is all of that . I reckon the English language ca n't compare with Spanish when it comes to expressing a man 's feelings . " A moment later he continued on the way , murmuring , " Well , tomorrow tells the tale . " He glanced at the sky and found it overcast with dark clouds . There was something chill , ominous , in the breeze that swept in from the far-off ' seacoast.  | Rain had come during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seep deeply into the sun-baked earth , like the warm glow of old wine spreading through a man 's body ; the sort of rain that brings life to the Southern California hills and swells to the bursting point the myriad buds of lupine and orange poppy . With the coming of dawn the rain had ceased , though the filigreed branches of the red-berried pepper tree in the plaza were still heavy with silvery drops . Above the Santa Ana Mountains , to the east of Santa Lozana , the cloudless sky was touched with amethyst , the flush spreading swiftly like a bit of water color from an artist 's brush touching an already dampened square of paper . The horizon brightened as broad streaks of orange-crimson lifted above the mountain peaks ; soon the sky was a-glow with bright , warm tints , giving promise of the heat to come . The first rays of the sun : slipped quickly down into Santa Lozana , picking out green highlights on a huge , spear-pointed agave at one corner of the plaza and throwing into bold relief the puddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled in graceful spirals from the chimney openings  | of adobe houses ; the fragrance of flaming mesquite was in the air . Life was moving about the square now . A Mexican appeared in his doorway , glanced at the sky , scratched his thick thatch of blue-black hair , yawned and turned back , drawn by the aroma of hot coffee . Other figures , serape-shouldered , moved out into the footpath . A hen with a brood of small chickens picked futilely at the clinging ' dobe mud , until she and her tiny charges were frightened into a panicky rout by the mischievous whoopings of a nearlynaked Mexican youngster . Before the entrance of the Santa Lozana Hotel waited an open carriage with two horses . A small crowd had gathered ; some sort of altercation was taking place . The Se  --  orita Castameto , heavily veiled and clothed in flowing , voluminous skirts of some soft dark material , was demanding details relative to the whereabouts of the two men who had driven the carriage to the hotel the previous day . The pair at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not her men , not her father 's employees . Why were they not on hand to attend their duties ? The Se  --  orita Castameto swore they should be punished for their absence . The two breeds on the driver 's seat sat in stolid silence , staring straight ahead , leaving all explanatory details to a pair of Americano riders , one of  | whom wore a matted red beard ; his companion was slim and dark and had shifty eyes . The posadero - of the hotel turned to the Se  --  orita Castameto , still standing in the doorway of the building  --  why did she hesitate ? The baggage was already piled on the front seat of the carriage . What difference who drove the vehicle , or who accompanied it ? The hotel man appeared nervous , while he strove to assure the girl that the Se  --  ors Bisbee and Corill were most reliable men . The se  --  orita ignored the innkeeper 's words and again demanded some information about her own men . With ill-concealed impatience , Clem Corill reined his pony away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuller explanation : the regular drivers had imbibed too freely of tequila the previous night and , deciding to leave the employment of the Rancho Sicamoro rather than rise so early in the morning , had turned the job over to himself and Wirt Bisbee . It was to be the duty of the two Americanos to see that the se  --  orita arrived safely , by nightfall , in her father 's arms . They had harnessed the horses to the carriage and procured these two men to drive it ; it would . be a pleasure for Corill and Bisbee to ride at the side of the vehicle and act as bodyguards . But now Corill assumed an aggrieved manner : he was n't at all sure , in light of the se  --  orita 's protestations and objections , that he and his pardner wanted the job . Where so much doubt existed , pay  | for the work might not be forthcoming . The se  --  orita had better make up her mind . The girl 's every movement betrayed indecision . She eyed Corill and Bisbee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver 's seat . Her words were short , brief , vitriolic . The hotelkeeper 's voice rose in argument . The se  --  orita spoke quick replies in imperious Spanish . The man appeared to dwindle before the heat of her manner . He fell silent , looking to Bisbee and Corill to do any further persuading that might be necessary . By this time the knot of curious about the carriage had been augmented , the sounds of the altercation drawing the idle ones from all directions . Impatiently , the girl abruptly decided to get into the carriage . Between the hotel entrance and the vehicle was a wide pool of rainwater . Immediately humble and anxious to please , the hotelkeeper stepped around the corner of the hotel , bawling loud orders . After five minutes had passed , two Mexicans appeared from the rear of the building , bearing planks to bridge the puddle . On the same side of the square , at the corner where it opened into a side street , Branch Dilliard watched the scene from the back of his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the men with the planks accomplish their purpose . " Dammit ! " Dilliard muttered under his breath . " She 's decided to go with those cutthroats , after all .  | I was hopin ' she 'd refuse . " An afterthought crept in . " Or was I ? " Before dawn he had seen Tony and Teresa , gone over their plans a final time . No one noticed Dilliard quietly sitting in his saddle . Other horsemen were moving about the plaza by this time . All eyes were fastened on the group before the hotel . The sun was climbing fast , well clear of the mountains now . Dilliard saw the two hotel servants appear with the planks . Some time was lost in the placing of the impromptu bridge . One end of a plank fell , striking the puddle ; muddy water spotted the side of the carriage . Suddenly , the Mexicans burst into loud lament ; the planks were not long enough to reach across the pool . A third length of board would have to be procured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion that followed , speaking swift , impatient Spanish , giving suggestions , pointing out that no further planks were necessary . After a few moments her ideas were placed into execution . The planks were again lifted , placed parallel to the wall of the hotel . Now , by utilizing the boards for her movements , the girl could reach a comparatively dry stretch of earth and , passing around the rear of the vehicle , enter the conveyance from the outer side . The crowd fell back so as not to impede her progress . The girl passed around the back of the carriage .  | Dilliard got into action . Touching spurs to his pony , lie moved forward at a swift trot , then gained speed . A pair of Indians stood near the step of the carriage . The girl ordered them away . They moved slowly , reluctantly . The girl brushed past , started to place one foot on the step . A wild , Texas yell left Branch Dilliard 's throat as he charged straight for the onlookers clustered near the carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage , Corill and Bisbee turned in their saddles , saw Dilliard . It did n't occur to them that the Texas cowman was taking part in their plans . They backed their ponies , to allow Dilhard free passage . Corill said , " Bet a plugged peso he 's drunk . " " Sure gets started early , " Bisbee laughed . Dilliard was closing in now . Suddenly he swerved , directing the pony still closer to the carriage . The se  --  orita had hesitated at his wild yell and turned to watch . Coolly , she judged the intervening yards between herself and Branch Dilliard 's thundering horse , figured he would just clear her in passing . Quickly she put one foot in the carriage , drew the other to the step . Dilliard nodded approval of the girl 's movement , even as he closed in . He caught a brief glimpse of startled faces . Excited cries rang ' round the plaza : " The Americano is drunk ! " " The gringo from Texas has gone demente ! " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | The latter , Se  --  orita Castameto was quick to admit as she saw Dilliard rise in his stirrups . A startled cry welled in her throat : the crazy rider would crash into the carriage . The girl shrank back , bracing herself against the collision . Of what happened next , she was never quite clear in her mind . There came a wild drumming of swift hoofs in her ears , then she felt Dilliard 's right arm sweep around her waist , felt herself lifted bodily in the air . Wind rushed into her face As Dilliard drew the girl up before him , on the saddle . His pony had n't even broken stride in the mad rush . Then they were away , leaving behind a cursing Corill , a dumbfounded Bisbee and a large number of startled natives . Corill acted first , hand sweeping down to his six-shooter . Bisbee was quick to follow suit . The vicious pin-n-nq of a leaden slug whined past Dilliard 's right ear as his horse dashed across the square . Two more reports sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left arm . His right reached to his gun-butt . Knee-guiding his pony , he half-turned in the saddle and released three swift shots . He heard a horse scream , caught the thud of its splashing as it went down in the mud . The plaza was a torrent of voices now . Other shots flew high over Dilliard 's head , as Corill urged various bystanders to take a hand in stopping the Texan . A  | fat man wearing a deputy-sheriff 's badge waddled out of a cantina , jerking his gun and firing widly . Dilliard did n't shoot again ; he was moving too fast for accurate marksmanship . Straight for the opposite corner of the plaza he rode . Passing the giant , spear-pointed century plant , he noted a hole appear as though by magic in one of the broad green leaves . Almost instantly the report reached his ears . " Gettin ' too close for comfort , " he chuckled grimly , driving in his spurs . The girl 's veil had blown to one side . Dilliard met her eyes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the scorn that burned into him . " I 'll tell it all  --  later , " Dilliard protested . " No time for explanations now . There 's nothing for you to be afraid of " " Gringo pig ! " the girl flashed out . Dilliard snapped , " Have it your own way . No time for arguing now . " He swung the pony swiftly to one side as they left the plaza and darted down a side street . The girl 's form was warm in his arms , as he moved with the motion of the speeding horse . Back of them an excited hue and cry rose on the air . The se  --  orita was struggling to get free now . Dilliard clutched her tighter than ever , fighting to pinion her arms . One hand wrenched loose from his grasp . Dilliard felt raw streaks of fire rip down his right cheek , noticed the fingernails of the girl 's left hand were tinged with crimson .  | This , in its way , was good . Dilliard could understand rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He grinned through the blood coursing four wide channels along his right jaw , seized and gripped tightly the belligerent hand . " I 'll bet you 're a wildcat for fightin ' , " he muttered , rocking to the motion of the horse . Something else came back to him in that mad rush through narrow streets , twisting , turning , doubling back to elude the pursuit he was certain was under way , something else that touched his grim mouth with humor . . . a silver flame in the dusk . . . . " Or silver daggers in hot sunlight , " Dilliard amended silently . The girl had ceased struggling now . From back on the plaza came faint yells calling confused advice . Horses were being procured and saddled to follow the first batch of pursuers . Dilliard glanced at the girl in his arms , voiced a silent prayer that his plan might be successfully carried through . A moment later , turning into an empty street , the Texan spotted an anxious Tony awaiting his arrival . Dilliard brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast to rear haunches , then stepped down from the saddle , holding the girl . Tony forced a white smile . " I 'm hear shooting ? and men like they have gone loco . I 'm guess you are lucky , like the four clovers  --  not " He glanced  | at the se  --  orita , then quickly averted his gaze , reluctant to meet the girl 's scornful eyes . Dilliard panted , " So far we 've been lucky  --  yes . Get in that saddle , Tony . Let that horse have his head and he 'll do things for you . Give those coyotes a run they wo n't forget . " Tony nodded , left hand clutching the bridle . Dilliard turned swiftly to the girl , saying in Spanish , " Only a little farther to go now . Will you walk , or must I carry you ? There 's no time to argue the question . Make up your mind  --  quick ! " The reply came in chilling accents from behind the veil and in English  --  almost Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch me again ! I 'll walk . " The street was momentarily deserted , only the two men , the girl and the horse being in sight between the crooked double row of adobe dwellings which appeared to be lifeless . Tony was in the saddle now , taking Dilliard 's place . He spoke to the pony , got under way like a shot from a gun , turned at the first corner . Dilliard looked after him but a moment . " Give ' em a run they wo n't forget , Tony , " he repeated softly . He caught a fleeting glimpse of the rider as ' Pony directed the horse diagonally into an alley to drop from view . Then Dilliard turned back to the girl . " This wily , " he directed , indicating a passageway between two houses . The way was choked with tall brush . Dilliard held the branches aside , impelled the girl  | before him , then followed . The brush closed behind them . Dilliard halted , pulled the girl down in the shelter of the screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded along the narrow street . A score of men flashed past , yelling madly . Bisbee and Corill led the way , Bisbee mounted on a different horse than the one he 'd had in the plaza . Peering out , Dilliard saw the pursuers take a different route than that followed by Tony . He chuckled with satisfaction . Dilliard had been holding one hand over the se  --  orita 's mouth . Now he felt it torn savagely away . He was n't looking at the girl but he felt her concentrated hate boring into him . " Sorry you feel thataway , " the Texan muttered humbly . Then , shortly , " C'm on , we have n't any time to waste . " They negotiated the passage between the houses , emerged near the corrals in the Calle de los Caballeros . From this point it was only a few steps further to the house of Tony and Teresa . Teresa was standing in , the doorway , anxious-eyed , when Dilliard and the girl arrived . There was no other sign of humanity along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It hav ' work , eh , Se  --  or Branch ? ? " she commenced . " Part of it , anyway . " Dilliard was breathing heavily . He glanced at the se  --  orita , decided that  | this was no time for argument . " Inside , " he ordered briefly , jerking his head toward the doorway . Teresa stood back . The Se  --  orita Castameto hesitated , then entered , her head held high . The Texan was right on her heels , closing the door as he moved in . Teresa was silent . Now came the difficult part of the plan . The se  --  orita 's head raised defiantly as she faced the man and Mexican girl . Dilliard hesitated , his mind fumbling for a beginning . Abruptly , he discarded his groping for proper phrasing and came to the matter at hand . " You 'll change clothes with this girl , " he ordered . That precipitated a storm of protest . The Texan was n't surprised at the se  --  orita 's refusal ; that was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden torrent of fiery Spanish that greeted his proposal .. Dilliard felt the hot blood creeping up his features . Teresa shrank back , her own round face mantled with a blush of shame . " It is not so , Se  --  orita Castameto , " Teresa commenced . " When you understand you will ? " Dilliard cut in , speaking impatiently , " We have n't time for explanations , Teresa . We 're wasting precious moments now . This girl will just have to take our word for things ? " Abruptly , he broke off , turned to the se  --  orita : " It 's necessary that you change clothes with Teresa . You wo n't be hurt . We 're doing this to help you . Please hurry ? "  | " No ! I refuse , gringo pig ! " Teresa 's pleadings were ignored . Dilliard swore under his breath . Precious minutes were fleeting past . The se  --  orita remained adamant , defiant . Her refusals assumed a knife-like edge that cut and jeered at Dilliard 's orders . Abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed before : " All right , se  --  orita , you 've had your chance . We ca n't waste more time . You 'll either do as I say , or I 'll take a hand and make you do it , " he said brutally . " It 's up to you . Make up your mind without further nonsense  --  and make it up plenty pronto ! "  | A tense silence suddenly descended on the room as the Texan snapped his words . Castameto 's daughter halted the fiery tirade tumbling from her lips and searched Dilliard 's face . She saw tiny drops of perspiration dotting his forehead , but there was n't a trace of pity , surrender , in his hard features . A quick glance at Teresa told the se  --  orita she could expect no aid from that direction . No doubt about it , this Americano savage was n't to be trifled with . It might be best to obey him . Briefly , the se  --  orita nodded agreement with the instructions . A long sigh of relief blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gods that his bluff had worked . " You 'll do it  --  without further trouble ? " he insisted . " I 'll do it . " The se  --  orita motioned to the doorway . " Get out ! " coldly . Dilliard hesitated , gestured toward Teresa . " You promise not to make trouble for this Mexican girl , after I step out ? " " I shall do as you say , " haughtily . " Just keep your dirty hands from me . When my father receives word of this outrage ? " " When your father hears of this outrage , " the Texan half-snarled , " he ought to get down on his  | knees and thank Teresa for the risk she is running . So far , you 've acted the part of a little fool . Now try to help us by hurrying . " Dilliard swung around , started for the door . Teresa suddenly found a new problem , " Wait ! Se  --  or Dilliard , what of the zapatos ? " Impatiently , the Texan paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose shoes ? " " It is like this , Se  --  or Dilliard , " Teresa explained . " Of the shoes I have none . The se  --  orita  --  " " The se  --  orita , " Dilliard said shortly , " will just have to go barefooted , Teresa , as you do . And you 'll just have to make her shoes fit you . Let 's lose no more time . Hurry ! " He opened the door , stepped outside , closed it at his back . Sounds of movements came from inside , then voices . Teresa was doing her utmost to explain the situation , but a sharp word from the se  --  orita , who refused to believe the Mexican girl 's words , sent Teresa into silence . From certain things that he heard , the Texan knew the two women were exchanging clothes without any further objections from Castameto 's daughter . " Well , she quit kickin ' up a fuss about that , anyway , " Dilliard muttered thankfully . " Pro'bly got an idea she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight any more . Still , I got to admit she did n't look scared any . Just plain mad ! " The Texan moved around to the back of the house where a saddled horse stood ready beneath a  | thatched ramada . Standing in the shade of the horse shelter , Dilliard waited in silence , smoking a cigarett ? , which was n't half consumed when he heard the creak of saddle leather , and Tony reined his pony into view around the corner of the house , a few yards distant . Horse and man were breathing easily , indicating that Tony had n't been pushed too hard . Tony swung down from the saddle , in the shade of the ramada . " What of the se  --  orita ? " he asked . Ruefully , Dilliard passed one hand down his damp cheek with its four livid streaks reaching to the jawbone . " She put her brand on me . " " Almos ' the earmark , too  --  no ? " " She 's a wildcat for a fight  --  gentled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadly , commenced an old Spanish proverb , " Until the tigress has found her mate ? " Dilliard interrupted , " You sure you threw those hombres off your track ? " Tony nodded vigorously . " There is no doubt of that . Half a mile to the northeas ' of Santa Lozana , I dropped down , from sight , into the Arroyo Chico , keeping well out of the mud from las ' night 's rain . Those hombres hav ' been follow the sounds of my horse . They do n't guess where I go , quick like the lightning , when the horse sounds is stop so quick . " " Did they cross the arroyo ? " Dilliard asked quickly .  | " Farther down from where I am hide on the side of the ravine , in the thick , high brush . They crossed at a poin ' where the mounts would not get flounder ' in the mud . From behin ' a mesquite bush , I 'm watch an ' hear the two Americanos try for decide where I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolve in their heads . It was all ver ' fonny . Finally , they give up , turn back . I 'm think by now they have return to the plaza ? " " Tony , if they 'd had sense enough to look for your horse 's tracks , instead of listening for sounds , it might not have been so funny . " " What you say is true , " Tony remarked sagely , " but I 'm not fear to outwit soch imbeciles " A sudden call from Teresa interrupted the words . Tony and Dilliard returned to the front of the house , Dilliard leading his horse . Teresa stood in the doorway , clothed in the senorita 's garments which fit her snugly , but well enough for the occasion . Her words came from behind the veil : " I 'm ready , Se  --  or Dilliard . " A wave of admiration for the Mexican girl 's cool nerve welled up in Branch 's throat . It was fortunate the two women were so nearly the same height . Dilliard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in white cotton standing within the dim shadowed interior of the house . The Texan caught his breath . Again came that choking sensation in his throat . Teresa 's crude garments seemed  | to enhance rather than diminish the se  --  orita 's blond beauty . Her feet were bare , the cotton skirt reaching but a little below the white knees . The cornsilk hair was gathered tightly about the small , defiantly set head . Teresa had added a blue and gray striped serape to the costume , which the girl clutched with one hand . Dilliard 's gaze met the dark eyes of Castameto 's daughter . Her eyes met his coldly ; no fear there , no surrender ; nothing but a slow , steady burning of haughty contempt . For this , Dilliard was thankful . At that moment , had Castameto 's daughter shown one sign of weakness , voiced one word of entreaty , the Texan could n't have refused her anything she might have asked . And all the driving force at his command was necessary for the movements now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of fleeting , precious moments . Dilliard , jerking his eyes reluctantly away from the slim white form , turned to Tony , " You 've ar-ranged for a third horse on which to follow ? " " About that there is no need of hurry . I still have money . All that can be arranged after your departure . " Tony 's eyes swept along the deserted street . " You notice those neighbors about which you were so much concerned  --  there is no sign of them . " Dilliard nodded . " You handled it fine , Tony  --  all of it  --  you and Teresa . " The Texan 's bronzed features were tense with the strain of the situationHe  | put his left foot into the stirrup , swung up to settle into his saddle . Tony and Teresa were deep in conversation , gathering last clinging moments . Tony 's voice broke a trifle . Finally he lifted Teresa up to the saddle . Branch held the girl before him . His voice was a bit hoarse when he said , " Teresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's up to you . Feelin ' skeery ? " " What is theese skeery ? " Teresa laughed nervously . " Eef you mean am I frighten ' ? pouf ! of what is there to be frighten ' ? " The Texan was staring straight ahead . " Maybe we 'll find out , " he stated grimly . Then over one shoulder , " Tony , I 'm countin ' on comin ' right back . " Further talk was n't necessary . Dilliard started the horse , moved quickly along the narrow street and turned toward the plaza . By this time , affairs in the plaza had quieted down considerably . The day was too hot to remain long in a state of excitement . The loungers had returned to their benches ; many of them were already half asleep . The carriage still waited before the hotel , the heads of the horses , as well as those of the two breeds on the driver 's seat , hanging low . No one had had any authority to say what should be done with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties within his establishment . At the opposite end of the square , Corill and Bisbee had dismounted in the shade of the pepper tree and stood leaning against their horses , deep in  | perplexed conversation , doubtless wondering what to do next . They did n't see the Texan 's horse enter the plaza with its double burden . Dilliard pushed his mount swiftly along , reached the carriage before the men on the driver 's seat were aware of his arrival . Hearing a slight noise , one of them turned to see the Texan depositing the veiled Teresa on the leather-upholstered back seat . His eyes widened in astonishment , a startled exclamation left his lips . His companion turned with unaccustomed swiftness . Abruptly , someone across the square raised a surprised yell . Dilliard laughed easily , explaining to the two on the driver 's seat : " The se  --  orita has not been harmed . It was all just a little gringo joke , amigos , to win a wager . I have won and I am satisfied . When you return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may now proceed to the Rancho Sicamoro . " Bowing deeply to the supposed se  --  orita in the carriage , Dilliard laughed a careless " Adi  --  s ! " and turned his pony away from the vehicle . By that time , Corill and Bisbee had mounted and come tearing across the plaza . In a moment they had drawn rein , one on either side of the Texan . Bisbee growled angrily , " Just a minute , Dilliard ! What 's yore hurry ? " " Did n't realize I was hurryin ' , " Dilliard replied quietly , slowly backing his horse from between the two . " I 've explained matters to your two boys drivin ' the carriage . I have n't hurt the lady . Had a  | bet with a fellew that I could do what I did ? shucks ! I 've won my bet and I 'm plumb satis-fied " I ai n't , " Corill snapped . His hand commenced to slide toward the gun at his belt . Bisbee quickly reined his horse to one side , placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't satisfied  --  not by a long shot , " Corill added . " That , " Dilliard said coldly , " is just too damn bad . We can take the matter up more thorough , any time you 've got a minute to spare . And , if you 've got that minute right now , why not jerk that iron you 're itchin ' for ' ? " Corill 's angry gaze locked with Dilliard 's . For the space of a quarter of a minute he held his own before the cold , challenging stare of the Texan . Then Corill cleared his throat , lowered his eyes . Slowly , his hand came away from his gun . Dilliard had made no move to draw ; that had n't been necessary with Corill . Something about the lean , bronzed Texan had shaken Corill 's nerve , something cold and hard and ruthless he 'd read in Dilliard 's slate-gray eyes . " Oh , hell , " he gulped tonelessly , and backed his horse a pace . Dilliard said flatly , " You showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , but just in case you were scoutin ' for a ruckus , I would n't object to a mite more fun  --  at your expense . It 's up to you . "  | Corill said , " Oh , hell , " again , without raising his gaze , and backed his horse another step . Dilliard laughed coolly , and , hoping to carry the business through on sheer bluff , touched fingers to the brim of his felt hat and made as though to turn his horse away . " Adi  --  s , Se  --  orita Castameto . May you have a pleasant journey " " Dammit , " Bisbee growled , " you ai n't gettin ' off that easy , Dilliard . Is he , Clem ? ? " " We got a job on , " Clem Corill snapped pettishly . " We 'll take care of Dilliard when we come back " " Silencio ! " Teresa spoke impatiently from her seat in the carriage . " Is it necessary that we wait and broil in this sun all day ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " And what do you wait for , fools ? Drive on ! Must I be forced to listen to quarreling gringo pigs , while you wait , idle , like bad beans in a cold pot ? Don Salvadore will take care of the Americano when word of this outrage reaches his ears . It is not your problem . Drive on , I tell you ! " Electrified into action , one of the men jerked on the reins . The other plied a vigorous whip . The startled horses leaped into swift movement . The carriage rolled off , leaving Dilliard still facing Corill and Bisbee . " There goes your valuable package , " Dilliard laughed softly . " Better get started before you 're left behind . "  | Corill was inclined to agree . " C'm on , Wirt , " he said sullenly . " We got important business . We 'll take care of this hombre later . " But Bisbee , not having faced Dilliard 's steely eyes as had his companion , wanted to argue the matter . He swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're skeered , but not me . This has got to be settled now . Dilliard shot my horse when he was busy pullin ' this joke of his . He 's cost me a fresh nag . He ai n't goin ' to  --  " " Look here , you two , " Dilliard 's voice abruptly turned chill and hard , " take my advice and get goin ' pronto ! If you 're lookin ' for trouble ? " That was as far as the Texan got with his speech . A vile curse rolled from Bisbee 's lips . There came a swift blur of action as he threw caution to the winds and reached for his gun . Dilliard had caught the swift motion toward gun-belt . His own weapon came out and up in one , smooth , eye-defying movement . The two weapons roared almost in unison . Bisbee 's bullet went high and wide as he swayed back in the saddle . His open mouth uttered a shrill , highpitched cry of pain before he toppled from his horse 's back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started to draw . " Hold it ! " Dilliard snapped . " I do n't reckon Bisbee 's dead , but I might not aim so careful with my next shot . I 've suggested twice that you vamos !  | I 'm through hintin ' now . Make yourself scarce . Quick ! " Yells sounded around the plaza . The little fat man with the deputy 's badge came running from a house . Corill cast one nervous glance at Bisbee , now in a sitting position in the mud , then nodded shortly to Dilliard : " You 've got the drop this time , Texas man , but we 'll meet again , and I 'll be remem-berin ' ? ? " You wo n't do any rememberin ' either , " Dilliard said grimly , " unless you turn that horse and make yourself scarce ? " " What 's going on here ? " It was the little fat man with the deputy-sheriff 's badge . Dilliard eyed the man coolly . The deputy had vacillating eyes of an indiscriminate color which peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very dirty shirt . Dilliard said , " I just had to shoot me a skunk . " " Now looky here , feller , " the deputy commenced . " You ca n't run rough-shod over Santa Lozana . You 've caused enough trouble ? " " Want to make anythin ' out of it ? " Dilliard said coldly . The deputy swallowed hard . He was n't craving trouble with this tall Texan . " I 'm the law here , " he blustered . " That 's fine . " Dilliard 's tones were crisp . He gestured toward the groaning Bisbee . " You better arrest that hombre for pulling on me- "  | " Did he pull first ? " the law-officer asked eagerly . " Hell , did n't you see him ? " Dilliard said impatiently . " Reckon I did at that , come to think of it . " " That 's a lie ? " Corill commenced . The fat deputy scowled , employed Dilliard 's words of a few minutes before , " Want to make anythin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar is , Corill , " Dilliard said steadily . " You know Bisbee went for his iron first . You 're lucky you did n't get what he got " Bisbee , " the deputy said pompously , " I 'll have to arrest you . Get up , you ai n't hurt much . " He tugged the white-faced Bisbee to his feet , and without waiting for further argument dragged the wounded man off across the plaza , followed by a jeering group of Mexicans . " And that 's that , " Dilliard said shortly , eyeing Corill . " Corill , your carriage has disappeared . You better hurry if you want to catch up to it . Or did you decide to stay ' ? " Corill muttered something unintelligible under his breath , and took the hint . Plunging in his spurs , he turned his pony and went racing off in pursuit of the carriage and the girl he supposed was old Castameto 's daughter . Dilliard glanced around the plaza . Peace had again settled over the town . Bisbee and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | Dilliard heaved a long sigh as he reined his pony toward the street that led to Tony 's house . " Anyway , it 's worked so far , " he said gratefully . " Now , if only nothin ' happens to Teresa " He stopped short on that thought , not caring to dwell on the various possibilities a discovery of the exchange might bring .  | Once , away from the square , Dilliard raced his horse back to Tony 's house . A saddled horse waited before the door . Tony stood in the doorway , his face ashen . It lighted with sudden relief as the Texan hove into view . Dilliard pulled to a halt , without dismounting . " Poder de Dios ! " Tony 's voice trembled as he dashed out and caught at Dilliard 's hand . " What has happened ? My Teresa . . . ? " " Teresa 's all right , Tony . She 's on her way , and they never suspected a thing " But I heard shots Dilliard nodded , related briefly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corill rode after the carriage , " he concluded . " Last I saw of Bisbee he was on his way to the hoosegow . " Tony scowled , " By nightfall he will be free again . That deputy-sheriff is of the no-good . " " Bisbee may get free , but he wo n't get around for a spell  --  not with a smashed shoulder . These ca'tridge guns pack a wicked punch . " Tony smiled broadly , " Then our scheme  --  eet hav ' work ? " " So far , " tersely . " Teresa 's what matters now . As soon as we leave , I want you to ride after that carriage , see that nothing happens to Teresa . "  | " S  --  s ? " " Remember , stick to that carriage like a leech . Do n't let Corill or the others learn you are following , but , until you see me again , do n't you lose sight of that carriage . " " Seguro , I stick to the leash on that carriage . " Dilliard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The se  --  orita ? " " Is inside of the house . I have explain ' that she is to make the ride with you . I have try ' to explain all of this mad business , but she refus ' to listen to truth . She tells me I am one lying peeg ' ? Me , Antonio Aguilar , the bes ' vaquero what evair rope on her father 's rancho ! I 'm do n't think I 'm like that . " " Tell her her horse is ready and I 'm waiting , " Dilliard said . Tony entered the house . A moment later , the girl emerged , her head held high , dark eyes full of hate for the gringo savage who had abducted her . She drew the serape over her head , held it close to her face . Tony tried to help her mount the horse at the side of Dilliard 's pony , but withered before the scornful glance she bent on him . Assistance had n't really been necessary ; in an instant she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilliard , repeating instructions he had furnished the previous evening : " . . . and follow the Arroyo Chico for the firs ' mile , " he finished . " After that it will be of the entirely safe to ride to higher ground . "  | His words died to silence as Dilliard led the se  --  orita 's horse past the corrals at the end of the Calle de los Caballeros . From this point the earth dipped abruptly , carrying the riders below the level of town . A little later , the two horses dropped into the Arroyo Chico  --  a narrow twisting ravine that carried them swiftly away from Santa Lozana . Occasionally the matted brush bordering the sides of the arroyo forced them to progress along the mud at the bottom , but , for the most part , the horses had good footing . In time , Dilliard felt it safe to move to higher , open country . The ponies scrambled up the sides of the arroyo , carrying their riders out to a long stretch of rolling hill-land . Half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low ridge . Santa Lozana was four miles way by this time . Only the roofs of the highest houses and the top of the red-berried pepper tree in the plaza showed above the gradually rolling terrain . " We 'll be able to make better time now , " Dilliard stated , endeavoring to make casual conversation . The girl just looked at him , did n't reply . Dilliard flushed and fell into silence . . . . All morning the Texan and the se  --  orita pushed steadily on , with no conversation between them , getting ever higher into the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains . Though not delayed as they had been  | in negotiating the bottom of Arroyo Chico , Dilliard was finding it difficult to make fast time . The se  --  orita rode side-saddle , Teresa 's short , cotton skirt gathered as closely as possible about her bare white ankles . Dilliard had tried , once more , to explain matters to the girl , but had been met with a rebuffing silence . Dilliard had again fallen silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer positive proof attesting the worth of his actions . The girl rode a few yards in advance , only turning her horse when Dilliard gave directions . Tony had mapped out the course the Texan was to follow ; Dilliard was quick to recognize certain landmarks the Mexican had indicated . The sun was high , now , throwing down hot waves . The se  --  orita retained the gray-and-blue serape over her head , but Dilliard was n't missing a certain painful redness of her bare feet . He drew a clean bandanna from his pocket , reined alongside the girl and dropped the bandanna over her ankles . If he had expected any expressions of gratitude for his actions , he was doomed to disappointment . The girl eyed him coldly , but kept and arranged the offering so it would do the greatest good . At noon the two riders dipped down a hillside in Conejo Canyon to make a short camp at a thin , trickling branch of some unnamed creek . The water was clear arid cold . The se  --  orita disdainfully refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stream and bathed her face and arms . Then they mounted and moved on . Had the situation been different , Dilliard would have enjoyed the journey . As it was , he experienced a certain pull toward this new , strange country . Many of the hillsides they crossed were a riot of color  --  orange poppies and lupine and violet brodiaea spread vividly painted tapestries along the rolling slopes . Below , on the more level stretches , huge gnarled live oaks spread their magnificent lowhanging branches , the lack of underbrush beneath giving it all the appearance of a wide park . Not a fleck of white showed in the turquoise sky . Now and then Dilliard recognized clumps of sage and prickly pear , but the former seemed more green , the latter much larger , with vivid yellow flowers jutting from the great spiney pads , than in his native Texas . At times the horses breasted their way through great fields of wild , yellow mustard . It must have been about two in the afternoon when Dilliard again sent the horses up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , rockcrested ridge , Dilliard directed the girl 's attention to a dusty , wheel-rutted road in a canyon far below . " By this time , " the Texan said quietly , " we should be ahead of that carriage . I 'm asking you to keep quiet , and watch that highway down there . Things will be happenin ' presently . But no matter what takes place , do n't make a sound . That 's for  | your own good as well as mine . With luck , nobody 'll see us up here . " The girl did n't answer . Dilliard dismounted , then helped the se  --  orita down from her saddle , wincing as he sensed her involuntary drawing away . The horses were screened from sight by great outthrusts of rock . Around Dilliard and his charge grew thick clumps of greasewood and mesquite . The girl glanced across the canyon to the opposite hillsides ; there was n't a soul to be seen  --  just rocks and trees and brush , blended by distance into bright green velvet . Overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flapping lazily ? near the top of a small peak . That was all the girl could see , that and the roadway below , until Dilliard spoke cautiously . " See ? Down there . " Following the Texan 's pointing finger , Castameto 's daughter saw a slight movement near the edge of the road . A man appeared , as though by magic , from the brush bordering the highway , then dropped from sight again . Soon , a few feet distant from the first man , a second appeared . Gradually , the se  --  orita made out other forms moving below her , most of them huddled in the rank brush that grew profusely along the road . Dilliard said tersely , " Am I a liar ? Did Tony and Teresa lie ' ? " " But  --  but , se  --  or , what do they wait for ' ? " " Your carriage  --  you . "  | The girl swallowed hard , glanced at the Texan . Her face was white . Perhaps , after all , this gringo savage had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she shrank back behind the protecting screen of mesquite . From around a bend in the road came the quick thud-clop-clop of horses ' hoofs , the squeak and rattle of the carriage . The waiting men on the road below quickly scattered out of sight , leaving the highway barren of movement . Dilliard , whispered , " The play 's about to start . I 'm askin ' you to watch what happens . " The girl 's eyes searched Dilliard 's , some of the belligerency dying from their dark depths . She did n't say anything ; just leaned forward to part the brush with one white hand to obtain a better view , as she crouched behind the sheltering mesquite . By this time the carriage had appeared , the veiled Teresa sitting stiffly on the back seat . The two breeds on the driver 's box were peering ahead , along the roadway . A certain tenseness in their attitudes betrayed that they were n't entirely ignorant of what was to happen . Riding at the side of the carriage was the man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope as he ordered the two breeds to slow the pace a trifle . Again , the girl turned and studied Dilliard 's grim features . Without turning , Dilliard said , " Look ! " It all happened in the next few moments . The  | se  --  orita saw fringes of white fire ruffle the brush near the road , heard quick shots , voices of yelling men . The carriage horses went to their knees , crashed down , tangling the harness . There were further shots : one after the other , the breeds on the driver 's seat pitched woodenly to the dust and lay still , faces turned to the white hot sunshine . The se  --  orita was n't missing the look of shocked surprise frozen on the features of one of the breeds , nor did she overlook the fact , through all the blur of action , that Corill , while appearing to fight off the assailants , was loosing all of his shots skyward . Men swarmed into and over the carriage . Teresa was lifted from the seat , struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly , reining his horse about , making a good deal of racket with his gun . Finally , he spurred away from the carriage and along the road , quickly disappearing around the next bend . Shots , aimed high , pursued him from the guns of certain men near the carriage , but no attempt was made to follow Corill . Powder smoke drifted slowly . There were sounds of many voices . Horses were brought from the brush where they 'd been hidden . The se  --  orita saw Teresa forced to mount one of the animals . The other men were in saddles now , moving across the roadway , ascending the slopes of the opposite hill , urging the horse that carried Teresa to greater efforts .  | Dilliard said quietly , " Well , what do you think now ? " The girl did n't reply . She crouched as before , her fascinated gaze glued to the carriage , the dead men , in the road below .  | Five minutes passed . The riders on the opposite slope were climbing higher now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight for you , but it was the only way I could make you understand . You would n't listen , before . " The girl nodded , wrenched her gaze away from the scene below , and gained her feet . She seemed stunned by what had taken place , as though still incapable of believing that the killing , and the capture of Teresa had actually occurred . Dilliard said , " Those coyotes across the canyon are reaching higher ground . A few minutes more and they 'll be level with us . We ca n't take chances of being seen . " He went to the horses , moved them back down the ridge , out of sight of those ascending the slopes on the other side of the roadway . The Texan noted it was n't necessary , this time , to tell the girl to follow him . He walked on , leading the horses , the girl picking her way through the long grass behind him . Stopping beneath a spreading live oak , a quarter of the way down the hillside , Dilliard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him slowly , full comprehension of the deed in the roadway dawning on her now in all its hideous certainty . Her face was white ,  | white touched with twin , burning points of indignation . Her full lips trembled with hot anger . " But  --  but they were Americanos , " she exclaimed incredulously . Dilliard said , hard-voiced , " I 'm apologizin ' for that too . I 'm not very proud of my own blood right at this moment . " " Se  --  or  --  Se  --  or Dilliard , I " The girl paused , unable to continue . Her sense of justice demanded that many things be said . She had wronged the gringo and his Mexican friends . Yet the humiliation of admitting , to this common vaquero from Texas , that she had perpetrated an injustice , was a trifle more than the se  --  orita 's strain of noble Spanish blood could sustain . Dilliard misinterpreted the girl 's hesitation . " Have n't forgotten I told you my name ? " Laughing eyes betrayed the firm lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd heard me . " Impulsively , Castameto 's proud daughter forgot her stern resolutions . " No , " she replied steadily , " I have n't forgotten your name . I remember , also , many other things . I should have believed you . But it all seemed so " " I 'm not surprised that you did n't believe us . " " But I 've been  --  been a little fool . You see , so much that is bad has happened of late . " The girl 's English was almost perfect , carrying just the barest trace of a Spanish accent that Dilliard found fascinating .  | She went on , " I am traveling to my padre 's rancho . My " I know  --  the Ranch of the Sycamores . " The se  --  orita nodded , continued , " My brother was ? my brother died  --  but that was some weeks back ? " Again she hesitated , her dark eyes moist . Branch Dilliard tried to make it easier for the girl : " I know that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramon , was killed . Your father 's in trouble for avenging his death . You are on your way home from Boston , where your father had sent you to school . You came by sailing vessel to the Isthmus of Panama , across the isthmus by carriage . Then another ship to California , to the port of San Pedro ? " " You know all this ? " Surprise tinged the girl 's words . Dilliard nodded . " From San Pedro you were traveling by carriage to the Rancho Sicamoro . Part of this I learned from Teresa and Tony . The rest ? about the kidnapping and so on  --  I overheard by accident in a cantina in Santa Lozana . The two Americanos who were to accompany your carriage had been drinkin ' . They talked too loud . " " But what of my own men who met me , with my father 's carriage , at the boat in San Pedro , and who drove me to Santa Lozana 2 They were good men . I do not understand Dilliard looked grim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . It was n't necessary to explain that Corill and Bisbee had added bloodshed  | to their other crimes of violence . The girl would learn about that part soon enough . Dilliard pushed on hurriedly , " Why they wanted to steal you I do n't know , unless the matter is somehow connected with your father 's troubles . I imagine it was a matter of ransom ? " " But you , a stranger to the Castametos ! " The se  --  orita was n't getting the idea at all . " You , an Americano , you risked your life to ? " " Reckon I did n't risk so much , " Dilliard grinned . " But you could have informed the authorities in Santa Lozana , and let them handle the matter . " That had Dilliard stumped . He could have , of course , and perhaps prevented the whole happening . But he felt it doubtful . " That did n't quite occur to me , " he said lamely , " or , if it did , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . He 's a pretty poor sort . I might not have been believed . Friends in Santa Lozana were scarcer'n frog 's hair . It 's a tough town at best . I had only Teresa and Tony I could depend on . " The girl nodded , without speaking , awaiting further explanation . The truth was , of course , that Dilliard had wanted a hand in the business himself . Now he hinted at something of the kind : " Yesterday , " he said quietly , " I saw you standing at your window in the hotel . It was just for a second or so , but that second or so sort of decided me I wanted to help you . " The se  --  orita read more in his gray eyes than  | Dilliard had put into words . She met his gaze a moment , then glanced away , a slow flush stealing into her cheeks . She changed the subject , her mind returning to the hold-up in the roadway . " The  --  the so-called bodyguard , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name you said ? What of him ? There were many shots but no attempt to hurt . He rode away " On his way to break the news to your father , " Dilliard told her . " He 'll arrive with a long yarn about you bein ' kidnapped . " " The two men on the driver 's seat , " the girl remembered next . " The guns fired straight in their case . " " A matter of double-crossing . " Dilliard had to explain the word . " Oh , they were in on the plot , all right , counting on getting paid for their part of the job . But I reckon those other coyotes figured it would be easier to throw lead than pay money after the job had been done . " The girl was silent for a few moments , then , " Do we ride on , now ? " Dilliard nodded , " My work is finished when I deliver you at your home . Nothing to prevent us from starting . " " My father will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and Dilliard 's heart skipped a beat , " ? not that I 'm incapable of doing my own thanking , but ? "  | " Just believin ' in me , " the Texan told her steadily , " is all the thanking I 'm wanting . " The girl 's eyes were deep , inscrutable pools as she flushed and looked away . Dilliard was entirely missing the point that the Spanish dons of those early California days looked upon the gringos as an inferior race . It may be the Spanish dons had much on their side to substantiate that belief : certainly the Spanish owners of large ranchos had found no particular cause to love the Americano . A considerable percentage of the men who first reached California shores , from east of the Rocky Mountains , were adventurers , seekers after gold , outlaws and schemers in nefarious projects , and they rode many rough-shod chapters across the early history of the Golden State . " You have n't told me your name , yet , " Dilliard reminded the girl . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl smiled and commenced , " Se  --  orita Mariposa Baca y Castameto de Hinojosa y Castilla la Vieja " Whoa ! " Dilliard grinned . That 's enough . Do n't bother with any more abbreviations . Lady , that 's a mouthful ! Let me see ? " he struggled with unfamiliar phrases of Spanish , " ? Mariposa means butterfly , does n't it ? " " Butterfly , or  --  well , my madre interpreted Mariposa as night-light ' . "  | Dilliard thought of " a silver flame in the dusk . " He said , laughing , " I did n't realize all I 'd get when I asked for your name . I wo n't try to remember all of it . Reckon I 'll just call you Mary , now that we 're on friendly terms . Mary 's shorter than Mariposa . " The Texan entirely missed the tightening that came to the girl 's lips at this , to her , unbounded familiarity . After all , to Se  --  orita Mariposa Baca y Castameto , descendant of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio , Texas , was only one more vaquero gringo , one more of the detested Americano invaders of a peaceful land . The girl said coldly , " Se  --  or Dilliard , would n't ' Se  --  orita Castameto ' be more in order ? " Dilliard jerked up at the look in her eyes . Comprehension came to him like a sharp slap across the mouth . He thought , " She 's run a brand on me a second time , I reckon . " Suddenly he grinned ruefully and nodded , " I reckon you 're correct ? Se  --  orita Castameto . " The girl flushed at his tone . " I 'm not forgetting I 'm under obligations to you " The sooner you forget it , " Dilliard said shortly , " the better I 'll like it . . . . Well , we 'd best be getting along  --  Se  --  orita Castameto . " Mariposa 's dark eyes flashed angrily . She bit her lip , stared at Dilliard a long minute , then changed the subject : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage ? " " She 'll be all right . You see , those hombres think  | they 've captured the very proud Se  --  orita Castameto . Until some business with your father is completed , they 'll handle Teresa with silk gloves . No , I 'm not sure what the business is . Ransom , maybe . " " But  --  but after those scoundrels learn of their mistake ? What then of the girl ? " Dilliard studied the situation with a clear mind . " That , " he admitted reluctantly at last , " has got my brain doing some queer tumbles too . I told Tony to follow the carriage , to trail Teresa , unseen , to wherever she was taken . I 'm hoping he 's on her track now . I figured to deliver you home ? " " Deliver ! " Mariposa intruded hotly . " Am I some sort of package , an inanimate object , with no decision in its own affairs ? " Dilliard scratched his jaw  --  not the one bearing the fiery marks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he stated coldly , " but I 'm not so sure I can say the same for your good judgment ? Se  --  orita Castameto . " His eyes clashed with her own blazing darker ones . The girl was furious , her short laugh harsh , jeering , as she gazed meaningly at the four livid streaks down his cheek . Finally , she said insolently , " I lower , degrade myself , quarreling with a gringo savage . In this way , we reach no place . I have requested information regarding the welfare of the Mexican girl . I demand a reply  --  now  --  at once . I demand ! Understand , gringo ? " " Your manners , " Dilliard said hotly , " demand a  | damn good spanking , and for a plugged peso I 'd give you one , here and now . For a minute I thought you had a trace of sense , but I was wrong . A dang good Mex boy and his girl have put themselves out to do you an important favor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Dilliard shook his head . " You have n't given me a chance to do that . You put me in my place a spell back  --  at least , you thought you did . All right , I 'm a gringo . What of it ' ? I made a mistake  --  I admit that too  --  trying to be friendly with a little greaser spitfire ? " " Greaser spitfire ! Gringo pig , you go too far ! I warn you , I , Mariposa Baca y Castameto " The girl panted hotly . " Aw , forget it , " Dilliard said wearily . The humor of the situation suddenly burst upon him and he laughed good-naturedly . " You said it all when you said we did n't get any place scrappin ' . You were mighty correct . Let 's pretend you 're always correct . We 'll get along a heap better , until I can knock at the door of your outfit and say , Here she is . Not a hair of her useless head harmed . ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl was suddenly calm again . " For the moment let us forget our differences . I 've asked for information regarding the Mexican girl . I refuse to go on until you finish telling me of her . " All right , all right , " Dilliard said impatiently . " Like I told you , Tony 's following her  --  leastwise  | I hope he is . I figured to unload you , then return and meet Tony at a place he 'd designated . Then we 'd see what could be done about getting Teresa out of the mess she 's in on your account " The mess , as you call it , might have been avoided if you had called at the hotel in Santa Lozana and told me frankly what was planned . " The Texan laughed scornfully . " And you 'd have believed me , of course ? " Mariposa suddenly lowered her eyes ; she had n't any answer for that one . Dilliard went on , " As I said before , I planned to join Tony , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teresa . I 'd even supposed your father might furnish enough men to help out on that job . I see now , if he 's anything like you , I was pro'bly wrong . All right , Tony and I can do it alone . " Mariposa 's dark eyes snapped , but she managed to control the fiery torrent of words that swelled to her lips . And that was n't a particularly easy task . " If you asked , " she said with bleak steadiness , " every man on the Rancho Sicamoro would be put at your command . The Castametos are n't entirely devoid of honor , as you seem to think . But what of the time ? " " Now what are you talking about ? " " Will you have time to secure the help of my father 's men ? Suppose the true identity of that  | Mexican girl should be discovered before you return . What then of her ? She must not be harmed . " The Texan looked curiously at Mariposa Castameto . His reply was weighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Se  --  orita Castameto , Teresa is only a poor Mexican girl . There is no noble blood in her body " Silence ! " Mariposa snapped . The Texan swallowed hard , but remained quiet . Mariposa went on , her voice coldly patient , explaining , " The Castametos always look to the welfare of their servants . To my knowledge , this Teresa has never been with us , but I recognized the man you call Tony ; formerly he was one of our vaqueros . That makes Teresa one of our people . About her something must be done  --  at once . " " If you recognized Tony , " Dilliard said , " I 'll bet he never knew it . " " I thought we were talking about Teresa , " haughtily . Dilliard laughed shortly . " You 're plumb insistent , anyway . You mean you want to see her safe ? " " I 'd like that . " " Had n't I better get you home first ? Another dozen miles or so will do the trick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Se  --  or Dilliard . It will require more nearly fifteen miles to  --  do the trick as you call it . But first comes the welfare of our people  --  Teresa . She must not be harmed . "  | The Texan examined the proposition from all sides , his gray eyes narrowed in thought . Finally , " I calc'late it can be done , " he said , half to himself . Then , to the girl , " It will mean waiting here alone . " " I 'll wait . " " It may require some time . " " I 've told you I 'd wait , " haughtily . Dilliard nodded , tethered the girl 's horse to a lower branch of the live oak , persuaded her to accept a couple of cold tamales wrapped in cornhusks and the canteen of water from his saddle . " I might be a long time gone , " he said tersely . " Now , I 'm not givin ' orders to a Castameto , but if I were you , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse . No telling who might show up here  --  I do n't think anyone will , but you ca n't always tell . If I thought there was a speck of danger , I would n't be leavin ' you . " The Texan swung easily up to his saddle , swept the soft hat from his black hair in a low , mocking bow , saying , " Adi  --  s , Se  --  orita Castameto . " Mariposa 's reply was as haughty as his own and came with a cold shrug of white shoulders , " Feliz viaje , . Se  --  or Branch Dilliard . May you have a pleasant journey . " She watched him rein the horse through the mesquite , and then rose to follow him with her eyes , until he had reached the crest of the ridge and disappeared from view , her mind a turmoil of conflicting emotions .  | She returned and sat down under the tree . Something was wrong . The Texan had acted for her best interests and she had snubbed him as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for a few minutes they had gotten on so well . But now , the barrier between them , abruptly dissolved after the scene of the hold-up , had been erected a second time . Just how that had happened , Mariposa did n't quite comprehend . " He need n't have been so familiar , " she tried to defend her actions , lip curling disdainfully . " So , he 'd call me Mary ' would he ? . . . Yet , was he wrong ? He saved my life , it may be . Certainly , he risked his own . A brave man he most certainly is . And there is nothing of the savage about him , as I at first thought . For a gringo he is very good looking . " A faint flush stole up the girl 's cheek , as she continued , " He has very good eyes , very true , honest eyes . I think , were our stations in life not so far apart , I might like him . " Then , abruptly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between a Castameto and a gringo can be only enmity . Always my padre has maintained that point . Besides , this Dilliard is crude , he is rough spoken , he has not the graceful manners of a Spaniard . " But , " she added as an afterthought , " he has a manner of his own , he is not so crude , nor rough . At times , he appears very gentle . It may even be he  | finds merit in the eyes of his own people " She broke off suddenly , eyes wide with horror . " Mother of God ! " she gasped . " I did n't realize ! We were so angry in our talk , I did n't think ! I  --  I am a little fool ! I have sent him alone to face those outlaws and rescue Teresa . He too was angry . I made my words sound like a challenge to his courage . Madre de Dios ! No , no ! I wo n't have it that way . He doubtless had some plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that . He would n't be so foolhardy as to ride into that outlaw camp and demand the Mexican girl . " Mariposa wondered if she were lying to herself , summoning up possibilities simply to set at ease her own guilty conscience . She strove to turn her thoughts to other subjects , always defending her haughty manner in dealing with Dilliard . Back on the New England seacoast , Mariposa had , usually , been accepted as an equal among the girls at the school she 'd attended , though there were remembered snubs during her first year there , when various struggles with the English language had been met with thinly-veiled sneers . But all that had passed during the succeeding months of schooling , as she had adopted the customs and manners of the girls in her classes . Now , once more in her own country , that sense of democracy had faded , leaving in its place the fact , foremost in her mind , that she was the only daughter of Don Salvadore Baca y Castameto , a ruler of vast acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants given , direct , from the Spanish throne in Madrid . The girl insisted to herself that she had n't intended to be cold and short with Dilliard 's attempted friendliness . Something stronger than herself , heritage , had dictated the haughty manner , coupled with an involuntary resentment erected by her remembrance of Salvadore Castameto 's warnings against any sort of intercourse with the gringos . Always it was the gringo who encroached on Spanish lands , gaining by hook or crook the possessions of Castameto 's friends and neighbors . Mariposa remembered her father 's last letter . Tears welled in her dark eyes to be brushed impatiently away . Was the Ranch of the Sycamores , as well , to fall into the greedy , grasping hands of these Americano foreign invaders ' ? The girl shrugged hopeless shoulders , murmuring " Quien sabe ? Who knows ? " But , somehow , she could n't put away the idea that her murmured words had something to do with her mingled feelings toward Branch Dilliard . She was regretting now those four cruel scratches on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into harsh lines of thought , as his horse slowly descended the slopes that dropped from the crest of the ridge to the roadside . A rueful grin twisted the bronze mask that was his face , and he told himself , " Reckon she 's pretty high-toned . At that , she need n't to have been so high and mighty . I 'm a gringo pig , am I ? Well , if she ai n't a spit-firin ' greaser  --  no , I 'll take back the greaser ' part . Not the other , though . Got a temper like a cat-clawed bob-cat . Mebbe that runs in the blood of these pure Spaniards . Just the same there was no call for her to be mountin ' the high horse with me . I was just tryin ' to be friendly like . " A new thought obtruded : was it just friendliness , or something more ' ? The Texan toyed with that idea for a time , endeavoring to deceive himself , though he 'd known from the beginning it was more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grinned weakly , " She 'll be gettin ' me down if I do n't watch out , " he muttered . " Still and all , there was no call for her to turn frigid just because I called her Mary . What 's wrong with that name ' ? Back home it was always a right solid moniker for a nice girl . " What was it Teresa had called her ? a silver flame in the dusk ' ? The Texan laughed scornfully . " Sunshine on ice is more like her . "  | He swerved the horse around a huge clump of prickly-pear covered with yellow and crimson blossoms , and beheld , a short distance below , the carriage in the roadway , the dead horses sprawled in tangled and broken harness . The two breed drivers lay in the dust on either side of the vehicle , their eyes glassy under the hot California sun . Dilliard resumed his abstractions : " I 'll say one thing for Mary  --  pardon me , Se  --  orita Castametoshe 's got blued-steel nerve . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew Teresa was safe . Oh , yes , the Castametos always look after their servants . ' S'help me , Hannah , if that is n't the dangdest thing I ever heard tell of . Just because Tony once punched cows for old man Castameto , Mary takes it for granted Tony 's whole family belongs to the same outfit . Darn little stuck-up wildcat ! I wonder who she thinks she is ? " He felt the hot blood rising to his face . " Gettin ' hoity-toity with me , was she ' ? Mebbe she thinks she owns me too , ordering me down to save Teresa . Not in so many words , but the way she said it  --  like she was darin ' me to ? " Dilliard broke off suddenly , then , " Come to think of it , she might have had a certain amount of right on her side . Seems like I 've heard the old Spanish Dons are like that . Once somebody works for ' em , they think it 's part of their duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , dang her hide , she need n't think I 'm looking for corral and fodder for  | the rest of my days . I 'll get the little spitfire home , after Teresa 's took care of , and then pull out without so much as a goodbye . Never did like this California country . . . . Say , I wonder where Tony is ? " Dilliard had crossed the road by this time . Swinging down from the saddle , he examined the earth for sign . There were plenty of tracks but nothing to show that Tony had yet passed . The Texan pulled his horse to a halt beneath the spreading limbs of a big white oak and angrily twisted a cigarette . The cigarette was scarcely lighted when the sound of an approaching horse was heard around a bend in the roadway . A moment later , Tony loped into view , his horse covered with lather . The Mexican 's eyes narrowed as his gaze took in the carriage and the two dead men . He greeted Dilliard stolidly , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Dilliard nodded . " That short cut across the hills you told me about got us here first . We were in plenty time to see the whole show . " " Teresa ? " Tony tried to keep the words steady and was only partially successful . " She was n't harmed , " Dilliard was glad to tell him . " Those skunks were right careful of her . Corill and Bisbee mentioned , that day I overheard ' em plottin ' , that they had never seen the girl . I doubt any of the other coyotes have either . So long as they believe Teresa is the Se  --  orita Castameto , she  | wo n't be harmed . . . . I had you figured to show up before now . " " I was delay ' . It require ' longer than I hav ' expect to buy a suitable horse . In Santa Lozana is mostly of crow-bait . . . . Where did you say those scoundrelly ones hav ' take my Teresa ? " Dilliard waved one hand up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll get on their trail when you 've had time to breathe your pony . " Tony nodded , paused to roll and light a cigarreto . He inhaled deeply . " What of the Se  --  orita Castameto ? " he asked next . Dilliard explained in brief sentences , concluding , " She insists on waiting while I do something about Teresa . She 's right , of course , only I was sort of surprised . " Dilliard was surprised a second time when Tony accepted the news of Mariposa 's action as a matter of course . " Was she ver ' frighten ' ? " the Mexican asked next . " Mad more than anythin ' ; then when she saw the outlaws hold up the carriage , she come around some and talked a mite . Did n't overwhelm me or anythin ' like that , though . Kind of uppity , I figure her .. . . . Say , Tony , she seems to feel that you and Teresa are her father 's servants . " Tony took that quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Branch . " " Dam 'd if I make you out . Servants ! Hell , Tony , this is a free country . Maybe you 're right , the way  | things used to be , but now California is a part of , is owned by , the United States Government . Old Castameto ca n't expect to control your actions . All that sort of thing is changed . " Tony smiled lazily . " Other changes may come ? but not that . I am of the patr  --  n 's people  --  always Don Salvadore has known I would some day return to the Rancho Sicamoro . Socorro ! Am I not his most grand vaquero ? " The Mexican 's white teeth flashed humorously , " It is like theese , Se  --  or Branch , if I do not return  --  pouf ! the Rancho Sicamoro she go all in the pieces . Don Salvadore can not get along without Antonio Aguilar . " " Oh , it 's like that , eh ? " Dilliard said dryly . " My gosh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a search warrant issued , so 's he could locate you and be saved from ruin . " " That would not surprise me , " Tony said solemnly . " Look , I will make the explain  --  once I am work for the patr  --  n , I am like of his family . Always he looks out for my well-being . Always , when I am ready to bring my Teresa to the rancho , I 'm know there is a small house will be furnish ' us . Had I return ' alone , then I would be furnish ' a bed and food in a big quarters weeth the othair vaqueros who hav ' not yet found their woman . But so long as I care to stay , I will be take care of , and my children will be take care of , and their children will be take care of " " Well , that 's fine , " Dilliard cut in , the situation  | seeming strange to him . " Maybe Castameto is friendly thataway , but I would n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , she was mighty high-and-toity with me . " Tony looked pained . " Ah , you don ' understand , Se  --  or Branch . Look ! To her you are only a gringo , a so-common vaquero . There are hondreds of you ? but of Se  --  orita Castameto there is but one . She is grateful , yes , for what you hav ' done , but , remembair , she has of the blood of kings in her veins ? what you call heem ? ? blue-blood , no ? " Dilliard nodded , sighed resentfully . " I reckon it 's all you say , amigo . Me , I 'll have to learn to adjust my sights . My lead 's throwing too high , looks like . " Tony smiled slyly . " Maybe , Se  --  or Branch , you take the aim in too much of a hurry  --  no ? " Dilliard grinned back . " Or maybe I 'd better quit shooting at that target , altogether . " " About that , we shall see later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're to do about Teresa . " Tony reined his horse around beside Dilliard 's . Spurs were touched to the beasts ' ribs and they started off . The two men ascended the hillside in the direction taken by the outlaws . Reaching the brow of the hill , Dilliard and Tony slowed their mounts to a walk . Here , the trail was easy to read , the hoof-chopped earth plainly pointing the way taken by Teresa and her abductors . Tony 's shrewd brown eyes flashed along the ground .  | " Pro'bly of two dozen hombres  --  no ? " Dilliard nodded . " Twenty or twenty-five . I did n't count ' em . Ca n't see why so many was needed for their butcherin ' work and to carry off Teresa . . . . We wo n't have an easy time of it , amigo . " " It looks , " Tony grinned ruefully , " like we have our work all cut an ' slice  --  not " " If you 're hintin ' we got a job cut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilled a whole mouthful , Tony . " " Spill the mouthful ? " Tony looked puzzled . " You spoke the truth , " Dilliard explained . Tony shrugged , slowly nodded as he absorbed the phrase . " Spill the mouthful . It is a good saying . . . . Well , shall we make the proceed , and get this cut-an ' - slice job over quick like the possible ? " They spoke to the horses , again moved on at a faster clip . All that afternoon , Dilliard and Tony followed the trail of the bandits , across a series of rolling hills and along tiny washes and canyons . Ever they mounted higher as they climbed the far reaches of the Santa Ana Mountains . At times they crossed hillsides ablaze with the riotous colors of wildflowers . Descending the opposite side of the same hills , the way , more often than not , was spiny with cacti and cholla . Now and then quail or wild doves flushed up from beneath the horses ' hoofs . Once a deer was startled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ada .  | The sun had long since swung to the west , its rounded edge touching the distant San Joaquin Hills near the blue Pacific . The air grew chill as a brisk breeze from the coast lifted into being . Tony asked , " You think those scoundrelly ones will travel all night ? " Dilliard shook his head . " I figure they 'll be stopping right soon . We ought to slow down a mite so we wo n't overrun ' em . That might prove disastrous . " The two men had just dipped down through a park of huge live oaks . Ahead , lay a narrow blind canyon . Momentarily , the evening breeze died down . Dilliard 's nostrils twitched at the sudden scent of wood smoke . " Camp ahead , " he announced briefly , drawing in his horse . Tony halted beside him . They dismounted , tethering the two animals to the lower limbs of a big white oak . Dilliard took the lead , and the two went cautiously forward on foot , carefully picking their way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water , they rounded a bend in the canyon . Dilliard stopped , stepped suddenly back , one hand behind him to halt Tony . They dropped silently to earth , a wide screen of mesquite sheltering them from view . Through the leafy branches , Dilliard and Tony made an unobscured examination of the outlaws ' camp . A fire burned . An odor of burning wood and  | cooking food was in the air . From a nearby tree hung a side of beef , doubtless from a stray Sicamoro animal picked up on the way . Nearly two dozen men sprawled about the camp which had been made at the foot of a brush-covered slope in the end of the canyon . Here and there , from beneath the brush , jutted great slabs of yellow sandstone . To the right , a short distance from the bandits ' camp , the outlaws ' horses were tethered on a rope stretched between two tall trees . Tony looked anxiously for Teresa , finally saw the girl seated on a blanket beyond the fire . She was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been withdrawn by this time . The girl seemed cool and collected . Even while Dilliard and Tony watched , one of the outlaws left the fire and approached Teresa bearing food and something in a tin cup . Dilliard watched him place bits of food in the girl 's mouth and judged that her feet and hands were securely bound . " Anyway , " Tony muttered nervously , " they ain ' do her none of harm . " Dilliard nodded , satisfied . He was suddenly aware that night had fallen . To his ears came the faint crackle of the outlaws ' fire . The camp gradually quieted down , though there was some ribald singing and drinking from flasks for a time . The Americano bandits were failing to display their  | better sides  --  if such existed  --  to their Mexican captive . Cramped from his long position , Dilliard finally edged back , drawing Tony beside him . For more than two hours the two men sat conversing in whispers in the darkness . The camp was quiet by this time ; the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a moment to pick out highlights on the blanket-rolled cocoons grouped horizontally about the smoldering embers . One of the bandits tossed a blanket around Teresa 's shoulders and sat down not far from the girl . Dilliard whispered to Tony ; then , with the stealth of a Comanche , moved off through the gloom . Tony settled back to wait for the Texan 's return . Fifteen minutes passed . Twenty . A half hour drifted by . Tony stirred impatiently , anxiously , peered through the lacy limbs of the sheltering mesquite . He could see no more than before . The camp did n't appear to have changed in any manner . Insects of the night made their myriad noises . Somewhere in the trees , off to the left , a night-bird went suddenly insane , and just as abruptly stopped its piercing notes . Again , quiet fell . Tony commenced to grow nervous . Still no sign of Dilliard . Another quarter hour passed . Overhead , the sky was sprinkled with stars . The moon had n't yet come up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Branch Dilliard 's lean form was  | sky-lighted momentarily , faintly , an instant between the mesquites . Tony 's surprise took the form of an effective Spanish oath uttered in an explosive whisper . Dilliard hissed a low-voiced , " Shhh ! " Behind him he led a saddled pony . The Mexican squirmed around in the gloom to get a better look . Dilliard was laughing silently as he dropped down beside Tony . " Sure was skeery thievin ' this bronc in the darkness . Gettin ' the saddle , and then riggin ' up , was the hardest part , though . But those coyotes never made a move ; they 're dead to the world I " Teresa ? " Tony tried to control his tones . " She 's all right , " the Texan replied . " One feller 's guarding her , but he 's been dozing most of the time . He 's got a bottle at his side ; hitting that plumb often is helpin ' a heap . Ten minutes more and I figure he 'll be in shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teresa 's tied tight . I got near enough to ? " " Diantre ! " Tony 's voice sounded choked . " You hav ' spik to her ? " Dilliard shook his head , then remembering Tony could n't see him in the gloom , responded , " Nope , I did n't dare try that . . . . Listen , amigo , you know that rope the outlaws ' horses are fastened to ? " " You mean the rope that reach ' from the two trees ? "  | That 's it . I untied both ends . There is n't a thing in the world to stop those horses , should they get a notion to run . " Tony rocked with soft laughter . " Se  --  or Branch , you are one diablo for theenk out ideas . I 'm theenk those caballos get the excuse to run pret ' soon ? no ' ? " " That 's my thoughts on the matter . " The Texan went on , " We 'll drift back and bring up our own horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste any time . Maybe we 'll be lucky , maybe we wo n't , but it 's best to prepare for everything . " Tethering the horse Dilliard had taken from the outlaw camp , the two walked noiselessly back , then returned in a short time with their own ponies . Tying the three horses loosely , Tony and Dilliard held a brief , whispered consultation , then separated , following different paths toward the camp . In a moment they had blended with the darkness . Again silence fell .  | The mountain horizon to the east was now edged with an aura of silver . Another ten minutes would bring the rising moon into view . Back in the hills a coyote yip-yipped with startling sharpness . One by one , and in twos and threes , other coyotes took up the cry . The sounds rolled across the hills , gathering form and volume , then abruptly died away . By this time , Dilliard had worked his way around the rim of the camp and was hidden in the brush , just a few yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter of leaves and branches , wiggled slowly forward on his stomach . Inch by silent inch , he approached the half-reclining form of the girl , moving across dead leaves and gravelly earth with all the stealth of an Indian . The Texan felt sure Teresa was n't asleep , even though she made no move . A few feet away , on a second blanket , one of the outlaws , acting as the girl 's guard , was sprawled on his back , eyes closed . All around the almost dead embers of the campfire , men were stretched in various attitudes . Dilliard moved even more cautiously as he drew nearer to Teresa . He glanced again at the Mexican girl 's guard and saw that the man dozed fitfully . Then , Dilliard put out one hand , lightly touched Teresa 's back .  | At the Texan 's touch , Teresa started ever so slightly , then held tense for what came next . She felt fingers fumbling at the tough , rawhide thongs that bound her wrists behind her . Cautiously she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her guard . The movement was slight , but the guard came awake instantly . Dilliard dropped flat behind the girl , hoping he would n't be seen in the semi-gloom before the rising of the moon . The guard said something to Teresa about getting to sleep . Teresa replied quietly that sleep was impossible for her . The guard growled something that had to do with " damn greasers , " rose and placed a dead oak limb on the cooling ashes of the fire . A few sparks stirred , flew quickly upward and disappeared . The guard returned to his blankets , drank deeply from a flask at his side , and stretched out again . Dilliard shrank close to earth , swearing mentally , every nerve fibre tense with the strain of waiting . Minutes dragged past on leaden feet . Abruptly , a deep , contented snore left the guard 's parted lips . Dilliard waited to see if the sound would awaken its owner , but after a moment the snoring continued . The tip of the moon appeared . Again that wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Momentarily a thought for the girl he had left waiting intruded on Dilliard 's thoughts , but he felt she was safe ; his mind came back to the business at hand . Twisting easily to one side he  | fished out his clasp knife , opened one blade , again moved near to the Mexican girl . Luckily the dead oak limb the guard had placed on the fire did n't catch fire . Dilliard renewed his efforts on Teresa 's bonds . In an instant the girl 's hands were free . She sat straighter , leaned over to fumble with the knots at her ankles . Suddenly , the guard sat up , stared blearily at the scene , only half believing what his sleep-sodden senses were telling him . He opened his mouth to shout a warning , but already Dilliard had crossed to his rear and brought down the heavy barrel of his six-shooter on the guard 's unprotected head . The man went limp and slumped , unconscious , back to his blankets . But Dilliard 's activities were n't to escape unnoticed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then opened his mouth in a wild yell of warning . Dilliard stooped , severed the rawhide at Teresa 's ankles with one swift stroke , jerked the girl upright . The camp was stirring into life now . Two outlaws were already on their feet , groping for guns . Dilliard 's six-shooter roared , as he seized Teresa and swept her back with him into the brush . Across the camp sounded a wild , high-pitched yell that startled the outlaws ' horses into panic . The gunfire had made the beasts nervous ; that yell completed the business . There came shrill , excited sounds from the horses . They reared , snorting madly , twisting free , down-slashing hoofs ripping brush and  | turf . Then , they were away in a mad stampede that swept them up the hillside , over rocks and through trees and bushes . Dilliard was still backing away from the camp , pulling Teresa with him . The camp was a bedlam of yelling men , wild shots and curses . Someone was striving frantically to fan the campfire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner and whoever had come to her assistance . So far , the outlaws had no way of knowing how large a party had come to attempt the rescue . Brush and small dead limbs were piled on the smoking log and smoldering embers . There came a sudden flare of light as flames gathered headway and rushed up , throwing the scene into bold relief . By this time , Branch and Teresa were half-hidden in the growth that surrounded the camp . The bandits were rushing wildly about , searching for their prey . Dilliard whispered swift directions to the girl who was too cramped from her bonds for swift movement . At that moment , Tony came plunging up . Dilliard swore gratefully , turned the girl over to the Mexican . Tony and Teresa disappeared in the mesquite , heading in the direction of the place where Dilliard and the Mexican had left their horses . Dilliard darted off at a tangent , firing his gun as he ran , to draw the outlaws away from Tony and the girl . Whining bullets cut the leaves around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capand-ball ,  | circled the camp , away from Tony and the waiting horses . The camp was a nest of hot gunfire . Three forms rolled on the earth , in agony . A fourth was down , braced on one hand , the other hand a-flame with smoke and hot lead . Dilliard 's gun jerked sidewise , exploded in a burst of orange flame . The body of another outlaw suddenly jack-knifed , pitched forward and lay still . Dilliard sprinted on , bullets humming around his running form , but , miraculously , without finding his body . The Texan was breathing hard now . Swerving to one side he crashed violently into a tree trunk , staggered , then righted himself . He paused , panting , in the shelter of the tree , one hand groping in a pocket for fresh cartridges . Empty shells were plugged out of his cylinder , fresh loads shoved into the empty chambers . There was no time now to reload his depleted cap-and-ball pistol ; that was thrust into the waistband of his trousers . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited , behind the tree trunk , looking over the scene . Dilliard chuckled grimly . " We sure stirred up a hornet 's nest looks like , " he muttered . Across the camp , hidden in the brush , were Tony and Teresa with the horses . But to reach them now meant that Dilliard would have to run a veritable gauntlet of flaming guns . To go around would require too much time , and every minute counted . At any instant , Tony and Teresa might be located . '  | " It 's now or never , " Dilliard told himself , stepping suddenly from behind the tree . By this time the moon was above the hills , bathing the outlaw camp with white light . One of the outlaws spotted the Texan almost immediately . His gun roared . Something hot burned along the Texan 's right ribs as he leaped into full view . He saw swift forms outlined in the moonlight , their hands throwing orange lances of savage fire . Dilliard muttered , " Straight into it is the shortest distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Colt-gun jerking in his right hand . An evil face loomed before him ; gunpowder flared wickedly close at hand . Hands clutched at his arms and legs . He shook them off , plunged on , his gun roaring or swinging sharply against bearded faces . A muscular hand gripped his shoulder . Dilliard swung his gun , caught a quick picture of a wide-open mouth , staring eyes . Seemingly from far off , a pain-wrenched cry reached his ears . He jerked loose only to stumble and go sprawling across a form that had just dropped at his feet . In an instant the Texan was up , throwing off his would-be captors . Quite suddenly he realized his gun was again empty , the hammer falling futilely on empty shells . The wild yells were falling farther to his rear now . It dawned on Dilliard , quite abruptly , that he was at last clear of the camp , running swiftly through the trees and brush . For a moment he lost all sense of direction . There  | was a crimson blur before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parched lips . His right side was queerly numb , carrying a vague sensation of paralysis . The Texan staggered on , spurs tangling in low brush , feet tripping over each other . Sweat blinded his vision against the moonlight pouring through the branches . As in a dream , Dilliard suddenly saw the figures of Tony and Teresa looming before him . The girl was already mounted . Tony 's words were tense with anguish : " For the love of the Se  --  or Dios , hurry ! " Dilliard laughed , a trifle foolishly , his words not quite steady , " Get slopin ' ! I 'll hold ' em off . Tell the Se  --  orita Castameto I did n't really intend to spank her . Go on , drift ! " " It is not necessary that you hold them off , " Tony implored . " They have run to catch their horses . It will be sometime before they are successful . More time will be lost in the saddling . If we leave now , they 'll never catch " Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is you who waste time . " She gave quick , snapping orders . " Por Dios ! " Tony cried . " You are correct , my Teresa ! " The Texan felt himself half lifted to saddle , then caught a rush of wind against his face , heard the steady drumming of horses ' pounding hoofs . He  | tried to speak , but his lips were dry , his tongue thick . Tony was riding close , one hand supporting the swaying Texan . There were certain difficult moments of intense concentration before Dilliard got the hang of staying in his saddle . Teresa rode ahead , leading the way , finding the best footing and the more open paths through the trees . Loose branches slapped viciously at the Texan 's face and body , but he did n't feel any pain . Once Tony 's anxious voice reached him in a moment of lucidity . " Sure , sure , I 'm all right , " Dilliard replied impatiently . " Keep going . I ai n't hurt none . " One leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were moments when Dilliard passed completely out of the picture , but always he contrived to keep up . He lost all conception of passing time and felt somehow cheated when he noticed , during one of his clearer moments , that the moon had already crossed the sky and was swinging to the west . It seemed not five minutes since he had left the outlaws ' camp . What had happened in the meantime ' ? A sort of nightmare , that ride , a queer business of rattling around in the saddle and losing his stirrups from time to time , and much foolish-sounding laughter which Dilliard was always surprised to find issuing from his own parched mouth . Then he would feel embarrassed and fight to keep clear-headed and  | sane , but always he drifted back to a semi-conscious delirium in which recent past events assumed exaggerated importance and caused Tony and Teresa to glance queerly at one another . Dilliard returned to sanity from one of these sessions with the realization that the horses had come to a halt . It was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slim white figure with cornsilk hair and bare feet . Mariposa . Tony had been giving details in low-voiced Spanish . Dilliard caught certain words that had to do with his own condition . He felt himself lifted from the saddle . For the moment his head cleared . He felt buoyant ; there was a lack of any sensation when his feet touched the earth . He swayed drunkenly on fast-weakening legs before the se  --  orita , insisted on making a low , mocking bow , trying for certain sarcasms that concerned " the very high-toned Se  --  orita Castameto . " He bowed low from the waist  --  and kept going until his long form was sprawled awkwardly on the earth . Mariposa 's anguished protests did n't filter through to his dim consciousness . Tony was straightening his form on a patch of grass . Teresa hovered near . Dilliard 's shirt was torn away . There was a sound of ripping cotton as bandages were manufactured . A dagger of sheer torture shot through Dilliard 's body . He heard Mariposa 's words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The old laugh formed on Dilliard 's white lips . He mumbled thickly , " You 're right  --  it ai n't serious . It 's the silver flame in the dusk that really hurts most . " Something of this reached the girl 's ears , made her wince . The last thought Dilliard caught for a long time was that of Mariposa giving orders , the Mexican pair obeying with efficient silence . After minutes of this , the Texan was again lifted to saddle , his rope was employed to lash his limp form securely in the seat . The horses moved on again . There were certain savage joltings during the remainder of the journey that brought Dilliard close to the surface at times , but it was near dawn before he came entirely to the top for a few minutes . Even then , it did n't mean a great deal to him  --  candles guttering in the early morning breeze , much excited conversation in Spanish , shadowy forms running here and there . Dilliard gained an impression of big trees and buildings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was being lifted from the saddle , he passed out again . He regained consciousness to find himself stretched on a bed in a large room . Someone was doing something to his side ; he caught the sound made by water being squeezed from a cloth . Dilliard wondered whether that really was a dagger being drawn sharply across his ribs . He gritted his teeth against the pain . After a few moments he opened one eye , met the  | searching gaze of a pair of keen black ones set on either side of a hawk-beak nose and , beneath it , a firm , straight-lipped mouth . A shock of wavy , irongray hair rose above the eyes . " I 'll bet a plugged peso , " and Dilliard 's voice was none too steady , " that you 're Ol ' Salvadore Castameto . Well , we brought her home  --  patr  --  n . It 's Teresa and Tony that gets any medals you hand out though . They 're gamey , that pair . Me , I sort of fumbled my part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead throws too high . The  --  the Se  --  orita Castameto can tell you how that went . " Dilliard 's eyes closed again . There were many excited and puzzled exclamations in Spanish on the heels of the Texan 's light-headed speech . Dilliard listened , eyes shut , too tired to take a hand . That damn ' dagger was being raked along his ribs again . Now and then he caught a word or two of Mariposa 's story and many references to the " gringo vaquero . " Later , a steel-sharp voice cut in , speaking in Spanish , " Now , to you , foolish one . So , you have returned once more . " And Tony 's humble reply , " Si , mi patr  --  n . " " And this time do you remain , with no more of your imbecilic notions ? " " Si , mi patr  --  n . " Tony 's meek mien brought a chuckle to Dilliard 's pain-twisted lips . " Si , mi patr  --  n , " Dilliard muttered , without opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father , my guardian . Tony , you jug-headed pack-mule ! Ai n't this a free country ' ? What 's become of the so gran ' vaquero ' who nearly wrecked the Rancho Sicamoro when he quit his job ' ? Do n't tell me you 're the same hombre that helped me battle ? " The Texan 's words changed suddenly to an explosive " Damn ! " They were using that razor-edged dagger on his left leg now . Dilliard caught sharp orders in Mariposa 's voice . The cleansing of the wound proceeded more deftly from that point . Castameto was telling Mariposa to leave the room . Mariposa was refusing . Some further argument ensued , before the voices died down and Castameto returned to his discussion with Tony : " You are content , this time , my so gay caballero ? " and Castameto 's tones were sarcasm-edged , " ? to remain with us on the rancho ? " " Si , mi patr  --  n . " Tony sounded very subdued . " So ! It is good  --  perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Si , Se  --  or Patr  --  n . " Teresa and Tony together this time . Castameto growled good-naturedly , " That , at least , Antonio , shows you have arrived at some sound sense in your so-thick head . The girl has a good face . With luck , she may yet make something worth-while of your useless hide , bear you many small ni  --  os . Is it , perhaps , that one is already on the way ? "  | Tony gulped and looked uncertainly at Teresa ; Teresa replied , low-voiced , " No , patr  --  n . " Castameto nodded sagely . " For the present , that is good . Later , no doubt . . . . Now , listen closely , both of you . I will give you comfortable quarters . Come Sunday , the padre is expected to stop here on his journey from Capistrano to El Pueblo de Nuestra Se  --  ora de Los Angeles . He will do that which is necessary . Later , a fiesta may be arranged to celebrate your marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gracias , mi patr  --  n . " A sort of duet from Tony and Teresa . A light-headed snicker escaped Dilliard 's lips . One eye cocked owlishly open . Somehow , the Texan lacked strength to prevent his next words : " Certainly the Americano 's condition will warrant attending your fiesta  --  providing the yellow rose of Monterey also attends  --  no , mi patr  --  n ? " " Que dice el ? " Puzzled , questioning Spanish from old Castameto who did n't understand English . " What does he say ? " Dilliard was suddenly weary . " It does n't matter , " he mumbled thickly , closing his eyes . Once more the black velvet curtain of unconsciousness fell , enveloping the Texan in its thick folds . . . .  | miles to the south , where the ancient herb doctor was wont to use his knowledge of healing plants and roots . The main trouble with Dilliard was loss of blood . A rib had been cracked and a thigh bone slightly furrowed . Both bullets had passed cleanly through flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection had n't set in . And then came the day when the Texan was allowed to rise from his bed and dress , though more than a week followed before he 'd regained his full strength . Teresa played a definite part in the recovery , proving herself a skillful nurse , although , during the period when Dilliard was still delirious , certain matters had been attended to by Mariposa herself , who had insisted that it was her duty to have a hand in the healing of the Americano . Once he had regained full consciousness , however , the se  --  orita had remained absent from the room that had been turned over to the Texan . It was a high-ceilinged room with a heavy oaken bedstead , on the head of which was carved the coat-of-arms of a noble Spanish line . The windows were recessed in thick walls and Many , many days passed , with Branch Dilliard slowly regaining his strength , this being to the credit , largely , of an old Mexican brought in haste from the settlement of San Juan Capistrano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The floor of the room was spread with wild animal skins . Though Mariposa had remained away , Castameto had come in daily , during Dilliard 's convalescence , to inquire about the Texan 's condition . There was something fine about old Salvadore , a touch of the patrician around the chiseled lips and hawk-beak nose . He was proud , dignified , courteous ; his eventoned speech revealed , once or twice , a haughtiness that was entirely natural and clearly revealed where Mariposa had inherited her blue-blooded reserve . Castameto 's dark eyes looked through and into a man , ever on the alert to search out a weakness . Of this last there had n't been any discoveries where Branch Dilliard was concerned ; the patr  --  n had n't been able to uncover anything but straight man . But , always , in their daily conversations , Dilliard had sensed a courteous but persistent probing , as though old Castameto was experiencing difficulty in fitting the Americano into the proper pigeon-hole to which he consigned all gringos . The fact of the matter was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traits Castameto had grown to expect from all Americanos in those early California days . Gradually , reluctantly , Castameto came to accept the Texan as different , though always with certain reservations . And then one day , when Dilliard was feeling himself again ,  | came Castameto 's invitation to inspect the big ranch house and surrounding grounds . The inspection of the place brought a series of revelations to Dilliard . It was constructed of rock and straw-and-adobe bricks , built in the form of a hollow square . Huge timbers , cut in the mountains and hauled down by oxen , gave the house strength and solidity . The roof was covered with tiles from the ovens of Mission San Juan Capistrano , which was situated some miles to the south of the Ranch of the Sycamores . Inside the hollow square of rooms was a gardened patio , open to the blue , California sky . A rockwalled well stood in the center of the patio , surrounded by flowering plants whose seeds and roots had been brought in by the early Spanish settlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spread almost to the eaves of the rooms on all sides . A roofed gallery , or corredor , open to the garden and , with a two-foot-high railing , bordered the inner square all around . The rooms seemed endless to Dilliard  --  bedrooms , a large main room with a fireplace at either end . The roof of the kitchen was like a huge inverted funnel where the smoke , from the fire below , escaped to the outer air , and the walls , in addition to a bristling array of pots and pans and kettles , were strung with lines of vari-colored corn and scarlet chili peppers . One room , the ba  --  o , was equipped with a small sunken plunge for bathers . The main room walls  | were plastered with adobe mixed with goats ' milk to provide a smooth , durable finish . It was a comfortable house of old paintings , heavy furniture of dark wood upholstered in worn red leather . Indian rugs and goatskins were spread in profusion about the floors . All the dishes for the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best to be had . The Rancho Sicamoro was situated at the upper end of Borrego Canyon in a grove of sycamore trees . To the east and south and north were the Santa Ana Mountains . To the west , a wide , fertile valley that stretched many miles to the San Joaquin Hills that ranged along the Pacific Coast , a valley dotted with cattle . There were also horses , sheep and goats on Castameto 's holdings . The house proper held quarters for Castameto 's ranch boss , or mayordomo . Apart from the house were other buildings  --  corrals , shelters for the vaqueros , comfortable huts for married employees , in one of which Teresa and Tony were now domiciled . There was a blacksmith shop , stables , sheds , a kitchen and eating house for the vaqueros . There was even a small carcel , or jail , which had stood empty for many years . Dilliard 's eyes opened wide at all this ; the patr  --  n seemed to be fathering a veritable village . Indians and Mexicans and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked about on their tour of inspection .  | The two had halted near a corral in which were a large number of blooded horses , the sight of which warmed the Texan 's heart . Dilliard rolled a cigarette , leaned against the bars of the corral , his gray eyes taking in the moving scene of activity all around . Castameto chuckled gravely and said , " Well , of what do you think ? " Dilliard shook his head . " I 'm beyond thought , " he replied in Spanish . " You have a small town here . Everything is clean and run with efficiency . How do you do it ? " Castameto shook his head . " We have always done it  --  I and my father before me . Our people are loyal . They realize that we work for their best interests . " He sighed , added , " No , it is not a question of how I do it , Se  --  or Branch , but of how I am to continue doing it . " Dilliard frowned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of that , I may speak more fully later . But this is no time for speaking of trouble . We must all be gay , happy . Tomorrow , we hold the fiesta to celebrate the marriage of Antonio to his beloved Teresa . " Dilliard went to bed that night mentally comparing the Rancho Sicamoro with outfits he had known in Texas . He sighed deeply . The old dons certainly knew how to do things in bang-up fashion . No wonder they resented the coming of Americans  | and American ways , their ever hustling activity , their eternal scratching for gold and land . The Texan 's thoughts turned to Mariposa : for two days now he had n't caught sight of the girl . She was somewhere about the house , he knew , but he was too proud to inquire after her whereabouts , too proud to risk further snubbings . Oh , well , it did n't matter . He 'd be moving on soon , now , returning to his native Texas . The following day would bring the fiesta to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him to stay for that . Dilliard shrugged his shoulders ; another day would n't matter . The day after the fiesta he could saddle up and  --  and Dilliard fell asleep on that thought . But fiesta day had passed all too quickly to suit Dilliard . Contrary to expectations , he had enjoyed the celebration thoroughly . There had been music by a Mexican orchestra of stringed instruments ; fandangos , horse racing and chicken pulling . In a huge pit filled with white-hot embers a beef animal had been barbecued the while a tasty , spicy sauce had been basted over the smoking meat ; wine and aguardiente had been opened . The Texan had entered several of the events ? mainly the horse racing and roping , and he had n't always won . And when he laughed and congratulated the winners , the flashing white teeth of the vaqueros greeted him warmly and they took the Texas gringo to their hearts .  | Mounted on one of Castameto 's horses he had won one race , lost the next by a nose to a wiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was just before the start of the third heat that Dilliard saw Mariposa for the first time that day . The girl was standing , surrounded by a group of her women , face flushed with excitement . For a moment her eyes met Dilliard 's . A hot , choking sensation filled the Texan 's throat . Impulsively , Mariposa had flung to him a yellow rose she held in her hand . Dilliard 's left hand had darted out , snatched the blossom from the air , thrust it inside his shirt . His heart beat madly . Again he tried to reach her gaze , but the girl was looking in another direction . Back of his daughter stood Castameto , a slight frown creasing his dark features . And in that moment , the signal to go was called . The other horses got under way immediately . With an abrupt start , Dilliard came back to his surroundings . A cloud of dust enveloped him from flashing hoofs . Plunging in his spurs , he darted off . One by one he drew abreast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now only one rider held the lead . Tony was two lengths ahead , riding madly . He glanced back , saw Dilliard at his rear , grinned widely . The horses thundered on , around the course , but try as he might , Dilliard 's pony could n't gain an inch . The air was a bedlam of drumming hoofs and excited cries . Dilliard 's horse was straining to the  | utmost but could n't overtake the flashing mount that carried Tony . Rather , he had lost a couple of feet . Again , Tony glanced back . The horses were nearing the finish now . Victory for Tony seemed certain . And then , just as they neared the yelling crowd grouped near the finish , Tony swerved his pony queerly to one side , the beast stumbled and went down , horse and man crashing to the dust . Before he could pull in , Dilliard flashed past the finishing line a winner ! Dilliard pulled his horse to a quick halt and without pausing for the plaudits awaiting the winner , swung back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddle , grinning widely . Horse and man were unhurt . Other contestants flew past . Dilliard reached from his saddle for Tony 's hand , pressed it hard . " You dang jug-head , " he chuckled , " it do n't go down . " " Me , I 'm theenk I 'm go down ver ' hard , " Tony replied innocently . " An ' my caballo as well . " " Chuck it , " Dilliard said , " you know what I mean . Tony , that was your race . You made that horse fall on purpose . I 'm askin ' why . " " It was that gopher hole the horse steps into ? " Dilliard laughed scornfully . " There ai n't a hole in this course , Tony . No more bluffin ' . I want an answer . " Tony shrugged lithe shoulders . " All right , if you  | must hav ' the truth . In the events today , I 'm theenk you win more often if you have your own horse . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can chuck that too . My wounds have healed . I 'm strong as ever . I 'll be ready to leave tomorrow ? " " Se  --  or Branch ! " Tony was suddenly serious . " Maybe , I 'm think to make you ver ' happy to win , then maybe you not be in soch hurry to leave here . I 'm ver ' much regret to see you leave " I do n't see anything more to stay for , Tony . " " I 'm think maybe you are wrong . That is why I 'm stumble-down my horse so you win . I saw certain things . The throwing of a yellow rose . It was not right that the bearer of that rose should lose ? " " Tony ! " Dilliard said eagerly . " Do you think she meant ? ? " Tony eyed Dilliard scornfully . " In many things you are the top man , Se  --  or Branch , but in the matters of love it is you who are the head of the jug ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Hah ! " Tony 's breath was expelled violently , disgustedly . " You have a head like a scorched frijole ! Do you think the se  --  orita threw that rose for the  --  what you call heem ? ? the exercise of the arm ? " There was no time to say more . A crowd of cheering  | men had raced down the track to surround the two . They were lifted from their horses , carried off to partake of the barbecued meat and wine . Tony was grinning like a good-natured gargoyle ; Dilliard 's face was a bronzed study of perplexity . In a group , a short distance away , Mariposa stood with her father . Don Salvadore 's features were grave as he talked to his daughter . Dilliard waited until the girl had turned in his direction , caught her eyes . His hand held the yellow rose she had thrown . Mariposa 's face flushed hotly , her head rose slightly . There was no answering smile for the Texan . Dilliard felt his face crimsoning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exaltation . Tony 's surmises had been wrong . Hell ! This rose was probably thrown to anyone who could catch it . He had been lucky  --  or was it unlucky ? Deliberately , in full view of the girl , Dilliard tossed the yellow rose into the barbecue pit and turned his back . He did n't see the look of pain that dimmed her eyes , as she continued listening , obediently , to her father 's words . The sun was swinging to the west now . Tony and Teresa found Dilliard , carried him off to watch the dancing and hear the music . The two were completely lost in the joy of the moment and in themselves . Dilliard envied the pair , while he watched the Mexicans at play . All of them , all of these men and women were like children in their innocent enjoyment of the patr  --  n 's liberal benevolence.  | Dilliard swore softly under his breath . " They 're like a bunch of overgrown kids , " he muttered . " No thought nor care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motto , I reckon . No wonder the Americanos are stealing them blind , grabbing their lands and cattle from end to end of California . " It grew darker , torches and bonfires leaped into being . The music and dancing continued . Men and women returned to the barbecue pit to partake of steaming meat and chili . Night came suddenly , sprinkling the dark sky with bright starlight . Tony and Teresa were dancing . Mariposa and her father were no longer in sight . Dilliard felt alone and depressed . Well , tomorrow would see him on his way back to Texas . He turned toward the house , pushed through an iron-grated passage that brought him into the peaceful , silent patio . Lights shone from one or two rooms surrounding the patio . It was peaceful here , quiet . The music of the fandangos outside the wall reached the Texan 's ear faintly . He walked to the center of the patio , paused a moment beneath the spreading limbs of the sycamore , to drink thirstily of the clear cold water from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railed gallery leading to the rooms of the house was bordered with yellow poppies . The scent of jasmine was delicately sweet in Dilliard 's nostrils , the air about the patio perfumed with its evening fragrance .  | Dilliard reached the railed corredor and started to step across to the main room of the house . The slightest of movements in the shadow to his left brought him around . He saw Mariposa , lovely in frothy white and with a jet comb high in the coiled masses of pale gold . The Texan laughed softly , " And I was giving that jasmine all the credit . Wrong , after all , was n't I ? " " You  --  you mean about my rose ' ? " the girl asked . " About that too  --  I reckon . " The girl 's words came hard . " You  --  you burned my rose . I saw you " " I 'm thinking I burned more than your rose in that moment . A heap of hopes went up in those flames . " " I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter  --  but I think you do , Se  --  orita Castameto . " The girl came closer , close enough for Dilliard to see her features dimly in the faint starlight that penetrated beneath the roof of the corredor . She said quietly , " Is it necessary  --  the very hateful way in which you utter that " Se  --  orita Castameto ' ? Do you hate me so much ? " " Hate you ! " Dilliard closed his eyes a moment , waiting for a certain unbearable pain to pass . When he opened them he forced his voice to be cold , hard : " You objected to Mary ' . "  | The girl replied low-voiced , trying to make him comprehend , " I did n't understand that day  --  I think there were things neither of us understood . But we seem always to be working at cross-purposes " " They 're not of my making . " " Are you so sure of that point , Se  --  or Branch Dilliard ? I can see my ways are strange to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are different . I ca n't comprehend why you are as you are . " " Do you think we ever will understand each other ? " Dilliard asked tensely . His heart went out of him until he had heard her reply : " I do n't say we wo n't . I 'm learning , learning fast , that all gringos are not alike . " The music , outside the patio , was weaving mysteries in Branch Dilliard 's brain . He took one step toward Mariposa , then halted , stubbornly reluctant to go further . Something relative to his " sights needin ' adjusting " came to him . He steeled himself against repeating a certain error . Suddenly Dilliard bowed and stood aside . " We all make mistakes , se  --  orita , " he said carelessly . " Buenas noches . I 'm figuring to see your father for a few minutes before I turn in . " " I know . He 's waiting for you in the sala . He told me you plan to leave tomorrow morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to speak , changed her mind , asked , almost to herself , " I wonder why you ever came to California ? "  | Dilliard laughed easily . " Nothing much to that . I crossed a herd over the Colorado three years back . I only stayed a week after delivering the cows , but that week was enough ; I got a bite of California that stuck in my craw . Could n't get rid of it . I returned a month ago to find out if there was anythin ' to it . " " And have you learned ? " Dilliard 's laugh was n't quite so easy this time . " I 've learned to wonder if I ever will get it out of my craw . Mariposa did n't fumble the meaning back of that . " Would it do any good , " she asked lightly , " to suggest that you stay until you 're certain ? " Dilliard 's voice shook a trifle , " You 're asking that ? " " My father would like to know you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I think Tony and Teresa would miss you . " Dilliard swore softly to himself . Again , memory of a certain mistake in his " lead throwin ' " prevented him from speaking the thought in his mind , insisting that the girl drop all evasion . From inside the house came inquiring words from old Salvadore Castameto , " Are you out there , Se  --  or Dilliard ? " " Si , Se  --  or Castameto . I 'll be right in . " Dilliard turned back to find the girl had vanished .  | He caught a brief glimpse of a white , lacy dress disappearing , wraith-like , through a doorway farther down the corredor . His mind in a turmoil , Dilliard swung back to the doorway , saying , " I 'm coming , Se  --  or Castameto. "  | As Dilliard entered the big room , Castameto came up out of a high-backed chair , before the fireplace of the sala , to greet him . A similar chair stood nearby , facing the flames , and between the two chairs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant glow through the long room . A servant entered , bearing wine , thin glasses and a long , narrow cedar box of cigarros . Castameto spoke a few words to the servant . The wine was poured and gleamed like topaz in its fragile containers . There was but little conversation at first . Dilliard settled himself in the comfortable depths of his high-backed chair to enjoy the wine and fragrant tobacco . After a few minutes the servant passed to their rear and withdrew . Music from the fiesta still faintly penetrated the silences of the room . Dilliard said at last , " The fiesta was a huge success . " He spoke in Spanish , the patr  --  n neither speaking , nor understanding , the English tongue . " I enjoyed myself hugely at the celebration . " " Probably it is the last ever to be given on the Rancho Sicamoro , " Castameto said . He corrected himself hastily , " That is , by a Castameto . " Dilliard evinced a certain surprise at this and said as much . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | need to dwell on my troubles . Cattle are nearly finished in California . The drought of ' 64 wiped out most of the large ranchos . Many large holdings have been lost to ? " he paused , then , " ? to newcomers to this land . Many of the invaders have entered into agriculture , knowing it is useless to run beef stock . Many of my friends have lost their places and returned to Mexico and Spain , leaving only hate in this California where they were raised and where their fathers were raised . " Dilliard said , a trifle uncomfortably , " Anyway , you 've still retained your place . " " So far , what you say is true . I have been fortunate  --  to some extent . A goodly half of my cattle have been disposed of . By paring expenses to the bone , and with the aid of sheep , I have managed to hold the old place together . " Dilliard predicted , " Cattle prices will return to normal one of these days . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in . " Stock prices are down . Only a miracle will restore them . " The iron-gray head drooped a bit sadly , lifted again . " You may find it extremely difficult to believe I have seen a herd of fifty thousand cattle sold for less than a peso a head . That took place at Santa Barbara , not so many years back . I witnessed the sight of ten thousand more head being driven over the bluffs into the sea that the pasturage might be conserved for sheep . " Dilliard said , shocked , " Good God ! "  | " It is true , Se  --  or Branch . The dry years have ruined the cattle raisers . Cattle must have food . When the rains fail us , the grass does n't come . The past ten years have been a continual struggle  --  some years worse than others , of course . Five summers ago , when all was parched and brown and the ribs of the cattle stretched tight their hides , we drove to the Mojave Desert for our grazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulously . " Grazing  --  in a desert ? " Castameto smiled sadly . " All around us cattle were dying , dropping to earth , finished . Flies , like black clouds , droned over the range . All of my neighbors were wiped out . Day by day , I watched my herds dwindle , powerless to do anything . Then , I happened to think of the Mojave River which flows through the desert . " " And you got water in the desert ? " " It was grass the cattle required . There was enough of water to get by on , at the water holes and at small streams . But there was no grass . Everyone said I was crazy , that there would n't be enough water in the Mojave River " " But there was enough , eh ? " Castameto smiled . " The river had dried up , but I 'd been fortunate enough to think of something else . Beneath that cracked surface of the river bed , deep down , a certain moisture had been preserved ? enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It meant making daily drives for the grazing ,  | then a return from the desert to the nearest water . " Castameto ended abruptly , " That year I saved many cattle I had expected to lose . " Dilliard whistled softly . " I want to meet the man who claims the Americanos have all the enterprise . Why , you played a hundred to one shot  --  and won ! " " Won only temporarily . I brought my herd through that season . That winter , rain was more plentiful . " Castameto sighed , " Yes , sometimes I have ideas . Even now , were conditions different , I could profit with my stock . But the Americanos increase daily with their land projects and agriculture . Most of the large holdings have been broken up within the past few years and resold to grangers . The movement has n't spread to Southern California completely yet , but with travel increasing by rail across the continent , the end is n't far off . " " It may take longer than you think . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , already there is talk of the Southern Pacific laying rails to El Pueblo de Los Angeles , southward from Yerba Buena . " The old man still clung persistently to San Francisco 's earlier name . " What think you such a railroad will mean to this part of the country , in particular to the old ranchos ? " The answer to that one was clear in Dilliard 's mind , but he sidestepped the issue , changing the subject slightly , " Speaking of railroads across the continent , I 've wondered why you had the Se  --  orita  | Castameto travel by ship from New England , rather than by the steam-cars . Much time could have been saved . " Castameto drew thoughtfully on his cigarro , then explained grimly , " The ships sailing on either side of the isthmus are owned by friends  --  wealthy Spanish folk . The railroads are operated by gringos ? your pardon , se  --  or  --  Americanos . I am not entirely persuaded to ? " Castameto broke off , his tones softening , asking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any route , Mariposa could not have arrived in time for the funeral of her brother . Anyway , that part must be now put away , forgotten if possible . Only today I told Mariposa she must put off mourning . The fiesta furnished a good excuse , Se  --  or Dilliard , it all comes to one point : I wanted Mariposa here for my last days . " " May they be many years ' distant , " Dilliard said courteously , sipping the topaz wine . Castameto glanced shrewdly at the Texan . " Almost , " the old man said , " I am sometimes persuaded you Are a Spaniard at heart . You have the language as good as mine ; in addition , you know the correct phrases to use at the proper times . And then , when I am almost convinced , I hear you speak strange words in that barbaric Americano tongue whose syllables come so fast to my ears , and I know that there can never be any common ground upon which Spaniard and Anglo may meet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quien sabe ? " " True . Who knows ? But I do not think so . " Silence fell between the two . The flames in the fireplace crackled and roared . Castameto refilled the wine glasses . Finally he said grimly , " So far as concerns my last days being many years ' distant , I thank you for the thought , but I see plainly you have n't knowledge of recent local history  --  but enough of that . Let us talk of yourself . I want to say that I regret sincerely that you are departing tomorrow . " The old man 's smile broadened , " Do you know , I never thought to see the day when I would speak such words to an Americano . But you are different , Se  --  or Dilliard . " Dilliard thanked him , adding , " There 's a heap more of us , Don Salvadore . " " Doubtless , " dryly , as though the subject were open to considerable argument . " It occurs to me again that I have never sufficiently thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unnecessary , " Dilliard said . " I will admit though to a curiosity regarding the abduction . I 've always felt there was more to that than just the matter of ransom ? " " Which , thanks to you , was never paid ? " " Do n't forget Tony and Teresa . " " Those good ones too I shall never forget . . . . Oh , yes , I would have paid a ransom had it been necessary . The man named Corill who accompanied  | the carriage when the Mexican girl was abducted ? it was he who brought me the news , stating he had been informed the Se  --  orita Mariposa would be returned safely in exchange for a certain sum of gold . That scoundrel . Then he departed , so villainously confident , saying he would return for the money . " " I heard something of the kind . Good for him he did n't return . " The servant entered again , leaned toward Castameto to speak . Dilliard caught from the low-voiced tones two names : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glancing at Castameto , the Texan saw that the old man had gone white and drawn . After a moment , Castameto nodded reluctantly to the servant , saying , " Allow them to come in . " The servant disappeared . Castameto turned to Dilliard . " Visitors from El Vaca , " he stated , drawing himself up rigidly . " I 'll leave you alone . " Dilliard rose . " Wait ! " Castameto pressed Dilliard back in the chair . " Do n't go . I hope to dispose of them shortly . They are very unwelcome visitors . " " Just as you say . " Dilliard sank back in the highbacked chair , his eyes asking questions of the leaping flames in the fireplace . He wondered what Drake Scabbard wanted  --  and the man named Fustian who accompanied Scabbard . There 'd been a breath of death in old Castameto 's tones when he had asked Dilliard not to go . Something serious was afoot , no doubt on that score .  | Castameto rounded the chairs , walked to the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments of silence , then loud voices at an outer doorway . The servant entered , leading Scabbard and the other man  --  so Dilliard judged . From the spot at which he was seated , he could n't see the rest of the room , nor could anyone else see the Texan . Castameto 's voice was stiffly courteous , " Se  --  or Scabbard , Se  --  or Fustian . Can I do anything for you ? " Then to the servant , " No , it is not necessary to remain . You may go . " Dilliard caught the departing servant 's footfalls , then a loud , roaring voice in execrable Spanish , " Evenin ' , Castameto . We just figured to drop in and see why we were n't invited to this fiesta you 're holding . " " The fiesta was for friends . " Castameto 's words were like chilled steel . " You must remember , Bart , " came Scabbard 's cold tones , " that Se  --  or Castameto has no particular love for us gringos right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . Is n't that so , Se  --  or Castameto ? " Scabbard 's Spanish was passably good . Castameto replied , " I 'm not so sure that I am mistaken , Se  --  or Scabbard . " Scabbard 's insulting laugh brought a ruffling of the hair at the back of Dilliard 's neck . In English , Bart Fustian said , " I heard there was an American stayin ' here now . " Scabbard replied in the same language , " Forget  | it , Bart . Castameto 's alone here now . That 's all we care about . Do n't forget we got important business ahead . " Castameto could n't understand this last exchange . He remained standing stiffly before the two , near the doorway , while the conversation in their own tongue was taking place between Scabbard and Fustian . Dilliard 's chair was placed with its high back to the room . The top of the chair reached well above Dilliard 's head . Neither of the two Americanos near the outer doorway could see the Texan ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room . Dilliard heard Fustian say in English , " Sure looks like the old buzzard is alone , all right , Drake . " " We 're playing in luck . " Scabbard added in Spanish , " The rest of your household is outside , enjoying the fiesta , I suppose . " Castameto replied , " The fiesta is nearly finished , se  --  or . I was about to go to my bed , shortly . If you have business to talk over , let us get on with it . " Moving cautiously , Dilliard peered around the edge of his high-backed chair , took in the two figures facing Castameto . Bart Fustian was a bulky-shouldered individual with closely-set eyes beneath his droop-brim felt sombrero . A gun hung at his right hip . He wore black trousers tucked into knee boots . Drake Scabbard looked about as he had when Dilliard had talked to him in the cantina in Santa Lozana.  | Somehow , the whole set-up did n't look good to the Texan . He settled noiselessly back in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scabbard was urging certain prompt actions on the old man , which Castameto protested against . Scabbard was saying , " . . . and I insist that 's the only way you 'll have a chance , Castameto . It means the scaffold , surely , if you do n't let me handle the business in my own way . I want to be your friend . I 've done my best to show you I 'm friendly . I 'll admit , right now , things do n't look any too secure , but you leave things to me and they 'll all come out right in the end . " " And I say no ' , " Castameto replied quietly , dignified dislike in his tones . " That is all . I bid you a very good evening , senors . " Bart Fustian laughed raucously . In English , " Drake , I told you it would n't work . He 's throwin ' us out . It 's a showdown . No time like the present . I 'll be ready when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . " " Better edge around behind the old fool , " Scabbard answered . His voice was even , cool-toned . In Spanish , he said to Castameto , " It 's good evening then , Se  --  or Castameto . I 'm sorry you wo n't reconsider . It would be safest . " " No ! " Anger tinged Castameto 's single word of refusal . Scabbard yawned , said wearily to Fustian , " I  | reckon you might as well let him have it , Bart . He 's damned stubborn . We can put a gun in his hand Dilliard lost the next few words . He heard three quick footsteps , then came quickly , quietly , up from the depths of the high-backed chair . He was n't noticed at first . Scabbard stood near the door , Judaseyes smiling coldly in Castameto 's face . Behind Castameto and a trifle to one side , Bart Fustian was just in the act of raising his long-barreled cap-andball pistol !  | A sudden , loud warning was ripped from Dilliard 's throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said , " Cripes A'mighty ! Dilliard ! " Fustian lowered his gun , turned swiftly . There came a clattering of chairs and tables as Dilliard charged swiftly along the room . He was unarmed ; the safest way was to get in close . Fustian swore , raised his gun toward the Texan . Scabbard shouted something just before Dilliard closed in . Fustian 's gun crashed loudly in the room . Dilliard felt burning powder scorch his left cheek . There was a moment of black desperation as Dilliard grappled with Fustian . The man was too big , too powerful , to be handled easily . Their locked bodies swayed about the room , struck violently against a heavy oaken table . " Get him , Drake , dammit , get him ! " Fustian panted . Scabbard cursed and yelled advice to Fustian that had to do with holding Dilliard quiet . But the two men were moving too fast for Scabbard to take careful aim . Castameto was facing Scabbard , his eyes hard on the derringer in Scabbard 's right fist , alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot .  | Dilliard jerked partially free . His right fist thudded twice into Fustian 's middle . Fustian grunted and gave pace before the Texan 's savage onslaught . Dilliard 's fingers were groping for Fustian 's gun hand now ; grimly he concentrated on that muscular right arm . Fustian 's curses were coming through set lips , as he struggled to throw off the relentless Texan . But Dilliard clung like a leech , his left hand locked about Fustian 's gun-wrist , his right seeking a hold at Fustian 's throat . Fustian roared like a maddened bull . The roar ceased suddenly , as he almost went to his knees . He flung his huge form to one side , carrying Dilliard with him . Dilliard hung on like grim death , digging his fingers into Fustian 's throat . His hold tightened . Fustian commenced to give ground . Dilliard dug his head into the huge chest , panting , sobbing for breath . He tightened his grip on Fustian 's right wrist . For an instant Fustian steeled his muscles to resist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he uttered a cry of pain . The gun dropped from his outstretched hand . Dilliard stepped quickly back , the old fighting grin twisting his lips . Fustian 's face was crimson with rage . Snarling , he came in with a rush which Dilliard sidestepped . As he lunged past , Dilliard struck out with all of  | the strength at his command . Fustian stumbled , tried to save himself from falling . Dilliard spun around , hit him a second time  --  and a third . For one brief instant Fustian swayed erect , then he pitched forward . Dilliard saw his head strike the corner of a table before he crashed down across a goatskin rug and lay silent . The Texan whirled to face Drake Scabbard , then stopped short to discover servants and several vaqueros crowding in from the patio . Mariposa pushed through the knot of men , looking very white . Her slim form was covered from throat to toes in a long yellow shawl of silk . Drake Scabbard stood at one side , the derringer still clutched in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resentment . Castameto was speaking stern , cutting words . After a time , Dilliard caught Scabbard 's words of attempted explanation : " . . . you 're mistaken , Castameto . You should have told us there was another man in the room . Doubtless when Dilliard rushed out , Bart was startled into drawing his gun " Fustian 's gun was out before I got into it , Scabbard , " Dilliard panted hotly . " You 're trying to make trouble , Dilliard ? " Scabbard snapped . " I stopped some , " the Texan jerked out . " If your intentions were peaceful , what 's your gun doing out ? " Scabbard laughed insolently . " I did n't recognize  | you , at first . I did n't know what was up . I was ready to protect myself . There was no reason for you to jump Fustian that way . It could all have ended peacefully . " Dilliard said , " That 's a lie and you know it . If I had n't moved fast , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " scornfully . " You 're crazy , Dilliard . " " I 'm not crazy enough to put any faith in anything you say . I heard your conversation with Fustian , when you first come in . You planned to kill ? " " Oh , cripes ! You 're crazier'n a hoot-owl , Dilliard , " Scabbard said wearily . The room was ringed with wide-eyed vaqueros . Mariposa had retired to the fireplace and stood , anxiously , watching the men . Castameto said , " Se  --  or Dilliard , you have met this man before ? " Dilliard nodded , " Talked to him a spell in Santa Lozana  --  the night before the attempted abduction of your daughter . " " So ? " Castameto nodded sagely . " No doubt he was in Santa Lozana to arrange that abduc-tion ? " " That 's a lie ! " Scabbard scowled . He half-raised the derringer in his hand . Dilliard reached forward , caught Scabbard 's  | wrist . " If you want to keep that gun , put it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Scabbard shrugged his shoulders . Dilliard released Scabbard 's arm . The gun disappeared in a pocket of the man 's long-tailed coat . Fustian 's gun still lay on the floor , not far from the body of its unconscious owner . One of the vaqueros stepped forward and placed it on a table . Dilliard said , " I suppose you do n't know anything about that abduction , eh , Scabbard ? " " Not a thing , " Scabbard said flatly . " Of course , I heard an attempt of that sort had taken place . I did n't pay any attention to it , though . " " Where 'd you hear that ? " Dilliard asked . " I do n't remember . Rumors get around . I told you I did n't pay any particular attention . " Suddenly anger got the better of Scabbard 's usually cautious reason . " I 'm asking what you know about it , Dilliard . " The Texan laughed softly . " Could n't resist your curiosity , eh , Scabbard ? Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two coyotes named Bisbee and Corill planning that job . I had a hand in the rescue , if you want to know . To cut it short , Scabbard , if you were the one that planned that job  --  and I think you were , though I do n't yet know why  --  I 'm the man who spilled your beans ! Is that what you 're itchin ' to know ? " Scabbard 's face had gone white . He said nervously , " You 're talking in riddles . I do n't give a  | hang who engineered that job , nor do I care . I know I had nothing to do with it . Why should I want to carry off the old man 's daughter ? What your part was , matters not the slightest to me . " " Your bluff do n't go down , Scabbard . " " I 'm not bluffing , Texas man . I do n't care whether you believe me or not . If you think you can make something of it , why not appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvadore . Maybe he will . " Dilliard turned to the old Spaniard , rapidly translated the talk that had taken place . When he had finished , Castameto slowly shook his head . " Not yet , Se  --  or Dilliard . The nearest law officer is at El Vaca . Drake Scabbard controls El Vaca . Everything would be against us . " Scabbard laughed triumphantly . " You see , Texas man . You could n't even get started , if you tried to buck me . " " I 'm not so sure of that , " Dilliard snapped . " There 's other law-officers . El Vaca ca n't hold all the law . " " It holds enough to control the country hereabouts , " Scabbard chuckled coldly . " Cripes , Dilliard , ca n't you realize what you 're up against ? Look here , you and I started off on the wrong foot in Santa Lozana . I intimated it would n't be healthy for you to come to El Vaca . I remember we had words . Well , maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have made a mistake in  | judging you . I 'll reopen my offer . Come to El Vaca . I 'll make it worth your while Dilliard laughed softly . " Is that your way of trying to prevent me from putting the law on your tail , Scabbard ? " Scabbard said carelessly , " Sure , if you want to put it that way . " " You got a nerve , Scabbard ? " Dilliard was amazed at the scoundrel 's effrontery , " ? admittin ' that much here . " Scabbard smiled coldly . " Certainly , I 've got nerve . That 's how I run El Vaca . For that matter , I 've admitted nothing . It 's your word against mine . I could swear you were a liar , and who could prove differently ? " Dilliard said dryly , " You and I are n't the only ones in this room . " Scabbard 's reply held contempt , " These people do n't matter , Texas man . Do n't you understand that white men run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know , Scabbard , I got a notion to show you these folks do count . I sort of owe it to my blood to stop you  --  and stop you in a hurry . " " Do n't be a fool , Dilliard . You 'd make very little headway . I do n't hold grudges . Let 's be friends . You come to El Vaca tomorrow . I pay good money for keen minds " And for killer 's bullets , I 'm taking it , " Dilliard said coldly .  | Scabbard 's black eyebrows raised slightly . " You 're missing my point , Texas man . What I 'm trying to make you understand is , it 's more profitable to work for Drake Scabbard than against him ? and not half so dangerous . " " Is that a threat ? " Scabbard shrugged his shoulders . " Suit yourself . I 'm giving you your last chance . Come to El Vaca and ? " " Nope ! " Branch shook his head . " I like it here . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer these greasers ? " sneeringly . " To Americano scum , " Dilliard nodded . Scabbard 's dead-white features momentarily crimsoned with anger , then he controlled his anger and turned away , forcing a cold laugh . " You 've had your chance , feller . Do n't blame me for what happens . " " I 'd advise you not to let anything happen , " Dilliard said warningly . Scabbard had no reply for that . He glanced down at the floor where Bart Fustian was commencing to stir into life , then , turning coolly to Castameto , asked for help . Castameto called two of the vaqueros to carry Fustian outside and place him on his horse . Scabbard paused a moment before leaving , his eyes baleful on Dilliard 's . " You 're a stranger around here , Texas , " he said in chilly accents . " You better learn right now that men in this country do n't buck  | Drake Scabbard . Take my advice and get back to Texas as fast as you can . Otherwise , you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dilliard nodded , " is pretty plain . I 'm warned now . Well , even a rattler warns before striking . " He paused , adding , " And I 'm plumb sure you 're no different than a rattler . " " We 're both poison , " Scabbard agreed lightly , and stepped outside , flinging back , " to those that buck us . " Of the people left in the room , only Mariposa , and Tony , who stood to one side , understood the import of the words that had passed between Dilliard and the Texan . To the girl and the vaquero , Scabbard 's threats seemed to seal Dilliard 's death warrant . Tony was worried , started forward to speak to Dilliard as the sounds of Scabbard 's and Fustian 's horses were heard moving outside the house . The two vaqueros returned . In the patio a clamoring of voices filled the air . Castameto spoke shortly , " You men can leave now . Go out , silence your women . Tell them all is well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or Dilliard . " The vaqueros and servants started toward the door , Tony flinging tragic glances toward Dilliard . Outside , the hoofbeats were dying away . In a few moments , except for Mariposa , Castameto and the  | Texan , the big room was once more empty of humanity . Mariposa came close to Dilliard , so close that he caught the faint fragrance that always seemed to hover about the girl . All the color was drained from her face , her dark eyes were wide with fear . " You  --  you understand what Scabbard 's words mean ? " she asked tremulously . " I reckon , " Dilliard nodded . " Are you sure you understand completely ? That it will mean death to stay here now ? " Dilliard replied quietly , " I understood completely . But I 'm not so sure Scabbard will be able to carry out his threats . " " Se  --  or Branch ! " A half sob tightened the girl 's throat . " I was wrong to suggest that you delay your departure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to leave in the morning , as early as possible . " A whimsical smile twisted Dilliard 's lips . " It 's too late now , " he said softly . " You see , this California country 's got a call to it . I 'm plumb curious to see more . " " No , no ! " Mariposa 's hand caught at his sleeve . Castameto had been watching the two . " Mariposa , " he cut in quietly , " at this hour you should be in your room . " The girl 's eyes held , pleading , to Dilliard 's a moment longer , before they dropped under the burning intensity of his gaze . Then she turned and passed slowly from the room .  | Castameto crossed the floor in quick strides , hand outstretched in nearly complete acceptance of the gringo . " Friend  --  good friend , " he said simply .  | " It is difficult for a stranger , " Don Salvadore was saying , " to realize the fiend that dwells in Drake Scabbard 's black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " Dilliard nodded , " just before he left this room . It was like a hot foul breath , seeping into everything it touched . I do n't underestimate him . I know he 'll hit low when necessary . " The two men had returned to their chairs before the fireplace . Fresh logs had been stacked on the flames . The big house was wrapped in the silence that comes with the second hour after midnight . Candles in their wrought iron standards burned with a slow , steady flame . The farther end of the long room was in dim shadow . Dilliard 's eyes were weaving pictures in the leaping flames , pictures that had to do with a slim white figure in a shawl of yellow silk . The firelight gleamed in the topaz wine Dilliard held , bringing a warm glow of liquid light to the center of the fragile glass . Castameto was speaking again . Dilliard reluctantly gave over his thoughts , jerked himself to attention to hear the words . " Once , " Castameto was saying bitterly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there can ever be friendship between a Spaniard and a gringo . It has made me  | suspicious . Perhaps you 'll be good enough to realize my feelings ? " " But , Don Salvadore ? " " Wait , amigo . I have already admitted that you are different . You 've proved yourself . Scabbard never did . It 's not many years back . I tried to meet the new order , saw that conditions were changing . It was for that I consented to allow Mariposa to be educated at one of your eastern schools , though since I have regretted my decision . But I thought I was doing my best to conform to changing standards . I wanted to be a good neighbor to the Americanos who were coming ? " " That is the best way . " " I 'm not so sure . I tried to adapt myself , did my best to treat with Drake Scabbard on equal grounds . " " I judge Scabbard has considerable power . " " Power ! Poder de Dios ! I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king in El Vaca . " " What sort of a town is El Vaca ' ? I have never been there . " " It is Scabbard 's stronghold . He built it himself , such as it is . It lies less than ten miles from here , as the crow flies , just beyond the line of my holdings . There he has built himself wealth , but few genuine friends . Money buys his companions . The man is a devil , quick to employ gunfire at the slightest offense . He is surrounded by hired killers . " " But what of the law ' ? Is there no law there ' ? "  | Castameto scowled . " Law ! " disgustedly . " Gringo law ! There is a deputy sheriff and a juez de paz ? justice of the peace . Both are miserable rascals , and both were appointed with the influence of Scabbard 's gold . The early residents of this country have no say in the administering of the law . Mexicans and Spaniards seek justice in vain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hirelings . Any wonder I have only hate for los gringos ? " " There is more to your own story , of course ? " " True . It commences with Ramon 's death  --  Mariposa 's brother  --  a matter of nine months back . Ramon never had the steadiness of his sister . Where Mariposa is reasoning , intelligent , Ramon was wild , stubborn  --  but a lovable son for all that , with a thorough understanding of his inheritance and what was expected of him . In the young there is always the crop of wild oats to be sown . Can you understand a boy of that kind ? " Dilliard nodded . " One can break a wild horse , but not tame him until his spirit has run its course , ' " he quoted . " Exactly , " Castameto said gratefully . " You understand . " The old man sighed . " So it was with Ramon . He was but a boy , but gaming and wining were in his blood . I thought to give him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him run free , until the time came when such pleasures had exhausted his interest . All might have been different , had his mother lived , but I was rearing Ramon in the only  | way I knew . If I failed , it was only through ignorance . " " You have not failed with Mariposa , " Dilliard pointed out . Castameto frowned slightly . " Of that I am not yet sure . Of late , she shows a tendency to follow her own inclinations , with no thought of my commands . But always , in the end , she has obeyed . As yet , nothing serious has arisen . When it does ? well , I trust she 'll remember her breeding . " Dilliard wondered what difference had passed between the two , wondered if it referred to himself . He remained silent , waiting for Don Salvadore to continue . Castameto went on , " But to Ramon . . . . There was a girl in El Vaca whom Ramon and other young men were in the habit of visiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Ramon was headstrong , disregarded my words . One night a quarrel ensued between Ramon and a young gringo , one Lucas Reardon . The quarrel had to do with the girl 's favors . This girl was  --  well , her type does n't matter . Perhaps you have guessed . Anyway , she was the sort that glories in fights over herself . A short time later , Lucas Reardon shot Ramon between the shoulder blades , when Ramon was leaving this girl 's house . " " That sounds like murder . " " It was sheer murder ! This Lucas Reardon fancied himself as a gun hand . He had always  | boasted of his prowess in accurate and swift shooting . Well , I appealed to the law at El Vaca . As I have mentioned , Drake Scabbard controls the law in that town . Scabbard promised to arrange for the arrest of Lucas Reardon , but two weeks dragged past with Reardon still at large and bragging of his killing . I appealed a second time to Scabbard . Scabbard put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Americano . After all , an Americano had killed a greaser . So ran sentiment in El Vaca . Why bother to punish anyone ? Ramon Castameto was only a greaser . " The bitter irony in the old man 's voice was making Dilliard ashamed of his own race . Castameto continued . " As I was leaving Scabbard 's office , I came face to face with Lucas Reardon on the single dirty street of El Vaca , and he laughed openly at my distress . " The old man paused , apologetically spreading his hands . " Perhaps all of my hot blood had n't descended to Ramon . It may have been wrong , though I 'm not sure that it was . I challenged Lucas Reardon to meet me in fair fight . He accepted my challenge as a joke , swearing he would shoot me down before I could put finger to trigger . Finally , after considerable jeering at my expense , he consented to meet me . We used guns , at fifteen paces , on that dirty street in El Vaca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no man of my own race daring to lift his voice . "  | " You hit Reardon ' ? " " I killed him , " Castameto said coldly . " Oh , he was faster than I. He shot twice . I pulled trigger but once . But my hand was the steadier of the two . Reardon dropped , wounded . The doctor who attended him pronounced he would live , but that night Reardon 's wound opened and he bled to death with no one near to save him . " " To me , that seems good . He had it coming . " " Perhaps , " Castameto admitted grudgingly . " The duel had cooled my blood . I was glad I had only wounded Lucas Reardon . I do not like the thought of taking a man 's life . But then he died in the night . . . . Now , look you , Se  --  or Branch , a great outcry was raised ! There was talk of a lynching . Ah ! The situation had changed : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still insist Reardon had it coming . " " That was not the question , " Castameto said bitterly . " I was arrested , taken to the jail . Bail was set at fifty thousand dollars ? " " Whew ! " Dilliard whistled softly . " That 's a lot . " " True . The Americano law called for less , but the justice of the peace established that figure and I had no recourse . After all , what is Americano law when applied to a greaser ' ? Drake Scabbard , in friendly guise , offered aid . As I have told you , there is no longer money in cattle . I had not the necessary  | fifty thousand dollars . Scabbard loaned me the necessary sum . " " With your right eye as security ? " " Ah , the security ! I was forced to turn over to Drake Scabbard the land grant awarded my family by the Spanish King . In addition , I was made to deed Rancho Sicamoro to Scabbard . You see , " sarcastically , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . And besides I had thought of Scabbard as a friend . " " Do I understand , " Dilliard said indignantly , " that Drake Scabbard now owns this rancho ? " " Papers were drawn up . Scabbard can call upon me for the money at any time with only two weeks ' notice . If , at the end of two weeks , I do not return the money loaned me , Scabbard retains the deed and my land grant . " " Has the deed been registered by Scabbard ? " " Not as yet , for a wonder . He is so confident of securing my property . " Dilliard 's eyes narrowed . " I suspect the attempted abduction of Se  --  orita Mariposa had something to do with all this . " " Doubtless you are correct . Had the plan been successful , the abductors could have demanded , as ransom , the amount of my bail money . I should have been forced to surrender it , return to jail , in order to gain her freedom . Once I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit his own ends . "  | " You suspect Scabbard of engineering the abduction , of course . " " And so do you , Se  --  or Branch . " Castameto smiled thinly . " Proof , we both know , is lacking , so we can not punish him for it . " Dilliard frowned . " But why should Scabbard be so eager to place you in jail ? " " To prevent my raising the money to repay his loan . You see , there is a slim chance that I may get some money from another source . For the present Scabbard does not want that loan repaid . He has his eyes on greater gain . " " You say he already has great wealth . " " Never so much as he desires . Let me explain . There is much talk of the Santa Fenicia Railroad building through this state . The proposed rail line would run directly through my property  --  almost straight down from the town of Santa Ana to Capistrano . " " I 'm commencing to see light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the price Scabbard could demand of the railroad people were he to own , outright , the Rancho Sicamoro ? I , of course , shall refuse to sell a right-of-way to the railroad people if they continue with their plans , and if it is within my power to do so , but Scab-bard ? " " Scabbard is playing for high stakes . This all sounds not so good , Don Salvadore . " " I am facing that fact , and more , " the old man  | stated grimly . " A few days before you arrived here , Scabbard came with a request that in order to hold my loan , I must deed over to him all of my cattle and horses and sheep ? " " In addition to the land and buildings ? " " You find it incredible , but it is so . " " The dirty , hoggish , thievin ' son ! " Castameto did n't understand the American slang , but he caught the import of the words . He bowed , saying , " I evaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , see if there were any other way . Tonight , he came  --  he and Fustian  --  to demand his answer , claiming he must have greater security on such a loan . I told him no ' , as you heard . And so now he insists on the return of his fifty thousand dollars in the two weeks ' time as stipulated by the paper that was drawn up . " " It looks as though you were caught in a trap , " Dilliard frowned . " I ca n't see why he would have had Fustian kill you tonight . " " Ah , my death would have simplified matters . Scabbard could have gained much quicker control of the things he wants , had Fustian succeeded in murdering me . They could have put a gun in my hand , claimed it had been necessary to fire in selfdefence . They thought I was alone , with no one near . With me dead and Scabbard holding the deed and grant to my property , they could have forged other necessary papers to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any protest that  | Mariposa might make would be futile . Do you see now ? " " I see , " Dilliard growled , " that we must stop Scabbard , or Scabbard will be running this whole country . But  --  how to do it ? There 's the rub ! " " Wait ! You have n't heard all yet . There is more . A short time back I arranged to sell a herd of cattle to raise the money to repay Scabbard . " " You have n't been idle then ? " " No credit is due to my industry . " Castameto frowned , " I still do not quite understand . Had the offer to buy not come from an old friend , Don Alvaro Serrano , I should have mistrusted it . " " Where is this Don Alvaro Serrano ? " " In San Diego . Years ago he had a small rancho , not very far from my holdings . The drought ruined him , he sold his property and left for San Diego . Suddenly , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be willing to sell him cattle . The price he offered took my breath away . Look you , Se  --  or Branch , it is fully two dollars higher than the standard now paid in California . I do not understand it . " " Cows bring almost twice that in Texas at present  --  some parts of Texas  --  though it 's good , that I admit . " " These days in California , " Castameto said earnestly , " it is unheard of . Think , I have seen cattle sell for less than a peso the head and not so many years back . I can not think what Don Alvaro  | is up to , but he assured me the money could and would be paid . Perhaps it is that he has taken land near San Diego and plans to raise beef  --  it may be wealthy relatives have died and left him money . He had relatives in Barcelona , in Spain . Still , if he planned to raise beef , why should he stipulate only sleek beeves in the shipment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , how ? " " Merely a figure of speech . The cattle must be gathered and driven to San Diego for delivery . Scabbard will do everything in his power to prevent our making that drive " " How did Scabbard get wind of it ? Did you tell him ? " Castameto shook his head . " On the contrary . I 've tried to keep the business secret , but evidently the word leaked out . It may be news crept up from San Diego . . . . But no matter . You know now why Scabbard is demanding the deed to my stock . He 'll do his utmost to prevent my closing the sale . And time presses . Even were I successful , I 'd still have to come to trial for the death of Lucas Reardon , but at least I could save Rancho Sicamoro for Mariposa . " The old man 's face was gray with worry . " Ah , poder de Dios ! If there were but one among the Americanos whom I could trust , one who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Salvadore , " Dilliard said warmly . Castameto smiled wearily . " I understand what you mean , Se  --  or Branch . Your heart is good . But I referred to an Americano with influence in the courts of law . " " Look here , " Dilliard said earnestly , " get it through your head that I want a hand in lickin ' this Scabbard coyote . I ai n't got any influence , but perhaps there 's another way . We can dope it all out . Your luck 's due for a switch-over . With half a chance I figure we can beat him yet Dilliard paused suddenly , laughing at the look of perplexity in Castameto 's dark eyes . It occurred to him abruptly that , carried away by his enthusiasm , he 'd been speaking in English . Swiftly he repeated the words in Spanish . Castameto 's eyes widened . " But  --  but you leave in the morning . Your plans are made . " Dilliard laughed . " Have n't you already seen how fast we gringos can change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , do you think I 'd go away , leaving you to fight a situation of this kind , when I might just as well stay and lend a hand ? " " You 'd join with me ? " Castameto said slowly , as though he could n't believe his ears . " Be one of us  --  against the Americanos ? " Unbelief , incredulity was evident in every word . " To the last ditch . Sure . Why not ? " " But  --  but , Se  --  or Branch . You  --  you are of the  | gringo race ? " Voice failed the old Spaniard for a moment , then , his words coming in a hot rush , " You would n't dare ! You 'd be fighting men of your own blood ? " " Would n't dare ? " Dilliard 's easy laugh filled the room . " I 'm eager to try it . Men of my own blood , perhaps , but not my kind of men ? " " You 'll bring down on your head the combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They 'll call you a renegade ! " " Do you think it matters what a certain type cares to call me ? " Dilliard asked . " Any name Scabbard and his scum puts on me , matters not in the least . I 'll be glad to be termed a renegade , if only for the reason that it will set me apart from Scabbard and his snakes . " Sudden hope lighted the Spaniard 's eyes . He was on his feet now , right hand reaching for Dilliard 's . Their palms met in a warm , hard clasp . Castameto 's voice shook a little . " It will be something , " he said earnestly , " to have one of their blood on my side , helping to fight my fight . Perhaps ? perhaps ? " His voice faltered . To cover his confusion he reached for wine , poured two brimming glasses , passed one to Dilliard with a hand that trembled . Raising his glass high , " Salud , se  --  or ! " the Spaniard offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  | Castameto 's . He said clearly , " Salud ! And to the damnation of Drake Scabbard , mi patr  --  n ! " That last brought moisture to Castameto 's eyes . Dilliard laughed softly to himself , " For once , I reckon my sights do n't need adjusting . " Castameto caught the sound , but not the meaning . Dilliard shook his head , " It does n't matter . We 'll talk more now . I want to understand this situation thoroughly , before I plunge in . " Fresh wood was piled on the flames , cigarros lighted . Dilliard asked question after shrewd question , demanding to know more about the men who worked on the Rancho Sicamoro , how large a fighting force could be raised . He put forth certain suggestions to which Castameto protested violently . The talk went on and on . Gray dawn was commencing to sift through the windows and the oak logs had burned to thin ashes before the conversation had ceased .  | The following morning Castameto stood , frowning anxiously , near one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle up . It was before eight o'clock . The rancho was stirring to activity . At another corral , a knot of vaqueros had come in from the range for a change of horseflesh . Several Indians employed mesquite branches to sweep the grounds about the outer wall of the ranch house . Smoke curled from chimneys here and there . A heavy , hide-laden carreta , with huge wheels of solid wood , and drawn by a span of big work cattle , the yoke placed across their foreheads , rumbled past on its way to a storehouse . Dilliard placed one booted foot against his pony 's ribs , pulled his cinch tight . He straightened up , mopped his perspiring features with a bandanna . It was hot , the sun bearing down from a sky of cloudless blue . Dilliard grinned , " Going to be plumb warmish , today . " He repeated the thought in Spanish . " Madre de Dios ! " Castameto protested . " You are bound for El Vaca and you think only of the weather . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot there too . " " Exactly what I fear . Se  --  or Branch , I ask once  | more , please give up this mad idea . It will bring you naught , but ill-fortune I fear . Why do you have to see Scabbard ? " Dilliard smiled patiently . " Don Salvadore , we went over that last night . I still think there 's a chance of making Scabbard listen to reason . I do n't want to overlook anything that may avert bloodshed . We have n't time for fighting , if a fight can be avoided . " " But , the danger  --  riding into the lion 's den ? " " You flatter Scabbard , " Dilliard laughed . " He 's no lion  --  only a coyote wearing a lion 's skin . I think I can bluff him out of any thoughts he may have regarding me , while I 'm in El Vaca . After I leave ? " " If you are allowed to leave ? " " ? I can look out for myself , " Dilliard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you frankly , I think my trip will prove useless , but I 've got to try anyway . You must pay that money in two weeks . I suppose the cattle are gathered , ready to start ? " About that , Castameto was uncertain . He shrugged his shoulders . " Such matters I leave to my mayordomo , Manuel Estudillo , a very good man ? " Dilliard swore suddenly . He looked unbelievingly at Castameto . " Don Salvadore , do you mean to tell me you do n't know whether or not the cattle are gathered ? "  | " I have told Manuel to gather them . Gave him proper instructions , and explained that the work must be put through ? " " Did you tell him there was unusual need for haste , that your life and the life of the Rancho Sicamoro depended on ? " " Se  --  or Branch , I am not in the habit of taking my people into my confidence . It is enough if I tell them ? " " Oh , my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on , " Your men will work harder if they realize the urgency of the matter . Another thing , when the cattle are delivered to Don Alvaro Serrano , will he have ready the cash on hand to pay ? ? " " Se  --  or Branch , " Castameto interposed stiffly , " Don Alvaro is an honorable man . I did not go into such details . It is not the custom . If Don Alvaro says he will pay such-and-such , I know he will pay ? " " But when ? " Dilliard struggled to hold his patience . " Look here , Don Salvadore , keep in mind that you 're fighting the gringos now . What the custom is does n't matter . You 've got to forget that . I do n't doubt that Don Alvaro is an honorable man and that he will pay , but remember this  --  you 've got to deliver five thousand cattle to San Diego , get your money and return with it to El Vaca . Money ? cash ! Do you understand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some bank , necessitating  | maybe a couple of months . Scabbard will use any pretext to avoid receiving payment . You 've got to be able to put the cash in his hand ! " " I  --  I think , " Castameto commenced uneasily , " that all will go well " You think ! This is no time for thoughts when we are dealing in certainties . You 'll pardon me , Don Salvadore , when I tell you you 've got to employ some of this Yankee energy you detest so much . Scabbard will win if you do n't . There 's been too much of this put it off until tomorrow ' attitude ? too much ma  --  ana ? " " Se  --  or Dilliard ! Stop ! " Castameto drew himself erect , dark eyes snapping angrily . " I am not in the habit of being criticized . Perhaps it will be best if you let me handle my own affairs . You have my thanks for what you have done , but ? " This was no time for courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish : " Diantre ! Must you ride always the horse of great stature when I am trying to help you ' ? Dignity is no longer a virtue when rats gnaw at its silken cloak ! It is a time for action and not for dwelling on past glories . Madre de Dios ! Why do you insist on closing your eyes when gringos come raiding your lands ? " Could he have understood them , the same words coming in English would have resulted only in Castameto receiving them as an insult . In his own tongue they were far more impressive . Dilliard continued ,  | " Look around you ! By your own admission , the gringos have taken the lands of your neighbors . Is it to be said that one of your intelligence is too old to change his ways that he may meet the Americanos in their own type of fighting ' ? Are you already beaten at the mere threat of Americano invasion ? " " But , Se  --  or Dilliard ? " Castameto commenced weakly . " Ca n't you realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act ! You 've got to act with the speed and strength of an eagle . You must display the brains and the power of  --  of a Castameto ! Otherwise , Scabbard will be victorious . " " Socorro ! " Castameto swore , snapped to sudden activity . " You are right , Se  --  or Branch ! I must adapt myself to the new conditions . Forgive me for ? " Dilliard smiled suddenly , " No es importe . It 's not important . My feelings were n't hurt . I 've just been trying to make it clear that we 've got to move fast . " " I see that you are right . " The old man was suddenly bewildered , " But  --  but what shall I do ? You still feel it necessary to see Scabbard " More than ever necessary , " Dilliard said earnestly . " I want to put him off , if possible . Your job will be to see your mayordomo . Learn how many cattle are gathered and ready for the trail . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I , myself , shall see to it . "  | " Good ! " Dilliard swung up to the saddle , wheeled his horse . " I 'll see you later in the day . " " God grant your words come true , " Castameto said worriedly . " I do not like it . " He stood watching while Dilliard directed the horse around the house and disappeared beyond the first rise of land . Then , Castameto wiped the perspiration from his brow . " Valgame Dios ! " he muttered . " I feel as though I had been caught up in a great wind . Such energy as that Americano displays ! It wearies me . But he must be correct . " Suddenly he raised his voice , calling to a young Mexican who was passing , " Narcisso ! Move quickly ! " The youngster came on the run . " Si , mi patr  --  n ? " " Saddle for me , at once , a horse . " " Si . A particular caballo ? Or matters it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have the spirit and dash of three devils , a mountain torrent , a  --  a ? " Castameto paused , groping for a suitable simile , and finished triumphantly , " the spirit and dash of the Americano , the Se  --  or Branch ! " " It shall be done , at once . " " See that you speak truth . No ma  --  ana , understand ? I want the horse today  --  not tomorrow . I go to superintend the round-up . " Narcisso 's jaw dropped . He was aghast . " You ? you , in person , mi patr  --  n ? " Castameto scowled . " What is so strange in that ? Am I so ancient that I can not attend to the handling of my own cattle ? "  | " No , no , mi patr  --  n ! " hastily . Don Salvadore was placated . He said gruffly , " All right then . See to the horse at once , " and strode off toward the house to change his clothing . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patio , Castameto paused , turned back to look . Narcisso was still standing as Castameto had left him , eyes wide with amazement , mouth hanging open , staring after the patr  --  n . Don Salvadore 's face darkened up like a thunder cloud . He shouted angrily , " Narcisso ! Would you crave to have the skin flayed from your miserable frame ? No ? Then move your worthless carcass with dispatch ! I want that horse saddled today  --  understand . Not tomorrow , not next week . Today ! Move quickly lest I decide that your listless soul shall perish on an ant-hill ! " A twinkle came into the old Spaniard 's eyes as he watched the Mexican youngster dash frantically to the building where saddles were stored . Don Salvadore strode on , into the patio , scowling . " What has come over this place I do not understand . My people grow lazy ! Were it not for the energy of two men  --  the Se  --  or Branch and myself  --  the Rancho Sicamoro would fall to ruins with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of affairs ! "  | Leaving the house at his rear , Dilliard loped his pony along Borrego Canyon for the first mile and a half . Then he turned toward the southwest , heading up into the slopes of a group of small hills . For a time he followed a long ridge , covered with chaparral and mesquite , before descending into a small canyon through which flowed a shallow branch of Aliso Norte Creek . Eventually , the canyon opened up , the creek branched off to the south . Ahead was open range , covered with tall grass , wild mustard and a scattering of greasewood . Here the horse was forced to retard its progress through the tall growth . Another half hour slipped past before Dilliard sighted the roofs of El Vaca ; twenty minutes more brought him into the town . El Vaca consisted of a single , dusty , crooked street , bordered along either side by adobe huts and frame shacks . There were two saloons , a general store , a dirty-looking wine shop , two restaurants with fly-specked windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offices of a deputy-sheriff and justice of the peace . The town seemed more Americano than Spanish or Mexican , though most of the men on the street were Mexicans and Indians , the majority of the latter having their  | hair done up in a sticky mixture of wet clay , held in place with colored rags . Dilliard chuckled at this last , " Must be the season for getting rid of the animal life , " he mused . Hitch-rails ran along either side of the street . Dilliard did n't see anyone he knew . No one appeared to pay him any attention . A passing Mexican , upon Dilliard 's request , pointed out the way to Scabbard 's house . Scabbard 's place proved to be just around the next bend in the street . It was a slope-roofed frame structure , erected in the shadow of a big live oak tree . Near the front , at one side , rose the highest clump of prickly-pear cactus Dilliard had ever seen . A low-railinged porch ran across the front of the building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railing , the latter standing open . Dilliard reined his pony over to a hitch-rail jutting from near the clump of prickly-pear and running at right angles to the street . Behind the prickly-pear , and on the porch , he could hear men 's voices . The voices sounded somewhat familiar . Dilliard dismounted , flipped his reins over the tie-rail , shifted his holstered forty-five a trifle nearer to the front . Then he crossed to the single step that stood at the entrance to the porch , his head turning toward the voices behind the prickly-pear . There came two loud oaths . A chair that had been leaning against the front wall of the building came crashing down on all four legs .  | Dilliard laughed and said genially , " Hello , hombres . Have n't I encountered you some place be-fore ? " Clem Corill and Wirt Bisbee were just rising from their chairs . Bisbee 's right shoulder was swathed in dirty bandages ; his face was ashen white behind the matted red whiskers . Corill 's dark features were contorted with rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . Dilliard laughed again . " How 'd you leave things in Santa Lozana , Bisbee ? Hope your shoulder is getting along all right . " Bisbee muttered a curse and dropped his eyes . Corill snarled something unintelligible , started to draw his gun , then stopped short upon noticing that Dilliard 's right hand was already wrapped about the butt of his own weapon . " Damn you , Dilliard ! " Corill sputtered . I 'll ? " " " You 'll not do a thing , " Dilliard snapped . " I come here lookin ' for your boss . Is he in there ? " nodding toward the open doorway . " Dilliard ! " exclaimed a voice from inside . There were quick footsteps , and Drake Scabbard appeared in the doorway . For a moment he stopped short , apparently astonished at seeing Dilliard in El Vaca . Then he recovered himself , said coldly , " Thought I warned you to stay out of El Vaca . " " Seems like you did , " Dilliard replied easily , " now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Drake , shall I ? ? " Dilliard 's narrowed eyes turned momentarily in Corill 's direction . " No , " Dilliard cut in coldly , " do n't shoot me in the back , Corill . It might work out to Scabbard 's disadvantage . Besides , I got business to talk over with him . There 's something he should hear before he goes orderin ' any executions . " " Leave be , Clem , " Scabbard ordered shortly . His eyes narrowed momentarily , and he added , " You might go round up a few of the boys , Clem , and give ' em a look at this Texas hombre that 's set to ride rough-shod over Drake Scabbard . The damn fool does n't seem to realize just what he 's up against . " " Sure , call ' em in , " Dilliard grinned . " The more the merrier . " The sneer left Scabbard 's face ; he glanced suspiciously along the street in both directions , wondering what , if anything , this Texas man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident , to make Scabbard entirely easy in his mind . Clem Corill stepped down from the porch and made off in the direction of the nearest saloon . Wirt Bisbee , looking rather relieved , dropped down in his chair again , his pig-eyes glaring at Dilliard . Scabbard turned back to the Texan . " You changed your mind about going to work for me ? " " I did n't say so . " " What in hell do you want ? " " Maybe I can give you some good advice . "  | Scabbard considered the Texan 's words , then said , " I 'm not sure whether I want any advice from you . " Dilliard shrugged his shoulders . " Suit yourself , " carelessly . " I 'm just talking for your own good . However , if you are n't interested . . . " He left the words unfinished and made as if to step from the porch . " Wait a minute ! " Scabbard snapped . " At any rate , you 're not leaving yet . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better make my time worth while , though . " He turned and entered the building , Dilliard at his heels . The room was scantily furnished : an iron safe stood in one corner , its door tightly closed ; there were several stiff-backed wooden chairs ranged along the walls . A couple of yards from the safe was a board table on top of which were several papers , pen and ink , and a couple of ledgers . In the left-hand wall was a closed door , evidently leading to Scabbard 's bedroom . In the rear wall , a door led to the outside . Inside the room , Scabbard turned to face Dilliard . " What 's your business ? " he demanded . Dilliard crossed the room , picked up a chair , set it near the table . " You better sit down , Scabbard , " he advised coolly . " We might have quite a talk . " Scabbard hesitated , then shrugged his shoulders , rounded the table and sat down facing the Texan . " Get started , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry ? "  | Scabbard nodded coldly . " Yes , I am . There is n't any telling just how long you 're going to be able to talk . You 're the one that should be in a hurry . " " You 're frank about it , anyway , " Dilliard smiled . " All right , here 's the proposition : Scabbard , you 're holding a deed and the Spanish Grant to the Rancho Sicamoro . " " There is n't any secret about that . I 'm holding ' em as security on a loan of fifty thousand dollars . There 's nothing illegal there . " " Perhaps not  --  according to the law you run in this town , but , Scabbard , you fooled an old man who trusted you , deceived him . But , that 's according to your lights . Now , you 're demanding the return of that fifty thousand , knowing that Don Salvadore will have to return to a jail cell . " " Not necessarily . I 'll extend his loan if he 'll deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No doubt . But you know damn well he has to have that stock to raise the money to pay you back . " " Suppose I do ? " Scabbard queried angrily . " That 's his lookout , not mine . He got himself in this fix . " Dilliard nodded . " I thought you 'd look at it that way , Scabbard . You 're fixin ' to grab the Rancho Sicamoro for yourself . " " Well , " Scabbard laughed harshly , " supposing I am ? What of it ? It 's a nice property . If these damn greasers ca n't hold on to their land , that 's their fault . "  | " I suppose you 'll deny staging that attempted kidnapping , so you could get a hold on Don Salvadore ? " Scabbard hesitated , then replied coldly , " No , I wo n't deny it , Dilliard . " " You got plenty nerve , " Dilliard said contemptuously . " Probably , " Scabbard agreed . " I 'll admit anything else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never get into court . If it did , and you swore I admitted these things , I 'd swear you were a liar . It 'd be your word against mine , and in this country my word carries a heap more weight . " " You 're a cold-blooded skunk ! " Dilliard snapped . Scabbard 's lips tightened . " Look here , Dilliard , what did you come here for ? Let 's get down to cases . " " Scabbard , I 'm asking you to give Castameto a chance . If you 'll give him a little time , he 'll raise that money and pay you back . Any decent white man would do that much . You wo n't lose a cent . If Castameto has to go to the gallows for killing young Lucas Reardon , he 'll go like a man , but he wo n't have to , if you 'll do your part ? " " Hell ! Do n't talk like a damn fool , Dilliard . Castameto 's only a greaser . . . " He broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his affairs for ? " " I want to see justice done . "  | " Hmm ! Justice , eh ? " Scabbard laughed scornfully , took out and lighted a slim black cigar , then laughed again . " You know , Texas man , I just had an idea . " " Yes ? So far I have n't liked your ideas . " " This may change your mind . It just occurred to me that you 're the one that 's had the wool pulled over his eyes . " " How so ? " " We-ell , it 's like this , " Scabbard said with affected geniality , " Castameto figures he might get some place if he had a white man on his side . Mebbe , under the conditions , the proud old fool is willing to put up with you at his place for a spell " Under what conditions ? " Dilliard was puzzled . Scabbard eyed Dilliard slyly . " Y'know , I would n't be surprised if you 'd been hit sort of hard by Castameto 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uses her to draw you on . You 've been bilked , Texas man . I ai n't surprised though . She 's a good-lookin ' wench , though I never did go for those white-and-gold hussies ? " Scabbard stopped suddenly . Dilliard had n't said a word . He 'd just drawn his Colt-gun and laid it softly on the table , the muzzle pointing toward Scabbard 's body . " What  --  what 's the idea ? " Scabbard stammered . The Texan 's voice was quiet , steady , even-toned , " Let 's start farther back , Scabbard . You were saying  | something about swearing I was a liar , if this matter ever come to court . " Scabbard swallowed hard , then becoming angry , snapped , " You fool , what else do you expect ? I 'm playing for high stakes . I ca n't afford to be cheated by a cow hand from Texas . " Dilliard smiled , replaced the gun in his holster . " That 's better , " he stated softly . Scabbard 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shilly-shallying . You said something about having some good advice for me . Get talking , fast ! " Dilliard nodded . " I come to see if you would n't give Castameto a chance . I should have known better . Now , here 's the good advice , Scabbard . Go slow , or you wo n't go any place . You 've got things your own way here , while you 're bucking poor Mexicans and Spaniards , but there 's plenty decent Americanos in this country ; they 're not going to stand very long for you and your kind . I 'm going to enjoy gathering the right men to see that justice is done . Is that plain enough for you ? Change your dirty ways , or they 'll be changed for you . That 's my advice . Take it to heart ! " The eyes of the two men locked , held for half a minute . Dilliard started to rise . " That 's all . I 'll be drifting . " " Sit down ! " Scabbard 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dilliard . Figuring to drift , eh ? Just where in hell you figuring to drift to ? " Sardonic laughter sounded at Dilliard 's rear . The Texan turned to gaze at a dozen or so men who had filed silently into the room and who stood with their backs to the doorway , their eyes hard on this gringo renegade . They formed an evil-looking group with their tattered sombreros , unshaven countenances and dirty clothing . All carried six-shooters , except one old rascally individual who toted a rifle and a wicked hunting knife at his belt . They were fit companions for Bisbee and Corill who headed them . Bart Fustian glowered at one side , his head swathed in bandages , the lower part of his face swollen and bruised to an extent that prevented speech . " How do you like my pets ? " Scabbard was saying mockingly . " Dilliard , these men are loyal ; they realize it pays well to work for Drake Scabbard . They 'll do anything I tell ' em to  --  and they wo n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ? " Dilliard nodded , laughed easily . " Nice clean looking group of boys . They 've got such wholesome , honest faces . Pro'bly spend their time studying wild flowers , do n't they ? I 'll bet they 're as sweet a crew as ever plugged a stage driver in the back . " The insolent remarks brought a number of oaths and threatening looks . Dilliard singled out the villainous old fellow with the rifle . " Who 's that crowbait ? Do n't tell me he 's fooled you into believing  | he 's Dan'l Boone or Kit Carson . They 're dead , you know . " The old " crow-bait " was a dirty-looking individual with ragged gray whiskers , stained with tobacco juice , and one squinting eye . He had a wiry frame , and wore a coon-skin cap , a fringed buckskin suit and worn moccasins , instead of the usual kneeboots common to the country . Cradled under one arm was a Spencer repeating rifle . The owner of the rifle gave vent to a vile epithet together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galoot who I am , Drake , " he squealed , in injured tones . " Dilliard , " Scabbard said pleasantly , " you 've heard of old Cat-Eye Fremont , have n't you ? " " Ca n't say I have , " the Texan denied . " I 'm surprised at your ignorance , Dilliard . Old Cat-Eye is just about the finest rifle shot in all the length and breadth of California . " Dilliard grinned suddenly , " Well , you tell CatEye for me , Scabbard , that if he does n't keep his rifle any cleaner than his ugly face , his barrel will get fouled and he 'll find himself in trouble " Jumpin ' catamounts ! " Cat-Eye yelled indignantly , " if ye can show me a cleaner bar ' 1 than what I got here ? " " Shut up , Cat-Eye , " Scabbard snarled suddenly , losing his temper . Cat-Eye " shut up " as did the rest of the gang . Scabbard turned back to Dilliard , saying savagely , " So you figured you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to drift to , Texas man ' ? You fool ! Did you think you could come to El Vaca and get out again , unless I gave the word . And I 'm not giving the word , see ? You 've overplayed your hand and in one minute you 're due ? " " Take it easy , Scabbard , " Dilliard interposed carelessly , " you 'll be havin ' a stroke of apoplexy if you are n't careful . Scabbard , did I ever mention that I had influential friends at the capitol ? " " You mean in Sacramento ? " Scabbard asked quickly . " Got a few in San Diego too , " Dilliard laughed . " Who are they ? " Scabbard 's voice was eager . " That does n't matter . You know , Scabbard , before I left for El Vaca , I had a rider sent in both directions , to tell those friends I was headin ' for El Vaca to talk to a skunk named Drake Scabbard . Of course , if anythin ' was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scabbard , think of the questions you might have to answer . Man , you might find yourself in a tight fix . " Scabbard looked uneasy . He remembered now that Dilliard had seemed to display a great deal of confidence . He looked steadily at Dilliard . Dilliard laughed contemptuously . " Dammit ! " Scabbard scowled . " You 're running a bluff . " The Texan 's grin was insolent . " Scabbard , I sure am , " he admitted truthfully . " Why do n't you call it ? Go on , I dare you to call it . "  | The very frankness of Dilliard 's manner deceived Scabbard . He was uncertain what to do . He could n't find anything to say . Again , Dilliard laughed contemptuously , rose from his chair . " Yep , I 'm ready to drift , " he stated . " S'long , Scabbard . See you on the gallows sometime . " Scabbard turned white with anger , but did n't dare halt the Texan on his progress toward the doorway . Dilliard eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Out of the way , scum , " he said coldly . The scum , awaiting the signal from Scabbard that did n't come , suddenly parted . Laughing coolly , Dilliard passed through to the outside , crossed the porch , reached his horse and mounted it , expecting any minute to hear gunfire break out at his rear . He gave a long sigh of relief as he turned the pony and loped swiftly out of El Vaca . As his hoofbeats died away , Scabbard and his henchmen gave way to a fit of cursing . " Dammit , Drake ! " Corill growled , " Why did n't you give the word . We 'd have finished him pronto . " " Give the word ! " Scabbard snarled . " You fools ! Did n't you hear what he said ? " " Aw , " Bisbee blustered , " that was all bluff " Yes , " Scabbard cut in , speaking slowly , " I think it was . But there 's just a small chance that he was talking straight . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities coming here . El Vaca would n't stand  | an investigation right now . I 've got to get more money before we can stand anythin ' like that . Once I 've got what I want we 'll tell the whole state to go to hell . Nope , it would n't do to kill Dilliard in my town ? " " " By Cripes ! " Corill questioned , " You aimin ' to let him get away ? " " Away from El Vaca  --  yes , " Scabbard said coldly . " Far enough away so a killing ca n't be hung on us . . . . Cat-Eye ! " Cat-Eye Fremont stepped up to the table . " You got work for me , boss ? " Scabbard nodded jerkily . " You 're not only the best rifle shot in California , but the best trailer as well . Get on Dilliard 's trail . Once he 's out of town he 'll be takin ' it easy . You wo n't have any trouble catchin ' up . Once you sight him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wo n't do no driftin' ' within my range , " CatEye boasted . " Make that statement stick , Cat-Eye , and there 's gold waiting for you on your return . Otherwise ? do n't return . " " Oh , hell , thet feller will be easy  --  - " " Drop that attitude right now , Cat-Eye , " Scabbard said sternly . " If he gets wind you 're following him , he 'll try to outfox you . " " He wo n't outfox this Injun , " Cat-Eye affirmed . " Good ! Get going , now . " Cat-Eye started for the door . When nearly there , Scabbard called to  | him . The old scoundrel turned and waited . " I just happened to think , Cat-Eye , " Scabbard said cruelly , " that I need a new pen-wiper for helping me keep my accounts . " " Is that so ? " Cat-Eye queried blankly . Scabbard nodded . " That 's so . Bring me his scalp , Cat-Eye ! "  | One mile out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk and glanced back toward El Vaca . No pursuing rider was in right , but that fact did n't deceive the Texan . " Scabbard wo n't give up a chance to rub me out this easy , " Dilliard mused . " If I 'm not mistaken in the man , he 's delegatin ' somebody right now to finish me off . Reckon I 'd better go easy until I learn who it is . Scabbard would n't want me killed in , or near , El Vaca , but if my dead body was to be found out on the range some place , that coyote could disclaim all knowledge of the affair . " Dilliard touched a spur to his pony and the animal moved into a faster gait , breasting through the wild mustard and tall grass . Before long the southern branch of the Aliso Norte was reached . Dilliard chuckled , " Here 's where I have some fun with whoever gets sent on my trail . " Reining the pony into the shallow depths of the creek , Dilliard followed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding out of the water on the same side on which he 'd entered . " There , mister , " he grinned at his supposed tracker , " you can waste some time looking for the spot at which I crossed the river . If that move do n't fool you , you 're a better man than I think . "  | The canyon walls on either side of the stream were now growing higher as Dilliard advanced . For a mile and a half he followed the southern bank , before a second time sending his pony into the water . This time he crossed over on a long diagonal . Even at its deepest point the water was n't much above the pony 's hocks . Emerging from the Aliso Norte near a natural break in the canyon wall , Dilliard turned the pony 's head toward the long hogback he 'd traversed a few hours before . But now he rode directly west . In a short time the hogback commenced to slope toward the canyon , and before long Dilliard had reached a point above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the stream . Here he dismounted and , screened from the creek by a high shelter of mahogany bush , sat down to wait . It was n't long before his vigilance was rewarded : a horseman rounded a bend in the canyon , riding slowly and scrutinizing the earth for hoofprints as he progressed . As the rider came nearer , Dilliard , looking down on him from above , recognized old Cat-Eye Fremont . Dilliard considered . " Cat-Eye , eh ? I sort of expected Scabbard to send one of his other coyotes , instead of old Cat-Eye . I wonder what the idea is ? Let me see . . . Scabbard said Cat-Eye was the best rifle shot in this country . Hmmm ! That means , I reckon , that Scabbard wants me killed from a distance . Must be he do n't figure his six-shooter men  | as being so good  --  not good enough , anyway . Yep , that 's pro'bly it . Cat-Eye knows this country ; he 'll figure to reach a point where he can command any trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle , from a distance . Yep , that 's it . In that way , there wo n't be any betrayin ' sign ' left near my body , to be traced back to El Vaca . Scabbard 's tricky , 1 got to admit that much . " Cat-Eye Fremont was reining his pony into the water now , following on Dilliard 's trail . Dilliard watched , chuckling to himself , when Cat-Eye rode out of the water and again commenced looking for the hoofprints he 'd been following . Slowly , back and forth at the water 's edge , Cat-Eye rode , looking for " sign " that was n't there . Dilliard saw the old fellow remove his coonskin cap and scratch his head in perplexity , then turn his pony back into the water again and scan the opposite shore . Dilliard laughed softly . " I sure got that old coyote baffled ! Hoofprints led into the water but they did n't come out again . I 'll bet a plugged peso that he follows the stream , just like I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same side where they went in . Then he will wonder what I 'm up to ? No , by gosh ! " Dilliard sobered suddenly , as Cat-Eye suddenly wheeled his pony back to the north shore of the creek , emerged , and sent the pony along at a brisk trot .  | Slowly , an involuntary feeling of admiration for Cat-Eye 's mental processes crept over Dilliard . " Dam 'd if he is n't a cagy old coot , at that , " Dilliard admitted ruefully . " I did n't fool him at all . I reckon Cat-Eye knows something about reading sign ' himself . He pro'bly does n't figure just why he ca n't find my prints on this side of the stream , but he does know that I 'm heading for the Rancho Sicamoro , and that 's where he 's heading to . He knows this country better than I do . Maybe that break in the canyon wall is the only one for miles , and he knows I 'll have to take it to get back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you thought you were , and if you do n't move fast , old Cat-Eye is going to cut you off . " Whirling , Dilliard ran back to his pony , leaped into the saddle , plunged in his spurs and headed back toward the break in the canyon wall . Now , as he rode swiftly along the hogback , he was formulating new plans for " stopping " Cat-Eye Fremont . He had n't much time in which to work , either , if he were to reach that opening from the river before Cat-Eye did . As a matter of fact , Cat-Eye was n't more than twenty minutes behind Dilliard in reaching the same point . Following the northern bank of the stream , Cat-Eye finally came to hoofprints left by Dilliard 's pony when it left the shallow water . " Knew dang well , " Cat-Eye mused , " that he 'd  | have to come out here . Ca n't see why in time he followed the stream so far , though . " The old fellow was entirely unaware of Dilliard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accomplished nothing in his attempted deception , except loss of time . The hoofprints were plain to follow now ; CatEye 's gray horse moved along at a good gait until it reached higher ground . Here the hoofprints were lost once more : a bajada of flat broken rock sloping gently from a low hill , presented a hard , uneven surface upon which passing hoofs left very little or no " sign " to follow . It was at this point Dilliard had turned , some time before , to gain the spot from which he had first caught sight of Cat-Eye Fremont , and only twenty minutes previously Dilliard had spurred his swift-running horse across the cluttered , rock-strewn terrain , to disappear around the first shelter of protecting hill that presented itself . Cat-Eye did n't waste time looking for sign now : " Dang it ! " he grunted irritably , " a hawss do n't leave no tracks on that stuff . Reckon I might as well head for softer ground , then cast around until I pick up his trail . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " sunk his broken fangs into the brown weed and tore off a " chaw . " Then , once more , he got down to business , searching on the relatively softer earth , beyond the bajada of broken rock , for Dilliard 's trail , little realizing that , by this time , the  | Texan had gained the crest of a low hill and , screened behind a wide spreading madro  --  a tree , was gleefully watching every move made by his pursuer . Crossing the bajada in the direction leading toward the Rancho Sicamoro , Cat-Eye was considerably surprised that he did n't at once spy the hoofprints of Dilliard 's horse . He cursed a little , then commenced to ride in wide circles , his shrewd eyes ever intent on the surrounding earth . Suddenly he found the " sign " for which he sought . " Damn odd , " he grunted , frowning . " From this here , it looks like Dilliard was headin ' up inter th ' mountings , ' stead of goin ' to Castameto 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing time over that question , CatEye took up the trail . And then the chase commenced ! It was a regular hare-and-hounds game that Dilliard was playing , with himself in the role of the hare and the wily Cat-Eye sticking like a leech to the trail . Up hill and down hill , Dilliard led the chase , without at any time nearing the Ranch of the Sycamores . He doubled back on his trail , cut down into deep ravines , mounted to high altitudes , but without being able to elude his persistent pursuer . From time to time , from behind a sheltering screen of brush Dilliard caught brief glances of old Cat-Eye . " Danged if that old codger is n't a hound on a trail , " Dilliard muttered appreciatively . " I 've  | used every trick I can think of , but I ca n't shake him off . " Never once had it occurred to Dilliard to ambush and destroy the old fellow , despite the fact he knew that Cat-Eye was following the trail with only one end in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost temerity to buck Drake Scabbard . The sun swung to the west . Still the chase continued . This was all familiar ground to Cat-Eye Fremont . Three times he had waited at points on the shelves along certain ravines , feeling sure , from the course Dilliard was taking , that he must appear , before long , on the opposite side of the ravine , where he 'd provide an open target for a slug from the Spencer rifle . But , somehow , the Texan and his chestnut horse had failed to put in the expected appearance and Cat-Eye had been once more forced to take up the trail . " Damn his hide ! " Cat-Eye swore . Cat-Eye was growing weary . It was a long time since his old frame had been forced to undergo such riding and scrambling along mountain slopes . " I do n't see what 's got inter Dilliard . Why do n't he act sensible an ' go home ? What 's he climbin ' around these here mountings for all afternoon ? Must be he 's lookin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ridin ' around these here hills . If I did n't know different I 'd think somebody had tipped him off to Scabbard 's orders and that he knowed I was a-follerin ' him . "  | Gradually , as the afternoon waned , the chase swung around to the vicinity of the Rancho Sicamoro . " Well , he 's gittin ' toward home at last , " CatEye grumbled . " ' Bout time ? " The old fellow paused suddenly . From the matted underbrush to his right a rabbit had darted into sight . Cat-Eye gave one soft , quick whistle and jerked his horse to a stop . The rabbit halted , raising on rear haunches to locate the whistle . Cat-Eye 's right hand swept to the belt at his waist , came up holding his long keen hunting knife . His wrist flicked back , then out . The knife was a streak of blue light through the air , ending in a frightened squeal in the jackrabbit 's body . Cat-Eye grunted with satisfaction as he dismounted , retrieved the bleeding carcass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have to make camp tonight , with all this chasm ' over the hills . I do n't aim to sleep on an empty belly . " He started his horse , eyes intent on the seemingly endless string of hoofprints that led the way before him . Fifteen minutes passed . The prints were leading to lower ground now . " Yep , Dilliard 's headin ' home at last , dang his ornery hide . He 'd orter be ' shamed of hisself leadin ' an of man like me across these hills all afternoon , ' thout oncet givin ' me a clean look ' tween my Spencer sights . I 'm gettin ' too old fer sech traipsin ' ' round . I jest reckon I 'll take me a short cut over towards Castameto 's diggin 's . He 'll have to come  | into plain sight when he nears home . I can be holed up , neat , in some brush , and throw my lead the minnit he heaves inter sight . By Cripes ! Thet 's whut I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tangent through the brush . The sun was low now . Half an hour later , Cat-Eye was entrenched behind a mesquite thicket , high on a hilly slope . Below him was spread out the Ranch of the Sycamores , and , to reach the ranch , Dilliard would have to pass CatEye 's line of vision  --  the line of vision being trained between the sights of a straight-shooting Spencer rifle . Impatiently , Cat-Eye waited for Dilliard to put in an appearance . " Dang his ornery hide , " Cat-Eye wailed , " he 's wasted so much time foolin ' around these hills , that it 's goin ' to be night before he gets here . It 'll be too dad-blamed dark to see him . Curse my luck ! " Which was exactly what Dilliard had figured on . He had timed the chase well , and , under cover of darkness , would be able to reach the ranch without being seen by Cat-Eye . The sun was below the horizon now . Twilight lingered but a few minutes , then darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of myriad stars . Cat-Eye sighed deeply , groaned when he straightened his ancient limbs . " By Gawd , " he swore , " I 'll git him tomorrer , anyway . Nothin ' ter do ternight , but camp out and wait . "  | Getting his horse , Cat-Eye moved farther up the hill , then stopped again and dismounted in a thick clump of chaparral and mahogany bush . Here he built a small fire that was screened by thick brush from the sight of those in the rancho below , and tenderly lowering his aching limbs to the earth , spread his blankets and commenced skinning the dead rabbit . . . . Five hundred yards higher on the slope , Dilliard chuckled as he caught a tiny glimmer of firelight below him . He 'd been waiting for that for some time . " Now that I know where Cat-Eye 's located , " the Texan grinned in the darkness , " I reckon I 'll get down to my own supper . I can take care of Cat-Eye later . " Slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse a few rods away , climbed into the saddle , and with the stealth of a Comanche , swung down the slope in a wide circle that carried him to the Rancho Sicamoro.  | Dilliard turned his pony into the corral and , slinging his saddle to shoulder , started for the small shelter , nearby , where saddles were left overnight . Overhead the stars shone brightly . Near the shelter a cigarette blowed momentarily , then was cast to the earth . A slim form took shape in the darkness , then Dilliard caught Tony 's words : " Por Dios ! Se  --  or Branch , you return alive ! " Dilliard laughed softly . " Looks that way , amigo . " " Almos ' I 'm sweat blood when I 'm hear you ride to El Vaca . I 'm theenk I nevair again set my eyes on your body . Only that the patr  --  n forbid ' I would , long since , ride to see what happen . But Don Salvadore order ' that we should wait yet a small time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hav ' happen ? " " I 'll tell you later , Tony . I want to see Don Salvadore as soon as possible ? " " But you saw Scabbard ? " " I saw Scabbard . Tried to persuade him against the course he 's following , but he could n't see it my way ? " " Socorro ! And you live to tell the tale " I made a bluff . Scabbard did n't dare try anything in El Vaca. "  | " Se  --  or Branch ! I am surprise ' Scabbard did not send one to follow your trail and kill " Scabbard did . Tony , did you ever hear of an old codger called Cat-Eye Fremont ? " " S ? , s ? ! " Tony said quickly . " Once or twice this Cat-Eyes he comes to Santa Lozana when I 'm live there . It is said he can shoot out the eye of a scorpion , at a mile 's distance , with bees rifle . Yes , I know of him . A dirty old devil if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly the story of the chase he 'd led Cat-Eye Fremont that day , chuckling as he talked . When he had finished , Tony shook his head dubiously , saying , " You should have put a bullet through hees ribs when you had the chance , Se  --  or Branch . Theese is not so good . Today , you have make of him the monkey , but always tomorrow comes , and theese Cat-Eye will be on the alert to shoot ? " " I 've thought of that too , " Dilliard said quietly . " What , then , do you intend ? " " We 'll talk about it later , " Dilliard said . " Right now I want to see Don Salvadore as soon as possible , learn how many cows are rounded up ready for the drive . " Tony vented an exclamation of dismay . " That I can tell you . Of only five hondred head are gathered ? " " Five hundred head ! " Dilliard swore bitterly under  | his breath . " Cripes ! What have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals from the leftovers of past years . There was branding to be done ? " Dilliard swore again . " They should know you ca n't bring a cow along a drive in good condition when it 's been fresh branded . What 's Don Salvadore thinking of ? " " Perhaps it is not entirely the patr  --  n 's fault . Manuel Estudillo , the mayordomo , did not realize the reason for hurrying . Today , the patr  --  n , himself , rode out to oversee the business . Diantre ! He was a whirlwind , a storm , a cyclone . He drove the men like a fiend from hell ? " " But , five hundred head . " Dilliard shook his head gravely . " That 's not so good ? " " All day , " Tony said dryly , " the patr  --  n have been impressing that fac ' on the minds of us . " Dilliard nodded shortly . " All right , I 'll talk to Don Salvadore , Tony . I 'll be back in a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide something about Cat-Eye Fremont too . " " Si , Se  --  or Branch . " Dilliard strode on toward the house , crossed the passageway into the patio and thence arrived before the door of the main room of the dwelling . His quick knock brought an invitation to enter . Dilliard stepped into the sala to find Castameto pacing the floor restlessly before the fireplace at one end of  | the room . Sudden relief flooded into the old Spaniard 's eyes . " It is really you ! You are back , Don Branch ! " " Back safely , despite your worries . " " You saw Scabbard ? " Dilliard nodded , related briefly what had taken place , but made no mention of being followed by Cat-Eye Fremont . " Thank the buen Dios ! " Castameto said fervently . " At least you are safe , even though your journey was less successful than you had hoped . Come , we shall eat . I would not have the meal served before . As to Scabbard  --  his attitude is no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant , who entered and received certain instructions , then led the way to the dining room . Mariposa entered within a few minutes , dressed in some soft gray material . Dilliard 's heart skipped a few beats at sight of the girl , but he managed to hold his voice steady and greeted her quietly . Throughout the meal , Mariposa took but small part in the conversation , and when wine and cigarros were brought , she asked to be excused and took her departure . Castameto frowned slightly upon noticing the way in which Dilliard 's eyes followed the girl from the room . But the old Spaniard said nothing . Instead he changed the subject , saying somewhat apologetically , " Se  --  or , I learned today , to my re
