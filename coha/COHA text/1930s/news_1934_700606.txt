txt Prosperity Through War . Together with inflationists , the " Prosperity Through ' War " theorists are advancing ideas . Because their theories consider only one side of the picture , . their arguments are specious . High wages would be the immediate order , and money would circulate , they say . But they ignore the high cost of war-living and the difference between real and nominal wages . Business would earn large profits. , they claim . With that , of course , we would have profiteering and high taxes . Inventions would result , but they would be war inventions , such as improved poison gas , deadlier bombs and more efficient fighting planes . Possible war debts are , of course , irrelevant in this discussion . Even a superficial consideration of any of these points will dispel any doubt but that " prosperity through war " ill only a myth . MYER L. KAUFMAN . Jamaica , N.
