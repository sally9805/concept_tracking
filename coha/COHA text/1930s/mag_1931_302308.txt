While President Hoover was sitting with his Cabinet one morning last week , an alarming report reached his bodyguard . Police reserves tramped into the White House grounds , deployed , guarded the gates . Pennsylvania Avenue shrieked with motorcycle sirens . Secret Service men issued curt , severe commands . Excited newshawks flocked about . Cameramen looked to their plates . Trucks bearing sound newsreel equipment lumbered up into position . Idlers paused , gaped , made throngs . When Vice President Curtis left the Cabinet Meeting , a bodyguard hopped into his car beside him. * All was in martial readiness about the White House to meet a reported Red demonstration for Unemployment relief . Police , newshawks , cameramen , bodyguardsmen , idlers , the President himself waited tensely for the picketers to arrive and be repulsed . One hour passed , then another . But not a Red showed up . The police began drifting away . The White House quieted its jumpy nerves . It was a false alarm . <P> Three days later , however , 14 persons appeared outside the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drizzle they unfurled their banners ( " Mr. Hoover , We Demand Food &; Lodging , " " Mr. Hoover You Have Money for the Entertainment of the Fascist Assassin Grandi . " ) . Promptly the police pounced on them , arrested all 14 for parading without a permit . Their leader , one Herbert Benjamin , loudly explained that when Congress sits ( Dec. 7 ) , 1,300 " hunger marchers " would be in Washington demonstrating for relief . <P> Next day the U. S. Secret Service paid Leader Benjamin the compliment of taking his " hunger march " seriously and thus helping to publicize it throughout the land . Chief Moran declared that his sleuths had learned the march was really a Communist demonstration on a large scale . " Marchers " from all parts of the country would be brought to Washington in 1,144 trucks , 92 automobiles . They would be lodged and fed along the way . They would have medical attention . They would defend themselves with stones . They would be organized in military fashion . They would petition the President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Only one thing in their plans did Chief Moran fail to ascertain and that was where the money was coming from to finance such a large undertaking . As usual , Moscow was publicly suspected . <P> While Washington waited to see what would come of this fantastic scheme , " hunger marchers " in motor trucks got under way about the country . The Chicago contingent produced a riot in Hammond , Ind . Mayor Mackey of Philadelphia advised them to " pass by " his city . Hartford closed its streets to " hunger riders . " Leader Benjamin denounced the Secret Service , declared : " A vast Red hysteria is being fomented . " <P> Secretary of State Stimson , looking worried , rushed in upon President Hoover one morning to report that he ( Mr. Stimson ; was the centre of a hot diplomatic incident with Japan . He had , he said , been misquoted on the Manchurian situation in press despatches to Tokyo ( see p. 19 ) .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
