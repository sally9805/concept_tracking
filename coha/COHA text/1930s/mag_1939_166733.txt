Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was in such an optimistic mood one day last week that he called in the political correspondents of a large part of the British press , swore them to secrecy , then gave them an extended lecture on how bright were the prospects for peace . Next day papers all over the United Kingdom told how " political circles " in London thought Italian demands against France could easily be satisfied ; that an international trade revival was on its way ; that in many little ways official Nazi Germany had been acting quite decently to Britain ; that even a general disarmament conference was not unthinkable . All this occurred two weeks after all Europe was supposed to have been sure that all hell would break loose March 6 . <P> No British correspondent dared to give away the identity of the " political circles , " but several U. S. newsmen did . The incident served as an illustration of how the British Government can get its own press to blow hot or cold as it desires , can often indirectly influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week U. S. pundits like Walter Lippmann , Edwin L. James , Dorothy Thompson , William Philip Simms , joined faraway Prime Minister Hertzog of South Africa in being optimistic about a Spring of Peace . <P> Following up Mr. Chamberlain 's unofficial hints , Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare conjured up an even glossier picture of peace prospects . He saw five men-Adolf Hitler , Benito Mussolini , Joseph Stalin , Edouard Daladier and Neville Chamberlain-getting together to sit down at a disarmament conference table and " transform the whole history of the world . " * Said Sir Samuel : <P> " These five men , working together in Europe and blessed in their efforts by the President of the United States of America , might make themselves eternal benefactors of the human race . Our own Prime Minister has shown his determination to work heart and soul to such an end . I can not believe that other leaders of Europe will not join him in the high endeavor upon which he is engaged . " <P> Reasons for the British ooze of optimism were not hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Election this year . Business usually improves when governments talk peace . The European atmosphere , moreover , has been so full of dire warnings to totalitarian powers lately that many a British voter might easily have forgotten that the Prime Minister won his international fame as the Great Appeaser . <P> Moreover , a hunter for peace might easily have found a few faint signs of improvement on the international horizon last week . The week-end trouble in Czechoslovakia ( see p. 22 ) was not likely to dampen determined British optimism and Britain was more than likely not to do any more than protest against another partition of the country . The British low-down on Germany last week was that the Nazis were having such a tough time with economic problems that they could scarcely plan an " adventure " soon . Similarly , <P> Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano , having roamed over Europe trying to find partners for a colony-grabbing expedition , was said to have failed lamentably . As for France , she had recovered not only her financial stability but her political unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
