txt Police Commissioner Edward P. Muirooney of New York City will head the new State Alcoholic Beverages Control Board . Governor Lehman , following the passage of his beer control bill in the Senate and Assembly late today , announced that he had asked Commissioner Mulrooney to accept the position , that Mr. Mulrooney had accepted , and that he would be formally appointed as soon as the bill had received the Governor 's signature and become law . Mr. Mulrooney takes his new job , at a financial sacrifice . His salary as head of the Beer and Wine Control Board will be $12,000 . As Police Commissioner under the recent salary reduction , he is receiving $13,390 . The other members of the board will draw salaries of $7,500 . Governor Lehman said he was very happy to make the announcement and that he regarded Commissioner Muirooney as most eminently fitted for the position , because of his intimate knowledge of the problems bound to arise in the administration of the control system . " I must say that in calling Mr. Mulrooney to the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was willing to waive his prior claim to the commissioner 's services in order that he might undertake this important work in the service of the State , " the Governor added . He did not feel certain when the police commissioner would relinquish his duties and come to the Capitol . Plans are under way for establishing offices for the new board in the thirty-two-story office building atop Capitol Hill . State Licenses June 1 . A day or two will probably elapse before the control bill becomes law , as certain formalities still remain for execution before the Governor can attach his signature . It will go into effect immediately upon being signed by the Governor . but the municipal licenses now in force will not be superseded by State licenses until June 1 . The Governor said some time would elapse before he could fill the four places on the central control board . While provisions requiring him to make his appointments from panels of candidates furnished by the State Bar Association , the Chamber of Commerce , the State Medical Society and the State Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reiterated his intention of adhering to his original plan of consulting these civic groups . Under the original bill the Governor was required to appoint at least one woman to the control board . There was opposition to this proposal from the start , especiarry among the Democrats , and an eleventh-hour amendment was made today cutting out this requirement . The Governor had not decided whether he will now name a woman member . The Legislature appropriated $225. - 100 to defray the cost of the con- trol board 's operations for the opening months , with a proviso that $25,000 is to go to the county boards . The passage of the control bill created little stir in either the Senate or the Assembly . Bearing the name of Senator Dunnigan , it was offered at a time when the Senate ' had completed all of its other business and was ready to adjourn . It was quickly passed in the upper house under an emergency message from Governor Lehman to expedite procedure . Senator Dunnigan advanced into the well of the chamber with some ceremony , carrying three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction . It was immediately advanced to the order of third reading without1 objection from any dry Senators . The Governor 's message and the enacting clause were read . A " rapid " roll-call followed . None indicating that he wanted to vote in the negative , the clerk announced that the bill had received the votes of all the fifty Senators in attendance . It was less than a minute from the time the bill , over which there had been weeks of bitter controversy and a deadlock of the Legislature , was introduced until it was declared passed by Lieut . Gov . Bray , who was on the rostrum . The Assembly , with all its other business completed , was impatiently waiting to receive the Senate version of the beer and wine bill and concur in its passage . The bill had already been introduced by Assemblyman Dunkel , a Republican , who had been a member of Governor Lehman 's commission to study alcoholic beverage control legislation . The Governor had refused to send an emergency message on the Assembly bill which bore a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure followed closely that in the Senate . The measure was shot through with lightning speed on a rapid roll-call . without any attempt on the part of any of the members at eulogy or censure . There was no record of the vote . Assemblyman Luke O'Reilly of Kings . a Democrat , not fully in accord with the control bill , tried to make a speech , but was hooted down . A new feature In the control bill is the broadening of the system of regulation to include 3.2 per cent wine . The statute to tax beer , already passed and approved by Governor Lehman , and thus being in force , was broadened also by the passage of a supplementary measure imposing a tax of 10 cents a gallon on wine . Where wine is sold in conjunction with beer , the sale will involve no additional license fee . If it is sold in an establishment where beer is not sold , a license fee equal to that imposed for the sale of beer is provided . Under a provision inserted in the bill at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent beer will apply to 3.2 per cent wine . I'he wine manufacturer will pay a license of $25 a year to the State . Under the terms of the beer bill as adopted , the Central State Control Board will be empowered to permit the consumption of 3.2 per cent beer at bars . The clause giving this authority reads : " No beer shall be sold to be consumed at a bar , a counter or other similar contrivance , except under such rules as the State board may prescribe . " The absence of any such provision in the earlier measures was resented with considerable intensity by many members of the Legislature , especially New York City Democrats . There was dissatisfaction , too , with the obscurity in the first measures of provisions regulating beer drinking in restaurants , because there appeared to be implied the purchase of food with the glass of beer , an echo of the " Raines law sandwich " of unsavory memory . The compromise clarifies this as follows : " Nothing in this chapter contained shall be construed to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Among the definitions contained in the bill is one including apartment hotels where food is being served in a restaurant within the " hotel " definition , thus rendering it legal for them to sell beer . The term " club " is held to include benevolent and fraternal organizations . A " club member " to comply with the terms of the compromise bill must pay annual dues . The 1930 Federal census is to control , in the distinctions , based on population , in the size of license fees . Members of the New York City board are appointed for four-year terms , those of county boards outside of the city for two years . The central control board will have power to remove members of county boards for cause , after giving them an opportunity to be heard in their own defense . There is one exception to the county board 's power to revoke . Where the county board has been divided in passing on an application for a license and where ' the State board has gone over its head in issuing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State board , on its own initiative or on the recommendation of a county board or on complaint from any person , after giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard , can revoke a license . Must Advertise Licenses . There is a provision in the bill under which those obtaining licenses must give public notice of the fact through advertisement in the newspapers . The text of the clause is : " It shall be the duty of every person procuring a license under this chapter , or a renewal thereof , to publish a notice , in a form prescribed by the State board , to the effect that such license has been issued and stating the name of the licensee and the location of the premises licensed , once a week for two successive weeks in a daily or weekly newspaper printed and published in the county in which such premises are located ; provided , however , that in the Counties of New York , Kings , Bronx and Queens such notice shall be published in two such newspapers . " Members of county boards will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fees for attending meetings as follows : In counties with cities of more than , 300,000 inhabitants the board members receive $20 for each meeting they attend , but not in excess of $1,000 in the aggregate in any one year ; in counties with cities of population between 300,000 and 50,000 , $15 for attendance , but not more than $500 in any one year ; in counties with no city with a population in excess of 50,000 the fee is $10 and the annual total not in excess of $350 . The State Central Control Board will pass on the annual budgets on the county boards . Restrictions on Brewers . As in previous bills , brewers are prohibited from having any financial interest in the retail sale of beer or in places selling it . Drug stores , as well as groceries , may supply beer for home consumption . Hotels , restaurants , beer gardens , clubs , railroads and vessels can sell it for consumption . Where a county board divides over the question of a .. ? ense , the State board can act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I at least four members . Not more than three members of the State board shall be of one political party . There is little change in the licensing rates from those established in the earlier beer-control measures which landed on the legislative scrap heap . Brewers must pay $2,500 a year and wholesalers $500 . Retail sellers for off-premise consumption in localities with a population of 1,500 or less , $25 a year ; in more populous localities the annual license will cost $50 . For retail sale with consumption on the premises the rates will be as follows : In cities of 200,000 or more population , $200 , and in other cities , $100 . Vessels will pay $100 and railroads $50 for each car in which beer or wine is sold . Summer hotels can obtain a license good for the Summer months only for $50 . No licenses will be issued to fel-ons , aliens or persons under 21 years of age . Where a license has been revoked following two violations of the control statute , no new license can be issued for a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the premises where the violations occurred . Penalties provided for violations have been tempered somewhat as compared to those contained in preceding measures . All offenses are defined as misdemeanors in the compromise bill , where under previous bills a second offense was defined as a felony . The compromise also provides for suspension of sentences within the discretion of the judge , whereas earlier provisions prohibited such suspension . A fine of not more than $200 or imprisonment for six moahs or both fine and imprisonme fft are the penalties prescribed in the new measure . That applies for selling without a license as well as for other violations . The State Control Board may establish rules , violations of which would constitute a misdemeanor when the rule so explicitly states . The Democratic controlled Senate killed a concurrent resolution which would have continued the life of the Governor 's Commission on Alcoholic Beverage Control Legislation for another year , after it had been adopted by the Assembly . Under the original measure creating it , which now will apply , the life of the commission expired with final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subject to the retail sales tax was indicated tonight .
