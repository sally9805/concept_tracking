RIM OF CHRISTENDOM-Herbert Eugene Bolton-Macmillan ( $5 ) . <P> Eusebio Kino was born in the village of Segno , in the Tyrolese Alps , probably on Aug. 10 , 1645 . Educated in the Jesuit College at Trent , he became a member of the Order in 1665 , studied at Ingolstadt , became a mathematician and cartographer , planned to become a missionary to China . Traveling by way of Genoa to Spain , Kino was ordered to Mexico , shipwrecked , studied the great comet of 1680 , began a long correspondence with the devout Duchess of Aveiro y Arcos before he landed at Vera Cruz on Sept. 25 , 1681 . He died 30 years later in northwestern Mexico after having mapped and explored a great section of New Spain . An energetic , restless , fast-traveling administrator , he introduced wheat-growing and cattle-ranching into the desert areas , became one of the most vital of the Jesuits who kept up the great chain of missions from the head of the Gulf of California to Central America . <P> His maps gave Europe its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely pirated . Late in life Kino wrote his autobiography and , although later Jesuit historians often referred to the book , the manuscript was lost until 1907 , when it was discovered in Mexico City by Herbert Eugene Bolton , professor of history at the University of California . A brisk , concise volume , Kino 's account of his life , together with his " chatty " letters to the Duchess and others , gives one of the clearest pictures available of the daily life in the missions that were established more than 30 years before Jamestown was founded . <P> Professor Bolton now offers a 644-page biography of Kino that brings together the results of more than 30 years of study . It is a strange and pleasant book , complete with maps and long quotations from Kino , in which the story is often interrupted with discussions of the author 's own trips over the routes Kino followed . Retracing Kino 's steps has given Professor Bolton a feeling of familiarity with his hero . He writes of the great explorer informally as " not a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life no " bed of roses " as he struggled with the desert . <P> Rim of Christendom begins with a general account of the work of the Jesuits in New Spain , skips back to Kino 's life , soon settles down to a detailed account of his wanderings ( and Professor Bolton 's ) , with incidental records of Indian rebellions , church intrigue , disputes with provincial authorities . Not a book to be read hastily , it is nevertheless of cumulative interest to readers who enjoy an abundance of facts on which their imaginations can dwell . And industrious Father Kino and Professor Bolton make a pair of travelers whose exploits are likely to remain in the memory long after the book is finished .
