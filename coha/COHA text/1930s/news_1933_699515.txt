txt Abandonment of large amounts of parallel railroad mileage , removal of severe regulation , consolidation on a national basis , if need be , and a paring down in top-heavy capital structures are recommended in the report of the National Transportation Committee made public today . The committee found that all forms of transportation should be subjected to the same regulatory authority , but that the Interstate Commerce Commission was inadequate . Alfred E Smith , in a supplemental report , said that he thought the Interstate Commerce Commission should be abolished . The recommendation with the greatest potentialities was that the roads should abandon unprofitable branch line mileage where the localities are served by more than one carrier . This should permit millions of dollars of savings in operations . Another important suggestion was that railroads be consolidated with the view in mind of eventually having one national system with regional divisions .

Other Nations ' Reports Studied " Commissions more or less similar to this committee have been at . work in England . Canada and the Argentine Republic and we have considered their reports and analyses . There are railroad commissions in nearly every one of our 48 states and similar bodies in many other countries . These , the Interstate Commerce Commission and the very able Congressional committees on these subjects have all been devoting themselves to the problems created by these rapid shifts " Much of this work and a great mass of other data have been assembled and given careful study by the committee . The problem is very complex and while the committee is in substantial agreement as to conclusions , it is too much to expect that four men of independent mental processes would all arrive at decisions by identical paths , or with equal emphasis on various factors .
