txt Fairyland in New York . To the Editor of The New York Times : I was in Fairyland the other evening  --  in the middle of Central Park , with a throng of people on each side of me . Of their existence I was unaware . I only knew I was listening to soft , beautiful music which seemed to talk if one would permit his intuition to listen . I only knew there were myriads of stars in a deep blue sky that twinkled in a friendly way . A short distance away black trees ' gently swaying in the warm air were dancing for my enjoyment . The lighted dome of a near-by apartment house was my castle . And I was monarch of all I surveyed ! How very fortunate we New ' Yorkers are ! One might say we have everything one could wish for just a block from our homes . Yet how few take advantage of them ! With these days of depression , when expenses concerning enjoyment must be curtailed , what should be more proper and natural than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all mankind in the enjoyment of good music ! The Summer season is almost with us , and that means the coming of the bands into our parks to play for us . Wo n't you come and listen  --  and share my Fairyland with me ? ALMA L. ZULEEG . New York , June 2 , 1932.
