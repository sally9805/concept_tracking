Day after the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby ( 1932 ) , U. S. radio listeners first heard Harold Thomas Henry ( Boake ) Carter 's news comments on a national hookup . Long before the baby 's body had been found , Commentator Carter had become the British baritone Cassandra of news broadcasting , cloaking his accounts of daily events in a tone of dark menace . Last year a menace vague as his own rose over the Boake Carter broadcasts , has hovered there ever since . <P> Commentator Carter talked himself into trouble with C. I. O. unions . Pickets marched in front of Station WCAU ( Philadelphia ) where he did his broadcasting , and it was persistently rumored that his five-year-long association with his sponsor , the Philco Radio &; Television Corp. , would not outlast the contract then in effect . At the beginning of 1938 Newscaster Carter and Philco parted company . Promptly he was signed by General Foods to broadcast for Huskies and Post Toasties . Thereupon Philadelphia 's C. I. O. Council passed a boycott resolution against General Foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and union leaders , he announced that he would refrain from any direct comment on labor . Said he : " It takes two to make an argument , and I wo n't argue . " <P> Because Marjorie Post Davies , wife of New Deal Ambassador Joseph E. Davies , was a director of General Foods , there were dark hints that the New Deal had gagged Boake Carter , whose crusty comments have had a decidedly agin-the-government tang . But General Foods President Colby M. Chester is stanchly anti-New Deal . Last week , when it was announced that Boake Carter would say his last General Foods cheerio August 26 , the rumors grew louder . Official reason for failure to renew the contract : The change from Daylight Saving Time would bring the broadcasts to western radios at 4:30 p. m. , too early an hour for most listeners , and better time is not available on any nationwide network .
