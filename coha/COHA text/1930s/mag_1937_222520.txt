BULWARK OF THE REPUBLIC-Burton J. Hendrick-Little , Brown ( $3.50 ) . <P> England has its Royal Family , the U. S. its Constitution . Both have been much amended , even temporarily abrogated ( though in the U. S. only partly ) . Which is the more sacred it would be difficult to say , but it would be harder to imagine England without its Royal Family than the U. S. without its Constitution . Last week , as in every week since President Roosevelt announced his intention of " revivifying " the Supreme Court , the Constitution was front-page news . In Washington and Philadelphia publicity-wise politicians were making capital of the grand old document 's 150th anniversary . And last week appeared a timely , eminently readable history of the U. S. Constitution to show thoughtful readers what lay back of the headlines . <P> Author Hendrick was no petty popularizer , rushing into print to meet a political opportunity or beat the Liberty Bell . Neither New Dealers nor Republicans could make resounding political copy of his book , but New Dealers are sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's epic song is : Fear not . The Constitution has survived much worse storms than this one , is not really so much a bulwark as a life-raft- " a living and fluid instrument , built not for an age , but for all time , responsive to the needs of a changing world . " He reminds gloomy headshakers that the U. S. Government has outlasted every European form of the last 150 years . <P> The Constitution 's history , as Mr. Hendrick reads it , is " from Nationalism to Nationalism . " In 1787 the Founding Fathers compromised on a nationalistic form that was a body-blow to the Jeffersonians , State Righters , disbelievers in a strong central government . Today the Constitution is again the instrument of aroused Nationalism . " The new American government now in process of formation . . . really amounts to an attempt to create a new American world . . . . What may fairly be said is that the five decisions rendered by the Supreme Court on April 12 , 1937 , create a new United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now so sweeping that the Republic , in matters of industry , perhaps of agriculture , has become an integrated nation . Or possibly it should be said that , if these pronouncements do not in themselves create such a new society , others will presently do so , for the same process of reasoning , and the same spirit of accommodation to events , that have extended the meaning of the Constitution to this point can easily push it into new fields . " The Federal Government has already assumed responsibilities undreamed of a few generations ago : " It gives financial relief to millions of unfortunates ; it clears the slums in cities , assists the people in building homes , pays off the mortgages on the farm , constructs roads , parks , bridges and transportation systems for localities , subsidizes Federal theatres , promotes literary and scientific research , furnishes amusement for the masses , and finances lighting plants and an infinite variety of public works .
