This development was regarded as indicating the existence of heavy Continental demand for all grains , due to generally below-average crops abroad . Yesterday 's foreign wheat purchases also came from Antwerp and Rotterdam sources and activity was confined largely to Gulf ports . However , Rotterdam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manitoba ( Canadian ) wheat Tuesday were estimated at 2.000,000 bushels , exported principally to the United Kingdom , although there were some purchases for the Continent .
