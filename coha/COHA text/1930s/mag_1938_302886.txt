Whenever U. S. citizens are asked to contribute to the Red Cross by whoever at the time happens to be U. S. President , the prestige of his great office has usually been enough to turn the trick . U. S. citizens have responded to Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's appeal that they give the Red Cross $1,000,000 for the succor of the Chinese people by contributing to date some $120,000 . <P> One reason for this apathetic response was that the President 's appeal in January was soon blanketed by subsequent world headlines . Another reason was that the chairmanship of the Red Cross has been vacant since the death of Admiral Grayson . Last week President Roosevelt persuaded his grey and graceful Ambassador-at-Large , Norman Hezekiah Davis , to take the vacant post . <P> The Japanese Red Cross has saved charitable U. S. citizens large sums since the beginning of the war in China by answering in the negative a question by the American Red Cross as to whether it needed money . Japanese gratefully accepted $10,000,000 from the American Red Cross at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel able to stand on the feet of the Japanese Red Cross . <P> The Chinese Red Cross , ever since China was invaded , has been thankfully accepting from the American Red Cross sums which now total $370,000 . Of this $100,000 was appropriated by the American Red Cross from its general fund before the Roosevelt appeal , and another $100,000 was added from the same source early this month . Private donations prior to the appeal amounted to about $50,000 . Chairman Davis keeps hearing from U. S. friends of China that , whereas Japan got $10,000,000 after her earthquake , the American Red Cross in the last three decades has sent only about $3,000,000 to succor Chinese flood and famine victims , and only one eighth as much has gone to China in her present hour of need . Already the British Red Cross and the Lord Mayor of London 's fund have raised and sent $500,000 , and various U. S. organizations including church groups have sent $1,000,000 , so that the American Red Cross is very much upon its mettle . It is handicapped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself initiates formal drives for foreign causes , depending on appeals like the President 's to bring in the funds . <P> Thus far the civil war in Spain has been no major problem to the Red Cross , for the reason that both Leftists &; Rightists have so many well-organized , passionate , money-collecting friends . U. S. citizens have donated just $1,054 to their Red Cross specifically for Spain . The International Red Cross has received $57,000 from the American Red Cross for Spanish succor , dispassionately divided between Rightists &; Leftists . The American Red Cross spent $41,000 repatriating U. S. citizens caught in Spain by the war and unable to escape by their own efforts . Some of the very ablest mercy work of the Spanish civil war has been done by the American Friends Service Committee , the Quaker organization to which Mrs. Roosevelt gives her radio earnings . The Friends have spent $50,000 in Spain for non-combatants on both sides of the line , giving and doing wherever the need arises .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
