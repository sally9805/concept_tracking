Aunt Tryntje to get out some of the old photograph albums . I 'd go myself , but I 'm expecting John Davis in about his mortgage . Wo n't you leave your dog here , Miss Gilbert ? He 'd be no trouble . " " Oh , no , thanks , he always goes with me . " " I 'll be enchanted to go , " said Adrian , laying down an inkless pen . " Tell Mr. Davis , will you , Father , to pass the word along to Dirck that the tennis courts are about ready to work on . " He used this as a gambit to start talk as they walked down the front steps . " Do you play tennis , Miss Gilbert ? " " Yes , I play . Not so well as my sister . She 's quite an expert  --  won the Middle Western ladies ' championship last year . " She spoke in a correct , colorless manner . " Yes , " thought Adrian , " her conversation is like what I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But at that moment Mr. Fort put his head through the side window of the Bank and called , " Oh , Adrian , hold on a minute . I wonder if Miss Gilbert could n't stay to have lunch with us . We 'd be so glad to have you , Miss Gilbert . And I 'll get my aunt to set out the spoons with the Van Benthuysen initials on them . Your mother always ate with those when she had meals with us . " The girl glanced at Adrian almost as if consulting him about what to answer . No , it could n't be her accent , he decided , that made her seem appealing , for she seemed so now and she had n't said a word . Perhaps it was a trick of turning her head . At any rate he was moved to say hastily and heartily , " Yes , do stay . " " Thank you , " she called back to the older Adrian , hanging out of the window ; " I 'll be glad to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a kind man , " she said . Adrian saw in the turn of her phrase an opportunity to exhibit a small verbal neatness . " Father does n't seem anything he 's not , " he said lightly . " He is a kind man . " At this she looked for an instant straight at him , said , " Does n't he ? " in an enigmatic accent and looked away again . Adrian was so taken aback that he was on the point of asking stupidly , " Does n't who ? " when in a polite tone , " Where is your house ? " she asked him . " I ca n't make connections with her at any point , " thought Adrian . " What in the world was all that about ? " Aloud he an/swered , " That low gray stone one across the Square , with the locust trees about it . " Like a swallow swerving suddenly upward , her voice broke into fresh personal vividness . " Oh . . . locusts ! Why , I believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees were locusts ! " " There are plenty of them all around , " said Adrian . " Probably the ones you remember are those in Cousin Constance 's back yard . " " Why ! Are they still there ? " asked the girl . Adrian laughed . " You make me feel like my father . It 's not so long since you were a little girl . Not long enough for a tree even to notice . " " I suppose . . . I never thought of it before . . . " her voice dropped to a solemn lower note . . . " Does Aunt Connie 's house still stand ? " " Sure it does , " said the young man , finding this naivete unexpectedand pleasing . " There it is , down the street , the fourth house on the right . What would you think could happen to it ? " " I ca n't make you understand , " said the girl , " how strange it seems to me that it has been here , really , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . It 's like  --  as if you saw there had been all along another dimension to things . Why , the first thing I can remember is Aunt Connie 's tulip bed . " " We can go over and see if any tulips are out in it now , " said the young man . " Or no , we 'd better go first and tell Aunt Tryntje about lunch . " " Is that a real name ? " asked the girl . " Well , sort of real . Katherine 's a great family name around here . The Dutch liked it . And Katrintje is short for Katherine , and Tryntje 's short for that . Aunt Tryntje 's great on old-time ways and it suits her to have the same nickname her **34;206;TOOLONG had . Her real name is Miss Katherine Brinckerhoff Van den Bogert . " " Goodness gracious ! " murmured the girl , smiling . It was the first time her seriousness had been broken . She looked very nice and young when she let herself smile , Adrian thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told her . " You are certainly a relative of hers . Anyhow everybody 's called her Aunt Tryntje so long she 's probably forgotten she has any other name . "  | " I know , " said the young lady ; " when you said just now at the Bank that I must be Penelope Gilbert it sounded like somebody else . I 'm always called Matey . " " Matey ! " said Adrian . " What a nice nickname . I never knew a Matey . " " Why do you find it nice ? " she asked in what was evidently a sincere wonder . " A good many people find it rather silly-sounding , I think . " " Oh , what it seems to mean . Comradely . Somebody who shares things with you . Shipmate on the voyage of life . . . that sort of thing . " She considered . " Well , I never thought before of any meaning to it . I always took it just like any name . . . such as Gladys or Bernice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her with feeling , " to rescue you from Gladys or Bernice . I would hate to think of anybody being stranded for life on one of those swampy malarious islets . " This time she laughed out loud . " How ridiculous ! " she said , appreciatively . Adrian thought to himself , " I sort of like this girl . " He decided that he went on liking her , later , as she sat opposite Aunt Tryntje in their living-room , a photograph album on her knee , listening to Aunt Tryntje 's exposition of her ancestry and its ramifications . Several times he thought he had detected her eyelids flickering down over her quiet eyes to hide amusement . And so , when the old lady turned her back on them to look for yet another daguerreotype , he caught the girl 's eye , expecting her as a matter of course to exchange with him a smile over Aunt Tryntje 's genealogical mania . But she did not allow herself to understand this invitation to laugh at her old hostess , and returnednothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's a nice girl ! " thought Adrian . He looked at her with respect which he soon forgot in his pleasure over a faint light striking up on the shadowed side of her face which brought out the details of the low-relief modeling in her cheek . The light was reflected , he noticed , from his father 's old Montaigne , glossy with long handling , which lay on the table beside her . " And now , " said Aunt Tryntje , " I hope I 've got you all straightened out about the way the Smiths are related to the I-lowlands . Just remember about those English names in theP103family , Whiteley and Russell and Smith  --  they were Quakers driven out of New England , every one of them . But not the Browns . They 'd gone to Holland first  --  well , well , I must n't go into that now . It 's your turn . Do tell me about your family . " She turned to Adrian . " Does n't she look a little like Cousin Mary Howland ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far apart and rather deep . Cousin Mary 's mother was a LeRoy , you know , and the LeRoy eyes are all . . " " Well , " said Adrian judiciously , " as I only remember Cousin Mary when she weighed two hundred and twenty and wore a wig . . . " The visitor broke into laughter . Adrian guessed that she had been for some time longing for a decent excuse to laugh . " Oh , to be sure , " said Aunt Tryntje , " I forgot you were n't your father . " She turned back to the visitor , " I do really want to know all your news . " " I do n't know where to begin , " said the girl . " I never met anybody who was in the least interested in my family as such . Most people I know have n't any idea whether I have any family , beyond the members they see once in a while . " " For mercy 's sake , child , where have you lived ? " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visitor without enthusiasm . " You were in Corinth , were n't you , when your father died ? " " Why , did you all know about us ? " exclaimed the girl , startled . " I should hope I would n't lose all track of Martha Whiteley'sgrandchildren . Your grandmother Whiteley was my first cousin , and my favorite relative . Well , go on , did you stay on long inCorinth ? " " We stayed another year there , till I graduated . Then I went to France for a year 's study . I have some old friends in Paris , a French family . I have stayed with them more or less ever since I was a little girl . I like them all very much and one of the daughters is my best friend . I lived with them that year and studied at the Sorbonne . When I came back I got a position in the French department at Western Reserve University . Teaching French seems the easiest thing , of course , for my sister and me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " The girl paused as if thinking what words to use . " No , I have usually lived in boarding-houses . Mother . . . after Father 's death o . . Mother became very much absorbed by her church . The Church we went to in Corinth was very ritualistic and . . . " She stooped down to where her little dog sat , and stroked his shoulder thoughtfully as she went on , " I find I hardly know how to speak of these things . Nobody among my acquaintancesin the places where I 've lived lately ever knew enough about us to ask . And my brother and sister knew , anyhow , so we did n't need to talk about them among ourselves . " She made this statement soberly in a matter-of-fact tone , but Adrian said to himself , with conviction , " It 's her eyes that make her seem appealing . " And then remembered with surprise that he had found them guarded and cold . " Perhaps I ought n't to have asked you about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , no , I think it 's sweet , you caring to know , " said the girl , " and there is nothing troubling about it , or hard to speak of . Mother just became more and more absorbed by the church services . There are a good many of them in a High Church . You know . " " No , I do n't ; we are all Friends , " said Aunt Tryntje firmly . Then , seeing that the girl did not understand , she explained , " Yes , I know , it does seem odd , Forts and Van den Bogerts being Quakers , but my mother was a Willetts , you know . " " Oh , " said the girl , lowering her eyelids for a moment . She went on , " Well , there are a great many services , for the different church seasons and hours of the day . Enough to take up about all one 's time . They seemed a great comfort to Mother , though she 'd never cared much about going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A what ? " asked Aunt Tryntje . " A sister , you know , in a Church Order . An Order that runs an orphanage near Corinth . That was where she went to live . She seemed always very busy and satisfied , and we children were so glad for her . " " But . . . " said Aunt Tryntje , " but . . . " She looked up at the ceiling as if making an inner calculation , murmured , " Hmmm , the Van Benthuysens are all mystics . But Jessica never . . . " Looking back at the girl , she asked with the privileged bluntness of old age , " Was there some person in the Order she . . . thought a good deal of ? " With a look of surprise , the girl answered , " Yes , she had come be great friends with the Mother Superior . "   " Oh , " said Aunt Tryntje . " Of course , friendships are n't allowed in religious orders very much , and once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . What interested Mother most was running the business part of their orphanage . She was wonderful at that . " " Well . . . " said Aunt Tryntje , and then , " How about your brother and sister ? " The visitor began , " Priscilla is in . . . " and was interrupted by an exclamation from Aunt Tryntje . " Oh , they did name her Priscilla , did n't they ? " " Yes , " said the visitor , again surprised . She waited for an explanation , but Aunt Tryntje merely said , " Nothing . It 's not one of the family names like yours , that 's all . Go on . " " Priscilla has taught French in a girls ' school near Chicago for quite a time . It 's a private school , sort- of finishing seminary , not very serious teaching , but she gets a much larger salary than I , than any college teacher . " " What is she like ? " " Well , she 's tall and blonde and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls abroad in the summer . That pays very well . We 've all been abroad a good deal . In France , that is , because of Father 's work , and now ours . " " Is size High Church and religious ? " inquired Aunt Tryntje . " Oh , no , not a bit ! " said the girl hastily . And paused an instantas if startled by some unexpected thought . But she added no qualification to her statement . " And your brother ? " " He graduated from the Harvard Law School the year Father died . And he 's in a law firm in Pittsburgh . " " Pittsburgh ! " cried Aunt Tryntje . " Why Pittsburgh ? " " Well , one of his classmates was a Pittsburgh fellow whose father is a successful lawyer there . Francis used to go to visit them in the vacations a good deal . They all liked him in the family . People do generally . And the father gave Francis a chance in his firm . He 's doing very well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you sound like an independent , successful set of modern young people , well prepared to take care of yourselves in the world , " said Aunt Tryntje admiringly , " as though you were getting whatever you wanted out of life . " ( " No , she 's not ! " cried Adrian to himself with instant cer-tainty . ) P1o6 " Is your brother married ? " asked Aunt Tryntje . " Not yet , " said the girl . For the first time there was a little dryness in her accent . Adrian took this for a sign that she had stood about all of Aunt Tryntje that could be expected . He rose to his feet . " I promised Miss Gilbert to take her over to Cousin Constance 's to see if the tulips are out there . She thinks she remembersthem . " " That must have been when you were sent on to her by yourself to stay with her in ' 87 , " said Aunt Tryntje accurately . " I remember you very well  --  one of the nicest little four-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as good a time living as a kitten or a puppy . Once she told me , ' Matey 's little face is like a nasturtium blossom . ' And now is n't it like some thing in a book  --  an English book , I mean  --  the way she left this money to you ? I hope my nephew told you what she said , I want that child to have some money all her own to do just what she wants with , without anybody 's approval or consent . By the time she 's twenty-four , she 'll know what that is . ' That was her age , you know , when she wanted so much to go away to study medicine . I suppose that 's why she did n't want you to know about it till that age . " ( " Can you beat it ! " thought Adrian . " First mention of that cash . . . not made by the heiress , at that ! " ) Aunt Tryntje was running on , " We 've wondered , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was some special thing you 'd set your heart on , as she had . " She waited for an answer to this . Their visitor turned her face away and seemed to look fixedly at a steel engraving of Washingtonon the wall . She murmured in a very low voice , " I should say that the matter with me is that there is nothing I want very much to do . " It sounded as though she had not intended to say this aloud , Adrian felt a hasty impulse to help her pass over what was perhapsan inadvertent confession . But was that really what she had said ? Perhaps he had imagined it as the sum total of his impression of her . At any rate , on the chance that she would like to have the subject changed , he said prosaically , " It 's not enough money to do anything with ! Not half so much as it seemed , probably , to a person of Cousin Constance 's generation . What , in this anno Domini of 1907 could anybody do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are people living in comfort on that in Rustdorf , this minute , " said Aunt Tryntje with dignity . " Then I 'll put it , what , could unfortunate people forced to live out of Rustdorf do with it ? " amended Adrian . Had the girl really said that , or had he imagined it ? " Well , take her along to Constance 's house anyhow , " said Aunt Tryntje , looking at the clock and letting Adrian have his point . " Peter Russell has taken the children off to Fonteynkill today and the house is shut up . " She explained to the girl , " Constance 's nephew Peter Russell inherited the house . His wife died a year or so ago , leaving him with a great batch of little girls to bring up . The forlornest old widower you ever saw . He was too old to get married in the first place , and now to be left alone with a family  --  ! Two of the children are delicate in health , too . " She turned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard . Penelope , would thee like to leave thy little dog here .. for I 'm not going to go on calling Cousin Martha 's granddaughter Miss , ' nor saying you ' as if thee were a stranger . " ( " How can Aunt Tryntje not have noticed what that dog is to her ? " Adrian asked himself impatiently . ) " Oh , I 'd like very much to have you call me by my first name , " the girl was saying . " But no , thanks , Sumner always goes with me . " " Sumner ! " thought Adrian . As they went down the steps and along the walk , Aunt Tryntje from the front door was calling instructions to Adrian . " Do n't forget to show her the Washington house , and the house where Aunt Dina died , and tell her what Rustdorf means , and that it should be Rustdorp , and point out Barnegat . . . " Her voice died away as they advanced across the Square . " Aunt Tryntje 's a pippin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw anybody in the least like her , " said the girl . " I 'll bet you never did ! " said Adrian . The girl answered steadfastly , " No , I did n't mean it that way , " and turned the conversation , asking , " What was that she said about saying you ' as though I were a stranger ? " " Oh , she 's one of the older Friends who still adhere to plain speech . ' " At the look of bewilderment in his listener 's face he laughed and explained , " In Quaker language plain speech ' does n't mean saying disagreeable things and admiring yourself for being honest , but the use of thee ' for you . ' " io8 THE DEEPENING STREAM " Oh , yes , I remember , I 've heard about that , " said Miss Gilbert . " Like the French use of tu . " I know an elder or two who would n't enjoy hearing you compareit to French usage , " remarked Adrian . " Do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most younger Friends do n't much , any more , except maybe for little children . I try to remember to do it for Aunt Tryntje , because she does n't like it if I do n't . " " It sounds picturesque , " said the visitor . " That 's no better than comparing it to the French ! " Adrian warned her . She looked amused and asked another question , " What is the Washington house ' ? Where he slept overnight ? " " No . Rustdorf antiquity has n't any such violent episodes as that . This is a house in front of which he stopped his horse and asked a little girl in the front yard if she would give him a drink of water from the well . But she happened to be one of our great-grandmothers . yours too , of course . . . so we are all brought up on what he said and what she said , and what was the color of his horse 's tail , and so on . " " A great-grandmother of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's nothing to hear , although as she grew older it took her longer and longer to tell it . My father , as a little boy , often heard her . She had worked out a peroration which never varied  --  And then President Washington bowed over his saddle  --  thank God/ I remembered to courtesy/  --  and riding magnificently , as he did everything , disappeared from my sight . But not from my mind . To have looked into the living eyes of a man greater in character than Julius Caesar or Napoleon . . . it gave me an undying faith in the human race . ' " " That 's a nice peroration , " said the girl . " Here , this is the house . Aunt Tryntje will be sure to ask you about it . That 's why this is called Washington Street . " he looked at the muddy ruts and added , " Some day we 're going to pave it , too , in his honor . " They stopped before a story-and-a-half white house , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but freshly painted , with ruffled curtains at the little windows , and a huge lilac bush guarding the low door . " Well , so he was , greater in character than Julius Caesar or Napoleon ! " said the girl , looking at the house . " Which way was he going ? "   " Back toward New York from a visit to Poughkeepsie , " said Adrian  --  " that way . " The girl followed the direction of his finger and looked down the elm-bordered street , arched over with early-Gothic twigtracery . " It 's absurd , " she said to her companion with a grimace of the lips which looked French to Adrian . " Absurd , how I hear the beat of a horse 's hoofs , unhurried and regular , down at the end of the road , and see a man 's back , very broad , very straight ... Its the first time I believed that George Washington ever really existed . From now on I too shall have more faith in our race . " " It needs all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He added , " It 's odd , your finding any interest in such a flat little historical incident , when you 've been in France so much . " " My great-grandmother did n't live in France , " said the girl . " Was n't it nice that she did n't forget to make her courtesy ? " " Ah , you 're real Rustdorf ! " cried Adrian , laughing . He asked curiously , " Did n't your father or mother ever tell you any of these stories ? How did you escape ? " " Oh , they were n't at all the kind of people who think of oldtimestories . They were both very active , absorbed in the present . We were all of us very busy . Mother did tell us a few . I remember one about a grandmother of hers who used to tell that in 1817 as a child of five she walked alone to town to see the traveling waxworks . Mother said that she wore a new pair of green morocco shoes and a new . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new plaid linen dress , home-grown , home-spun , woven , dyed , and made . And at the waxworks she saw Captain Cook devoured by the cannibals , Pocahontas saving the life of John Smith , the Sleeping Beauty , and the Witch of Endor , raising  --  " He was rewarded by hearing her laugh out , loud and free , as she had in the house . " You 'll believe now perhaps that we are twigs on the same tree . I can cap any story you begin . Do you know the one about the children  --  our great-uncles , I daresay  --  who were picking up apples to eat and because it was a Sunday afternoon thought they were as wicked as the go up , baldhead ' children , and set a little brother to watch for bears ? Which ones did your father tell you ? " She shot a look at him from under her lashes and said , " The only thing he ever said about Rustdorf was that he would n't be caught dead in it for half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wonder , " Adrian queried as he laughed , " that you suppressed that particular family reminiscence when you were answering Aunt Tryntje 's questions ? For a newcomer , you  --  " She cut him short . " That 's the queer thing . I do n't feel like a newcomer . Less than ever in my life . It sounds foolish , literary , made up  --  but almost from the first I 've felt as though I 'd come back to a "  --  after a hesitation her voice changed so that Adrian felt as though she had moved closer to him as they walked  --  " to a place I 'd always known , to people near to me . And that 's strange . For I 've never known any place very well . Nor people either . The only other people who seem to reach back into my past and sort of connect together the different parts of my life are a family of friends in Paris  --  but I remember , I told you about them in the house . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this out abruptly , without having in the least intended to . " You are ? " said the girl , surprised . " Do you teach French , too ? " " No ! heavens , no ! You ought to hear me speak it . I was studyingpainting there . " He had not meant to say this , either . " Oh , you are an artist , " said the girl . " No , I 'm not , " he answered , " I found that out . That 's why I came back . " What under the sun possessed him to do this ? He had not said so much to any soul in Rustdorf ! Good heavens ! He had told it all , all there was to tell ! He shrank with a raw soreness from any rejoinder she could possibly make , and began hastily to tell himself not to blame her for saying the wrong thing since he he d put her in a position where there was no right thing to say . Walking thoughtfully by his side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing silence . When Adrian finally glanced at her , he found she was looking at him  --  seeing him this time . Their eyes met . He thought wildly , as he bent to open the gate in the hedge , " Why , she has magnificent eyes . " They had arrived . He pushed open the gate and led the way around to the back of the old house . " I remember more than I thought ! " said the visitor behind him . " I remember perfectly that side door in two parts . I was too little to unlatch the lower part , and when I got on a chair itp111seemed more fun to wriggle over and drop down outside . It 's exactly like going back to the beginning of life and starting all over again ! " They turned the corner of the house and saw before them a slope of lawn , a few tall , leafless trees , the wide bare river in the distance . Several tulips stood like little painted flames beside the path . " Oh ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little run , stopped , one hand at her temple in a startled attitude , and then moved slowly on . Adrian thought it discreet to leave her to whatever memories of things past were set before her by the scene . He moved to one side and sat down on a bench . The little fox-terrier , who with his usual self-effacement had been trotting noiselessly at their heels , instead of following his mistress down the lawn , turned aside and jumped up beside him . Adrian felt a shock of pleasure . He put his arm around the old fellow . It was extraordinary , he thought , what a liking he had taken at sight to that dog . The little lean warm body felt positivelydear to him . And what an original , suitable name Sumner was ! He looked down deep into the dog 's eyes . They were all right , for a dog . But how limited and animal-like any dog 's eyes are , compared to the awe-inspiring revelation of personality which human eyes can give ! The girl came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves and now dropped them on the bench beside him . Adrian resisted with difficulty an impulse to pick up one of them and draw it through his fingers . He looked down fixedly at the little soft huddle of gray suede , wondering if they were still warm from her hands . He tightened his clasp on . the dog . The girl was standing close beside him , but he did not look up at her , having an obscure fear of what might happen if he did . He felt her stir . he heard her voice , crying out the thought that was knocking at his own heart , " Why , this is incredible ! All of it ! " P112cc W ELL , I do n't know when I 've seen a nicer girl , " said AuntTryntje , as she poured the second cups of tea thatevening . " They need n't tell me that all modern young people are mannerless and uncivilized . Those with Dutchess County blood , bring them up where you will and how you will , show their ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two had gone back to the bank , when I had her to myself . " " Yes , I found her attractive , " said the older Adrian . " With a real family look , too , " said Aunt Tryntje . " Oh , yes , very much so . That breadth of low forehead , and the distance between her gray eyes . It gives them the honest look I always like . " " I told thee , Adrian , she had LeRoy eyes , " triumphed Aunt Tryntje . " She mentioned having bad headaches . Now all the teRoys have that trouble with headaches . " But Adrian knew by his father 's voice that he had not been thinking of the LeRoys but of his daughter who had died , Adrian 's little sister whom he could not remember , who would have been grown up now and might have helped to fill the place left by their mother . " No , all is not vanity , " thought Adrian , looking at his father . " Adrian , when thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her the story about Speck Zyn Kill ? " " No , Aunt Tryntje , I did n't . The conversation did n't seem torun naturally toward Speck . " " Did thee show her where the old landing-slip had been ? " " We went to look at the river while we waited for her train . I 'm not sure I remembered to point out the old slip . " " Well , did thee at least tell her that Dutchess County was always freehold land  --  never any patroon foolishness ? " " No , it slipped my mind . Something else must have come up . " Adrian thought he was pronouncing these commonplace words in the most casual of tones . But he had a notion that his father pricked an ear . Now was the time , he thought , to slide into some other topic , to ask his father if he had remembered to speak to Dirck 's father about the tennis.  |p113So  he asked , putting the question to them both , " What is that slight accent of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accent ? " said Aunt Tryntje in surprise . " What is thee talking about ? She had no more accent than I. She spoke very nicely , I thought , not chewing and swallowing her words as young people do nowadays . I could hear every syllable . " " No , I do n't think I noticed any accent , " said his father judicially , after thinking a moment . To himself Adrian said , " Now this is enough ! " Aloud he asked , " Nice little dog of hers , was n't he ? " Aunt Tryntje dissented again . " Now that was the only thing I did n't quite like about her . That dog . I thought she acted a little foolish about him . I do n't like people who are foolish about their animals . It means a soft streak . In every other way she seemed such a sensible girl . " " I should n't say she had much of a soft streak , " remarked the older Adrian in a noncommittal tone . The meal was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living-room . Adrian 's father sat down at once withthe Poughkeepsie Evening Enterprise . " I 'm safe , " thought Adrian , getting out his pipe , " and just about time ! " He planned to ask his father a question about the campaign for the mayoralty of Poughkeepsie , just then beginning . " Did you notice a sort of appealing quality about that Miss Gilbert ? " he blurted out helplessly . His father lowered the newspaper and looked over it at Adrian . " Well , at least I 'm too old to blush , " thought Adrian in exasperation , keeping his eyes on his pipe . " No , I did n't think she was at all appealing , " said his father , after considering the matter . " I should have said that appealingnessbelonged to another generation of girls . She struck me as a singularly self-possessed young woman . Not unattractively so . I liked her . I liked the way she took the news of that bequest . Rather unusual in my experience . Yet that might have come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed rather a dry personality for anybody so young . " He waited a moment . Adrian made no audible comment , although in his heart he was crying out wrathfully , " Dry ! " He was lost in consternation over the insensitive dullness of the older generation . The older Adrian lifted his newspaper and went on reading.  | Adrian struck a match , lighted his pipe , and reached for the book nearest him . It was the old brown Montaigne which had cast a reflected light upon the suave low relief of that young cheek . He glanced from it  --  a natural sequence of memory  --  at the steel engraving on the wall before him , to which their visitor had raised her beautiful gray eyes . As he looked , George Washington'sbroad inexpressive face of putty became sensitive , young , looked back at him kindly . Had she really spoken those disheartenedwords ? Or had he dreamed them ? It seemed important to him that he should know , as if it would make a vital difference in his life . Well , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went through into the old kitchen where she was putting the dishes together in readiness for Rebecca , the colored woman who " came in mornings . " But now , he who had been able to speak of nothing else could not bring out a single word . Aunt Tryntje began to tell him eagerly , the fourth time he had heard it , about the recent discovery of five letters , mostly legible , received from Loyalists who had emigrated to Nova Scotia at the end of the Revolution . Aunt Tryntje thought such Loyalists unjustlyneglected by Americans . These letters , she told Adrian , settled once for all the question of who had been second in commandon that expedition . " Good God , who cares ? " thought Adrian indignantly . Aloud he said , " Thee must find such papers very interesting . " He was anxious to keep Aunt Tryntje in a good temper . He stood awkwardly , bored by the necessity of paying enough attention to those papers to answer Aunt Tryntje , irritably watchingevery motion of her hands , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have it . Aunt Tryntje said repeatedly , " There now , that 'll do for tonight , " in the pleasantly satisfied voice of housekeeping women when surveying something that comes up to their standards . And repeatedly darted at some last thing , " Just let me hang up this dishcloth ! " or " Oh , I have n't put out the milk bottles . " They both finally went back into the living-room . Adrian had let his pipe go out . And he had not asked his question . Abruptly he said , " Aunt Tryntje , when thee asked Miss Gilbert if there was something she 'd specially set her heart on , to do with Cousin Constance 's money  --  " " Yes  --  " prompted Aunt Tryntje .   " What did she answer ? " The words were out , thundering as they came . Aunt Tryntje considered , " Yes , I remember asking her that . What did she answer ? Did she really answer at all ? " She shook her head . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just then , and I remembered I had n't said anything to Rebecca about an extra person to lunch . " " Ah , " said Adrian . He took up the Montaigne again . Aunt Tryntje knitted peaceably . Presently she began to murmur in a low hum , as if thinking aloud , " Mmmm  --  funny  --  Jessica a nun  --  mmmmm  --  Van Benthuysen  --  Abby  --  iIarietta  --  " her thoughts dropped below the level of audibility . They rose again with some emphasis to clearer speech as she answered herself with decision , " No , zna'am ! Do n't tell me ! Jessica was no mystic . That Mother Superior  --  " Adrian laid down his book to laugh . " Why not admit the possibility that she was converted to a more spiritual life ? " The old knitter looked up , startled . " Have I been talking to myself again ! Mercy ! How like Aunt Anna that is ! I was just thinking over what Jessica 's daughter told  --  " she stopped with a look of alarm and asked quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , various charitable speculations as to some sordid motive for Mrs. Gilbert 's going into a sisterhood , " replied Adrian . She looked relieved . " Oh , that 's all . I was trying to think if I 'd ever known Jessica to show her Van Benthuysen blood . It was her grandmother , thee knows , who 's recorded on the Reformed Church books as a member of this church but somewhat given to enthusiasms . ' " Adrian had heard this story so often that he ignored it now . " Does n't it seem rather queer , " he asked , " that her parents had n't told her anything about Rustdorf , apparently hardly mentioned the name of the place ? Come to think of it , I wonder why they did n't ever stop off , between trains , sometime . They must have passed through dozens of times . " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Aunt Tryntje casually , neutrally . As she never spoke either casually or neutrally , Adrian wondered what she was keeping from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldstop for , once Constance was dead and her money bequeathed ? " Adrian 's father looked over the top of his newspaper . " She was a person I used to find touching , " he said .   " Adrian , how can thee say that ? Thee never could abide Jessica , " said his aunt . " I did n't say I liked her . I found her touching . Did n't thee ever feel a sort of uneasiness about her ? As if she were . . . yes , I know that pile-driver way she had of going after what she wanted , but in spite of that . . . really uncertain of the value of everything she did ? Dependent on what other people thought of it , maybe ? Yes , probably needed to feel backed up , approved of . The kind of woman who needs to be treated with great magnanimityif she 's to develop any inner life of her own . " He sighed , held up his paper , and remarked behind it , " But as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After a few minutes he put down his paper again , asking himself with resigned self-contempt , " What makes me waste my time over newspapers ? " " Aunt Tryntje , " he went on , " what would thee think of inviting Jessica 's daughter to make us a visit this summer ? She seems pleasant , and it might do us good to have another young person around . Would it make much trouble ? " " Well , it might be nice . I could think about it . I suppose the room over the wing would do for summer . " " How about you , Adrian ? " asked his father . " Oh , I guess it would be all right , " said Adrian , taking his pipe out of his mouth . " She said she plays tennis . I suppose we could get up some doubles . " He put his pipe back into his mouth and went on looking at the page before him . " Let me have a little time to approach Rebecca about it , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older Adrian ; " we 're only in April now . " He wandered toward the piano and turned over the music on it . " Will it bother thee if I try something here ? " he asked . " Not a bit , I love to hear thee pounding away , " said Aunt Tryntje kindly . He played stiffly , with middle-aged , not very expert fingers , but with ( so Adrian often thought ) a certain sense of what it was all about that made his occasional false notes and halting tempo not very important . Just now he was feeling his way through a Bach Invention that looked simpler on the page than it was . After that he played , making a much more presentable job of it , a graceful MacDowell " Woodland Sketch . " At the end he shook his head , sighed , murmured , " Oh , what 's the use ! " and reached for his too difficult Bach again . P117In the midst of this he said over his shoulder , " That Gilbert girl said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much it amounts to ? " " I did n't see any indications one way or the other , " answered Adrian readily , with a competently executed casual accent . He was doing better , he thought , forgetting that he had not turned over a page since he had been holding the book . His father swung around on the piano stool and sat there , his hands hanging between his knees . After a time Adrian glanced up at him and met his thoughtful eyes . No , he was not too old to blush , he thought , feeling the slow heat burn its way to his temples . FIe looked back at the Montaigne , resolutely turned over a page , and suddenly thought , " Oh , perhaps Father is only thinking about whether I 'm going to stay or not . " The heat died out of his face . " Well , I believe I 'll go to bed , " said Aunt Tryntje cheerfully , taking off her glasses and putting her knitting inside the little walnut sewing-cabinet which stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , there 's gingerbread in the cake-box , and some applesauce in the blue bowl on the pantry shelf . " The tall clock ticked loudly in the silent room after she had gone . Adrian Jaid aside the Montaigne and looked expectantly and a little nervously at his father . " What 'd I do with my pipe , I wonder ? " said the older man , getting up from the piano stool . After he had found it and lighted it the two men sat smoking meditatively . Adrian got himself more in hand . When his father spoke he was ready to answer him as quietly as the question was put . " Well , Adrian , how about it . . . have you had time to think what comes next ? I 'm ready for anything you decide . " " I believe I 'll stay right on here , " said Adrian . " I 've had my try  --  a fair chance at what I wanted . It 's no go . " With the words something that till then had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay dead at Adrian 's feet . He was somewhat shaken , having thought it dead before , but he averted his eyes and went on in a matter-of-fact tone , " Better be a good savingsbankcashier than a mediocre artist . " Within his father 's heart rose a cry of desperate sympathy , of passionate unresignation , of reckless uncounting devotion  --  he ached with longing to spend his all , his life that was no longer of any use to him , so that his boy should have what he wanted ,  | He drew a long , deep , painful breath and came back from this madness to a wonder that at his age he should still think there was any way one human being could give another what he wanted . What had the boy said with that manly finality , that had clicked like the locking of a door , and yet with a quiver in his voice which his father recognized from his little-boy days . . . " better a good bank cashier than a mediocre artist . " " There 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said his father gently . " Oh , I believe it , all right , " rejoined Adrian steadily , tamping down the tobacco in his pipe with his forefinger . He could not have told what his father had said , or what he had answered , except that the very sound of his father 's voice had been irritating to him . He struggled hard to keep out of sight this aftermathof an emotional crisis . His father waited humbly to see if Adrian felt like adding anything to his statement , like letting his father share in what had brought him to his decision . Adrian very decidedly did not feel like letting any one share in the consciousness of failure which had preceded that decision . His bald statement of it had been just all that he could manage , and he now sat in a moody silence , listening to its reverberations down his future . His father heard them too , apparently , for after a long pause he remarked moderately , " Well , there are worse things than living in Rustdorf . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk like Aunt Tryntje , but there is a good deal of quiet blood in us . It 's the fashion nowadays to maintain that a man ca n't be sure whether he 's alive unless there are guns going off around him , and some weaker person to knock down once in a while , and a new woman every week or so . " He had hoped he might win Adrian to a smile , but there was no lightening in the other 's somber face , so he went prosaically on , " But as a matter of unobserved fact , there are several other varieties of men , and we Friends usually belong to one of the variants . At least I do . " Adrian said impatiently , " Oh , Lord , yes , " as though this were not the matter in question . His father went on thoughtfully , feeling his way forward among his words as he had among the Bach notes . " After all , I suppose you get harmony and equilibrium in life as in everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by havingP119such a lot . And harmony and equilibrium are maybe what last you best , in the long run . " He was aware from the suppressed exasperation on Adrian 's tightened lips that he was sounding like Polonius . What made parents always go through this futile business of trying to pass on to the young the incommunicable fruits of experience ? " I know what you mean , " Adrian said , evidently thinking of something else . With an unheard sigh his father turned the subject around to another angle . " The fact is , I dare say , " he remarked , " that at the very moment I am talking about the reasonableness of our family stock I am probably expressing an unbridled primitive passion . Well , if you ever have one son and lose his mother and live without her for many years , and without him all the time of his education . . . perhaps you 'll not be able to stifle any better than I can a whoop of selfish relief when he decides to stay near you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened . He looked over warmly at his father and said from his heart , " You certainly know how to give the prodigal a rousing welcome home . " He was ashamed of his morose impatience and very glad that he had not let his father guess at it . " What do you say we try some gingerbread ? " suggested his father , rising . In the low-ceilinged , brown-beamed , whitewashed kitchen , over the spoils of pantry and ice-box , they talked business . In the intervalsof his own college work and in a period before going abroad , Adrian had been junior clerk and assistant bookkeeper , so that he was quite familiar with the routine of its management . " The trustees have always taken for granted you 'd come back , " said the older Adrian , sipping his milk ; " so it 'll be perfectly all right with them . Of course it 's no opening ' at all in the modern sense , and never will be . The beginning salary is microscopic , but you know the ropes so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all in hand . I 'll soon be glad enough to step back to second place . I 'm almost at the age now when my father did . Not that there 's much money to be made , at best , in a savings bank . But it 's always been rather a satisfaction to me , and perhaps it will be in the long run to you , that nobody makes any profit out of our kind of a bank , only salaries . To be in a business that does n't make profits for anybody , only just decent wages for work done ,  | I 've found it tranquilizing . It keeps out of your life  --  your own personal life , that is  --  the uneasiness about the real source of profits . You can be dead sure that you have not , without meaningto , put your hand into somebody else 's pocket . " Adrian was as used to this notion of his father 's as to Aunt Tryntje 's ancestor-worship and made no comment on it . " I do n't mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do with money in Rustdorf ? Enough to buy tennis balls and give Aunt Tryntje my board-money , that 's about all I could use . " " You might marry , " said the older man , tipping back his kitchen chair ; " people do , sometimes . " Adrian laughed , " Well , yes , I suppose there really is n't anythingimpossible about it . " He leaned across the table and broke off a piece of gingerbread . His father said nothing for a moment , balancing on his chair , one sinewy , delicate , elderly hand holding to the edge of the table . Then , " I hope you will , Adrian , if you find the right mate . " He brought all four legs of his chair accurately and noiselesslyto the floor and went on speaking very naturally and lookingdirectly at Adrian so that all of his personality spoke as well as his words . " There 's a great deal said about love , " he remarked , " some realistic brutal things , some sentimental and sugary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every word that 's been said , each way , is true enough . As far as it goes . But nothing to the purpose . Young people ought to be told that nobody has ever been able  --  not even Dante  --  to find a way to say what it really is , true love . All that 's said about it . . . well , it 's like Plato 's cave-shadows , compared to life in the sunshine . If you are fortunate in your love . " Adrian said nothing , feeling rather awed and , used as he was to his father 's natural way of speaking out whatever was in his mind , extremely embarrassed . " As in old time ... ' " quoted his father " As in old time , a head with gentle grace , All tenderly laid by thineTaught thee the nearness of the love divine . . . " ' With an exquisite piercing stab to the heart Adrian thought of Matey 's head laid tenderly by his . . . . " Well , it does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up top121put the milk away in the ice-box . " I hope you 'll have your share , Adrian , " he said , over his shoulder . He shut the ice-box door quietly and sat down , leaning an elbow on the table , resting his gray head on one hand and looking at the floor . Adrian tipped back in his chair and stared up thoughtfully at the rough brown of the uncovered beams . His father 's words filled the room to the brim . Presently it seemed to Adrian that what filled the plain old room overflowed into the world beyond . " Nobody 'd need a label on us to know us for Friends , " said his father finally , raising his head . " We 've sat here holding meetingall by ourselves as if we were a couple of old elders . It 's past bedtime . Adrian , wind the clock , will thee ? Thee 's taller than I. " PRISCILLA was in Italy , chaperoning a party of American girls , when she received Matey 's letter saying she was engaged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start home ( it was toward the end of August ) so that there was no time for more than the noncommittal " love and best wishes " which Priscilla sent off from Naples . But when she landed in New York , as soon as her spoiled and petulant charges had been restored to the not-too-enthusiastic arms of their well-to-do families , she telegraphed and took the first train north . Matey had an idea that Priscilla 's feelings were not very fully or accurately represented by sister understand . The new joy in her life had brought with it a clear sense of freedom from old bonds . " No , dear , you 'd better not come with me to meet Priscilla 's train , " she told Adrian . " She 'll want to see me first alone . The walk up from the station will give us a chance for a good talk . " It would not take her any longer than that , she was sure , to make Priscilla understand . She was overjoyed that her sister was coming . With Adrian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not merely her old sense of decent family loyalty that kept her from trying to paint her past for him , nor her certainty that it could never be least , Priscilla !  --  that I am a little taller than he . The nightmare faded out to nothing . I lay down in bed and went right to sleep as I used to when I 'd been out playing hide-and-seek . " Her imaginary talk ran on faster and faster . " Yet I 'm not always sure that I am in love with Adrian or want to be married to him . How can I be sure when in spite of all I 've read , I honestlydo n't know just what that means , and I 've always been ashamed to ask or try to find out ? To get married is stepping off into something unknown , I see that . But if I go with Adrian ! .. . I like him so much . I like to have him near me . You know how you and I have always hated to be touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different was how I loved to have his hand brush against mine as we walked side by side . 1 like his hands . I like the back of his neck . . . is n't it silly . . . and the first time he put his arms around me I felt as though we were just one person . Do you suppose that is being in love with a man , ' Pris-cilla ? " In the distance , down the river , the train whistled . The sound startled Matey . She had forgotten that these confidences were not being really made , that Priscilla was not there yet . Tears were standing in her eyes , so sweet had been this foretaste of intimacy . She wiped them away to catch the first sight of the train which was bringing to her Priscilla , the real Priscilla , not the imaginary one with whom she had been happily talking . She saw the train , distant , dark , hugging the curving tracks with a worm-like twisting , darting fast toward her , a spiteful jet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , coming to find out how in the world her little sister could have lost her head . It loomed closer . Roaring and grinding its brakes , it drew up at the station . Matey looked around for Sumner and snatched him up . Holding him in her arms , she ran along the platform . A friend of Aunt Tryntje 's climbed slowly down , looking very Rustdorfin her old-ladyish ignoring of prevailing styles in hats and hair ; a shabby tired mother with a couple of sticky-faced children ; some gum-chewing girls . . . . And then Priscilla  --  tall , blonde , tailored , her face masked in the set impassivity of the well-bred Nordic traveler . At the familiar sight , Matey 's past surged up from the remoteness tosmallP125which Adrian had pushed it . The very odor of the sachet Priscilla always used , the very feel of her firm smooth cheek as they embraced , brought back to Matey all their other meetings . Their past loomed darkly between them . Of course there was naturally the matter of the baggage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationwas , after the usual Rustdorf habit , Adrian 's second cousin . He had to be approached therefore with even an increase of the humane Dutchess County tradition that business is a part of the never-ending flow of life and not part of a mechanism to be snapped briskly open or shut : " So this is your sister ? " said he to Matey . To Priscilla , kindly , " Glad to see you back in the old town . I used to know your mother well . Shy . certainly was a whipstitch ! You girls will have to step fast to keep up to her . " Remembering that there was a question of baggage , he guessed maybe he could deliver that trunk today . Or tomorrow morning . . . . But there was Priscilla 's suitcase . Looking into each other 's eyes , and reading there life-and-death decisions to be taken , they tried nervously to decide how to get Priscilla 's suitcase to the house . Should they try to carry it  --  or send it ? " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , no , Matey dear , I could n't let you carry it . No porters ? " ( asked the girl fresh from Naples ) . " Gracious ! No ! " ( In spite of her nervous tension the girl who had been spending the summer in Rustdorf was overtaken by a sudden laugh . ) " Perhaps we could send it up with the trunk ? " " But , Matey , it has my night things in it . I 'd need it tonight . " More talk with the expressman . One by one the sparkling bubbles of reunion 's new wine broke and fell flat . Yes , he guessed he could bring them things up this afternoon if there was so much hurry for them . Matey knew very well he had nothing else to do . " Oh , thank you so very much , Mr. Van Bommel . " All this in their company voices . At last they started , the two sisters , up the elm-shaded street . And Matey was not the one who roused herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as they turned away from the station , burst out , " See here , Matey , I do n't think you ought to . . . You know . . . you know . . . I 'd always taken for granted you and I would never marry . It 's not . . . It frightened me terribly to . . . " She threw her arm about her sister and pressed it hard against her shoulders . Her words were too faltering to be intelligible . But Matey knew what she meant and would not say . It was moving to have Priscilla thus helplessly shaking the door she had locked long ago . Matey was startled into a reflected agitation by the strange sight of Priscilla agitated and not trying to hide it . " Now I must n't let Priscilla stampede me , " she thought , trying to call back the confidence she had felt while waiting for the train . But in her imaginary conversation she had made no preparation for a Priscillatrying hard to say something of her own . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found that in this absurd momentary confusion she could not at once seem to remember exactly how he looked . " What is the matter with me ! " she thought fiercely . " I will not let this go on another instant . I will answer Priscilla something before I draw another breath . " She heard her own voice saying with incredible flatness , " It 's all right Priscilla . Adrian 's really awfully nice . And so is his father . " What had made her mention fathers to Priscilla ! Anything but reassured , Priscilla gave her sister a panicstruck look . " But , Matey . . . suppose it 's not all right , " she said in a trembling voice . " You ca n't know . . . . Remember how everybodyused to think . . . " Matey knew now that if she tried to answer her voice would be worse than flat , that it would tremble like Priscilla 's , for she was startled into a bodily tremor she could not control . Priscilla had not said out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind none the less . Priscilla meant that they had both been at least safe , that they had learned how to cower down so low that the roaring wind of evil passed over their heads . She was trying to find words to cry out on the madness that had induced Matey to risk all , to stand up , to take a step forward in that trackless dark . If the younger sister turned pale and shook under this onslaught , it was partly with dismay at herself . She was silent , struggling impatiently as with a nervous seizure . Priscilla saw nothing but her pallor and said urgently , " Matey , you could easily get a position in the school where I am . Or I could go to teach in Cleveland near you , if you are lonely . IP127ought to have done this before . We could keep house together . . . . " A dreadfulness of raw feeling throbbed in her voice . It overshot the mark . It put , quite unexpectedly , the right weapon for resistance into Matey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priscilla did not seem an older , more complete person . ' With astonishmentMatey perceived that her older sister sounded like a child , as though she did not understand at all . Really it was not very intelligent of Priscilla not to have learned more than one thing out of life . " After all , " thought the younger sister , half impatiently , half pityingly , " after all there may be something in the world besides our lost forty cents . " She almost said it aloud . But Priscilla had never heard what that story meant to Matey . And she never laughed herself out of overwrought ideas . How odd it seemed that it should be Matey who was trying to think of some way to quiet and reassure Priscilla ! She laid her hand on Priscilla 's arm , she made her stand still on the sidewalk , she tried to penetrate into Priscilla 's real self as she said firmly , " Now , Priscilla , listen to me . It 's all right ! " But no , her thrust went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked away . Priscilla gave the little meaningless , nervous laugh which was her parry against any stroke that threatened to come too close . Priscilla could not  --  would not understand . Adrian came running down the street toward them now , Adrian dressed for the important occasion in white flannels . In spite of them he did not look very stylish , only fresh and clean . Adrian never would look very stylish , Matey knew that by this time . He looked a little nervous too at passing the inspection of the first of Matey 's family and at seeing Priscilla so formidably elegant and worldly-looking . But more than anything else he looked , compared to Priscilla , grown up and complete , with his nice hazel eyes and his smile  --  Adrian 's smile  --  lifting his sandyredmustache as he halted before them , shook Priscilla 's hand , and said he was glad to see her . " I was supposed to wait for you at the house , " he explained cheerfully , " but when I saw you both actually coming along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At the sound of his voice , with its inimitable naturalness , at the perfectly Adrian-like unarranged and unpicturesque words with which he first addressed his sister-to-be , Matey shook off the last reflection from Priscilla 's hysteria and stepped out from the past . " He just has n't any company voice , " she thought fondly .   " He simply could n't plan for an effect or keep his mind on what impression he is making . " It seemed to her enough of a reason , even though scarcely the traditional one , for marrying him . It was one Priscilla might understand , if she could only tell her . Or perhaps Priscilla might see it for herself . By the end of Priscilla 's stay Matey did not know whether she had seen this or anything else . And yet Priscilla had beaten Adrian at tennis once or twice and had seen for herself that he did not hate her then or sulk afterward . Priscilla must have noticed that . But Matey could only guess . She knew no more than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed Priscilla allowed much of anything to go on in it . She regretted more bitterly than ever that she had not been able , long ago , to speak to Priscilla of the ending of their father 's life . She still did not at all understand that never-forgottenhour . The recollection of it always tossed her helplessly back and forth between two impressions of it  --  if that had been love , and if love could do no more than that for human lives ! And yet  --  a belonging together that outlived all else , and stood up boldly in the face of death  --  ! Whatever it had been , it was Priscilla 's as well as hers . Why had n't she ever been able to say the few words that would have told it ?  --  " Priscilla , as Father lay dying , he was frightened , horriblyfrightened , and it was Mother he called to in his fright . And it was Mother who answered  --  Mother !  --  in a voice of such steadfast love ; Mother who helped him through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like that ? Time after time she had determined that she would . But always as she drew her breath for the first words , her heart began to beat thickly with the fear that if she spoke now her voice would sound self-conscious , unnatural , false . What was this paralysis of throat and eye which overtook them at the thought of saying simply and naturallywhat was in their hearts ? One evening after Priscilla had gone , when she and Adrian were taking a twilight walk together , she put this question to him . She did not explain what it was she wished to say to Priscilla , but put it as part of her general wonder at the ways of human beings . Adrian answered that his guess was that the language of saying simply and naturally what was in your heart was probably at least as difficult to learn as French or German and took as much practice .   " Father 's a proficient in that language , " he told her . " Perhaps it 's his Quakerism . . . lifelong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps because he always manages so there is little he needs to conceal . He can actually , if it happens to come into his head in a quiet hour , talk to you about his feeling the immanence of God as naturally as he asks you whether the front dodr is locked . Once , I remember , last spring  --  I think now he had seen I 'd already fallen in love with you  --  he said something to me about love and its greatness . . . . Did you suppose there was a father living who could bring himself to mention such a subject to his son ? " Matey was astonished . " I 'm twenty-four years old and I 've known lots and lots of people and I never , never heard a single living human being intimate openly that love could be great . " She added , " What did he say ? " " Ah , I would n't dare try to repeat it to you . My voice would sound like a preacher 's , and that 's the last awfulness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " he snatched her to him  --  " but I ca n't tell you . Not yet . But I 'm going to lose no time in practicing that language . You too , Matey darling ! " " I do n't know a word of it , " said Matey . " Well , practice a little , now , " he urged . " What comes into your mind first of all when you remember we are going to be married ? " Matey looked at him piteously , but said bravely , " I 'll tell the truth . . . a sense of complete unreality . " Adrian had not expected this , but after a pause for taking breath he asked , " How do you mean , unreality ? That I do n't exist ? Or that we are n't engaged ? Or what ? " He put his arm about her as he spoke ; they were strolling along the lane which led to the river , a favorite evening walk of theirs . Matey leaned against him . Physical nearness to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what was in her mind for a moment and answered . " Everything seems unreal  --  myself too . Only not you , when I 'm close enough to feel you . The old Matey 's gone . . . or is she just waiting there in Clevelandfor the autumn teaching to begin ? And I do n't know the new one . Is there a new one ? It seems like something in a dream . Perhaps it has n't had time to reach me yet . " She turned her face to his , in the twilight . " You know , Adrian , I did n't mean at all to kiss you back that time . From the moment we sat down on the grass I was all ready  --  I even had the words picked out  --    to tell you that I was n't the marrying kind , and that I was going to go away from Rustdorf the next morning anyhow . I was saying that over and over to myself to keep it clear . . . and then you just looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Were you glad you were planning to say that ? " asked Adrian . Matey turned her head from one side to the other a little tildly . " Oh , Adrian , I ca n't tell you whether 1 was or not . I do n't know . I ca n't tell you how strange it seems . Priscilla may be right . Perhaps I ought n't to marry . " ( But she did not tell him why . She never told him why . ) " I do n't understand anything about it . Whatever made me , when you only looked up at me so , begin to cry and kiss you back with all my heart ? I did n't mean to ! " " Perhaps you love me , Matey ? " suggested Adrian gently , drawing her closer to him . " Do you suppose I do ? " said Matey , half sobbing , half laughing , clinging to him , rubbing her cheek back and forth on his . " When I 'm with you , I seem to , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . But I thought . . . I thought I could n't love anybody . . . except Sumner ! " she ended absurdly . " You 're like Sumner anyhow , " she told him , laughing uncertainly ; " you want me to tell you the truth . Well , I thought from the very first you were like Sumner . Your eyes are like his . You do n't need to tell me I 'm being silly . I know it . " " Oh , I do n't mind having Sumner as a predecessor , " said Adrian ; " you probably learned a lot on him . As a matter of fact we are alike . We 're both alike . We both love you . And we let you know it . " " Do you suppose , " Matey asked him , " that I love you enough to marry you when I ca n't even really believe we are engaged ? " " Well , let 's try it anyhow , " suggested Adrian . They had come out now on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to look at . A miracle bloomed there with every lamp-lighting time . The wide stream was as dim in the twilight as the River of Death . On the opposite bank stood a settlement which in the daytime was only a cluster of mean wooden houses . Punctually , night by night , as darkness fell , there shone out in its place the golden sisterhood of stars at which the lovers now gazed silently . Francis made a visit to Rustdorf too , stopping off between trains on his way to New York . He was handsomer than ever , andp131better dressed , and more masculinely magnetic . The aroma of power scented any room where he sat , as definitely as the perfume of his very upper-class cigars . He told Matey that he had come to see her fiance , and to tell her that she was not the only pebble on the beach , that he was engaged to be married himself . Her name , he said , was Emily McAdams , her father was a senior partner of the law firm where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much retouched that Matey had little impression of more than the requisite numberof features ; he said she was rather darker than blonde , was a graduate of Miss Spence 's School , a debutante of that year , liked to wear blue a good deal , was not the athletic sporty type , but rather old-fashioned and domestic  --  told , in short , every imaginabledetail but the one of which Matey had been instantly sure from the announcing of his news . Francis had been engaged before ( this was one of the things she had not told Aunt Tryntje ) to a girl with prospects . But when the grandmother had died , it was found that her fortune had been left to the Presbyterian Church instead of to the younger generation . And not long after that , the health of Francis ' fiancee had declined so that her doctor , in spite of Francis ' pleadings , had absolutely forbidden her to think of marrying . In announcing his present engagement he spoke about this earlier disappointment not only to Matey but to the Forts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that after all , life has unsuspected reserves . Not that anything could be like one 's first love , but perhaps something might be better , deeper and quieter . Matey made no comment . She leaned back in her chair absentmindedlystroking Sumner while Francis talked about his future . She had no more to say when he talked about their common past , for , finding that both their father and mother were known in Rustdorf , he fell naturally into reminiscences , painting a vivid picture , true to the last detail , of the various homes they had had , t he stirring social life in which their family had always been a leader . " Do you remember , Matey , those dinner parties in Hamilton ? By George , Mr. Fort , I go out a good deal in Pittsburgh , but I never heard better talk anywhere than that I heard at my parents ' table . Living in a university circle , you know , one has t he pick of people who know their stuff . And Father and Mother knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal home atmosphere for us . When I hear other fellows talking about family life  --  lots of the Pittsburgh boys have parents who were divorced  --  Irealize more than ever how fortunate we children were in seeing such an example of team-work before us . Father and Mother were literally never separated for more than a day or so . They were crazy about each other . " The Forts heard more , they said , about Matey 's family in the one day that Francis was there than in all the week Priscilla stayed with them . For that matter , more than Matey had ever told them . " Oh , Matey 's a regular clam , " said Francis , with a friendly laugh . " She was a chatterbox as a kid . I remember she used to talk your head off . But as she grew up  --  Mother used to say it seemed as though Matey 's music took the place of words . Her music and her darned little dog . You may have noticed that Matey 's only confidant is Sumner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always said . " He ruffled the old dog 's ears playfully as he spoke . He seemed to make his usual brilliantly favorable impression on the Rustdorf people . Adrian 's father greeted him kindly , listened to him attentively , and Aunt Tryntje was quite carried away by his interest in Dutchess County history and his desire to learn the details of his ancestry . " I never saw a more delightful young mah , " she told Matey a good many times after Francis had gone away  --  " so appreciative ! When I told him what Mr. Winthrop said about the Friends in Rustdorf , a community of transparent souls where no man hides his motive , ' he said he had never heard a finer phrase . " It seemed very familiar to Matey not to have any idea what to answer back . She could not very well report Francis ' talk with her at the station as he went away : " Matey , for heaven 's sake , pull out of this hole ! You 'll suffocate , used as you are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing for granted . But you just try living in an American small town , cutting yourself off from civilization , and you 'll . . . I tell you I know , just after this one day here , what Father meant when Ile used to say he would n't be caught dead in ... " " I remember what Father used to say , " Matey cut him short . " Well , bear it in mind ! The old aunt is enough to addle your brains . And that prosy pious old banker . . . ! God ! The whole place fairly reeks with stagnation . Honestly , Matey , you 're crazy ! "  |p133Struck  with a new possibility , he interrupted himself to sad hastily , " See here , you 're not making a mistake about this bankingbusiness , are you ? Do you even know the difference between a real bank and a mutual savings bank ? It 's not a bank at all in the business sense  --  there 's no more chance for profits in it than in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing . . . sort of charity . Honestly it is , like something a university settlement might run . Yes , you might about as well be planning to marry a settlement worker . " This was the only direct reference he made to his sister 's fiance . She needed nothing more explicit . She had read in his first glance at Adrian the conviction that he was a dead loss who never would get anywhere . " Why , Matey , the expressman here at the station is the old man 's first cousin . And another of your relatives-to-be , so I gather , that ancient crone who runs a bakeshop in one corner of her house . Honestly ! Matey . . . ! " Matey felt her cheeks hot with resentment , and to her shame , with discomfort . She spoke angrily to hide her flinching . " Francis , do n't be ridiculous , everybody in America has relatives like that ! Those very ones are ours too , you know . " " Why pick out the one spot where such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fort 's cousins is Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court , " advanced Matey , hating every word she was saying . " But you 're not going to live in Des Moines , " said Francis , with a devastating effect of finality . His words almost gave Matey the clew to something clear and final to be said on the other side , something she had dimly felt from her first hour in Rustdorf . But with Francis ' scornful eye on her , she could not get her wits together enough to grasp it . She had , after all , no defense but her old one of being ashamed of being ashamed . Francis was too much for her , as usual . As long as he stood there she could not save herself from the abjectness of seeing Adrian , his father , Rustdorf , as Francis did . She was horrified to feel under her brother 's blighting survey that she was ashamed of Adrian 's lack of an air , of his future , of the very things in him and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis rose up admonishingly . She could at least look stubborn and closep134her lips with an offended air , as if she were a sulky child . Francis readily identified her expression as a familiar one . Had n't she . . . his memory groped among old trifles . . . had n't she as a little girl looked like this one day when she had spoiled a game for a whole crowd by being unreasonable ? He said in a brotherly tone , " I 'm just giving you the best advice I can , Matey . Get mad about it if you like , but do n't forget it . " And then , on an impulse , laying a comradely hand on her shoulder , " See here , Matey old girl , why do n't you come to Pittsburgh to teach ? In the university there . I could get you a job , I know . And I 'm getting on , fast . More than I 've let on to you and Priscilla , because I do n't like to brag . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be glad to introduce you to them , and let you have the entree wherever I have . It 's to whatever 's worth while in the city , if I do say so . " His imaginationcaught fire . " Why , yes , Matey , why have n't I thought of this before ? You 'd meet scads of the nicest sort of young fellows . . sons of the steel magnates . . . every one of them , " he said with an emphasis that pointed a contemptuous finger at Adrian , " with a big future before him , going somewhere and going fast/ Emily would be awfully good to anybody I backed up , you can bank on that . So would all her family . I do n't mind telling you , just to give you an idea  --  that I pulled her father out of a hole the old man wo n't forget in one while . And kept still about it afterward . He 'd see to it that you got every . . " From the beginning of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she could not put a label . Did she wish to stamp her foot and slap Francis ? Or to burst into bitter tears ? Neither , apparently , for she now began helplessly to laugh . Francis was simply too Francis-like for anything ! " What are you laughing at ? " asked Francis in amazement . " Never mind what , " said Matey . " It 's no laughing matter , " said Francis , nettled . " You 've got to stop these childish ways of yours , Matey , and face facts . What you decide now decides all your future life . If Father were alive , you know how he . . . " Matey stopped laughing and looked again , so Francis thought , stubborn and dumb . He liked this better than her laughter , diviningin it a resistance less formidable . If he only had time . . . but his train was coming in . He had done his best to take his father 's place and put a stop to Matey 's madness ; he had pulledp135all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Matey and with her young man . He had given them each something to think over . His appointment in New York was an importantone . After all , Matey was not planning to be married until next June . There was plenty of time . He stooped to kiss his sister good-by , and said , urgently , affectionately , " Now , Matey , do n't make a fool of yourself ! Come on to Pittsburgh and join me . I 'd stand by . We 'd go far ! Honest we would ! " " Now here is a test , " thought Matey to herself as , rather shaken in nerves , she walked slowly home under the elms . " Shall I have the courage to tell Adrian that for a long wretched moment I was ashamed of him ? " She felt a sincere misery over what , after a summer of Aunt Tryntje 's idiom , she called to herself " the Gilbert blood coming out . " But she found she could not bring it to the light , even to Adrian  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening to tell her something which he evidently would have preferred to conceal . She had felt him stirred and preoccupied at the supper-table , usually so peaceful , and when they went out on the porch , noticed that he did not sit down on the swinging hammock beside her . " What makes you sit off there on that straight uncomfortable chair ? " she asked him as honestly as a child . He was silent , and then , " Matey , I 'm the one who 's always talking about never hiding anything from each other  --  I suppose you might as well know now as later , that I doubt . . . I doubt ... if your brother and I will ever be exactly what anybody could call intimate friends . " Matey was genuinely astonished that there should be anybody who , meeting Francis for the first time , did not like him . " What ever happened ! " she asked . Adrian said quickly , " That 's what I do n't want to tell you  --  yes , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . He  --  lie tried to  --  " No , decidedly he could not say it . Matey thought she knew . " He tried to make you think that I 'd find Rustdorf too  --  " But Adrian 's look at her through the dusk showed her it had not been that . " What did he say ? " she asked . Adrian hesitated , " He said he thought as the only man of your family , he ought to warn me  --  to tell me that you  --  " He stopped ,   really at a loss . Finally he murmured , "  --  that you have n't very much of what the French call temperament . " For all that Matey understood he might as well not have made any effort to speak out . She had often heard this word , but among the many things which at twenty-four she did not know was what exactly it meant . Her impression , which had seemed to suit any context in which she had as yet met it , was that a personwith temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once said impatiently of a cook with many suitors that she had so much temperament it was useless to expect her to get three meals a day . Well , if Francis had told Adrian that she did not fall in love easily or often , he was right . Why should Adrian object to that ? " Well  --  ? " she asked . Adrian said furiously , " I lost my temper . I told him perhaps his taste and mine in that matter might not  --  I told him it was none of his business . I told him to go to hell . " Matey had never seen Adrian angry . She was too startled to speak . From the open door the elder Adrian 's voice asked , " Matey , how about Number Seven ? Could you give an old bore one more . . . " " If you only knew ! " said Matey , rising quickly , " how many lonesome hours I 've spent playing Bach to myself because nobody would listen ! " " I 'll sit out here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We understand each other , Sumner and I. " In the middle of the Bach , Matey stopped playing . She swung around on the piano stool , flashed a quick bright glance at Adrian 's father , and said , " Excuse me a minute , will you ? I 've just thought of something I want to say to Adrian . " Adrian was not on the porch . But she saw him dimly in the starlight , standing with Sumner beside him , looking up at the sky . She ran across to him and seized his arm . " Adrian , see here . .. " she said in a tone of quick breathless high spirits . " Why do we wait till next June to be married ? Why do n't we do it right now , in September ? It just came to me  --  while I was playing that Bach . I felt something rising and rising in me , and all of a sudden it brimmed over . . . . " Adrian had brought his gaze down from the stars to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplative expression . They met hers with a shock , as if a spark had leaped out between the two . All her face was sparkling clear , as he had never seen it , as he had not dreamed it could be . Her woman 's face was bright like that of a happy loving child . He was silent an instant , dazzled . But when she saw his eyes on her , she flung herself headlong into his arms , clasping him in hers in a little girl 's tight , singleheartedembrace . " I want to marry you , Adrian ! " she told him willfully . " If ever I was n't sure , I am now , after Francis ' and Priscilla 's visits . I can feel myself boiling over with temperament to marry you . " " You do n't know what you 're talking about , " he mul Inured fondly into her hair . " Adrian ! What a Quaker thing to say to the girl who insists on marrying you ! " she cried out on him , drawing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face with its starry eyes seemed to give off a radiance of its own . She looked as she felt , as if with a clap of wings she could have soared into the air . " I never saw anything in the world as beautiful as you are this minute , " he told her , in the old lover 's phrase . " Make it September , " she murmured , with a coaxing pretense of imploring , bringing her face close to his till he could see nothing but her shining eyes . She was startled , a little frightened , by the roughness of his arms about her . And still more startled when she saw tears in his eyes . He said in an uncertain hoarse voice , " Oh , Matey , if I can only make you happy ! " THROUGH the open window admonishing chimes dropped down from the tower of Antwerp cathedral to tell them how lazy they were . " Lazy but unashamed , " Adrian answered the solemn tolling of ten o'clock . " Being now married to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it 's noon or midnight . " They were still luxuriously in bed , idly debating plans for the day , although a good part of the morning had already passed and they had eaten every crumb of the frugal breakfast brought them by the red-faced brawny Flemish girl who was general help in their bare clean small hotel . Matey agreed with her husband that being married made other things seem unimportant . She knew now what it meant to be married . And , as she had planned to predict to Priscilla , she had found out that in marriage as in everything else , the fact that Adrian was Adrian was all that mattered to her . Anything Adrian wanted , and wanted with those caressing hands , those eager lips from which hers took such living warmth  --  why , she wanted anythingAdrian wanted . She wondered that there could be women so perverse as sometimes not to want what a husband who loved them wanted . But perhaps they had not all such darling sweet husbands as Adrian . She put her arms around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I never claimed to be a cave-man , " said Adrian . " You ca n't say I deceived you on that point . " He spoke whimsically but a shadow fell , ever so lightly , on his face . " What 's the matter . Adrian ? " she challenged him . He lay gazing up at the ceiling for a moment , and then turned on her his good and clear look of affection . " I want you to love me , Matey . " " I do ! " she cried . " So you do , darling , " he said gently . The intrusive clock struck another quarter-hour . They decided they really must get up and go to look at the Plantin Museum . As they were sauntering back after a late luncheon , " Look here , Matey , " Adrian suggested , " we 've done about all these Flemish galleries we can take in for a while . Why do n't we skip up to Holland and have a look at Vermeer and Rembrandt for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no trip at all . " But with an energy which startled her , Matey found suddenly that there could be cases when she did not want what Adrian wanted . " No , let 's take the Paris rapide this afternoon . I hate Holland , " she said peevishly . " Why , what have you got against the Dutch ? " asked Adrian , surprised . " Oh , I do n't know , " said Matey . But she did know . She had remembered . On a street corner outside the museum in The Haguep139a well-dressed mother and three attractive young people stood waiting for her to join them and suffer , while coming toward them , red and furious , obviously wishing they had been dead rather than there to see his . . . " I ca n't bear Holland ! " she said . " We will have it eliminated from the map , " Adrian assured her . " On to Paris ! I never did think much of the Dutch . " When they reached the tall old hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Adrian 's father which informed them among other Rustdorf news that if they were thinking of buying any furnishings they must bear in mind that the color scheme of their new living-room was settled by the three coats of Quaker gray with which he had just painted the floor . He also told them that he and Sumner got on well together , Sumner being company for him after Aunt Tryntje had gone to bed , " although I ca n't say that he appreciates my piano practice as yet . To tell the truth his real affection has gone out to Rebecca . No , not merely at mealtimes . He often goes out in the kitchen of an evening when there is nothing whatever on his plate and sits there , breathing in the memory of Rebecca 's presence . It is not an unrequited attachment , I am happy to say . Rebecca loves him . I am sure she cuts out the tenderloin of our Thursday steak to give him . Where else can it go ? " " Is n't Father  --  the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line about the color of the floor paint is to break the news to us that he 's gone ahead and bought that Washington Street house for us as a wedding present , just as he threatened to . He ca n't afford it , you know . It 'll take a good deal more than half his savings . " Matey folded the letter and put it away in her handbag . " I love your father , " she said . " I loved him from the first moment I saw him . " " Well , do n't forget to love me too , " said Adrian , taking off her hat to kiss her hair ; " I 'm the one you married . You keep getting off that subject . " Matey laughed . " I 'm not allowed to get very far off it . " " It 's hard work to keep you on it , " he assured her ; " I never saw such a wandering mind . Suppose you try putting your arms around me this minute . It might remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shyly lifted her arms , he cried out roughly , catching her to him with passion . " Oh , Matey ! Matey ! If I can only make you happy ! "  | " I am happy , " said Matey , wondering at him a little , as she often did . " Not happy enough ! " " Happier than ever before . " " That 's nothing ! " " As happy as I know how to be , " said Matey . " Maybe , but that 's a subject you must study and learn more about , " Adrian told her seriously . " This afternoon , " announced Matey , " we must call on Mme. Vinet . " " In that case , " replied Adrian , " I 'll have to buy a shirt and some collars . This homeless tourist business is hard on laundry . I 've nothing left but the neglige-est of negliges . Suppose we walk over to the Bon Marche . You can stock up on ribbons or hairpins or handkerchiefs or whatever girls buy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As they walked , Matey went over again the information she had given him about the Vinet family so that he would make no mistakes in conversation . " Mme. Vinet is a widow now , you remember , " she said , beginning at the Lop , " and lives with her two sons , Henri , who 's about my age and a professor in a lycee , and little Paul  --  the one we used to call Polo  --  who must be thirteennow . He was a baby that first year we knew them . Henri 's a mother-boy , regular French eldest son , never leaves her side , never has . I suppose he 's what you 'd call a sissy , but if you do call him that I 'll never forgive you . He 's always seemed like a brother to me  --  though not a bit like Francis . To play Four-hand arrangements on the piano together , that 's their idea of heaven , Mme. Vinet and Henri . The children were all educated at home so that they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the reason they gave . Since I 've been grown up I 've suspected it was because Mme. Vinet never could bear to have Henri away from her . Polo has always been a nice little boy , not spoiled as much as you 'd think by being adored by his older brother and sisters . Mimi married six years ago , when she was only nineteen , not very romantically  --  a manufacturer much older than she  --  but very comfortably . Everybody was relieved . She 's rather delicate , sort of nervous , not much vitality . She has three children and seems about the same as ever . A new baby since I was here last . She 's the only one who has any money ,  |p143They  have two houses , a nice comfortable one in La Ferte-enValois , out beyond Meaux , and a smaller little country place right on the Marne . Ziza is the best-looking of the family , quite strikingin a vivid way . She 's three years younger than Mimi and I. . must be twenty-one now . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the one I told you was always so excitable . She 's married , too  --  to a Belgian  --  just recently . But she and her husband are making an after-the-honeymoon visit to her folks , so we 'll be sure to meet them sometime if not today . They 'll probably arrange a family reunion , and that includes us , for when I 'm with them I seem just like one of the girls . They all say thee and thou to me , as if I were blood kin , and Mme. Vinet still brings me up in the way I should go . " Adrian started to say his lesson over , checking the Vinets off on his fingers , but Matey interrupted him shyly . " Adrian , I know you do n't like secrets ; still . . . let 's not tell Mme. Vinet where we got the money for this trip ? She 's a dear , but they 're all so everlastingly thrifty .... " Adrian stopped her with a laugh . " I get you ! Not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to agree with Aunt Tryntje that a solemn thing like a year 's interest on your dot ought to have gone into hardwood floors and a furnace . " " There 's one thing more , " said Matey , constraint in her voice . " They none of them understand a word of English . " She had kept out of her mind any picture of this part of the meeting as resolutely as she had pushed Holland out of sight . " Oh , I 'll get along , " said Adrian comfortably . " None of my studio friends understand any English either . I 've plenty of French of a sort . " Yes , he had , but what a sort ! She had gauged its quality in Antwerp on the few occasions  --  buying tickets , or ordering meals  --  when she had not managed to slip unobtrusively ahead of him . She felt herself wishing that he did not know a word  --  could stay in safe uncompetitive aloofness . They were at the door of the Bon Marche and she found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unlaid ghosts of memories . " It 's going to be hot inside , Adrian , " she said . " Do you mind if I wait for you on a bench in the square ? " She sat down on the bench , her back to the big shop . She was afraid to go in . She was afraid of the silk counter , afraid that she would find her mother there , unable to make herselt understood by a slow-witted , slightly deaf salesman , while her father leaned on the counter , apparently absorbed in admiring the quality of the silks , intervening finally with a start , as though just now noticing the difficulty and delivering the necessaryexplanation in a French especially diamond-faceted in contrast to the self-distrustful woolliness of his wife 's . Matey was afraid she would forget that she was grown up and married to Adrian and would become again the drooping little girl who stood between the two , the child who had entered the shop bouncing with joy at the prospect of a new dress , but who now , wincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how soon she could get back to the Vinets . She heard herself asked once more which color she wanted , and said once more , " Oh , I do n't care , " in a tone so dull that her father was justified in exclaiming , " If you do n't , who 's going to ? Do you think we 're buying this dress to amuse ourselves ? I never saw such a dead-and-alive child ! " It would n't stay down in the black hole where she had pushed it . It streamed up like the genie coming out of the bottle and settled down around the married Matey on her bench . She might as well have gone into the shop with Adrian . When finally she saw him coming toward her , a paper parcel under hi ; arm , she ran to hiln , crying , " What in the world took you so long ? " " I struck a poor uneducated salesman from out Limoges way who could n't understand my pure Theatre Francois vowels ! " he told her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a bust-up to celebrate our arrival at the old stand ? How about  --  laying a wreath on Aunt Connie 's grave as we go  --  how about a duck at Foyot 's ? " " I 'm awfully ' sorry , Adrian , but one of my sick headaches seems to be sinning up . Calling on Mme. Vinet will be about all I can stand . " Adrian looked at her keenly . " You do look terribly tired , all of a sudden . Funny ! You were all right a minute ago . Well , we 'll be sensible and have dinner at the hotel . " he said patiently . The call on Mme. Vinet did n't turn out to be difficult . Adrian managed a few conventional phrases of greeting well enough , and for the rest of the visit there was nothing for himp143to do but be a correctly in-the-background new husband , while his wife and her old friend occupied the center of the stage with family news . " What luck that you come at this time ! " exclaimed Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are down from Belgium . spending a few days with Mimi . Why do n't we all go out on Sunday to spend the day together ? There 's an early train to La Ferte , the one we used to take  --  remember , Mete ?  --  for Sundays together in the country . It would be charming to have all you children together , you girls with your husbands . Was n't it curious , little Ziza marrying an Adrien , too ? " " I never heard , " said Matey , " how they happened to choose Louvain to live in . " " Choose ? How did thy husband happen to choose R-r-rusdorf ? " asked Mme. Vinet , her tongue tripping a little over the name . " Ziza 's husband would ask you , Where else would a Conacq live but in Louvain ? ' One of those old plain provincial families , you know , who live for centuries in the same town . His father is professor of German literature there . " , When Ziza and her new family had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mimi . " Think of Mimi with three children ! " marveled Matey . " Why not ? She has been married six years . " Mme. Vinet consideredMimi 's case for an instant , and then , " The queer thing for me is to think of any Vinet with money ! One would think , brought up as she was , she 'd feel shy in the presence of real cash . But she seems to find it perfectly natural . " " It 's the absence of it that bothers people , " contributed Adrian , his American r 's harsh and heavy . Matey did not look at him , feeling it more decent not to , What a terrible accent he had ! He must be wincing over those r 's . They were like her mother 's , and brought before her the tense expression of her mother 's face when she was speaking French . What time was it ? she wondered . The large ornamental clock on the Vinets ' mantelpiece had never run since she could remember , and she dared not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and her headache was evidently going to be one of the bad ones . Depression fell on her gloomily . She laid it . to the prospect of a day with the complete Vinet family  --  so many of them , and a new baby to exclaim over . It would be noisy ! People tired her , en masse like that . And French familiesp144were always en masse . The familiar ache at the base of her brain began to hang its black veil between her and life . Mme. Vinet looked to her very plain and commonplace . With a malicious desire to give pain , which after the words were out quite shocked her , she asked , " I thought surely by this time I 'd find Henri engaged to be married ? " Mme. Vinet 's face changed . " Henri never seems to think of marrying , " she said carefully . " His profession absorbs him wholly . And his music . " " She is as frightened as ever at the idea of living a minute without him , " thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and son had had , and how it made the rest of them feel left out . In the third-class railway compartment on the early omnibus train Sunday morning , she saw the same look pass between the gray-haired widow and the slight , pale , seriously bearded young man into whom the slight , pale , serious Henri had developed . He did not remain serious very long in Adrian 's society . It was the first time Matey had seen Adrian in French company . There was simply not room in her mind for the astonishment she felt as the train slowly rumbled along . He spoke French , as he had told her long ago and as she had heard for herself , very badly , with ( it is true ) a sort of wild student fluency and slangy abundance , but with inconceivable oddities of grammatical incorrectness , and an American accent as full-flavored ( Adrian said it himself that morning ) as molasses and buckwheat cakes . This was evidently not the first time he had been off for a Sunday in the country with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they expect of such an outing . And being himself in his usual gcod spirits , he lent himself heartily to this expectation , using his unique French as a comedian would use a natural gift for farce . It flavored richly with its drollness the mildest of his humorous remarks , and rose at times through some particularly happy combination of current slang and unexpected mispronunciation to heights of absurdity which made even grave Mme. Vinet laugh to tears , as Matey had never seen her laugh before . His fantastic explanation , always in this extraordinary fluent comedy language , of what molasses and buckwheat cakes are to American life , reduced little Paul to such shrieks of laughter that he had to go out into the corridor to get himself ap145drink of water . Mme. Vinet and Henri looked at each other with an enchanted expression of satisfaction . One of their worries was lest little Paul , alone with them , should have too serious a life . The Vinets had always been a cheerful enough family in their subdued civilized way , but Matey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rire , so much beloved by sober French people , as Adrian knew how to produce by his linguistic tomfoolery . They poured out of the train at La Ferte in a state of hilarity which made Mimi  --  looking very matronly and settled , and rather too stout  --  inquire what the pleasantry was . " Me  --  I am the pleasantry , Madame Mimi , " said Adrian , bowing , his hand on his heart . Mimi shook hands with him , introduced him to her grave , substantially built husband , M. Bouvard ; there was a fusillade of two-cheeked kisses among the Vinets , and they moved out of the station to dispose themselves in an elderly , well-kept carriage , dating from an earlier generation of the Bouvard family . Matey took her place between Mimi and Mme. Vinet on the back seat . The three men , Henri and Adrian already like old friends , and Mimi 's husband , stout , dignified , and inexpressive , crowded togetheropposite . Thirteen-year-old Paul , his cheeks still glowing from the resounding greetings of his provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which elevation he continually turned his head not to lose a word of what Adrian might say . Ziza and her husband were waiting for them at the house , it seemed . " How do you like her husband ? " asked Matey . " I like him , " said Mimi , " but . . . I could wish Ziza did not like him quite so much . " " What is this talk , " inquired Adrian , " of limits set to liking husbands ? M. Bouvard , it is time for us to stand en garde . " " Ah , Ziza is only just married , " remarked Mme. Vinet . " Give her time . " " Fix bayonets ! " said Adrian to M. Bouvard , imitating exactly the raucuous speech-tune of an army sergeant . " E-e-e-n avant ! ' archel " His accent added a color of burlesque to this which brought an explosive astonished laugh from the massive M. Bouvard . From the driver 's seat came a delighted cackle . Adrian turned , his hazel eyes shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him a grave nod and look of understanding as from husband to husband which sent Polo off into rockets of laughter again . Mme. Vinet made an effort to think of the right conversation for people who do not live in Paris . " Did you have a good wheat harvest ? " she asked . M. Bouvard , whose business was the manufacturingof plumbing-fixtures , stared out of the carriage as if looking for evidence , and gravely assured his mother-in-law that he believed it had been good . The wheat had been cut long ago , but as Matey followed his eyes over the bare brown fields , there came back vividly  --  more vividly in memory than ever to her seeing eyes  --  the magnificence of the wheat in this part of France . The stubble in the broad sloping fields was brown now , but the hoarded seed was only waiting for the fall plowing for next year 's glory . New ideas sprang nimbly up in her brain . What a history it had , wheat ! Why had she never thought of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefest treasure , alive more than ever when they were crumbled dust in their graves . . . living as ideals live on , long past the death of those who cherished them . It was wonderful to be out in such a countryside . And what air ! To come here from Paris was like going out from a stuffy room into a west wind . And yet she had not noticed in Paris that the air seemed stuffy . Oh , it was because her head had stopped aching ! What a relief . It was going to be a lovely day . They had arrived . She sprang from the carriage and ran to kiss darling Ziza , hung like a poppy on the arm of a blond young man as stout as he was tall , which was saying a good deal . " Un vrai homme du Nord ! " thought Matey as she shook hands with him . In the house , as the women were taking off their wraps in Mimi 's pretty , overfurnished bedroom , " Thy husband seems like a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of us . I feel already intimate . And Americans are usually so remote . Why , I would hardly know him for an American at all ! " she said , struck with the idea . She added casually , " Except for his speech . " What was this singular lightening of the heart which Matey felt as she ran down the stairs ? She felt like capering . It was absurd . She felt exactly , she thought , with no reason at all , as though she had had very good news  --  when she had been expectingbad . She laughed at almost everything  --  at the fatnessp147of Mimi 's new baby , at the way they avoided the stuffy French ceremoniousness of Mimi 's overdraped bourgeois salon , and all piled into the kitchen , sunlit and copper-saucepan decorated , where the picnic baskets were being filled  --  at the frantic objectionsof that absurd , lovable Ziza to any plan of march to the river which would separate her from her husband . She noticed that Mimi looked at her curiously , as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance " Savezvousplanter les choux " with him . And later on she caught the same look of inquiry from Mme. Vinet as , picnic-baskets in hand , the comfortable family party strolled along the country lane that led from Mimi 's house to the banks of the Marne . " It is such a lovely , lovely autumn day , " thought Matey . This friendly autumn sun was enough to make a paralytic leap and run . And how deepheartedthese civilized French people were , how warm the family feeling which kept them all together ! How nice it was to be with them again ! She began to sing at the top of her voice " M. le Cure n'a pas deux souta-a-nes , " a light-minded marching song Henri had brought back from his military service . Leading the others , she kept it going through all of its interminable variations . As they finished the song , Mimi called out to Adrian , " You have brought back our old Mete to us ! " " How so ? " inquired Adrian . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . how she did upset all our rules the year she stayed with us ! " " Never ! " cried Matey , astonished . " I was crushed ! Submissive as a little mouse . . . I obeyed more rules than I had thought I could . . . " They interrupted her with derisive laughter , even Henri . " We always called that year our trip to America , ' " he told her . Adrian shook his head over a disillusionment . " All those stories of Matey 's about how suppressed she was ! " They drifted apart in a narrow place in the lane , Henri and Adrian walking together . " Well she has been suppressed since then , " said Henri . " I have not seen her like this , not since she was grown up . " He added pleasantly the obvious " It speaks well for her husband . " For an instant Adrian did not hear him . He had been as mystified by Matey 's high spirits as the Vinets , as Matey herself , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had with him . This was the light-heartedness into which hep148had so longed to open the door for her . He had seen one glimpse of it , the night of Francis ' visit , the evening when they had decided not to put their wedding off till June . He had tried , tried with all his love , his tenderness , his passion , to free her for it again . But he had been in the dark . He had not known where to throw his effort . What was it that kept her hesitating , sent her in the midst of cheerfulness into those inexplicable numb fits , made her unable to step off freely into gayety as she was doing today ? Henri 's remark finally penetrated to his attention . " I 'm afraid it ca n't be laid to her husband , " he answered , trying to speak lightly . " It 's rather improbable that the best of husbands should affect her all at once , today , like this . " He returned with the equally obvious " It 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But to himself he thought eagerly , wistfully , " Could it be she 's just waking up to our being together . . . for always . . . and liking it ? I 'll ask her . Why not ? " " How is it , mete , " Mme. Vinet was saying as she walked beside Matey , " that thy husband knows our marching songs and the commands of our army ? " " He spent a year and a half in Paris , studying painting , " explained Matey . " I thought you said he is in a bank . " " So he is . " She hesitated , decided that the plainest possible statement was the best , and explained , " He thought he had not enough talent to give himself to painting . " Mme. Vinet needed no embellishments on this statement , " Ah ? " she murmured . " Not an ordinary young man . " She looked ahead to where Adrian was carrying Mimi 's delighted four-yearold . The sound of his laughter and the delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said seriously to Matey , as she would to a daughter , " Mete , I think thou hast a good husband . Thou must be a good wife to him . " Matey was a little surprised by this . It was very different from any of the comments , spoken or unspoken , she had received on her marriage from her American circle . No one had ever put it to her from that side . " Thou must learn how to make up to him for what he has put away , " said Mme. Vinet earnestly , as though Matey were still a little girl under her care . But it was Ziza , little mad inflammatory Ziza , who challenged Matey most directly . After the lunch , stuffed and somnolent , theyp149lay about the river bank , smoking and " making their digestions . " The two Adrians with leisurely gestures were bailing out a waterloggedboat , preparatory to taking their brides for a row on the river . Matey and Ziza sat together , their backs against a great sycamore , looking down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mete cherie ? " Ziza asked pouncingly . " Are you making your husband happy ? " " Well , I hope so ! " said Matey , heartily , she thought . Ziza replied , " No , you 're not ! Not what I call happy , or you could n't answer in that voice . You are not happy as I ! I am crazy , crazy , crazy about my husband ! " Each impassioned folle ! follel burst up from her like a ball from a Roman candle . " You 're not going to be happy like Mimi , are you ? " she inquired . " Like a hen or a cat ? " Her great dark eyes glowered at the idea . " How can anybody tell what he 's going to be ? " asked Matey . " Well , I can , " said Ziza ; " I know exactly how I 'm going to be . I 'm going to worship Adrien every hour of my life . Do you worship your Adrian ? " she asked . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ? " Matey looked down at Adrian and saw him distinctly as an ordinary-looking young man with a sandy red mustache , rather lean and small compared to his heavy red-faced companion . The two young men were resting now , sprawled in the sun , smoking and talking quietly together . They were probably comparing notes , thought Matey , about conservative investment yields . Adrian 's rather leather-colored face wore an expression made up of mild interest and of perfect quiet and composure . The murmurof their voices came up to Matey 's ears . Even at that distanceshe could hear his strong un-French intonations . She looked at him more keenly , watching him as he smoked and talked and listened peaceably . After a moment , feeling her eyes on him , he glanced up , gave her a tender smile , lifted his hand in greeting , and turned back to his companion . He looked as natural and at ease , as little concerned with the impression he might be making , as  --  " as Sumner ever does , " thought Matey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a belated answer to Ziza 's question  --  not that Ziza had noticed , having caught her own Adrien 's eye and sent him an impassioned kiss  --  " Well , he makes me feel . . . " she stopped because the words that came to her mind seemed rather odd and inappropriate .. " he makes me feel  --  different , " she saidp150finally . This was certainly a noncommittal statement , she thought , to set by Ziza 's fireworks . But Ziza never did the expected . She flung her arms about Matey 's neck and cried out , almost sobbing , " Yes , darling , darling , is n't it like being in a different world "  --  this was not nearly strong enough  --  " like being in another universe . " " Ziza is the same crazy little thing she always was , " thought Matey . " I know why her mother and sister feel uneasy about her . " She glanced down at the stalwart young Fleming there with Adrian , and wished he looked less opaque . Mimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children talking about so excitedly ? " " Our husbands ! " cried Ziza , as if it were self-evident . Mimi lowered herself a little heavily to the grass beside them , prosperity and maternity having made picnics slightly difficult for her . " Wait till you have children , " she said . " Do you want children , mete ? " asked Ziza , but she evidently had no interest in whether Matey did or did not , for she went on hastily , " I suppose I do . Adrien would like it , I imagine . But I would hate them if they got between Adrien and me  --  for a minute  --  for an instant ! " " You do n't know what you 're talking about , " said Mimi . " Wait till you have your first baby . " " I 'm no setting hen , " said Ziza , running her pointed red tongue around over her red lips as she spoke , in her old expression for exasperation . " You do n't know what you are , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ! " cried Ziza . " And that 's enough for me ! " She got up impatiently and ran down the bank to join the men . Mimi gave Matey a look which said , " You see what we mean . " She said aloud , self-righteously , " Now that 's not the way I feel about my husband at all . " Matey made no answer . Out of this familiar tossing about of the idea of being married , a singular idea had occurred to her with great force . Why , she was married too  --  really married  --  permanently . This was not one of the things that would disappear behind the curtain of change . Adrian was always to be there , would never disappear or fade into the background with a move to another town . How strange that she should feel this onlyp151now ? She had known it before . Why was it only now that she believed it ? It took time , did n't it , for anything to happen ? Mme. Vinet , followed by Henri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about thy husband 's family and home . It may be years before we see thee again . " Matey was very sure it would be years before they saw each other again . So , sitting on the bank of the Marne , the rich humanized French countryside about her , she tried to paint for them the small old Hudson valley town , and the rich humanized Dutchess County countryside . There was little in her picture that was new to them . The slow old town full of blood-kin and set traditions , the great-aunt with her passion for ancestors , the humorous , unambitious , musical father-in-law  --  they had seen all those in French provincial towns . It was not unlike what lay before Ziza . And Adrian 's salary of $1200 a year which Francis had found so pitiable sounded normal to them . About what Henri had . It was only when she chanced to speak of going to Meeting with Adrian and his father that they looked surprised . A darkeningcame over the face of the conscientiously anti-clerical Mme. Vinet . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , looking down at Adrian , her old dislike and fear of the inhumanitiesof religion shadowing her eyes . " Well , not like any church you ever heard of , " said Matey hastily . " I 'll tell you about it . " They listened in astonishment . " No professional priests ? Why , I might like a religion that nobody made his living out of , " cried Henri . " No music ! " murmured Mme. Vinet , horrified . " No toleration of war , really and truly ? " said Mimi , already a European mother with sons . No one made any comment during her attempt to give them some idea of a Quaker meeting . " It 's not a bit like a church service with something active going on every minute , " she told them . " It 's an exercise in contemplation , really . Most of the time is spent in silence . Silences longer than you 'd think possible . At first I fidgeted and coughed and noticed my finger-nails . But I was quite astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet ! At first just an empty quiet , like a waking sleep . But do you know , even that 's awfully restful . And then , once in a while , up through the space cleared from the clutter of surface things ,  |p152you  feel a deep lifting of something more . . . like a slow tide rising . . . . " She was silent . They looked at her in surprise . She was a little surprised herself . " Do you  --  do you pray at those times ? " asked Mimi , timidly , wistfully . " Now that I have children , I . .. " " No , " said Matey , trying to tell the truth . " You know I 've never been at all religious . I do n't think I have ever prayed . " " I call that praying . . . " said Henri decisively . All this talk about praying made Mme. Vinet a little uneasy . " Wo n't they ever get the boat ready ? " she asked , looking down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the boat ride . Brides first ! " sang out Ziza , turningtoward them . They left 1Iimi sitting under the tree , musing , her head bent down . In spite of her good husband and prosperous home and nice children , Mimi 's old pensive look seemed close to the surface . In the rumbling , jolting , badly lighted interior of the thirdclasscompartment going back to the city , conversation was difficult . And they were all pleasantly drugged with their dose of fresh air and exercise . The Vinets slept frankly , peaceably , little Paul with his head on his older brother 's lap . Matey 's eyes slowly flickered open and shut . For a moment it seemed to her that she was a little girl again , returning with the Vinets from a Sunday expedition into the country . Adrian leaned to her ear . " This morning , " he asked her softly , " when you were all at once so gay , singing and dancing . . . what was it ? " She opened her eyes and tried sleepily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered . " Do you ever know the reason for a change of mood ? I just seemed all of a sudden to enjoy things more . " She saw that her answer had disappointed Adrian and added , " I 'd tell you , Adrian , if I knew , truly I . . . " And then it came to her . " Oh , yes , I remember perfectly now . It was the country looking so lovely  --  and something or other about the wheat that came into my head . And the fresh air had stopped my headache . " " Ah , " said Adrian . He added , " I hope it does n't ache now . " " Not a bit , " she told him ; " I never felt better . It 's been a lovely day , has n't it ? Are n't the Vinets nice ? Is n't Ziza a wild little darling ? "  |p153She  laid her head down on his shoulder and fell again into a waking doze , all sorts of disconnected pictures wavering through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Sumner sitting sentimentally in Rebecca 's kitchen of an evening ; the enigmatic expression in Priscilla 's eyes , during the long silences of their Quaker wedding ; a chemise she had left lying across a chair in the hotel bedroom , in which she must remember to run a ribbon , the long flexible themes in the Arietta of the Sonata Mme. Vinet had played while they were waiting for supper at Mimi 's ; and then , as clearly as if she had seen them out of the train window , a preposterous pair of big Dutch country boys , pedaling madly along on a tandem bicycle , their huge , their voluminous , their incredible trousers bellying in the wind like homespun sails . She remembered perfectly where she had seen them , though she had not thought of them from that day to this . It had been in Amsterdam , in the midst of the city traffic . How ridiculous they had looked , and how heartily and goodhumoredly they had returnedthe laughing shouts and greetings of the city crowd . They had looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel window , laughing and waving her hand at them , and had lifted their flat Dutch caps with a gay gesture of comedy . Funny that should come into her mind now ! " Adrian , " she said impulsively , " I do n't know what made me so contrary about Holland . Now I think of it again , I think it would be fun to sail for home from a Dutch port , and stop over in Louvain to see Ziza on the way north . " " Rising from the vasty deeps of non-existence , I salute thee , Holland , " said Adrian . " I always did sort of like the Dutch . " 0F THE honeymoon fortnight in Paris Matey remembered best , after that day with the Vinets , the visit to Minarossi 's , and the first time she went to the Louvre with Adrian . The Vinets being musical rather than artistic , she was very much more familiar with the Salle Gaveau than with the Louvre and had never so much as heard of Minarossi 's . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dull midsummerseason the moldy old rookery was almost deserted . The calico-clad concierge billowed out from her loge with a wide smile , a copious greeting , a handclasp for Adrian , and a searching look of scrutiny for his new wife . " I hope you will make M. Adrien happy , Madame , " said the whiskered , triple-chinned , coarse old woman , " for he has a beautiful nature ! " She and Mme. Vinet ! thought Matey . Everybody in America had concentrated , as far as she could remember , on hoping Adrian would make her happy ! Adrian was laughing over his beautiful nature and accusing Mme. Dol of saying the same thing to every returned student , when some chance remark brought out the news that among the few painters still clinging to the old place in summer for the sake of reduced rent for studios was le petit Marceau . " Oh , we must see him , " said Adrian to Matey . " He 's one of the old gang . " They went down the dilapidated stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow wooden stairs , glancing in through open doors to big dusty bare deserted rooms . Through the half-open door of one she caught a glimpse of an elderly Italian model posing in a banal attitude , leaning on a long staff . A few young men with easels sat in a semicirclearound him , looking up intently at the nude brown withered body which Matey found as unlovely as the rest of this dingy palace of Art . Le petit Marceau being found ( a study in still life on his canvas , a cheese , a pear , a brass candlestick and an orange posing for him ) proved to be a small young man with an immense brown beard , who at the sight of Adrian raised arms to heaven , and then springing forward with loud cries , kissed him soundly on both cheeks . There was a flurry of introduction , greetings , the brown beard bent solemnly over Matey 's hand while a pair of sharp brown eyes looked hard at her . ( " He 's wondering , " thought Matey to herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " ) There were rapid-fire questions and answers about a dozen names strange to Matey , in the midst of which le petit Marceau interruptedAdrian by another ardent embrace . " Bon Dieu , mon vieux ! If I could only tell thee how sweetly that monumental accent of thine rings in my ears ! If only the rest were here to listen to it ! " To Matey he explained what had already been very apparent to her . " Your husband , Madame , is a great favorite among us all . "  | " He 's rather a favorite of mine , " said Matey . The little Marceau drew back with a Mounet-Sully gesture of dramatic surprise and admiration . " But you have no accent ! you are French ! Mon Adrien has married a French . . . " He was about to rush on her with an embrace . " No , he has n't , " said Adrian hastily , laughing . " She 's as Americanas I am . In fact she is a cousin of mine . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must persuade him , " said Marceau to Matey , " to return here , to give up this melancholy plan of his for making a bourgeoisof himself ... " " God did that , not I , " said Adrian , beginning to look restless . Passing quickly into farewells , he steered Matey back into the street . " How did it look to you , dear ? " he asked Matey . She made the little sign with finger and thumb which had been whimsically agreed upon between them as an announcement of truth told with difficulty , and answered , " About as alluringas an empty barn . How did it look to you ? " " I do n't believe I 'll tell you , " said Adrian . He so seldom spoke gravely to her , except of his love , that Matey was startled . " Are you  --  do you regret  --  ? " she asked him , expecting the usual instant reassurance that nothing was of any consequence to him so long as she was beside him . " Well , why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel no need to say anything more , walking along in a silence that was rather somber . She felt a chill . She had supposed it an understood matter that she completely filled his life , his capacity for joy . Was that not the basis for marriage ? She thought to herself that this was the traditional first step away from the honeymoon glamour . At the Louvre Adrian was increasingly silent , a quite different companion from the one with whom she had " done " the Belgian galleries , as new to him as to her . The Louvre was evidently anything but new to Adrian . His feet carried him here and there . from one favorite canvas to another , with no thought on his part . In the room of the Italian primitives , one of the bored elderly guardians , shifting his weight from one aching foot to the other , looked hard at Adrian , broke into a smile , and came shuffling forward to shake hands with him . " Where have you been this long time , M. Fort ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Ah , getting married ? Well , half a year is not too long for that . " Would he , too ? wondered Matey . Yes , it was obvious that he was asking himself , European fashion , as he looked at her , whether she would make a good wife for Adrian , rather than the other way around . " I used to copy here a good deal , " explained Adrian briefly to her as they moved away . He had never talked much to Matey about his painting , and had apparently not taken home from Paris a single canvas . They walked around the room now , passing from the candor of the pink and blue and gold Angelicos to a canvas which gave Matey a quiet unesthetic emotion . It was an Italian painting of a grotesquely ugly bald old man with a bulbous red nose , leaning down to welcome a small fair-haired boy who came running happily into his arms . Matey cried out , " Oh , Aunt Connie ! The expression in the old man 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away , as they did very soon , she stopped in the anteroom and bought a photograph of that picture . " We 'll hang it in the living-room over the mantel , " said Adrian , " in memory of Aunt Connie . I always liked that too .. . hut it was the red in the cloak that struck me . I like Ghirlandajo anyhow . He was n't one of the great ones . None of his canvases ever gives you the authentic thrill . He knew that too . He just offered what he had , so simply , so . . . It seems as though ... " He was silent again . In silence they came down the steps of the Louvre into the little shrubbery jungle of the small park around the Lafayette statue . " Let 's go and sit on that bench behind the lilac bushes , " said Matey , and when they were there , as unabashedly as any midinetteshe gave her husband a long kiss . " I believe I love you , Adrian , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's high time you . . . " Adrian made an attempt to strike the whimsical note , but his voice failing him , gave it up . His hazel eyes searched her gray ones deeply . " Oh , Matey ... " he said with a long sigh . It was the first time he had asked anything of her , the first time  --  was it not ?  --  that anybody had asked anything of Matey.  |p157U|p  from unknown depths in her heart came a flood of tenderness such as she had never felt . She flung open her arms to her husband . " Ah , Adrian , if I can only make you happy ! " she murmured , her lips on his cheek . THE first summer after Matey 's wedding , Priscilla was personallyconducting a party to the North Cape and the sisters saw each other only for a day or two . The second summer Priscilla decided not to take her usual trip with a group of girls . She was rather tired of Europe , she wrote , and very tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought it might be a good idea to get acquainted with her small namesake . If Matey was really sure she would n't be too much trouble , with the baby and all . . Adrian agreed with Matey that Priscilla would n't be too much trouble . " But whatever can she find to do in Rustdorf for a whole summer ? " he asked , answering himself , " Oh , of course tennis . We must get the courts in extra good shape . " Except for a few mild outings and an occasional Saturday after , noon match of the Rustdorf Tennis Club with . players from Newburghor Poughkeepsie , there was nothing at all to amuse Priscilla , and for years she had been used to a great deal of amusing . In the winter Rustdorf people were not without diversions . They went occasionally up to Poughkeepsie to a concert , or to a lecture at Vassar open to the public , or after much planning and arrangingof time and finances , went down to New York on the 5:20 train , coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost too sleepy to trudge home from the station . There was a Rustdorf chorus too , in which Matey and Adrian and Adrian 's father sang , which every spring gave a public performance of one of the less difficult oratorios or cantatas . As long as the ice held and the snow was good there was plenty of winter fun . Of course a Bridge Club , and a Village Improvement Society , and a District Nursing Association , if you could call their meetings diversions . And people invited each other around for the evening meal which was still called supper . But the summer Rustdorf was of an abysmal quiet . It is hot in the Hudson valley . All nature settles down to a slower-paced life . Adrian 's father said , " Our Dutch blood comes to the top in summer . " Of course young mothers with first babies are never anything but hurried . Summer brought no slackening of speed to Matey that year . Except at Meeting , she seldom had an instant of leisure in which to think connectedly of Priscilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when Adrian called her attention to it , she agreed with him that it was a wonder that Priscilla , who at this time of year was usually making the rounds of the leather shops on the Ponte Vecchio or taking for the tenth time the drive to Amalfi , could endure such an existence as theirs . Even the daily tennis outing was Rustdorfian . They usually walked down Washington Street , Adrian pushing the baby-carriage , the three rackets lying across the foot . From the other direction came Dirck Davis and his young wife , also pushing a baby-carriage . Adrian sometimes asked Matey , " How does Priscillastand us ? " Sometimes they had to wait before a court was free , for tennis was one of the fixed Rustdorf traditions and both courts were often occupied . They sat about on the old greenpaintedbenches then , chatting with neighbors they found there . Everybody was related to everybody else by blood , or marriage , or old neighborhood habits ; everybody knew the resources , financial and intellectual , of all the rest ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than he was , so nobody bothered to try . Matey had never heard such natural talk as there was in Rustdorf or felt so natural herself as she did , sitting under the old elms , exchanging impressions of the day 's news , watching with one eye the players flashing about the courts , and with the other keeping track of the baby sleeping in her baby-carriage . But she realized that what seemed restful to her might easily seem a frightful bore to Priscilla , used to people for whom social contacts meant assuming an attitude , a manner , an expression , quite different from their natural ones . If Priscilla had been at all musical she might have been interested in the odd relationship growing up between Matey and Adrian 's father . But music was one of the many things which Priscilla had long ago locked out . On Sunday afternoons , the usual time for one of the joint weekly seances before the piano , Priscilla wrote letters . So the only break in the monotony of the tennis-less Sundays was going to Meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p159For  Priscilla went to Meeting as naturally as she fell into other Rustdorf ways . Nobody had dreamed of asking her to go . Everybody was surprised that she did , everybody , that is , except Aunt Tryntje , who diagnosed it as " the Van Benthuysen coming out in her . " Matey spent considerable time in Meeting wondering why in the world Priscilla had ever thought of coming . Sometimesshe sat looking at her sister 's serious , absent profile , marvelingat the invisible thickness of the wall that could stand between human beings so close to each other . For she had been able to share her marriage and motherhood with Priscilla as little as her courtship . Even over the exciting new daughter and niece , she had never been able to say anything better than " I can hardly believe she 's real . Wherever do they come from  --  a new person like that , all at once ? " or " Are n't little babies too funny when they sneeze ! " and once when together they were bathing the baby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " That last question , trivial as it seemed , had received a silent answer from Priscilla louder than her words , which were merely , in a casual tone , " Why , a little like Francis , do n't you think ? " Ominous as a mutter of distant thunder , something unspoken passed between the two women . Matey answered , looking at the mysterious unknown new member of humanity on her knee , " Oh , do you think so ? I never noticed . " But she had . And though it startled her to hear in what Priscilla did not say an echo of what was in her own mind , she felt comforted to know that Priscilla shared it with her as Adrian could not . " Hand me the talcum powder , will you , Priscilla ? " she asked . During an especially silent Meeting one Sunday it occurred to Matey that if she could but put out of her head the idea that words were the only expression of what people felt , Priscilla and she might enjoy more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always trying vainly to drag into the net of syllables something which  --  for them  --  lived in another , deeper medium . To accept , once for all , this mute speech as their true one might free her from her troubling sense of the disharmony between their trivial talk and the strength and beauty of the tie between them . As they walked home together through the Sunday stillness of the old town , she took Priscilla 's hand in hers . For a time they walked hand in hand as they had when they were little girls . She felt Priscilla 's fingers gently return the pressure of hers. abo THE DEEPENING STREAMp160Matey thought , " How lonely women must be who have no sister ! " Presently Priscilla said in a low peaceful voice , " Elms are nice for street trees , are n't they , when they get old ? " As she spoke she looked up at the roof of the leafy arcade over the sidewalk . " Yes , I think they 're more graceful than maples , " Matey answered , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old street from side to side . Matey was not sure , but it seemed to her that Priscilla felt it too . As the summer days slid by , Adrian began to guess that Priscillawas not too frightfully bored by Rustdorf . He said to Matey once , " Who 'd have thought that Priscilla could draw her breath in our equatorial domesticity ? " and added , " Maybe she is too suffocated by it to get out . " She never said whether she liked it or not , but she stayed on and on , making herself more or less useful , refusing various vacation invitations to Maine and the Adirondacks from one or another of her wide circle of acquaintances . Hearing Matey say once that in her letters to the Vinets she never felt she gave them any idea of what her life now was , Priscilla bought a camera and took some snapshots of Matey and Adrian and the baby , and their old story-and-a-half stone house , green-shuttered , with the tall locust trees towering slimly over it , and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . Prints of these were sent to the Vinets and to le petit Marceau and others of Adrian 's studio comrades with whom he kept up , at long intervals , a desultory correspondence . In due time the Vinet girls sent back letters with snapshots of their children , homes , and husbands . For Ziza now had a baby , a little boy . " I 'm ahead of you , mete , " she wrote exultantly ; " I have two Adriens to your one . " Priscilla had never known the Vinets as well as Matey did , but she read these letters all through and looked attentively at the photographs . She made no comment on them beyond " Is n't it queer , Mme. Vinet has four grandchildren now , and all boys . " Adrian said , " Le petit Marceau  --  do you remember him , Matey ?  --  has a boy too , he writes me . " Aunt Tryntje interrupted her count of knitting stitches to remark , " People used to say that was a sign of war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked than any other sentiments she might be having in Rust/dorf , and this although the cocoon-like little Priscilla was in the two-months-old somnolent , sometimes damp , occasionally soursmellingand vociferous stage of development usually disliked by sophisticated unmarried aunts . Matey herself , excited and fatigued by the complications of caring for a baby , was occasionally out of all patience with her small daughter . But Priscilla , though she was a little shy of taking responsibility , seemed never to tire of being with the tiny scrap of flesh , so amusingly human . She often volunteered to be nursemaid while the baby slept in her carriage out of doors or lay there waiting for her next meal , regarding the world with very round blue eyes . Aunt Priscilla always had a book with her , or a writing tablet . But she wrote few letters and did not read much . Glancing out of the window as she flew about the housework in the precious interval of the baby 's nap , Matey often saw her sister sitting idly , her head tipped back against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven out of tree-green and sun-gold . " Never , " she told Adrian , " never since I can remember did I see Priscilla doing nothing . She was always busy about somethingevery minute . " " Maybe making up for lost time , " suggested Adrian . " If I 'd been busy every minute of my life I 'd want to rest by the time I was thirty-three . " Matey herself was rather often nervously and physically tired , " wild " she sometimes told Adrian , because there were more things to do every minute than she had thought possible . She grabbed at one , half did it , and was summoned imperiously to something else , until she was sometimes crosser than ever before in her life . She snapped at Adrian occasionally , and he rather snapped back , for his nights were broken , too . But it oddly did not matter much . Sometimes Matey , remembering the tragic importance which the very intonation of a word had had for her , how a mere impatient look from her father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand why a hearty exchange of impatient exclamations with Adrian seemed to leave no more impression on the color of her day than did the chance small discomfort of settinga hairpin crookedly in her hair and taking it out to set it straight . The point seemed to be that Adrian was entirely different  --  to her  --  from any one else living . It was not , as Ziza seemed to feel , a passionate adoration of everything her husband did which16z THE DEEPENING STREAMp162made her married life unrecognizably different from anything she had known before . Little habits of his , his unpunctuality , his whistling , his waiting too long before going to the barber 's to have his hair cut , annoyed her to the point of exasperation . It seemed to be rather his permanent nearness to her , and hers to him , a nearness immeasurably beyond anything she had dreamed possible . One Sunday morning as they lay talking together in the peaceable quiet of a rare vacation dawn when the baby slept late , she gave him an impression that had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her head on his shoulder . " Honestly I hardly knew for an instant which was my flesh and which yours , " she said . " Do you know , Adrian , lots of times I feel closer to you than to me . " " I know what you mean all right , " said Adrian . " I 've thought of it too  --  I believe I 'd tell you things I 've always kept dark from myself . " " Well , that would mean , " began Matey , on the trail of a new idea , " that sex helps bring people  --  instead of the way every-body  --  " But then the baby did wake up with her usual vital , hungry , attention-demanding yell , and whatever abstract idea had been crudely before its time trying to come to life in Matey 's mind , slid back safely into the fertile formlessness where during this period most of her ideas lay , darkly striking roots into rich soil . The unending urgent tasks of their always disorganized day had begun . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on one deck and she on another . In a moment she had the baby in bed with her , and Adrian , gone sleepily downstairs in slippers and dressing-gown to start Sunday breakfast , was shouting up to her that the milkman had forgotten to leave the milk and was there any left from yesterday . Over the greedily nursing baby she shouted back uncompromisingly , " No , not a drop ! " so loudly that it sounded almost like an oath , and grimly left him to wrestle unaided with this problem . They had begun another day of their cruise , during which they would both rush about from side to side of their small undermannedcraft , pulling at this rope and frantically letting out or furling this sail , like excited inexperienced sailors in windy weather . For whatever else they were , they were not becalmed . The lifting plunge forward of the deck under their feet as the following wind pushed hard on their sails made them stumble sometimes , and catch at each other , and for a moment standp163unsteadily , locked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ears . It was not at all either what the sentimental or the brutal reports of marriage had led Matey to expect , although she had really " expected " nothing , drifting forward in that carefully acquired skepticism of all theories of life which she had learned in college . She had " expected " nothing very exactly and she did not know very exactly what she was getting because she had no time to consider the matter . The raw material of life poured in on her with such speed and in such bulk that she could not even begin to get it in order , could only toss it here and there in heaps , to make room for what would be borne in by the next day 's high tide . She could not have reported accurately on any part of all this newness . Sometimes she loved her small daughter almost to agony ; again , on the very same day , when she was tired , it was not love she felt but indignation over the egotism with which the baby insisted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppled over from a too swelling crest into outrageous laughter . She and Adrian were often overtaken by helpless mirth at the Nero-like tyranny of the newcomer . " The nerve of her , " cried Adrian , " pushing us off the center of the stage like this ! " Matey had not laughed so much  --  or scolded so much  --  or cared so intensely about anything  --  or been so tired  --  or felt herself so flooded with vitality  --  not since she had been a little girl , playing . If Priscilla had ever asked her , " Well  --  ? " Matey 's report on marriage would have been only a wild half-laughing , " Why , now , blow wind , swell billow , swim bark ! The storm is up and all is on the hazard . " Washington Street  --  the one which was always going to be paved  --  had been filled up in modern times to make the grade more even . The large front lawn of the young Fort menage wasseveralfeet below the street , from which a short flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sidewalk thus lay about on a level with the eyes of the people in the house or on the lawn , and Adrian pointed out to Matey how the passers-by on foot or in carriages ( there were as yet but few automobiles ) , coming and going in each direction , made a long moving many-colored band or frieze , sharply defined below by the empty green plane of the lawn and above by the dense foliage of the elms . The figures on this decorated band were for the most part far enough away to be soundless , which Adrian insisted brought out their colors more .. brilliantly . Matey would never have seen this for herself , but once her attention had been called to it , was quite taken by the idea and now saw it with Adrian 's painter-eyes . Whenever they glanced up there was a new design , a new compositionto look at . Sometimes a group of children loitered along the sidewalk , talking loudly , tagging each other and leaping suddenly to one side with deer-like bounds ; sometimes a farmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ; or a nicely painted ancient phaeton with one of Aunt Tryntje 's oldladyfriends driving a jogging horse ; or a half-grown boy flashed along swallow-like on a glistening bicycle ; sometimes , going to or from the factory , a line of powerfully built workmen in rough old clothes sculptured to significance by the strong bodies under them ; or a well-pressed suit of clothes went satirically by , folding and opening the creases of its trouser-legs in the motion of walking , the face of one of the merchants of town topping the coat and white collar ; or rattling and shiny , a smart red-wheeled dogcartfrom one of the " estates " out in the country . If it were no more than the grocer 's wagon , or elderly Peter Russell with his brood of unkempt motherless little girls , something was always being painted by the airy brushes of sun and shadow on the frieze which hung there , halfway up that eastern wall of their world . One day it had rained hard in the morning so that the courts were too wet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ( always ! ) too long grass of the front lawn . Priscilla went out on the front porch with a book which soon fell shut on her knee as she sat idly brooding . The baby was " being good " although awake . She lay on a blanket on the grass , making futile grabs at the unattainable feet dangling in the air at the end of her short legs , occasionally murmuring a good-natured remark to herself about the game she was playing . Matey stood for a moment at the house door to look at all this . She was tired , as she often was , too tired even to remember what there was urgently needing to be done . She went slowly to where the small Priscilla lay and sat down beside her on the blanket . At once her released body drifted into a sort of physical somnolence . She leaned against the tree and thought of nothing at all ,  |p165the  only thing in her mind a vague wonder that she could possibly feel , as she often did in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet have this new savage magnificent underswell of con viction that there was nothing  --  nothing !  --  that she could not do if necessary . The whir of Adrian 's lawn-mower was rhythmic . On the outdoor frieze sunlight and shadow painted three small children , tumbling forward with a furry black puppy . Back of them towered a golden hay-wagon , pulled by two bright bay horses , stepping slowly with a firm air of being adequate to what there was to do , like an echo to what was in the background of Matey 's fatigue . Her eyelids dropped shut , as though the sunny quiet and the singsong of the lawn-mower had put her to sleep . Did she go to sleep ? It seemed to be from a wide realm of other-consciousness that she emerged with the slow beat of her eyelids opening . The baby still lay beside her , placidly untroubled by never reaching her feet , the puppy 's laughing yelps came clearly though faintly from down the street , the hay-wagon was just ponderously moving off at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , for a heartbeat Matey opened her eyes upon another world . It was just what it had been , of course . And yet wholly something else . Oh , lovely ! lovely ! heartbreaking with beauty ! This was her world , her corner of life , just what she had known she had . . . but transfigured as if it and she had been carried up to another new , unthinkable dimension . . . and yet it was not new at all . Once before she had felt this melting into strange heavenliness of something quite familiar and old . She remembered now . The two moments fused together . . . she was still Matey Fort , sitting under one of her own trees , a grown woman , a mother . . . and she was also a little ignorant surprised child leaning over a red-plush railing while up from the depths , borne past her on the angel wings of the violins , came the voice of revelation . She was on her feet . She turned to Adrian now as naturally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ran across the lawn to him . " Adrian , Adrian ! " she said in an eager low voice , shaking his arm a little . " Now I know what heaven will be . . . the same , the same as life , and yet transfigured . . all glory . . . like something you 've heard on the piano played by the whole orchestra , you know ! " 166 THE DEEPENING STREAMp166No , he did not know . Had no idea what was in het mind , looked bewildered . He could not , of course , Matey remembered now , share in a long-past moment of hers , which had been too impalpable for her to tell herself in words . But she could tell him more in words than she had ever been able to tell herself . She knew she could ! Was he not closer and clearer to her than her own unknown self ? She could say it out , if she could hold his hand as she now did in both hers , if she could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of solitude . Quick , before the glow faded  --  " Why , Adrian , here is just what I have always had . what everybody has . . . sunlight , the earth , trees , a shelter , food . . . they meant nothing to me ... I do n't believe I ever in my life really looked at them till just now . But for an instant , over there , in the quiet , I saw what it all makes for me . . . with you , with the baby . Why , now it 's ... " After all it was not with words she told him . They stood hand in hand , smiling into each other 's quiet eyes . On the porch behind them , Priscilla  --  they had forgotten her  --  stirred in her chair . That night before she dropped off to sleep Matey 's memory presented her with an old picture  --  a little girl , not so very many years older than her own little girl , trotting along a narrow path , unquestioningly , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall green bushes of the broom . Down the path , out of sight of the child , waited terror . But Priscilla had been there , who knew there was nothing to be afraid of . Matey thought drowsily , " It 's the other way around now . " MATEY had always wanted a listener for her music . At least , years before , she had thought it would be lovely if Priscillawould share what she was doing at the piano . And now she had a listener , Adrian 's father . In a way Adrian was a listener , too . He liked to hear her play , especially if it was something he already knew and liked . But he soon became accustomedp167to the sound of the piano in the house and was capable of getting up in the middle of a favorite piece of music to open the furnace draught or to make sure the baby-carriage had not been left out in the rain . This was the way most people listened to music , Matey knew . That is , they thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and Adrian was that he did not pretend to anything more than he was . Adrian 's father , on the contrary , took root in his armchair with her first note and never stirred till after the last one . Yet for a long time his way of listening rubbed Matey 's susceptibilities the wrong way as much as Adrian 's " naturalness . " He listened with intensity to every note , but there was no more recognition of Matey in this concentration than in Adrian 's way of remembering a house errand that needed to be done . There were moments in that first period of her Rustdorf life when she was out of all patience with her father-in-law for his way of reducing her to no more than a sheet of glass through which he gazed at the composer'sintention . His silences were monumental . And when he broke them it was never to refer to Matey 's playing , no matter how good it might have been . What he said was , " Funny , is n't it , how that change of key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your brain into your feelings . " Or , " Well ! who ever would have thought that to set a triplet in the middle of a run would give it wings like that . " Often he said nothing at all . Sometimes did not even remember , when she finished , to thank his daughter-in-law . In many encounters of that first year with Adrian and his family Matey was piqued by what Dirck Davis ' young Maryland wife , Flora , called plaintively " their Quaker ways . " She and Flora as newcomers occasionally sympathized with each other about Rustdorf customs and had a catch-word in common  --  " There , Isaac , that is a good hat "  --  which they often quoted to each other with a smile . It was drawn from a story of Aunt Tryntje 's about a Friendly hatmaker of the town in early days who had been asked by an elderly Quaker neighbor to make him a beaver hat . When he presented it to the purchaser he said , " There , Isaac , that is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , if thee dies in any sort of season . " Matey sometimes repeated this phrase spitefully to herself at the piano , her father-in-law at her elbow . She could not but be affected by the intense interest Adrian 's father took in the168 THE DEEPENING STREAMp168music open to him through her playing ; she was , as a matter of fact , insensibly coming to be half of a musical personality of which her father-in-law was the other half . But she was none the less often vexed and exasperated by him and agreed heartily with Flora Davis when she said in confidence , " Seems as if Quakers just make a point of not having nice manners , does n't it . " That is , she had thought she agreed with her , until the evening when she played at a benefit musicale given at one of the handsome " estates " near Rustdorf . It was the country home of a wealthy New York family of Dutch origin who from time to time took a notion to " join in the life of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and prepared her music and her gown with more care than she would have been willing to admit to any one but her brother . She and her father-in-law were working their way through the earlier Beethoven Sonatas that winter , but she knew better than to offer such undramatic fare as that . She began to practice some showy Liszt , but Adrian 's father so took the luster from it by his silent bewilderment at her choice that she threw it down pettishly and decided on the Chopin Etude in C Minor  --  the " Revolutionary . " She found it outrageously difficult to get up to tempo , quite beyond her usual capacity , and she was obliged to give hours of work to it for several weeks before the musicale , revenging herself on her fatherin-lawby never letting him hear a note of it . The musicale was held in a handsome drawing-room and was carried out according to the recipe for what is known as a " brilliantaffair . " " Like a faculty party , " thought Matey , looking out over the restless glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleased to be the center of these moneyed men and women , but before striking her first note she waited with a sternnesstaught her by Mme. Vinet , till perfect quiet filled the room . If faculty wives had as much money to spend on their clothes as these , " she added to herself . Perfect silence finally did fill the room . Matey played . Chopin 's tocsin clanged out its bronze notes savagely in the midst of a decorous silence . Then the vibration of the fortissimo ed appassionato ending had died away , the audience applauded . They applauded generously , having been surprised by the unexpectedly vigorous performance of the young provincial matron , invited only to gratify local pride . And what they applauded was the player 's skill and not thep169music . There was no doubt about that . After the concert was over , they crowded about her , filling the air with the correct catchwordswhich they had learned from their parents and which they were teaching their children , " Perfectly fascinating ! " " Such a lovely touch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique ! " Here were the nice manners Matey and Dirck Davis ' wife had missed . These people were well bred enough to admire her and not Chopin . But living with the two Adrians had trained her ear to too fine a pitch of accuracy ; it heard a crackled flatness in this good breeding . She did not feel exhilarated , she felt grim , as she put off her excited sharing of Chopin 's violence and put on the correct smile to match the nice manners of these nice people . And when she heard her own voice saying brightly , " So good of you to say so ! " and " Oh , you 're so very kind ! " she felt belittled and trivial and depressed . She looked from one smiling pleasant face to another , trying to find in one of them the awakened expression of some one who has really heard music . But they were all alike masked to uniformity by their formulas . Formulas were what Adrian  --  what all Quakers  --  lacked . Matey , smiling and grimacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not miss them as much as she thought she had . One man said , " It 's absurd to think of such a pianist being buried in a place like Rustdorf . " His intention was evidently no more than to say in a slightly new manner the " how perfectly fascinating ! " of the others . But Matey heard in his words a cornplacentimplied assumption of superior musical intelligence in the audience before her . She found this so unexpected and naive that all at once her grimness vanished in a laugh . The Sunday after , without warning him , she played that Etude for Adrian 's father . He sat motionless from the opening cry to the peremptory violence of the last four chords , and then rising all in one piece , went blindly out , not noticing that she existed . That was one time when he had not minded in the least his Quaker ways . In fact from that time on she slipped with less friction into the dual personality which she and her father-in-law were creating , became little by little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Quaker herself . She leaned more consciously on his capacity for musical attention , far riper and firmer than hers . It never wavered or slipped for a bar or two , as hers did . She felt him sometimes , half inside her own head , warning her to take care lest she lose the significance of a single phrase . Never before had Matey felt so physically the difference between music that has meaning in every phrase  --  and the other kind . Under their scrutiny " the other kind " withered up and blew away . Sometimes her listener made inventive suggestions : " How about pausing just a breath before the end of that run ? Would n't it add a freshness to the climax not to have that last note come as a matter of course ? " Or " Hold on , hold on ! Is n't the bass the important part of this ? " Together they worked out small delicacies of interpretation , the sum total of which transformed their music into something richer than Matey had ever dreamed it could be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it sounded childish and obvious . The Minuetto of one of the Beethoven Sonatas was one of the things she had learned to play in Hamilton . The difference betweenwhat she made of it then and now was like a diagram , she thought , of what growing up amounted to . " You simply learn to see what 's there instead of missing the important things by taking them for granted as a child does . " She sometimes thought , " Is n't it strange how you go on accepting childishness for all there is , never guessing the depths of understanding that lie beyond , waiting for you to grow up to them ? " I T WAS , however , not at all with any depth of understanding but with stupefaction that Matey greeted Priscilla 's announcementduring her second summer vacation in Rustdorf of her intention to marry the faded elderly widower who lived in Aunt Connie 's house and whom Matey had come to accept in the characterof harmless neighbor under the title of Cousin Peter Russell . No , she acted toward the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . She recognized in her consternation at Priscilla'shaving thus " thrown herself away " the very quality of Francis , and it kept her mute . The exclamations of alarm , of anxiety , of disappointment , might rise to her lips fast enough , but how could she bring them out save in Francis ' voice ? Never before had she seen so clearly how Francis had stood between her and that part of their common inheritance which Aunt Tryntje wouldp171call their Gilbert blood . How Francis ' example had colored her estimate of values ! The pictures he painted of his success in Pittsburgh , how profoundly they had affected her judgment of Rustdorf life ! " Somebody ought to talk sense to Priscilla , " she told Adrian , excitedly , " but I ca n't ! " She could not , because the sort of sense she thought Priscilla ought to hear was the Francis sort . She did not spare Adrian at least ; she poured out her selfreproachto him , she cried out on herself for having been so blind . For she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had all been happening before her eyes . She had been so absorbed in her own interests she had not seen what was there . She could now trace it step by step back to the beginningwhich she had seen but had not recognized . For that second of her summer visits , Priscilla had chanced to arrive in time for the Fourth of July celebration . The old town had its own way of celebrating the Fourth . As long as daylight lasted , it seemed like any American town on Independence Day . The children went about firing off crackers and flinging torpedoes down on the flagstones . Each child for himself , they created noise as copiously as each father and mother allowed . But from time immemorial the fireworks in the evening had been a communal affair . No true Rustdorfian ever bought any fireworks of his own . The money that he would have spent on them he gave to a common fund , administered ( origin of this tradition lost in the mists of time ) by the postmaster . It was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the evening of every Fourth as soon as darkness began to fall , people sauntered in pairs and groups out toward the rocks over the Hudson at the end of Barnegat Lane . The postmaster with the fireworks and a group of the more reliable adolescent boys were at the base of the rocks , on a half-circle of sandy beach in a cove , visible from above . To help with the Fourth of July fireworks was one of the Rustdorf rites of initiation into adulthood . All the little boys in town looked forward eagerly to the time when they would be down on the beach instead of leaning tamely against their mothers and fathers among the family groups scattered about in the dark on top of the cliff . The Fourth when Priscilla was there for the first time was clear and starry . She had come in from Chicago on the late afternoon train and had received but the sketchiest account of what to expectwhen they all set off along the twilight lane , Adrian walking with Aunt Tryntje and carrying his fourteen-months-old daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushions . By the time they came out on the rocks , darkness had fallen deeply . They could see nothing , but a sixth sense made them aware that all about them were groups of waiting people . Across the river shone a garden of fire-flowers , each steady blossom of flame supported by the long wavering stem of its reflection in the water . " How lovely those lights are ! " said Priscilla . " Are they part of the celebration ? " " They are kerosene lamps , " said Adrian 's father in his quiet voice , " some of them smoky , set on kitchen tables in poor men 's houses . " " Here is a rock with nobody on it , " announced Adrian from one side . They settled themselves to wait , hearing and feeling about them the rustlings and stirrings of the unseen crowd . A faint breeze came in from the river , flitted about , stepping capriciously on its light feet from one group to another , lifting locks of hair with invisible fingers . From the cove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestic rush , up soared a rocket , tracing toward the stars a curve of fiery speed . " Ah-ah-ahl " breathed the unseen , earth-bound crowd . The rocket put all its soul into that upward flight toward infinity . But it was not enough . The poor finite thing could not reach even the fringes of the stars . It hung an instant in the blackness , and then with a soft explosion that was like a longdrawnbreath , made its failure beautiful in a bouquet of manycoloredfalling sparks . " Ah-ah-ahl " breathed the invisible crowd . A child 's startled voice shouted out , " Oh , p'itty ! p'itty ! " " That 's a child seeing it for the first time , " said Mr. Fort . He added in a musing tone , " I can remember very well whensaw it for the first time , sixty years ago . Can you remember your first time , Adrian ? " " Never 'll forget it , " answered Adrian . " They 're lovely here , " came Priscilla 's voice through the darknesswith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before.  |p173You  're always too near . You hear people scolding a'bout the fuses being wet , and how somebody 's not holding the Roman candles right . " " Sh-sh-sh-sh ! " Up sped another rocket , its tense flight cleanly drawn , up and up  --  all those human faces lifted toward the stars to follow its aspiration . The bright curve halted in mid-air , recognized its defeat , bent its head in resignation , and sighed out its life in a golden rain . " The baby 's watching it , " announced Aunt Tryntje , who had claimed the privilege of holding little Priscilla . " She really does take it in , I 'm sure . She lifted her face to follow it and put out her little arms . " " I wonder , " thought Matey to herself with a start , a pang , at the idea that her baby might be beginning a life of her own , " I wonder if perhaps this will be one of the really ' remembered things for her . " And with the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depth . She saw it as it might look to little Priscilla years from now , she saw the golden curve of beauty which had just died before her eyes , shedding an immortal brightness along the unknown future toward which the baby 's feet were tending . Tears came to Matey 's eyes . She felt herself humbled and exalted . It was the first step she had taken forward from physical maternity . A flare of red flame blazed up luridly around the edge of the beach , showing the rocky walls of the cove and a line of black figures , arms melodramatically upraised toward the sky . " Roman candles now , " explained Adrian 's father to Priscilla . To Adrian he called , " Adrian , when was the first time you began to feel grown up ? " Adrian laughed . " Sure thing ! " he said . " Same time you did , I bet  --  first time I was allowed to hold one of the Roman candles . " From each arm sprang up a ball of colored fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness free for those that followed . They rose in flocks like little sprightly birds , they died down , they rose again . " The allegretto after the largo , " murmured Adrian 's father in the ear of his son 's wife . The red fire faded down to darkness , the Roman candles were still . People stirred and rustled as though for a moment they had forgotten to breathe . A child began to cry . It was quite near the rock where the Forts sat , but they could not see it . There was no quick maternalp174murmur of reassurance . No other sound at all but the low wordlesscomplaint . They looked into the darkness , on this side and that , saying , " Why does n't somebody quiet the little thing ? " Adrian said , " Perhaps it 's lost . I 'll see if I ca n't find it . " He left the rock and moved off , saying , " Somebody strike a match so we can see . " " It is here , " said Priscilla , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now . " Adrian 's father struck a match . In its yellow light they saw , painted on the darkness , a tiny flaxen-haired child , her face glistening with tears , her thin small hands groping out toward Priscilla . They saw Priscilla quickly lean and draw the little thing into her lap . The match went out . " Yes , she must be lost , " said Priscilla through the darkness . " I 'll just hold her till the fireworks are over and we can find her mother . " " It 's Peter Russell 's youngest , " Aunt Tryntje told her ; " she has n't any mother . " She went on , in a lower tone , " The idea of Peter bringing that great brood of young ones here , with only himself to look out for them ! He might have known he 'd lose some of them . " " I suppose he wanted them not to miss what other children have , " said Adrian 's father . " Sh-sh-sh-shl " Another rocket burst from its pasteboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint light cast by its soaring Matey could see that the little girl had settled down into Priscilla 's lap , one arm around her neck , her flaxen head laid on Priscilla 's bosom . " Right then and there , " cried Matey to Adrian at the end of the summer , in one of her most Francis-like moods , " anybody with a grain of sense would have risen up and taken that child away from her . One look at her there ought to have been enough . But I never dreamed . . . how could I have dreamed ! " If she had not had sense enough to think of it then , the next day ought to have put her on her guard , she told Adrian in one of those later fits of remorse . But on that second occasion too she was absorbed with her own life . The fifth of July fell on a Sunday that year ; Adrian 's father and Aunt Tryntje had comep175to dinner , and after the meal was over the family divided into two parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile he gave to no one but Matey , having said , " How about a little music ? " The others had gone out to the porch chairs and hammocks , to collapse into after-dinner coma and to watch little Priscilla staggeringly practice what Adrian called her " walking steps . " A strange voice sounded from the porch . Glancing out of the window Matey saw mild Cousin Peter Russell , stooped and gray , his rather unattractive , unkempt , sober-faced children clustered about his thin legs . But she did not leave the piano to greet him . Adrian and Aunt Tryntje and Priscilla were surely enough of the family to do the honors , especially for a neighbor whom one saw every day . He had probably stopped in to thank them ceremoniouslyall over again for taking care of little Mary Ellen last night . The Russells were not Friends , any of them , and Matey had so far acquired Quaker tastes that she was sometimes impatientof Cousin Peter 's wearyingly polite insistence on treating each small event decently and in order with conventional for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the thread of the music . Debussy was hard enough to follow without interruption . She was playing the notes now as though they were words in a language she could pronounce but did n't understand . And Adrian 's father hated that . She started over again , forgetting the existence of so negligible a person as Cousin Peter . Later , delightfully worn out by her struggle with a new musical personality , she joined the outdoor group , rejoicing that she had before her so restful a job as putting the baby to sleep . Looking around she asked , " Where 's Priscilla ? Writing letters again ? " " No , " said Adrian , from where he lay on the grass beside his small daughter , both of them absorbed in watching . the maneuvers of a beetle . " No , she went along with the Russells . Little Mary Ellen seems to have taken a shine to her and teased her to go to see  --  something or other her father has made  --  a doll-house , was n't it , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attention to their buttons and to see that their faces were washed more often and spend less time on doll-houses , " said Aunt Tryntje over her knitting . " Those children look like I do n't know what . Rebecca says that old colored woman Peter has to take care of them is no better than a dirty slut , but Peter will keep her because she 's good-natured . " Matey had been a little surprised that Priscilla did not come back that afternoon till suppertime , and a little more surprised to see her after this so often strolling over to the Russell house or appearing with one of the children beside her . But little Priscilla'sreactions were so much more important to her mother than anything else that she paid small attention to the older Priscilla 's interest in the Russell children . Up to this time little Priscilla had lived , like all first babies , hermit-like , marooned on the desert island of babyhood in the ocean of grown-up life . Little Mary Ellen Russell , only two years older than she , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matey was so touched by her baby 's excited interest in a near contemporary that she welcomed in the three-year-old neighbor without wondering how she happened to be there so often . In her mind , as in that of any woman just emerging from the physical excitement of bearing and nursing a child , there was a deep-rooted conviction that her baby was absolutely different from any other . Mary Ellen was all right , a nice little thing , though her eyes were too close together , and she was sometimes rather noisy and spoiled . But it was obvious that she was made of wholly other stuff than Matey 's own child , whose life Matey shared with a literal nearness not unlike that before her birth . When little Priscilla cried  --  or laughed  --  or ate  --  or slept , her mother felt a mystical reflection in the cells of her own body . When Mary Ellen Russell cried , Matey suggested to Priscilla that perhaps it was time for her nap and had n't she better be taken home ? That Priscilla might not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister . What did occur to her , with a naive shock of newness , was the thought that since the baby was so delighted with a playmate , she ought to have a little brother or sister . " Well , Adrian , " she said to him one night , when their murmured before-going-to-sleep talk had been of this , " it 's simply laughable how different I am from what I thought I was ! I 'm not only simply crazy about you and the baby , but the minute I think of our having another one , I just love him to death , already ! " Before she dropped asleep she said with a drowsy laugh , " Dop177you remember my saying I thought I could n't love anything but Sumner ? " " Yes , I remember very well , " said Adrian , more distinctly ; more awake than she had expected to hear him . " Does n't that seem a million years ago  --  somebody else ! " she murmured . Adrian made no answer . She supposed he had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matey could see how it had been nothing but her absorption in her own affairs that had blinded her to what had been openly going on . " But you did n't see it , either , did you , Adrian ? " she challengedhim . " I ca n't see it now , " said Adrian . " Talk about going through the woods to pick up a crooked stick ! Not that there 's anything crooked about Peter . He 's straight , all right , what there is of him . But what on earth does Priscilla want of a gentlemanly old nonentity after the chances she 's had ! " Such phrases had been all that came into Matey 's mind after Priscilla had exploded her small bombshell . She had been on the point of bursting out , " Oh , Priscilla ! After all the chances you 've had ! " But as the words shaped themselves in her mind she saw that they had fallen into a Francis pattern , and was silent . When she was able to speak , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words not to say what she meant , " Well , Priscilla clear , of course I 'm surprised . You must have known I would be . I 'll have to wait a while before I can really take it in . " Priscilla did not seem to notice her sister 's guardedness . She said in a low trembling voice , unlike her own , " I had thought 1 would never have any children  --  " Matey restrained herself with an effort from shouting , " But these are n't your children ! " As she heard these unspoken words Matey did not like the sound of them . And yet how perfectly jus-t ified they were ! For the first time since they had begun to talk , Priscilla looked up . With a startled shock Matey thought , " Why , Priscilla never before let me look into her eyes . " " Four little daughters  --  " murmured Priscilla . Her face , which Matey had thought set forever in its mechan. ical brightness , softened into the wavering misty look of young helplessness before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too much . Matey had been as helpless as her sister before the gust of emotion which flung her into Priscilla 's arms , crying out , " Oh , darling , darling sister ! " her cheeks wet with tears half of sympathy , half of pity , wholly of love . All through the interval between the announcement of Priscilla'sengagement and her marriage , the absent Francis kept Matey from speaking out . But he did far more than that for his younger sister . Her repeated wordless struggles with his standards forced her over and over to take accurate stock of what was in her own mind . Even in thought she could scarcely finish wholeheartedlysome of the outcries that came naturally to her lips . " Think of Priscilla , with her professional ability to make good money , drudging her life away taking care of another woman 's children . " Or " How crazy for anybody who 's learned to dress so beautifully as Priscilla to bury herself in a place where nobody 'll care how she looks . " By the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on the railroad platform hearing Francis ' unanswerably prudent objections to her own marriage . Time and time again Francis made her draw back , thinking , " No , this can not be the real reason for my heavy-heartedness over Priscilla 's marriage . " But although Francis forced Matey to drop one after another of the conventional objections to that marriage , she did not grieve the less over it . Her heart , freed from its meaner cares , ached with all the purer sorrow to see Priscilla , so brilliant , so blonde , so accomplished , beside the listless life-weary man with whom she was to share the rest of her years . Nor was she the more reconciled when she learned that Priscilla and Cousin Peter were to share life only as house-mates , not as man and wife . When Priscilla managed to tell her sister in a shy reticent word or two that her distrust of life had abated only half , that there was to be no question of love or real marriage for her , but only the sharing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pang that was half passionate relief and half passionate unresignation . " I do n't know whether that 's better or worse , " she told herself wildly . Nor did the sight of Priscilla 's fondness for her foster-children to be ( touching as Matey found it ) soften in the least her fury of compassion . " She thinks that 's all , poor Priscilla ! " Matey often thought , watching with a lump in her throat Priscilla 's beginnings of motherly ways . She felt for her older sister during thosep179days an almost maternal yearning , as if she were an adult watching a child make an ignorant wrong choice among life 's values . Why this heat about Priscilla 's marriage ? Whence came the shadow which Matey saw Priscilla unsuspectingly entering ? From a light , of course , as every shadow must . And the light streamed , Matey saw it now , from the center of her life with Adrian , from their love , from their union , from their marriage . That was what gave the meaning to every breath she drew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it herself . She had been living in marriage as inattentively as she sometimes played music , striking the mere notes with correctness but making no sense of them . She had been loving Adrian without knowing what she was doing . Somewhere , back of her , lost in the million other insignificant moments of the two years of her marriage , had been the moment when she stopped being a cool shallow child yielding passively to caresses , and had begun to be a woman who loved . This was the moment Priscilla would never pass . One morning as she made their bed a memory came to her of some of the books she had read in college , some of the lectures to which she had listened . Those childish notebooks of hers , filled with docile notes ! Well , thought Matey , beating a pillow to lightness and setting it back , nothing , nothing at all of what she had been told to expect by all those life-experienced elders had turned out true . . . for her . Money had been neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , sex had not been the ignoble concession to animality that the older generation by word and gesture and ugly grimace had led her to expect . It had been the foundations of the bridge over which she and Adrian had crossed the unplumbed salt estranging sea of human isolation . Like the refrain to a litany came her new heartache  --  Priscilla would live her life out on her island prison , alone . How strange that it had been her selfless , concern for Priscilla which had made her look up from her small busy thoughts and perceive the greatness into which life had led her . Was advance ulna ays haphazard , oblique like this ? Suppose Priscilla had never made her anxious ? Would she have gone on being childish and flat , missing love because she took it for granted ? One Sunday in Meeting , Rebecca was moved to speak . Matey card nothing but the quotation with which she began . She heard at as if for the first time and always after heard it clad in thatp180velvet Negro voice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should sleep and rise , night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he knoweth not how ; first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the . . . " Around the words , quiet circles began to widen in Matey 's mind . All those older people , set there in her youth to point her to the way ahead , why had they never told her that love could come in any other way than as a flash of lightning comes  --  comes and blazes and burns and goes ? Nothing could possibly be more unlike a stroke of lightning than love as it had come to her . . . like a field of wheat rather , first the blade , then the ear , then the full . . . " Alas ! my dear Priscilla will never feed on that harvest . " Late on the afternoon of the next day she sat sewing on buttons and waiting for the baby to wake up . Rebecca 's quotation echoed in the small sewing-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , and it grows , he knoweth not how . " How was it possible the harvest could come to one who so little deserved it ? She had but slept and risen , night and day , giving no thought to the seed . The door opened and Adrian , back from work , stepped in . He looked as for the first time that summer he often looked , rather tired , not very fresh , no longer in his first youth . " Hello , Matey , what makes you look so solemn ? " he said , dropping his hat on a chair with a gesture expressing weariness . ( " Yes , yes , Ziza ! " cried Matey silently across the ocean . " I am crazy , crazy , crazy about my husband ! " ) " Did I look solemn ? " she said , laying her work aside . " Well , I was feeling so . I had been thinking what Priscilla is going to miss . . . . " Adrian 's face darkened . He said literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Look here , Matey , I 'm tired of hearing you go on about that . What do you think she 's missing ? You 're hardly in a position to think it 's tragic that she wo n't have much money . Peter Russell 's income is about as much as we 're likely to have . He lives in as good a house , on the same street . Why is n't hers as good a marriage as yours ? " Matey searched her husband 's hard unsmiling face . She was thankful that there was in it no trace of the indulgent patient gentleness which she had seen there in the first days of their marriage . She was past needing indulgence from him now . He would never need to be patient with her any more.  | " How can you ask me such a question , Adrian ? " she said in a rough low tone . Her husband paled . " She will have plenty of children to mother , " he said . " Is n't that enough ? " With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , taking his arm in her two hands . She said violently , " No , it 's not enough ! It 's not enough ! And you know it ! And you need n't pretend I do n't know it , either ! Do n't you over dare , Adrian Fort , to say such a thing to me again ! " They were foolish childish words . No matter ! If they did not say what she meant , she would find others that would . She needed but one other . Adrian shook off her hands with a rough gesture . He held her at arm 's length and looked at her . She said his name , " Adrian ! " There was no word at all in his answer . He caught her violently to him , no gentleness in his touch . Did they get everything wrong , those cocksure mentors ofher youth ? Matey often asked herself during the next yearsof her life . Were all their wise sayings mere traditional rules of thumb ? That axiom of theirs that the emergence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely  --  ! Why had they not once given her a hint that people might vary in this as in all other matters ? Why did they not tell the young people under their charge , so touchingly , helplessly ignorant of what might be before them , something of the infinite diverseness of the paths which lead human beings toward the great moment of conversian to life and faith in it ? Matey in college had " taken " many courses in English literature and " passed " them all . Yet now poetry came to her like a revelation . Why , now she knew what people were talking about when they said those excited exaggerated things about poetry . One Saturday afternoon she took advantage of Adrian 's being at home to play with the baby , and with broom and duster attackeda neglected corner of the attic . On the dusty shelves , among other books from Adrian 's college days , was an old volume of Whitman . It fell open in her hand . The bold words on the182 THE DEEPENING STREAMp182page leaped up . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever read . " Oh despairer , here is my neck , By God ! you shall not go down ! Hang your whole weight upon me . " She gave a shudder of pleasure . She turned the pages over and came to " Poem of Wonder at the Resurrection of the Wheat . " After a few lines , " Adrian , oh , Adrian , do come up here a minute , " she called from the top of the attic stairs . With his solid little girl on his shoulder he came running up to where his wife stood , turbaned by a dusting-cloth , leaning against her broom , the book in her hand . " It 's about the earth , the earth we live on , " she told him and went on : " Behold this compost , behold it well ! Perhaps every mite has once formed part of a sick person . Yet behold ; The grass covers the prairies , The bean bursts noiseless through the mold in the garden , The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its graves . " She looked up at him , chanting : " The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead . " " Grand ! " said Adrian , and " Gosh ! Matey , I never knew you could read aloud like that . You make the cold chills go up my back . " " I could n't for anybody but you , " said Matey . It was not only poetry which thus sprang into life . It was all the visible world with its drama . The sun , moon , and stars , darknessand light , dawn and noonday , came into sight . There had been skies , too , had there not , wherever she had lived before ? But with the slowing down of her young pulses her eyes had forgotten that it was not a wood-and-plaster ceiling over her head . No , not wholly forgotten . There had been the night skies to which she hadp183been led by Sumner ! The Matey , mother of one child and hoping for another , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last look at the stars , held out a hand to the wistful little Matey 8 with her dog . It was not only beauty which fed Matey 's new hungriness for life . Roughness and hardship  --  yes , even suffering -- were part of the banquet spread before her . One bitter winter night as she and Adrian stepped off the late train from New York ( they had been down to hear The Valkyrie ) they found themselves facing a sudden wild snowstorm . There was nothing to do but to fight their way home on foot from the deserted station through the empty streets . Afterward Matey could not separate the music from that boisterousbattle with night and cold and the screaming wind . She leaned forward against the force of the wind ; she clung to Adrian , her head bent to shield her face from the slash of the hard-driven snow ; the grinding roar of the storm-tossed ice in the Hudson back of her sounded like the tumult of the orchestra . She could scarely draw breath into her lungs , so smothering was the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Adrian 's ear , " Is n't this great ! " as , on turning the corner of the Square , they were set upon by the full sweep of the storm . They buffeted their way forward , stumbling in drifts , wrestling with the storm like Jacob at the ford . Under the piercing cold Matey felt the flame of life in her burn up strong like a blastfurnaceunder forced draught . Was she the one who was shrieking out the Valkyr " Ho-yo-to-ho ! " or was it the yell of the tempest ? And when half-frozen they staggered up to their door , unlocked it , and found themselves inside , in the incredible quiet of their living-room , warmed and rosy-lighted by the coal fire in the grate , Matey flung her hat in one direction , her coat in the other , and cast herself violently into her husband 's arms , crying out , " Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " Adrian kindled at her eyes . " Great Scott , Matey , I 'm sorry for the folks who are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing his teeth , he remembered that his father had thought her " dry . " " What 's the joke ? " she called from the next room , and then looking in , " Oh , it 's brushing your teeth . It sounded as though you were laughing . "  | Spring came and went , and drooping under the summer heat , Matey needed all her new-found strength and serenity . Long hours of every day were spent in resisting and succumbing to the physical wretchedness of pregnancy , and then afterward doing hurriedly and with exasperation what she could easily have accomplished in those lost hours . But this vexation , real as it was , blew over the surface lightly . It did not reach the steady warmth within . Even boredom , perhaps the most difficult of human ills to resist , occupied now but a corner of the spaciousness into which she had stepped out . A new careless fortitude , like a grown-up 's attitude toward a child 's troubles , sustained her when she went with Aunt Tryntje to the meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose dragging , lagging existence seemed to be a necessary part of running Rustdorf , from the Tennis Club to the District Nursing Association . " They 're simply terrible , " she reported to Adrian , just as she always had . But she really minded them no more than the slight bother of brushing her hair or lacing up her shoes . With Adrian she seemed now to be reading out of life a times more of its meaning than she had dreamed could lie on its familiar pages . It was exactly like the change in her reading of music . One sunny morning , late in November , on the day after the first snow-fall of the year , she went out into the back yard to burn some waste-papers . The three-year-old Petella ( this was the versionof her name which the little Priscilla had made as soon as she began to talk ) was always tagging at her mother 's heels like a little dog , and helped carry out the bushel-basket from the woodshed . Together they emptied the crumpled papers upon the cinder-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiteness by the new-fallen snow . As a treat , Petella was allowed to touch the match to the pile of papers . They took fire with a flash . The child drew back quickly to the shelter of her mother 's skirts . The two stood for a moment to watch . The tongues of flame flared up , their fiery red and orange chastened to transparency by the sunlight . Petella and her mother could see through their shimmering clarity the featherlightcold crystals of the new snow . The soul of heat . . . the soul of cold . .  |p185The  woman watching them , woven firmly into human life by a thousand blood-ties , felt her imagination soar up on a new wing . Even as she stood there in the body heavy with its double humanity , she caught through those disembodied flames a glimpse of the beautiful , fierce , unhuman life of the elements . " I visited Saturn and Jupiter and the moon for a moment today , " she told Adrian that night at the supper-table , " when Petella and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spoke the vision cast a reflection of its brightness up into her rather weary face , shadowed by physical weakness . She too was beginning to show that she was no longer in her first youth . " Do n't get so far away you ca n't come back to us , dear , " said Adrian , his eyes deeply on hers . She thought , " I have seen the soul of heat , and of cold  --  and now the soul of tenderness . " Petella glanced up from her milk toast in time to catch the interchangeof this look . She pushed her plate forward for another helping . " Petella empty like hired man , " she said heartily , in an old-time phrase of Aunt Tryntje 's . One of the many changes which these years brought to Matey was an astonishing difference in her feeling about her home . When Adrian 's father had first shown them the old house Matey had seen it flatly , literally , as she saw other things , a story-and-ahalfstone building with a white-painted clapboarded wing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be anything more than a house . The course of her life had moved her in and out of so many houses that she thought she knew how to see one . It had amused her a little to feel so like her mother as she competently examined kitchen , pantry , and plumbing . After that first inspection of the house the family party of four had strolled about the yards , front and back , Matey , in the haze of golden unreality in which she had wandered through the period of her engagement , listening dreamily to Aunt Tryntje 's talk , and dreamily wondering if she were really to be married and live there. . the locusts around the house came from Long Island . All the English families planted locusts as house trees . They were thought more elegant than forest trees . The elms in front are of course part of the regular street planting that New Englanders did wherever they settled . The big beech here was planted right after the Revolution by one of the LeRoy cousins back from the186 THE DEEPENING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went away a private and came back a colonel , and that 's more than any LeRoy of that branch has done since . The story was that when he came home from the war his uniform was so full of vermin he would n't wear it into the house . He went out into the barn . . . in those days there was a barn standing where the weeping willow in the back yard is now . No , that was the smoke-house stood there . Where did the barn stand ? Oh , I know , farther back where the stone wall is now . Some of those stones are ... " How absurd , how amusing , how quaint Aunt Tryntje was , thought the young Matey  --  but very dimly , because she was tingling to the touch of Adrian 's hand as it brushed hers. " and so they baked his uniform in the oven next to the fireplace  --  it was the kitchen-dining-room then , what thee 's going to use as a living-room  --  and his wife , Henrietta Richmond , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never could bear to eat anything in the oven after that , and that was how it came to be bricked up . It 's still there , thee knows , under the wall-paper . . . . " Adrian 's eyes were the color of sherry wine when the light shone through them from the side . " The willow was planted in 1835 by Madeleine Ter Bosch  --  she was thy great-grandmother 's cousin , Matey  --  because weepingwillowswere in fashion then . She 'd been down to visit relatives in New York and they were all working weeping-willows in crewel . She brought back the slip from there . But she died before it eve amounted to anything . " At that time all this had been for Matey but a part of Aun Tryntje 's quaintness . To be polite to an old lady she had looke. at the trees , but she had certainly not seen them . Why were the now , like the house , like the sky above it , become living per sonalities ? There had always been trees  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never any more to her than th people who get into the train at one station and get off at th next . By the time she was expecting her second child , she had taken root beside these trees . The certainty that she would be looking ; out on this very sky and these very trees to the end of her days deepened her present with overtones of her past and future , mak.  |p187ing  her peaceably one with the old woman she would grow to be , as she was with the adolescent she had outgrown . She felt herselfnot only a part of Adrian , of the child she had , of the child who was coming , but a part of the piled-up old stones that had sheltered so many other families like hers , part of that old humanizedpiece of earth , full of root treasures , left there like the traits in her own personality by her predecessors in life . Like her strength , her weaknesses , they had been there before her time and would go on opening out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , the things that grew around the house , from the lilies-of-the-valley to the rhubarb , down to the very blades of vigorous grass , but she came to have a particularaffection , a particular intimacy , with the trees . ' Whenever she turned into her own yard after being away from home they looked themselves to her , unlike other trees as much as she and Adrian were unlike other people . How differently they took life ! The willow was almost a hundredyears old , but it had never grown indifferent to the miracle of spring , rushed out to greet it with the same eager , pale-green young welcome , long before its more prudent comrades had stirred from their winter torpor . It was under the willow that Matey had chosen to make Sumner 's tiny grave when , a little while before Petella 's birth , he had faded out of life . How differently they acted in thunderstorms ! The line of Levantine elms with their dramatic , excited gesturings in the wind , the Nordic oak surly and stiff and insensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from self-expression by their height like gentlefolk by their breeding , so that all that could be seen of their emotion in the most violent storm was the slight swaying motion of their long brown trunks . How differently they stood up under the recurring adversity of winter ! On the stormy day in December when Matey lay down on her bed , shuddering in the onset of labor-pains before the birth of her second child , she saw out of the window the old beech , stripped to the poles , magnificently glorying in the battle with wind and snow . She faced her own battle with a new heart . Thepresent , anguish that it was , dwindled to its proper place in the great perspective . She remembered with pity the faltering panic of her first confinement . The pains were as great now . But she was so much greater. .88 THE DEEPENING STREAM " No , no ! Adrian ! " she cried to him , seeing him turn very white at an outcry of hers , his teeth set in his underlip . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . When she could get her breath to speak , " It 's worth it ! " she told him , with all her heart . He turned paler than ever , his face transfigured by love and by shared suffering . Oh , wonder and glory of life that could bring such moments , thought Matey , bracing her soul against the old beech as a new rage of pain swept over her . This too was part of the banquet spread before the living . When she was up again , later in the month , her new son in her arms , she sometimes held him up at the window through which the beech was to be seen . And on her first outing with her two children , the baby in the baby-carriage , the little sister trudging through the snow beside it , she stopped under the tree and said fancifully , " That 's your tree , Adrian the fourth . " It stood quiet enough , that sunny day , holding up its branches to the winter sun , casting a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its strength . Petella gazed up at the tree seriously . The resemblance to her Uncle Francis was particularly marked when she lifted her little fair face . " Oh , dear ! " thought Matey with a qualm . " I 've made a mistake in saying that . She will not want the baby to have more than she . I must remember , now there are two , not to . . . " The child trotted through the light snow to the tree . She laid a mittened hand on the great mottled gray bole . " Brother 's tree , " she said , smiling back at her mother . " Darling ! " cried Matey , falling on her knees in the snow to catch her little daughter to her . She longed to have had Aunt Priscilla there , to see that smile rn that Francis face . She did share another such moment with Priscilla , later that winter , one day when Aunt Tryntje was telling the children stories . Priscilla had brought her brood to spend a snowy afternoonat Matey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that these were the same children , these rosy , noisy , vital little girls ? Could these be the children who , conscious of ugly clothes and ill-cut unkempt hair , had drooped shyly in corners , trying to escape disapproving looks by being invisible ?  | " Those young ones just wear thee out , Priscilla , " said Aunt . Tryntje that afternoon , looking at Priscilla 's faded radiant face " It 's enough to make a hired man take to his bed to have them always on top of thee like that . Now , children , let your mother alone for a while and I 'll tell you a story . " Matey , her baby in her arms , and Priscilla leaning back in peaceful weariness , listened too , although they now knew all of Aunt Tryntje 's stories . " It 's about the Colonel LeRoy who was born and brought up in this house , the one whose uniform was baked in the oven downstairs , you know . But this was long before he went to the wars with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was sent to take home across the river an old-maid seamstress who had been working here . Indians never did any harm around here , but across the river things were n't any too settled in those days . Bartholomew was a big fellow then , and rowed the boat across the river all right in good time . They were halfway up the path toward the settlement where the seamstress lived when she remembered she 'd left her work-bag in the boat . So Bartholomew LeRoy told her to wait while he ran back for it . He had n't even got as far as where he 'd tied the boat when he heard her scream . . . a scream that fairly shook the leaves on the trees , he always said .... " The little girls at Aunt Tryntje 's feet huddled together like startled chicks . Matey asked herself impatiently , " What was I thinking about , to let Petella hear such a story ? " Aunt Tryntje went on , " Bartholomew felt for his knife and , started back up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the corner of the path , men 's voices talking Indian talk . IIe had just time to jump into the bushes and hide when they came along , four Indians and two renegade white n-'en dressed like Indians . They had the seamstress gagged now so she could n't scream , and they were hurrying her along as fast as she could go , stumbling and tripping on her long skirts . Well , what should the boy do ? He could n't fight six men . What good would it do anybodyfor him just to go and get captured himself ? So he decided to stay safe in the bushes and ... " " No , no , no ' " came shrilly from little Petella . " No , he did n't stay safe ! No , he did n't ! " She glared at the narrator . " Why , what does thee mean , Petella ? " asked Aunt Tryntje in astounded rebuke . " Yes , he did , too . "  | " No ! " cried Petella passionately . " He ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat lady ! " She began to cry furiously now and rushed to her mother 's knee , looking up at her with Francis ' face , filled with outraged generous pain . " Oh , Matey ! " said Priscilla on a deep note . " Listen , darling little daughter , " murmured Matey in Petella 's ear , " it all comes out quite nicely in Aunt Tryntje 's story . Just let her go on and you 'll see . " She made room for her beside little Adrian on her lap , while Aunt Tryntje , somewhat ruffled , went on , " Well , of course he was n't to blame " ( this with a glance at the still defiant Petella )  --  " not a bit ! And everybody told him sc . But he could n't seem to get over it . I 've heard the old people tell how he used to sit right in this room by this window -- just sit and sit , his face hidden in his hands . In the spring of that year he disappeared . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old by that time . They did n't have any news of him for about a year . Everybody thought he was dead . And then one day the next April his mother sat on the front stoop out there , churning , and looked up , and there down the road he came , all in ragged old buckskins , thin as the last run of shad , a great scar across his face , but the seamstress was with him . . . all right , though she was looking like a regular squaw with an old ... " Priscilla 's noisy little girls had been quiet as long as they could , and now began to shout and laugh and clap their hands and turn somersaults on the rug . " Thee sees , Petella , " said the old lady triumphantly . But Petella had quite forgotten the story and her remote kinsman . These were the first somersaults she had ever seen . She gazed at them fascinated , and scrambling down from her mother 's lap , began clumsily to try to imitate her foster-cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow from his feet , and calling out to the children that he 'd got the biggest sled and was going to pull them all home on it . Cousin Peter was almost as much changed as his little girls , thought Matey , noting his sleek look and the animated expression on his mild face . " If you 'll let me have that pattern for the baby 's cloak , " said Priscilla , rising to go , " I can get it cut out and basted by tomorrow . Peter is going to be at lodge meeting this evening . " But it no longer made any difference what Priscilla said . THE DEEPENING STREAM 191p191x THOSE very first lean years , when Adrian 's salary as bookkeeperwas too small to mention and the house needed everything , the interest on Aunt Connie 's money had melted uninterestingly , each half year , into mattresses and chairs and a new furnace and tiny expensive woolen baby shirts , and taxes and doctor 's bills . But by 1913 , the fifth year of their marriage , Adrian had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was moderately well furnished . " Let 's save it all up this year and buy a Ford ! " said Matey daringly . There were but few automobiles owned in Rustdorf as yet , and mostly by people who had much more money than the Forts . " Everybody 'll think we 're crazy , " said Adrian , " buying a car before we either of us own a fur coat . Let 's . " So they did . And with its purchase in the spring of 1914 they went for a time ridiculously back to the joys of childhood and venturesomely forward into unexplored emotions of the future , as no generation before them did , nor after them can ever do . To be transported through the air at the speed of light by merely wishing it will not so astonish and ravish the blase generations of the future as to be whirled along familiar roads at four times the speed of a trotting horse astonished and ravished the generation to which , in maturity , the automobile was new . The very process of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no driving instructors in those days . The Ford agent from whom Adrian bought the car took him out on the road once , gave him a lesson in the use of the pedals , exhorted him above all to remember where his emergency brake was , and told him to go to it . On a back road , Matey perched on the bank , Adrian went to it , perspiring from every pore . " I have n't felt the pit of my stomach come up so , not since I was three years old and starting to slide down the banisters the first time , " he told his wife , halting the infernal machine with difficulty and wiping streams of sweat from his scarlet face . As a rule now Matey took Adrian for granted , but the idea did come into her head that it was not Francis who would have allowed a witness to watch his fumbling unheroic struggles with a new power . " It 's awfully nice of you , Adrian , " she told him ;  | leaning down from her refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Adrian , naturally , did not know what she was talking about . " I need you to pick up the membra dis jecta , " he told her , bringing himself with a visible effort to let the clutch in again and start off . " Let me see , turn on a little more gas , press on the left pedal , take your foot off the . . . " When , a , week or so later , Adrian first drove out his wife and children , their excitement was almost as great as his . Petella , at five , was considered old enough to sit on the front seat beside her father . Matey sat in the back , clasping the small Adrian tightly to her . " Are you planning to use him as a cushion to fall on ? " asked Adrian as he climbed over the side into the driver 's seat . " Looks like it . Petella , how 'll thee and I do that ? Will thee fall on me , or I on thee ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seat which had been in imitation of her mother 's tensity . Matey laughed too and set the fat two-and-a-half-year-old boy down on the seat beside her , one arm around him . " Release the emergency , press on the left pedal , raise the foot from the . . . " murmured Adrian prayerfully . And they were off . In the first months of their car-ownership , Matey and Adrian , along with other responsible family people of their generation , were carried away by an exquisitely childlike delight in a brandnewkind of fun . They swept Priscilla along with them . Seeing Petella and little Adrian as rapt over the Ford as their parents , she coveted it for her own little girls . Adrian told Matey , " She 'll never get Peter Russell to take money out of the savings-bank to buy a car . He 's as Hudson valley Dutch as if his name were Van der Poel . " But all Priscilla 's dammed-up life-forces were now pouring along the channel they had found . Nothing , not even Dutch blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have whatever other children enjoyed for their own good . The Forts bought their Ford in April of 1914 . In May Peter Russell came to the savings-bank to draw out the sum of $795 , a sum as closely associated in that year with the idea of a Ford as two cents is associated with the idea of a postage stamp . " Goody ! Goody ! " said Matey , when Adrian came home from the bank with this piece of news . " Good for Priscilla ! " She never did , as matter of fact , overcome the physical terrorp193which her timid elderly husband felt ( along with the majority of his generation ) for the unholy speed of automobiles . She never succeeded in persuading him to learn to drive . So she herself learned to drive long before Matey did , one of the first women in Rustdorf to sit behind a steering-wheel . Adrian said it must he the sporting blood that used to show in her tennis ( which she had now entirely given up ) , coming out in a new form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priscilla had never had a drop of sporting blood . " Both you girls are perfectly crazy with the heat , " Francis told them jovially when , on one of his infrequent visits , he learned about their Fords . " I ca n't afford a car ! " " You could afford a Ford ! " said Matey , using a pleasantry which was still young and unwrinkled in those days . " Oh , I 'd just as soon ride in a Ford as not , " he told them generously , " but Emily has one of these fool prejudices against them . She says she would n't be caught dead in one . " This energetic statement did not sound at all to Priscilla and Matey like their effaced young sister-in-law whom they had seen only twice in Francis ' between-train visits in Rustdorf . They did not even need , now , to look at each other to know that this impression was common to them both . It was extraordinary , thought Matey , how her Gilbert blood pursued her . From that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprecatory about their having a Ford and not a more expensivecar . She joined with cowardly haste in the jokes made about its cheapness and was not too glad to be seen in it by the t ealthy people on the estates round about , with most of whom she had now a nodding acquaintance . Nothing , however , could mar her enjoyment of it when the wheels were really going around on one of their drives , long , tong drives of forty or forty-five miles . Like every one else who owned a car for the first time , it became their occupation . They drove and drove and drove . Up the river to Poughkeepsie and beyond to Rhinebeck , where none of them had ever been , though they had passed through it a thousand times on the train . South nearly to within sight of New York . Inland toward Pawling and Amenia , along the boundaries of what Aunt Tryntje still called the Great Nine Partners and The Little Nine Partners and the Rombout Patent , exploring roads known till then only by farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a late drive they drew up in front of their house and happened to find Adrian 's father there on the sidewalk , Matey knew from the amused expression on his face that they were all four wearing naively happy smiles . " Yes , we 've gone back to our infancy , " she called to him . " It never did take much of a straw to tickle me , you know , " admitted Adrian . It was the twenty-ninth of July , and too hot for anything in the late afternoon . Too hot even for the Ford . " She 'd boil her old head off , " said Adrian . " Mercy , yes , and we 'd have to wear stockings if we went out , " murmured Matey . They sat on the porch , which Aunt Tryntje faithfully called the stoep . It faced east , so that the scorching splendor of the sun setting over the Hudson behind them wreaked its fury on the back windows of the house . But it was quite hot enough in front . Matey wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could have the energy to pretend to be interested in Petella 's struggle with her reader . It was at least her five hundredth try at the everlasting story of the Little Red Hen . Matey reached up idly to pick off a dead leaf from the vine over her head , enjoying the elasticity of her muscles . Heavens ! how alive she was at thirtythreecompared to what she had been as a girl ! " Did I remember to tell you , Adrian , " she asked drowsily , " that Ziza has another baby ? I had a letter from Mme. Vinet yesterday . " " A girl , I should hope , this time , " said Adrian , tightening his arm around his own little daughter . " Another boy , " said Matey . " They 're going to name him Henri for Ziza 's father . " " But the hen said to the duck , No , you did not help me with the corn . Now you shall not have any of the bread , ' " read Petella with wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that part by heart , Father , that 's not really reading it . " This seemed so natural a statement to Adrian that he evidently did not notice it . But Matey gave an inaudible hail back over the years to Aunt Connie , who had watched another little girl , and blew an invisible kiss toward the top of Petella 's Francis-golden hair . " And the turkey said , " went on Petella , adventuring stumblinglyinto new worlds , " Let me have some of that nice bread ! ' But the hen said , No , you did not help me with the corn . Nowp195you shall not have any of the nice  --  ' " Was n't she the mean old thing ! " said Petella indignantly . " But she 'd done all the work , " advanced her father . " She might have let them have a taste ! " said Petella , shutting up the book . " Mme. Vinet writes that Ziza does n't seem like herself , " said Matey , although she knew that Adrian was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up as well as she ought . " " How old is her first boy ? " asked Adrian . " Oh , he 's as old as Petella almost , born in 1909 , just as she was . No , it ca n't be any effects left over from that confinement . Mme. Vinet says it seems almost like a lack of nervous energy . Ziza seems sort of discouraged , does n't want to get up . " " That does n't sound much like the live-wire Ziza you 've alwaysdescribed to me , " commented Adrian , " nor like the way she seemed that day at La Ferte . I should have said motive-power was the last thing she did n't have enough of ! " " Oh , it ca n't be anything serious , " said Matey . " Where 's Brother ? " inquired Petella , bored by her parents . " Under his tree , in the sandpile . " " May I take a piece of candy from Padre 's box ? " " Yes . " " And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matey 's answers were no more than murmurs , but she was not too drowsy to smile at the picture Petella made , hanging over the candy-box , deliberating soulfully which two pieces to take . Her golden head drooped in the pose of a pre-Raphael angel , her half-open lips took on a seraphic curve . " I believe the ones with nuts are the best , " she said thoughtfully , at last . After she had gone her mother sank dreamily down below the surface of the ocean of well-being . The late summer afternoon was compounded of all golden elements of peace . It was after working-hours , it was midsummer , it was Rustdorf , it was home . The locusts sang with all their might and the dark silent trees listened gravely . From around the corner of the house came a murmur of children 's voices . " How well they get on together , " observed Adrian , " and is n't it heaven 's own mercy there are two of them to amuse each other . " He added in an ecstasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get as far as to the hammock ? " " I 'm sure I could n't , " said Matey , closing her eyes.  | " Why move when you 're perfectly all right as you are ? " Adrian admonished himself . And to his wife , " Honest , Matey , could anybody be more perfectly all right  --  and surer of it ? There is n't anything that could happen to us  --  except one of us dying . " " Nothing , " agreed Matey . She relaxed still more , leaning with all her weight on the fabric , firm at last , of life around her , partaking effortlessly of the sun 's dynamic force , of the rooted strength of the trees , of the children 's young affection , of Adrian 's love . She had enough , Everything was all right . In her mind the two thoughts were one.  | INTO this beatitude came Adrian 's father , an open newspaper in his hand . As he walked up the path toward the house , Matey began calling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect a note of music from me this hot evening , Padre ! I 've just been telling Adrian I have n't energy e  --  " Adrian 's father had reached the porch now and at the sight of his face Matey stopped in the middle of a word . " What 's happened now , Father ? " asked Adrian sharply . His father held out the newspaper . Two headlines of equal size stood out boldly . Matey 's eye caught the wrong one first , " No Swine to be shown at County Fair , " and after a bewildered glance at her father-in-law , looked at the other . " French troops being concentrated along the frontier . " " What 's that ? " she asked , jumping up and snatching the paper from him . She stared at the words , believing her eyes as little as if she had seen the old beech walking across the lawn . " Not French troops ! " she cried . She had been very busy with raspberry jam for the last few days and had not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father replied . Over her shoulder Adrian was silently devouring the scanty telegraphic news on the front page . " But France has n't anything to do with that quarrel between Austria and Serbia , " protested Matey indignantly . " Russia 's started or getting ready to start , you see , " said Adrian 's father to his son . Something in his tone told Matey that the two men had decidedly not been missing the paper lately . Her father-in-law put his finger on a subhead , " Czar 's troops wreck bridge . "  | " My God ! " said Adrian , who seldom swore . The two men looked at each other . For the first time since her marriage , Matey felt what she had heard other wives speak of , the chill of being ignored . " Still , " said the older , " you notice this . " He pointed out a smaller head-line , " Wall Street easier . " They seemed much closer to each other than to her . " Yes , that 's a darn good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it is anything but a scare . " Matey drew a long breath of relief . " Of course it 's only a scare , " she told them impatiently . " What are you thinking about , to imagine for a minute that modern European nations are going to war ! Why , Adrian , do n't you remember , when we were in Louvain with Ziza and the Conacqs , how everybody was singing l'Internationale ' ? Ziza 's husband said it was much more like their own national anthem than the real one . " " That day of the picnic at Namur they showed us some allfiredbig frontier fortifications , " Adrian reminded her . But Matey had recovered her poise . " Oh , of course it wo n't come to anything . It ca n't , " she said . She looked at the paper again . " I suppose if the French troops really are maneuvering toward the frontier , little Paul Vinet 's with them . He 's in the last months of his military service , you know . Mme. Vinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have him back . They hover over that boy like a couple of old hens . " " The Belgians  --  Ziza 's husband may be called out , too , perhaps , " said Adrian . " Oh , that would be serious ! " admitted Matey . The next day 's paper reported , " Austrians in first battle , one thousand killed . " This was not to Matey 's purpose . She ran her eyes hastily down the column , impatient for other news . There was no mention whatever of France or Belgium . " You see ! " she told Adrian triumphantly , as if it had been a perverse idea of his that there might be war . After the children were in bed that night Adrian 's father and Aunt Tryntje came over and sat on the porch with the " young people . " They were both rather subdued . " The news in the paper brings back the War of the Rebellion , " said Aunt Tryntje . For the first time Matey heard that her father-in-law had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War.  | " Why , I thought Quakers did n't . . . " began Matey , surprised . " Not as a soldier ! " cried Aunt Tryntje and Adrian and his father , all speaking together . Aunt Tryntje added , " As a stretchercarrier . And there was talk of reading him out of Meeting for that ! " Matey measured from the sharpness of their correction the intensity of their Quaker horror of war and felt a little nettled . They need n't think that Friends were the only ones who knew that war was barbarism . All moderns did . Aunt Tryntje was launched on a reminiscence , one which Matey had not heard before . " I 'll never forget how thee looked to us , Adrian , when thee came back . The Rustdorf boys were to come , Matey , by boat , up from New York , after they were mustered out there , and were to be at the dock here at three in the afternoon . The whole town was there . Everybody . I remember we borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All sorts of preparations had been made to celebrate . Our Rustdorfboys had been in the thick of everything !  --  at the Devil 's Den at Gettysburgh and  --  " " Never mind all that , " said Adrian 's father in a muffled voice . " Well , everybody wanted to do them honor , you can imagine . Most of the band were away in the army , but some of the old fellows who 'd stopped playing long ago got out their old uniforms and tuned up . The school-children had been drilled in a patriotic song . The little girls up to the fourth grade were all in white , dressed with red-white-and-blue sashes , and every one of them had a bouquet of flowers . The Seminary boys had torches , ready for a torchlight procession as soon as it got dark . The returned soldiers were to march up the hill to the Square , hear an address of welcome , and disband . Mercy ! How excited we were . " Well , half-an-hour ahead of time we were all there on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of it . The schoolchildrenpracticed their songs . The little girls shifted their bouquletsfrom one hand to the other . Finally the word was passed around that they would not come till next day . So we all went home . " But some of the big boys sat up at the end of the pier to keep watch , and along about two in the morning did n't they see the boat all lighted up , swinging around the corner of the river , by the Danzkammer . They put out up the hill as fast as they200 THE DEEPENING STREAMp200could lay foot to the ground and roused the town . In about a minute , seems though , every house in town was blazing with lights . People scrambled out of bed and got into their clothes double quick . The Seminary boys grabbed their torches and lighted them as they ran down the hill . The little girls took their bouquets out of the water where they 'd been put to keep them fresh . And away we all went to the landing again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was the first time in all my life I 'd been outdoors after midnight . I remember how queer it seemed . " The boat was pretty close then , drifting in without any noise . We could make out people passing back and forth on the deck in front of the lighted windows . ' My ! how black and still the Hudson looked ! Our band struck up , sort of quavery . The boys with torches formed a double line and we crowded up close behind them . The boat slid up and bumped a little against the landing . A couple of deck-hands jumped off with a rope and made her fast . The gangplank went down with a bang . We heard a loud voice give a command . And two by two , shoulder to shoulder , they began to march past us  --  what was left of the men who had been boys when  --  when we  --  last  --  saw  --  " For some words Aunt Tryntje 's voice had been trembling . It now stopped altogether . She wiped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , we did n't have any more of that celebration . " She turned to Adrian 's father . " Does thee remember , Adrian , how the band stopped playing . . . first one instrument and then another . . . I can see thy face now just as I saw it then . " Her voice failed , She tried again . " I wish I could forget it ! " . . . This time she did not go on at all . After a silence , " Well , what did you do , " asked Matey , " if you did n't carry out the celebration ? " " Everybody cried , " said Aunt Tryntje , " that was all . Everybodycried . " " Why in the world did you cry , then , " asked Matey. " when you had them safe back ? " The older people did not answer her . From now on Matey did not omit to read the newspaper on account of raspberry jam . On August first the Poughkeepsie EveningEnterprise informed her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford cars was to be cut . One piece of news was about as interesting to her as the other . What didTHE DEEPENING STREAM 201p201she care about abstract ideas like Germany and Russia ? Little Paul Vinet was not in the Russian army , was he ? nor was Ziza 's passionately loved husband in the German . The Vinets were always in her thoughts . She kept trying to imagine where they all were . Was Mme. Vinet still in Louvain with Ziza ? No , by this time she must be back in Paris with Henri . The second of August was a Sunday . Newspapers were not delivered in Rustdorf on Sundays , and Matey , though the day seemed endless , would not acknowledge her anxiety enough to ask Adrian to go down to the station to buy one from a train . On Monday , August third , she read in the headlines that " Great Britain orders mobilization " and that French troops had fought with Uhlans at Petit Croix . Where was Petit Croix ? Where was Polo ? She turned the page over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare war within a few hours . " " Adrian ! Adrian ! It 's not possible ! " But Adrian was not there . He had gone to work as usual . Everything went on as usual . Most people were much more interested in the cut in the price of Fords than in anything else , except a recurrence of an old hope of paving Washington Street . Matey laid down the paper and went about her own usual work . 1t was time to get the children in from play , washed , fed , and to bed . Brother addressed himself whole-heartedly to his food , but Petella asked , as she often did , for a story of " when you were a little girl , Mother , " and Matey told them about a jolly baby she had played with in France , " the first baby I was ever acquainted with , " she said . " I was like one of his big sisters , you know . He used to play peekaboo with us . And even then he always played fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children , with a kiss she tucked them up in their safe soft beds , she left them , and going out into her own bedroom , stood for a long time , one hand at her temple , staring at the floor , remembering Polo . . . how he had enjoyed Adrian 's fun on that last visit . The day went by . Matey varied between determined incredulity and moments of sudden physical sickness such as she had when the was pregnant . Belgium refused to allow passage to the German troops . " They 're crazy ! " said Adrian to his father . " What else could they do ! " he answered . " That was one of the terms of the neutrality treaty . They signed that . " 202 THE DEEPENING STREAMp202On the day after that , Matey read , " Belgian troops marchinlz to frontier . " All day she heard them marching . That night she woke up with a cry . " What is it ? " asked Adrian . He flashed on the electric light . Matey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly . " Oh , a dream , " she said . She lay down again . Adrian turned out the light . She had thought she heard Ziza 's voice screaming . In the morning she asked , " Adrian , how quickly you woke up ! You had that light on instantly . " " I was n't asleep , " said Adrian . " I was wondering where le petit Marceau is . He has three children now . " And then began the advance into Belgium . How long did it last ? It lasted till the end of Matey 's youth . Day after day the headlines read , " Liege battle still on , " " Liege forts still holding , " " Germans still held up at Liege . " Matey resolved that she would not again read a single word of the bloody description of the attack and defense , and every day read all of them . Liege fell . The headlines then read , " Belgians retreating on Ant-werp . " It was August 20 . A letter from Mme. Vinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant chatty letter , full of her return to Paris , how hot the train had been , and Henri had had the hall papered during her absence . She knew Matey would like the new paper , of which she inclosed a sample . Ziza 's new baby was sweet , looked just as Polo had when .. . Matey looked wildly at the date  --  July 21 . It had been almost a month on the way . On August 24 the first account of German atrocities in Belgium was printed in the paper . Matey burned like a torch . Adrian 's father said gravely to his son , " War 's always the same . " Matey was furious . Partly because he would not talk to her . " You do n't mean to say , Padre , " she flared at him , " that our American men in the Civil War . . . " He looked at her strangely , an expression on his face she had never seen there before . " Oh , there 's no use talking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a regular meeting of the Rustdorf D.A.R . chapter . It was Aunt Tryntje 's turn to entertain them.  | ( They were mostly old ladies , friends of hers . ) Matey went across the Square to help out with the refreshments . She found Aunt Tryntje turning over the pages of the immense album in which she kept old photographs . " I got to thinking about Adrian , thy Adrian 's father , in the war , " she explained over her shoulder as Matey came in . " I thought I had a photographof him in his stretcher-carrier 's uniform , but I ca n't find it . " Matey went to look over her shoulder . " Who 's that man ? " she asked , pointing to the photograph of a bare-headed , bearded soldierstanding in front of a tent . " That 's General Grant . " Matey looked into the tragic eyes of the old photograph . " It 's dreadful ! " she murmured . " I never saw such a sad face in my life . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Aunt Tryntje . She turned over the page . In the moment before she turned another , Matey caught a glimpse of half a dozen faded photographsof battle scenes . Corpses in uniforms , scattered sand bags , thrown-down rifles lay scattered about the trenches . But these dead men did not shock her . They did not look real . Either they were so peacefully relaxed that they looked enviably asleep , or they were in grotesque and impossible attitudes so that they looked like nothing but badly stuffed rag dolls . They did not horrify her half as much as the steady patient misery in the eyes and on the lips of Grant . " No , I ca n't find that photograph of Adrian , " said Aunt Tryntje , shutting the book . " I 've brought over some of those thin wafers , " said Matey , " to serve with the lemonade . Rebecca made an extra lot the last time she was at the house . " " They 'll be nice , " said Aunt Tryntje . Life slid forward in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vinets , any of them . The papers reported civilian mail delayed . Where could they all be ? Had Ziza escaped to Paris with her children ? No , Matey did not see her in the crowds of refugees reported by the newspapers . Ziza would never leave her husband . " Je suis folle , folle , folle de mon mari ! " cried Ziza again to her old comrade . With perfect distinctness Matey nowp204saw Ziza coming and going in the well-remembered pretty little Belgian suburban villa and felt herself sicken in the suspense which must be beating wildly in Ziza 's breast . " Come , come , this is hysterical , " thought the Matey who was sewing on the porch of her comfortable home , the locusts singing the old trees to sleep outside , her own children and Priscilla 's little girls playing pussy-wants-a-corner with an astonishing degree of noisiness . " This is melodramatic nonsense . I 've lost my nerve . After all , this is the twentieth century , voyons/ " ( Her thoughts came to her often in French in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles . And noncombatants are never involved in a modern war . Ziza 's husband is older than mine , past military age . Only the young men with the colors will be expected to take part in a war . Adrien Conacq has probablylong ago piled his wife and babies into their little motorcycleand side car and trundled them away from Louvain to Paris to stay with Mme. Vinet till this preposterous business is over . " Ziza 's American sister-friend looked up from her darning , calmed and reassured . Along the outdoor frieze flashed the spokes of the newsboy 's bicycle . He reached his hand into the brown canvas bag slung on his handle-bars . Riding with both hands free for an instant he folded an Evening Enterprise into a hard-twisted baton , and with a practiced gesture slung it far into the Forts ' front yard . Matey walked out over the hot grass to pick it up . " Mother , can we put on our bathing-suits and play with the hose ? " asked Petella from the side yard . " Yes , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrolling the paper . Halfway down the front page , among longer telegraphed dispatches , were two lines which read , " Louvain wiped out . Its civilian population has almost ceased to exist . " EXCEPT for Adrian and his father , Matey now felt herself in the midst of perfect strangers , almost on a strangeplanet . Priscilla , as ever , was absorbed in her convert'sfanaticism . As long as her little daughters had what they neededand were happy . . . ! And the others , these Rustdorf men andp205women , what could they be made of to go about as usual , cold and self-centered and hideously indifferent to suffering and death ? They read the war news , it is true , they commented on it  --  she shuddered to hear the comments they made . They complained of the difficulty of pronouncing those queer looking foreignnames or even of remembering what they were from day to day . They said , " I see the French government was moved to Bordeaux yesterday . Looks as though Paris was a goner , does n't it ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out of it ! I wish you 'd save me some of the seed from those pansies , they 're like some we used to have years ago . " Matey loathed the sight of them , shallow , vegetating provincials . feeling herself of a superior race . She tried to cable Mme. Vinet for news of Zizahadshe left Louvain in time ?  --  and was told it was impossible to guarantee the arrival of any telegram with a French destination . No letter carne . " Germans only forty miles from the capital , " said the headlines . Matey sat up till all hours , reading . She read straight through page after page of the Encyclopaedia , wherever she chanced to open a volume , and never knew afterward which ones they had been . Every day now , if the newsboy who brought the Poughkeepsie paper was at all later than his usual time , she went down to the train which brought the afternoon papers from New York . On September 7 she was late . The papers were in . People stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , the elderly owner of the iron factory . " Mr. DuBois ! " she cried , " What 's the news ? " He lowered his paper and looked at her absently , recalling his mind from his reading with an effort . Then , " Ah , Mrs. Fort , " he said , smiling . " How do you do , these days ? Chldren all well , I hope . " She was incapable of answering him . Her question reached his ear . " The news ? " he said vaguely , and then , " Oh , yes , yes , Paris , of course . I had n't looked yet . " Matey saw that he had been reading the financial page . Now he did look . " Not taken yet , " he told her . He added gravely , with a deacon 's intonation , " How thankful we Americans should be to have no connection with all that . " The next day the newsboy brought the afternoon paper early . Matey caught it from his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous headlines , the biggest , the blackest she had ever seen , three times as large as any The Enterprise206 THE DEEPENING STREAMp206had used before . They danced and wavered before her eyes . It had come . Mme. Vinet too . . . She held the paper off , trying to steady herself to read . But the words were not " Paris taken . " No , not at all . Matey made them out now . Like a startled yell they rang out from the paper : POUGHKEEPSIE MAN SLAIN ! Among the lists of German soldiers killed in a battle with the Russians was , it seemed , the name of a man who had lived in Poughkeepsie for a time before going back to Germany ; a man people had known ; a real man , who only now had been walking down Market Street like anybody . And he was dead . Killed . In broad daylight he had been thrust through with a bayonet by a man he had never even seen before . POUGHKEEPSIE MAN SLAIN ! shrieked the horrified printed voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that murder was being done . Before even she looked to see the news from Paris , Matey was pierced as by a bayonet by her first deep intuitive understanding of something not personal to her . For an instant she saw that Rustdorf people were acting as they did according to a universal law  --  not because they were bad or inhuman , not even because they were indifferent but because they did not see what was happening . As soon as ever they saw  --  ! But how was it possible that human beings could fail to see such events ? The rebuking answer to that question lay written large in her own thick-skinned indifference to the " thousand Austrianskilled ! " Could Mr. DuBois himself be any more stone and ice to human agony than she ? She began to understand what lies at the base of cruelty . The instant of vision flashed and disappeared as her other first guesses at reality had come and gone . Her eyes leaped over the corpse of the slain Poughkeepsie man and ran hurriedly through the telegrams , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Germans forced to change plans . " On September io came the news of the battle of the Marne . And a letter from Mme. Vinet . THE DEEPENING STREAM 207 THE children were scuffling in the next room . Matey could hear some sort of heated discussion going on . But lively tilts between them were not uncommon . Petella was devoted to her little brother , but she often found him exasperating and contrary-minded , and he on his side was often wrought to frenzy by her big-sister attempts to bring him up . Their mother took this for one of such encounters , not serious , a mere part of the process of settling down to live together . She continued to rush about feverishly cleaning the dining-room ( the third time that week ) and paid no attention to them till she heard Petella 's voice saying urgently , " No , honest ! Brother , do n't call her . I 'll buckle it for you : She feels so bad  --  you know !  --  that baby she used to play peekaboo with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matey stopped short . Where had Petella heard that ? Did childrenknow everything you tried to hide ? She thought she had hidden from the children not only the news of Polo 's death but all her fever of sorrow and anger and alarm . She had carefully come and gone about the house as usual , she had played with the children , she had sung to them . ( But , oh ! not the old French nursery songs she had sung with Polo and Ziza ! ) She had kept a rigid grimace of cheerfulness on her face . She had been doing her duty , she thought , by keeping them shut out of her real life , by pushing them outside her door . She had forgotten that she was Petella 's mother and not her nurse and caretaker . But Petella had not forgotten . Matey began helplessly to cry . To think that her baby girl had been sorry for her ! She knew that Petella had heard her and had pushed the door open . But she did not stop . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , the first tears she had shed for the murdered Polo streaming down her face . She heard the child come in and felt about her knees the pressure of short arms , squeezing earnestly . She sat down on the floor and took her little girl into her arms , weeping more than ever  --  but not wholly now from sorrow . Very dimly , calling in a faint voice from far in the past , came the question  --  had her mother , to protect her , shut her out so208 THE DEEPENING STREAMp208from her real life ? And she had not known how to . find her way in , like Adrian 's deep-hearted little daughter . She had only run away to play  --  like Francis . They cried a little while , Petella and her mother , hugging each other very hard , and ten minutes after , Petella had shed it fromher five-year-old mind and was arguing with Brother about whose turn it was for a ride on the kiddie-car . Her mother was working again , but not so hysterically , capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little voice . He was once more getting around Petella . During those days of suspense Matey could do nothing but work . There was not , she felt , work enough in the world to occupy her . " No , Rebecca , leave that . I 'll do it , " she said over and over . She could not bear her piano . A note struck by chance on it by the children made her wince . She could not bear to go to 1Vleeting . She had never found in the Quaker " silences " more than quiet and rest and occasionally a vague but comforting sense of a greater , more powerful current of life in which she was sharing . Now those long pauses were filled with sights and sounds which appalled her . Incessant activity of the most primitive kind was the only screen between her and the sight of Paul Vinet as his mother saw him in the hospital where he died , armless , blinded , mutilated beyond her recognition  --  little Polo ! the harmless , lovableboy . . . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbing-brush and broom to shield herself from that sight . But she only sprang into a wave of terrified surmise about Ziza and her children . It was almost worse not to know what had happened to them than to know as with Polo . At least he lay in his grave , safe from further tortures . Not a word had reached Mme. Vinet from Ziza . Henri 's summons had come , he had joined his regiment and perhaps now lay on a battlefield  --  Matey thought , " like one of those tumbled corpses in Aunt Tryntje 's photographs "  --  Mimi 's husband , obese and middle-aged , was with the reserves , who were digging trenches all across the north of France . Mimi was to stay with her boys in the house at La Ferte-en-Valois to do what she could to keep the business together . " La Ferte of course , so far to the interior , is perfectly safe . " So wrote Mme. Vinet in mid August . By the time Matey read the letter , La Ferte too had been engulfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? Had she been caught like Ziza ? Where were those little rosy boys of hers ? Mimi had not Ziza 's vitality . She never would survive a great shock . " Petella , is that the mailman ? " her mother called out a dozen times a day . In the midst of her restless misery it comfortedher that she did not need to keep a company face for Petella . Another letter came . Petella stood by anxiously , halving her mother 's fright by sharing it . Matey raced through the first page and sent her daughter away happy with the news that the little boys who lived in La Ferte were all right . Yes , Mimi had been caught by the tide of invasion , had lived through the passage of the Germans ' advance and retreat . The house had been ransacked and fouled , some of the furniture had been carried away , but no harm done to Mimi or the little boys beyond a week of deadly fear and venomous hate . Mimi was sticking it out in La Ferte to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen were mobilized , of course , but she was looking up the older ones . Her oldest boy was thirteen , old enough to help her a little at the ' factory . At the factory ! The soft , well-served , domesticated Mimi try ing to understand business accounts ! Soiling her white fingers with machinery ! Mimi , who had never been able to endure with steadiness even the most sheltered life . It was unthinkable to Matey . " Mimi writes that she must save what she can out of the wreck for her children 's future , " wrote Mme. Vinet . ( " Of course Mimi would feel so . Any mother would , " said Priscilla when Matey read this letter to her . ) Mme. Vinet had not in the least given Ziza up in spite of the terrible silence from Louvain . She wrote : " I can feel that she is still alive . And if she is , as soon as she can escape she will come home . I hear her knocking as soon as I drop off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to open the door three or four times . I must not leave the apartment for more than an hour at a time . She may come at any moment . Providentially the government has declared a moratorium on rents . If I had to pay rent I should not be able to stay here . Henri 's salary has stopped , of course . Mimi 's husband is practically ruined . I have no music lessons  --  oh , what a chaos of mean and tragic miseries , my Mete ! " At the end of this letter , " We ca n't be thankful enough , can210 THE DEEPENING STREAMwe , Matey , that our children are safe and all right , " said Pris. cilia earnestly.  |p210LONG  with all the rest of the world , Matey passed into thenext phase  --  the phase when nothing different happenedinto a state of suspended animation in which it seemed at first she could not live another day , a condition which all wise experts , financial , political , military , economic , said could not last another day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . Henri still lived . During the first period of maladjustment in the army he had been put back into the place in the regiment  --  in the line , as a common soldier  --  which had been his years before , as a young man during his military service . He had gone through three battles , receiving " only " a slash in the face , which was superficial and treated on the field . Now , as some glimmerings of order began to appear , he had been assigned to semi-clerical work ; at the front , but not actually in the trenches , not charging with a bayonet . Adrian had had word from le petit Marceau , his old comrade . He had long ago , as completely as Adrian , given up painting for bourgeois life , and earned a comfortable living as a traveling salesman for a large silk manufactory in Lyons . Like Henri he had been sent at first into the front-line troops , but was now , like other men past thirty , transferred to " lighter " service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , to pick up wounded and carry them back to the dressingstations . " Imaginez-vousl " he wrote Adrian in surprise , " that one of the sections of automobile ambulances which take the wounded from the first dressing-shelters back to the hospitals are American Fords , driven by young Americans . I call that chic ! Lads who could be at home in comfort with their girls . And not even their expenses paid ! " Matey could not repress an involuntary smile over the French " realism " of that last underlined exclamation . Mimi was struggling on in La Ferte , trying to learn to manufacture plumbing-fixtures with a working force of old and infirm men . She had been able , finally , late in October , to make a flying trip to Paris , to see her mother . " There is gray in her hair , " Mme. Vinet reported , " at thirty-two . She looks like someTHE DEEPENING STREAM 211P211one else . A Mimi I never saw . " They had decided , the two women who were the only members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all costs Mme. Vinet should keep the apartment , in case Ziza might even then be struggling toward that refuge . " We hear now that it is not safe to trust to a moratorium for rent , because it will be ruinous after the war is over to pay the accumulation . But I have things I can sell . My mother 's India shawl will bring in quite a sum . And that little Creek statuette presented to my husband by his old students , I could probably find a purchaser for that . " Her American foster-daughter saw her sitting alone in the old home fighting down grief and fear and looking about her to see what pounds of flesh would be salable . That letter brought Matey for the first time a possibility of relief . All that day she was turning over this possible escape from the horror of her own inaction . trying to think of words that would do to begin to speak of it to Adrian . While Matey cleared away the supper-table Adrian usually  --  rent upstairs with the children , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat between their beds while they fell asleep . That night she did not hear him come down . She finished and went into the living-room . It was smiling warmly with lights and books and the sea-coal fire , but Adrian was not there . Looking out , she saw in the light from the street lamp that he was pacing tip and down the front walk , his hands in his overcoat pockets . She snapped off the electric lights , put on a wrap , and went out , Mme. Vinet 's letter in her hand , desperation in her heart . When he saw her coming he said in a constrained tone as though he owed her an apology , " I could n't settle down indoors . " Matey slipped her arm through his . They began to walk up and down together , coming as they approached the street into a circle of white light , stepping into deeper and deeper darkness on the way back toward the house . Matey was asking herself , How can I begin ? With what words can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low that she could scarcely hear his voice , " I have n't said much to you about it before , Matey  --  I  --  I had another letter from Marceau today  --  I do n't suppose you can realize how it makes a man feel to  --  " Forgetting her , he burst out loudly , " I t makes a man feel like a dog to be wallowing here in comfort and safety , while . . . other men , old friends , old comrades . . . " Matey felt as if he had struck her , and instantly struck back212 THE DEEPENING STREAMP212at him in a reflex of anger . " How do you think it makes a woman feel ? You think it 's perfectly all right and natural , I suppose , for a woman to be in a position that makes a man feel like a dog ? " Their vehemence had stopped them short . In the light from the street lamp Matey examined her husband 's face as if he were an enemy , resentment burning darkly in her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather an expression of apology . " I ought to have known you 'd feel it too , " he said , " but I 've been wrapped up in my own problems ... yes , I can see now that it must be worse for a woman .. . she has to stand it without even the consolation of thinking there 's anything she might do about it . " Matey stared at him , her resentment mixed with astonishment at his grim accent and the set lines of his face . " Why , Adrian , what could you possibly do any more than I ? As much as I ? You are n't thinking . . . even if you were French you would n't fight ? " " Matey , I do n't know ! I ca n't tell you how hellishly I go round and round between what I believe and what seems necessary . . . . I do n't know what I 'd do if I were French . . . it 's all out of the question anyway . I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , if it were n't for leavingyou and the children . No , I do n't suppose I 'd fight , though that would be the logical thing to do  --  the way I feel . No . " He laughed unsteadily . " I suppose I 'd compromise , try to help out somehow short of actually taking my share . . . there 's the Belgianrelief . . . and Marceau mentioned those ambulances . I can drive a Ford . " Matey took his hand in hers as they walked , and said , pressinghome her words as though they were swords , " Adrian , where do you think I would have been by this time if I had not been married ? " It was Adrian 's turn to be astonished . " Why , what could you do ? " he echoed . " There are plenty of women  --  poor things  --  to look out for everything that can be done behind the lines . " " Most of them are busy trying to earn a living for their babies and their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out . She told him of what was in Mme. Vinet 's last letter . " Of all her children , she has n't one with her . . . . am like one of her daughters , I owe her much of whatever it isP213one owes a mother . She has n't any money to live on , she ca n't keep the apartment there for Ziza perhaps to come back to , withoutmore money . And we have Aunt Connie 's . She writes in every letter of , being swamped in trying to help destitute refugees  --  with nothing but the clothes on their back  --  half crazy some of them  --  all women and children and old men . That 's woman 's work . Why should I wallow here in safety and comfort any more than you ? " Adrian reminded her in a horrified voice , " But , Matey  --  the children ! " " They 're your children as much as mine , " she said steadily , and loosed her hand from his , walking at his side , waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes away . They paced up and down silently . Her demand was something so new for him . She saw now with patience how new it was for any man . She could feel how long it lay on the surface of his mind before he could let it in . In her heart she was saying over and over passionately , " Let me in . Let me in . We are man and wife . " She thought , " This must be the way religious people pray . " And later , " This is per , baps prayer . " Presently as they turned again from the house out toward the lighted street Adrian had come to the point of being able to pay , not contentiously but more in his usual voice , with an Adrian-like wish to consider everything fairly , " But , Matey  --  look here  --  how could we both ? The children have got to be .. . I do n't see . . . " " I do n't see either , " said Matey . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it together , instead of separately ! " She took his hand again . They marched off toward the future , looking for the path together .. They walked out toward the world and turned back toward the children , over and over , up and down the old flagstones of the old path . It was now very late . The street light went out . A thin moon showed itself palely through the elms , rose higher , and shone more brightly as they walked and talked . The mere fusing of their overwrought nerves brought  --  miracle of human fellowship ! - more quiet , more steadiness than either had known for months . They went round and round the situation , pushing against every locked door , trying the strength of every bar . Time and again they put away the whole idea as madness , only to return immediately to considering possible ways and means . Aunt Connie 's money  --  yes , they could use that  --  if they had the right to endangertheir one small nest-egg of capital . From the money they passed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of her frustrated life . " She must have walked up and down here , right up and down this very street , as raging to use herself to some purpose as we are now . But all alone ! Never any mate , never any comrade ! She never did find a way out . " " It takes two , " said Adrian , " to find a way out . A real two at that . " They looked across to Aunt Connie 's house , where Priscilla slept beside her foster-children . Matey said , " How shallow-minded I was about Priscilla 's marriage ! I 'd forgotten about Aunt Connie 's fate . I never see the real sense of things at first . " " There are all sorts of ways of being shut out from life , " said Adrian . " Priscilla is n't as bad as some . " " Adrian , I feel as though Aunt Connie were walking up and down with us right here , telling us to take her money and go . She 'd want us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting it , " admitted Adrian . " What would she say about taking the children , I wonder ? " " I tell you one thing , " said Matey with conviction , " if Aunt Connie had lived with Petella for five years as we have , she 'd know the child would n't want to be left out of a chance to help . " " What in the world could a child of that age . . . ? " " When you live with a person , even a child , you know , " said Matey . She felt that Adrian thought this a womanish notion , and tried to think of specific proofs . Were those incidents of child life anything a man would call " proofs " ? Could you reason so from small to great ? Yes , you could . Most of what understanding she had had come to her from the light cast on great events by small ones . " Well , anyhow I know ! " she repeated . Adrian put the question aside . " Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested . " The war ca n't last long  --  six months at the outside . You and they 'd be safe enough in Paris . " They went on to talk of details , of letters to be written , inquiriesto be made . Matey interrupted this planning to make ; a confession . " Look here , Adrian , I must n't set up to be any less self-centered than you . It had n't occurred to me you might bop215feeling it as I did . If I 'd spoken first I 'd have left you out too , I 'm afraid . I could n't think of anything but  --  " " I know , I know , " said Adrian , " civilization going to the scrapheapand  --  " " No , I was n't feeling anything thoughtful and abstract like that , " Matey interrupted . " I do n't feel that way now . I know all that . But I do n't feel it . If it had n't been for the Vinets I would n't have felt it any more , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as that goes , I too , " said Adrian humbly . " I 've a lot of old friends in the French army myself . " They went back to their equal-to-equal talk of ways and means , talk of action which , vague though it was , drew out some of the poison from their inaction . Once as they halted for a moment under the old beech tree , something very tiny and light eddied down from the darkness of the branches . Matey put up her hand to see what it could be . Dandelion fluff could not be flying in November . It was a tiny downy feather . " From an owl , perhaps , " said Adrian dreamily . Their excitement and tension had slowly poured out through their hope to act and left them in a tired tranquillity . For a time as they walked and talked Matey held this morsel of clown between her fingers . It was so fine and small she could scarcely feel it . And yet  --  she held it up when the moon shone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ! ringed with flawless symmetry . " How can it be so infinitely pert  --  soso infinitely small , " she wondered , musingly . " There 's no big or little in infinity , is there ? " said Adrian . She blew it from her finger and watched it settle to the earth through the still , cold night air . The moon sank behind the house . They still walked up and down , hand in hand . Finally it sank behind the hills across the 13ndson . And yet they were not in darkness . They looked around and saw their old home world standing steadily about them . " We 've walked the night out , sweetheart , " said Adrian . " This Is the dawn . " 216 THE DEEPENING STREAM WHEN Francis wrote , as he did in February , Matey thought wildly , " I do n't care if he is my brother . This is too much ! " What had been in his hurried note was the advice to put every penny she and Priscilla could lay their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made there . This war is going to last lots longer than most people think . The European factories ca n't begin to supply their demands . It 's a wonderful new market . Every American manufacturer who 's got anything to sell is going to make money . They say the people in the foodstuff business feel the upward pull already . But steel products ! That 's what Europe 's going to need most , of course , arms and ammunition . Emily 's sister is married to one of the steel men here , so we get the inside dope . If you take that little nest-egg Aunt Connie left you out of the savings-bank and put it into Steel you 'll be on Easy Street , take it from me . Emily and I are selling everything  --  we 've eve put a big mortgage on the house  --  and buying stock . Common , you understand . Do n't buy preferred . It 's the common that 's going to soar . " Matey tore this letter up angrily . It was one of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I feel as if I never wanted to see him again ! " Yet the next time her brother came , she ran with a cry of pit to put her arms around his neck . For nine days Francis had ha a little daughter . And now she was dead . So much his siste had learned from a letter written them by an aunt of his wife 's . The very next day Francis stumbled up the steps to Matey 's door . She opened to his knock , she looked into her brother 's face  --  " Why , Francis ! Francis ! " she cried . They went down the street to Priscilla 's . " I just wanted to see you girls , " said Francis pitifully , taking Matey 's hand as they walked over the glittering gayety of the sunlit snow . " Seemed as if it would do me good to see you . I never left my little girl Matey . I stayed right there in the hospital . They thought blooJ transfusion would save her , perhaps . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on talking , although his lips shook so that he could scarcely form the words . " Theyp217took my blood for her , Priscilla . She was the nicest little kid ! At first I could n't think who she looked like . But after a while  --  do you remember how Matey looked when she was a baby , Priscilla ? Sort of wide between the eyes ? That 's how my poor little girl looked . I was going to get a dog for her . Matey always took tic ) much comfort in that old dog . You were an awfully nice kid , Matey . She 'd have been  --  I sat there planning what I 'd do for her . And  --  only nine days ! I could n't believe it when the poor little thing stopped breathing . You girls are all I 've got in the world of my own , now . " He began frankly to cry , undone to childishness by grief and sleeplessness and loss of blood . His sisters , shocked and compassionate , got him food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been a sick person , and gent a telegram saying he was safe with them , to that aunt of Emily 's who had written them . Since Emily was in the hospital , fll , this was the only name and address they had . He fell asleep soon , his mouth sagging wearily , peace at last on his tear-reddened eyelids . Matey , looking ih at him , shuddered . Suppose she had already quarreled with him about that letter , had shut her door against him ! How touching he looked , defenseless , appealing , human ! Calamity had brought to the surfacea Francis she had never known . So it had been for her father ! How different they would have been both , if there had ken more pain and sorrow in their lives ! But they were so competent in avoiding pain . Her head ached with trying to understand . She could get no further now than understanding that deprivation like Aunt Connie 's was not the only thing that frustrated what might have come to be . Success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already shut him out ! How like her , to feel so angry at him just the first time he needed her ! Bewildered , always wrong Matey ! She was discouraged by the steepness of the uphill road that led from her childish hardnesstoward a little understanding of the rich complexity of life . I t seemed to her that she stood still , never advanced at all , unless swept forward  --  why , like Francis ! like her father !  --  by a blow , by calamity . Francis slept almost twenty-four hours , and when he woke , a little refreshed though still weak and sad , " I must get back to Emily , " he said . " Where 's a time-table ? " Matey abased herself remorsefully with the resolve never to forget that his first thought was for his wife. 218 THE DEEPENING STREAMp218At the station , pacing together soberly up and down the snow  --  covered platform , he and his sisters , freed from themselves for a moment , had a talk such as they had never known . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Francis . " Mother always thought it was a judgment on them . It was a little boy . " " I never heard about a first child ! " said Matey . " No , Father never talked to you girls as much as he did to me . You were always hard on them , Matey , in your way . I 've often thought you and Priscilla held them off  --  " " Held them off ! " cried Priscilla . " Well , anyhow , after you grew up , you did n't make it easy for them to feel close to you , you know you did n't . " Priscilla laid an unconsciously dramatic hand on her heart and stared beyond her brother at her past . " I 've always wanted to talk to you about them . But yo know  --  it 's not easy to begin . And you girls always took every thing so hard . Maybe now you 're married yourselves  --  they wer all right , Father and Mother were ! Fitted each other . I kno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be king-pin But scrapping over that kept them up to the mark . Scrapping ' what keeps people fit , anyhow . Suppose Mother 'd been the sof resigned kind of woman . Inside of three years Father wouldn have been fit to live with . It does a man good to have to fig to keep his end up . Fighting 's the law of life . And faithful each other  --  ! There was a Mrs. Whitlock in Logan Bluffs  --  n . Hamilton it was  --  you were probably too young to take it i  --  Matey , and it was after you left , Priscilla . Well , she fairly thre herself at Father 's head . Rich , too . But did he dream of takin her seriously ? Not on your life . And Mother knew that . Sh never had to worry a single minute about her husband 's bein taken with another woman . " He looked at his sisters , astonished a their lack of response , " Great Scott , girls ! what more can woman ask ! " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bet the first girl Father was engag to would n't have had the nerve to keep him up to his best : Mother . . . You did know , did n't you , that he was engaged another girl when he met Mother ? That was one of the things the made them so  --  " " No ! " cried Matey . P219They had not noticed that the train was there , the wind of the locomotive 's passage blowing their long skirts about . " Another time . . . " said Francis , kissing his sisters . But they knew this was the only time . " All I wanted anyhow was to sort of stand up for them a little , and to tell you , Matey , do n't be so hard on folks ! " He was gone . His astounded sisters looked into each other ' ; ; eyes . But a neighbor of theirs had left the train , a D.A.R . member . She walked home between Mrs. Fort and Mrs. Russell , telling them about an eighteenth-century letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , which gave an irate account of how the soldiers of the Revolution , camped at Fonteynkill , had taken the rail fences for miles around for their camp cooking and had even stripped off the siding from the Reformed Church as high as they could reach . Matey thought , " When we get to the house and all by ourselves , Priscilla and I must  --  " " That 's why the lower clapboards of the Fonteynkill Church are of a later period ! " explained Mrs. Deyo . As the three passed the bank , Adrian raised a window and called , " Matey , come in a minute , will you ? " Priscilla went on with Mrs. Deyo . Adrian came out on the walk bareheaded although the cold was intense . He held an open letter in his hand . " I 've got the answer from the New York office of that ambulance service , " he said to his wife . Matey read its few lines in one glance . Looking at each other silently , the Forts made their decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyoung Forts expected to stand quite alone when the stormof horrified disapproval broke over them . But to theirsurprise , at least to Matey 's , Adrian 's father stepped quietly overto their side out of the crowd of protesting prudent people whoad ordinary good sense . On the evening when they first told him , e said nothing at all . He listened through to the last word oftheir somewhat agitated explanation of their plan . After theybad said everything over twice , he sat a long time thinking , his220 THE DEEPENING STREAMp220eyes closed , his gray head propped on one hand . Sharing that silence with him , they felt something of his quietness come into their troubled hearts . Matey thought , " It 's like letting turbid water stand still till it clears itself . " Finally he lifted his head , looked at them , smiled , shook his head , and said , " I 'll have to have more time , I 'm afraid , " and putting on his hat and coat , he let himself out of the house . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told her , " I 'm glad Adrian is not going alone . " " Oh , Padre ! " said Matey , thanking him with a look . She asked him timidly then , longing for his approval , not hoping for it , " Padre , about taking the children  --  it 's not  --  I know they would be safe here with you and Priscilla  --  but  --  " Struggling with herself , she tried vainly to break her silence about the moral atmosphere of her childhood . " I think the risk of  --  I feel  --  " She looked away from his attentive eyes and said in a low shamed voice . " I learned when I was a little girl that anything is better than letting a barrier grow up between parents andj children . " He waited a moment before he answered . She ventured a hurried glance at him and saw in his face a silent fatherly com  --  passion . When he spoke he humanely made no reference to the wordsi wrung from her , answering her in a judicial tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as children . Older peopl are apt to forget that . Why should we take for granted that if they knew what the choice was , they would , any more than yo and Adrian , prefer safety and comfort to ... " " Oh , yes , yes ! " cried Matey . " That 's just what I felt , but Z did n't know how to put it . " Adrian 's father used rather steadily his ability to " put " i from the time his children 's plans were known until they wer gone . One such talk of his helped her over the worst , Priscilla ' feeling . He met Priscilla one day going out of the Fort house crying as though there had been a death in the family . " I can ' stand their going ! " she told him . " I do n't think they 'll regret it , " he said moderately . Inside the house ( it was April then , and the windows were open ) Mateystood to listen . " But the children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever regret it , either . " THE DEEPENING STREAM 221 " Regret it ! . . . Will they live through it to have any opinion ! " " There must be several million children of their age in France , " said Mr. Fort . " Matey made inquiries about supplies , milk and schools and everything . Mme. Vinet reports everything near enough normal for health . " Priscilla redoubled her protests . " Honestly , Mr. Fort , it seems to me wickedly wrong , to do anything that might in any way be a disadvantage to your children ! " " Ah , there are various kinds of disadvantages , " Mr. Fort remindedher . " Perhaps when they grow up , to know that they did not stand in the way of a generous-hearted action of their parents ' but shared it will be no disadvantage . " Priscilla caught at the word " generous . " " You must n't think I 'm  --  Francis has perhaps written you that  --  It 's not the money . I would n't care a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . . . just sent it to Mme. Vinet by the first mail . But to ... " " Do you suppose Mme. Vinet would accept it ? " asked Mr. Fort . " Self-respecting people retain their self-respect , I imagine , even in wartimes . If you were alone , in distress , two of your childrengone , the others in danger , yourself in want , how would you feel if Matey just sent money to you ? Is there any decent way to Five money except to give yourself with it ? And anyhow , I have n't the faintest idea that the war can last much longer . I expect them back in the autumn . The children will get a good French accent out of it . " Priscilla was outraged by his lack of heroics . " Mr. Fort , how an you ! Those darling babies . You 're their grandfather ! " " I 'm Adrian 's father , too , " Mr. Fort reminded her . " You must remember that I too could n't stand it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you were n't married and a father ! " " It will be a sorry day , " said Mr. Fort , energetically , for the rst time losing his implacable patience , " when getting married nd becoming a parent puts an end to being a member of umanity ! " ' For an instant Matey feared he had gone too far and criticized oo plainly Priscilla 's ingrowing maternity . It was all she had : lvaged , and it was natural  --  it was perhaps essential  --  that she ould think it all there was to be had. 222 THE DEEPENING STREAMP222After her sister had gone , she went out on the porch to thank her father-in-law . " It 's wonderful , Padre , how you know what to answer them , every time , " she said gratefully . She wished she dared give him a hug , as she did to Adrian when her feelings overflowed . But that was one of the things you did not do to the cool old Quaker . So she went on , straining words to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just would n't have the courage to do this if it were n't for you , Padre . " " Oh , yes , you would , " he drily corrected her sentimental overstatement . And nodding , went on his way . Matey looked after him , abashed , nettled , respectful . " Every word of his is fresh from the mint , full value , " she reflected , " but I know what Dirck Davis 's wife objects to in them ! " She and Adrian felt better , calmer , quieter , now that it was decided . Matey went back to her piano , and never played so much for her father-in-law as in the period when the last preparations were being made , their tickets bought , the manner arranged for Adrian 's father to forward to them the necessary installments of Aunt Connie 's money . Francis 's wife had had a relapse and was so ill he could not leave her . But he wrote . Matey held the letter in her hand a long time . She remembered the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . But she remembered too how softened her heart had been on his last visit , and how startled she had been to learn that Francis had been , all during their youth , more tolerant than she . Or was it only that he had been more insensitive ? Or were those two ways of saying the same thing ? At any rate he was her brother . She laid the unopened letter on the fire and wrote him , " I did n't read your letter , Francis . I knew what would be in it , and what 's the use ? Be good to Priscilla while we 're gone . And do n't let 's ever ever forget that we grew up together . " He wrote Adrian then . " Francis thinks we 're perfect softhands , " reported Adrian , knowing nothing of the first letter , " fooled by all this pro-Ally guff , ' as he calls it , about France and Belgium being martyred nations . He says that invasion of Belgium is what any modern nation would have done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme to ruin Germany because she 's efficiently industrial . You know ! That line ! " His father nodded his familiarity with that line . But Matey did not know it at all and said so . " My goodness , why bring in political economy ? Does he think we 're going be/cause . . . why , I 'd like to tell him that if it was a German family that I loved as much as the Vinets , and owed as much to , 1 'd go to Germany just as . . . " " Well , I would n't ! " said Adrian . " You 've got another guess coming if you think that 's the way I feel . I 'm going to do my share to help France win the war , and do n't you forget it ! " " You 're a better Friend than your husband , " the older Adrian said to his daughter-in-law . " See here , Father , " his own son challenged him , " you were n't so impartial yourself . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal ? You know you would n't . ' His father 's face darkened . Matey remembered he had never said a word about those three years of his life . There was a silence . Then : " When I went away from home I would n't . After the first battle . . . " He got up , a strange expression in his eyes . " It 's one of the things there 's no use talking about , " he said roughly , walking away . Matey was not always as sure as her words . There were morningswhen she woke up thunderstruck by their madness in even thinking of taking the children away from physical safety . On such a day Francis came to see her . He did not exclaim or reproachor protest . He simply talked the plainest sort of common sense . " What do you think you can do , Matey , " he asked , " to help the cause of the Allies ? You and the children will be only more mouths to feed , more dependents to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . This is no job for women and children . You 're not cut out for a vivandiere anyhow . " " But there are women and children there , Francis , who need what a woman could  --  " " Now , Matey , use the old bean a little . France is a rich modern country . Do n't you think she 'll take care of her own without help from Rustdorf in Dutchess County ? What good do you suppose a woman and two young children are going to do ? You 're not any wonder of strength yourself , you know , with those sick headaches of yours . " Matey thought . " I did use to have sick headaches ! I wonder wheat they stopped ? " To Francis she said , " I 'm perfectly well and strong now , Francis , much better than when I was a girl . "   " Use your strength to take care of your own children then , " he told her with his first severity . " How anybody who has a child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of and said nothing . He went on , " It 's not surprising that you are carried away almost hysterically by this . That 's the trouble with you homekeepingwomen , when you do make an exception and take some interest in public matters you have n't anything to judge by . Nothing in your sheltered lives corresponds to the realities of the great world , of course . Take it from me , there is not a pennysworthto choose between the two sides in this war . They are all in it for what they can get out of it , and they all brought it on Themselves . The thing for Americans to do is to let them stew in their own juice . For heaven 's sake , why get into the mess when we are out of it , in a safe place  --  " His voice went on , but for a moment Matey no longer heard the words . The rug of her living-room turned into bare barn boards and on them a hapless , blindfolded , befooled little boy staggered about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there if he could only find them . That night she told Adrian , " Francis was here today . " " What did he say ? " " A lot of unanswerable common sense . I had n't a word to say for myself . " Adrian looked at her hard . " Now I 'm really sure we ought to go , " she said . " I wo n't doubt it again . " Adrian 's father was the last of their own they saw on the dock as their steamer pulled out . He had put his by no means new hat on the end of his umbrella and was waving it absurdly at them as though they were off for a summer vacation . Matey could scarcely see him through her tears as she put away in her memory his last words to her . Standing beside her on the deck , while Adrian at the other end of the ship showed the children how the donkey-engine worked , he said in his inimitably natural voice , " Matey , I 'm nearly seventy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fully expect to be here when you come back , but it 's possible that I may not be . I do n't mention that because it 's of any consequence , of course . A few years more or less . . . ! But it would be a pity ifp22SI let you go without making sure that you know what you have been to me . It 's not only that I 've seen you grow from a nice girl into a deep-hearted woman who 's the best wife I could imagine for my son . But for me . . . I 'd thought I 'd go down to my grave , always feeling the emptiness left by the death of my little girl . Yet you have filled it . I have had a daughter after all . " Matey forgot her shyness of him then , put her arms around him and kissed him with all her heart . She longed to tell him that she who had missed having a father , perhaps by her own fault , had found one after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no words that would not sound theatrical . She was so much more fluent than he and could say so much less . Now as the ship was slowly leaving the dock , she could only wave her handkerchief at his small lean elderly figure , and strain her ears to hear what last greeting he was shouting to Petella , who , Adrian clutching at her skirts , leaned herself half across the railing , shouting excitedly , confusedly , " Good-by , Padre ! Goodby ! Come again ! Good-by ! " " What did Padre call out to you the last thing ? " asked her mother . " Oh , he just hollered , Be a good girl , Petella ! ' " He never bothered about what words to use , thought Matey . Any words would do for him . THEY passed at once from a world where their action had been melodrama to a world where it was a commonplace . But few Americans were in the second class with them . The first class was almost deserted . People with money enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trouble there . It was , of course , the trouble there that was taking back the second-class passengers . The men , mostly no longer young , were going to help out women relatives left manless , to get in the crops , to hold small businesses together till the head could get back from the front ; to do , in short , what there was no one to help Mimi do . Many of the plain , self-supporting women were doing just what Matey was doing , going back to take226 THE DEEPENING STREAMP226with service and money the place of members of the family dead , or buried alive in the regions occupied by the Germans . No one thought it surprising that the Forts were going back to France , too . Matey 's French made them suppose that she was a Frenchwomanmarried to an American . " But perhaps your husband is of French parentage , too ? Adrian Fort . There was a family of Forts living down the street from us in Noyon . He is perhaps related to them ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank unnoticed into the second-class passenger list . Adrian asked his wife , " What in thunder made us wait so long ? " The first part of the trip was fine , sunny and quiet . People walked up and down the decks or took the May sunshine in steamer-chairs , played shuffleboard , flirted and gossiped as if it were any crossing . Matey and Adrian smiled shamefacedly a good many times at the beating on the emotional drum which had precededtheir departure . The children were enchanted with the new experience , and Brother was enchanted with the new language . He inhaled and exhaled it as if it were air , embellishing his baby-talk English with scraps of baby-talk French which sent his father into fits of laugher . " Mon dieu ! " exclaimed Brother , dressing himself with difficulty on the floor of their cabin , " Mon dicul I dot my left slipper on my wight pied . " His language had a great success . As he trotted about the deck , people stopped him to hear this bilingual babble . Petella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the very idea of saying a word in the strange language she felt and looked wild . But she was very proud of Brother 's French , and Matey often heard her showing it off to by-standers . Halfway across , talk of a submarine attack began . Before they left it had been considered certain that passenger ships would never be attacked . There was a rumor among the passengers of a French armed ship being sent to convoy them through dangerous waters . Anxious eyes searched the ocean . Port-holes were darkened . No one was allowed to strike a match on deck at night . A notice appeared in each cabin warning passengers to have their life-belts at hand . It no longer seemed in the least like vacation travel . No one made any pretense of enjoying danger . Matey woke up a good many times during the last nights out and lay listening to the vibration of the ship 's engines till they seemed the pulse of her own being , the mysterious rhythm which wasp227driving her forward over a dark sea to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adrian 's father would feel an impulse to deflate . " How he takes the dramatic quality out of things ! " she told herself impatiently . Later she perceived that his dry coolness was enemy only to melodrama , and that deflating its falsity , he allowed the real drama to emerge . " As if it were only now that I am driven by a mysterious rhythm to an unknown destination ! " she thought . Late one evening the ship came into the mouth of the Garonne . The passengers were told they would dock at Bordeaux early the next morning . Every one packed before going to bed . Matey was tired and fell asleep as soon as she lay down in her berth . The children had long been tucked away in their upper bunks . She woke to a sensation of panic . There was not a sound . Why was this stillness so death-like ? Oh , the engines had stopped ! No wonder she felt as though her own pulse were stilled . A thud of feet came along the corridor . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Adrian , springing up to open . Out of the dark a voice said hurriedly in French . " We are in a mine-field . The captain has ordered the ship stopped till dawn , hoping she will lie quiet enough not to strike against one . Every one is to dress and have his life-belt at hand . No lights . " The feet went thuddingdown the corridor , a knock on the next door , " Qu-est-ce-quec'est ? " in a startled voice from behind the door . Matey and Adrian groped for their clothes , dressed , and decided to let the children sleep . " If we need to , you can carry Brother , and I 'll take Petella . They 'd better sleep if they can , " said Adrian . They sat down on Adrian 's berth . And waited . Matey thought , " Now I shall know whether I can endure fear . " Adrian took her hand . " Are you afraid , dear ? " She began , " Not so much , oh , not near so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not her first encounter with fear . She had met it years ago , and what she felt now could not be compared to that black helpless waiting for catastrophe of the child she had been , tragically unfortified , like all children , by experience . Nothing had then come into her life strong enough to stand between her and her fear  --  over the oatmeal , bitter as poison on bad mornings  --  that there was nothing real in life but the wish to hurt . That had been true despair . But this present danger  --  all that was not physical in her stood apart from it , unthreatened , secure . She tried again to answer Adrian 's question . " I do n't believe grown-ups can ever be as afraid as children . There 's so much you 're sure of that ca n't be hurt that a child does n't know . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " said Adrian blankly , " and I tell you what , Matey , I may not be what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a hole  --  see here , why ca n't we take the children and our life-belts up on the deck where we could at least  --  " " Good heavens , yes ! " cried Matey fervently , her heart leaping at the thought of being in the open air . She was afraid , she saw that . But if fear was n't any worse than this ! How wonderful to be grown up ! How tender one should be to helpless children , for whom the present is all ! " For goodness ' sakes ! " said Petella , opening her eyes and I blinking in the sunlight . " How 'd we ever get up here in our sleeping-drawers ! And what am I sitting on Father 's lap for ? How cunning Brother looks ! " Brother still lay , a blanket-swathed cocoon in his mother 's arms , sound asleep , though one of the horizontal rays of the rising sun struck rosily across his round face . " Mother and I thought it would be fun to carry you up on deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did n't we even wake up when you took us out of bed ? " " Just like sacks of meal ! " " What 's that ? " asked Petella , pointing to three masts emerging from the water . " Looks like the top of a ship . It is the top of a ship ! What made it sink ? Why , there 's some more masts , down the river a little . What made so many sink ? What are we on a river for , anyhow ? I thought big ships did n't go up rivers . What 's that funny-looking building over there ? Oh , who are those men in .. " " Petella , not a question out of you till I get my breakfast , " said her father irritably , setting her down on the deck with a shake . " You run along and get dressed . " Adrian was as natural with his children as with any one else , and when he was tired and cross he showed it . Petella giggled at the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . " Why , " wondered Matey , " do the children mind it so littlep229when Adrian speaks impatiently to them ? My parents never did to me , and yet . . . " She knew why , of course . " It is because they know , as I did not , there is nothing to fear , underneath . " She caught herself up with remorse . Here she was again , think ing in that old childish , unjust way as though she had not learned better . Had she learned better ? Could you ever unlearn something that had grown into your memories ? Adrian said , yawning , " Quite a night . " He looked at her somberly and asked , " Are you sorry . . . ? " " No ! " His face lightened . " You 're a game old girl , " he told her , gettingup stiffly from his steamer-chair . He looked more tired than Matey felt , although she was quite tired enough . But ever since their decision , under no matter what fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground-swell surge of conviction that she had enough strength for whatever she had to do . " Wake up , petit frere , " she murmured to the child in her arms . They watched the docks of lower Bordeaux slide slowly by . It was late in the afternoon , the trip up the mine-sown Garonne even in broad daylight having been conducted with extreme care . Matey was tired , sleepy and disheartened . Bordeaux looked like any modern city , invulnerably industrial . She wondered why they had thought France was in need . Maybe Francis had been right . Certainly the business-like streets they passed , with trolley cars clanging and trucks moving up and down , did not look in the least like an organism blindfolded and befooled , staggering about in vacancy . " There 's the dock where we 're going to land , " said one of the passengers . They approached it more and more slowly . A group of people stood there , leaning against the custom-house walls . " Probably been waiting for the ship since four o'clock this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that about midnighta rumor got about in the city that our ship had struck a mine and gone to the bottom . " Matey ran her eyes over the people waiting . How French they were ! Why did any group of French people look so different from Americans ? There was a small , thin old woman in black , with a long black mourning-veil , who was crying and waving her handkerchief at some one on the ship . Matey turned her head to see who was waving back at her . No one . She looked again . The old woman seemed to be looking at her . With a shock Matey knew whose was that ravaged human countenance . Across the narrowing stretch of water , she was lookingfull into the eyes of Mme. Vinet . It was her first glimpse of the war . " Look , look ! " she cried to Adrian . " It 's Mme. Vinet ! How can she have dared to leave the apartment ! How old she looks ! " She held up the children , calling out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To Adrian she said , in a whisper , " Can it be that they have heard Ziza is  --  " She shrank nervously from the word which was soon to pass her lips familiarly enough . But when , carrying Brother , she made her way down the gangplankand ran toward Mme. Vinet she learned there was no news . " Ziza . . . ? " she cried as she ran . " Nothing yet , " said Mme. Vinet , opening her arms . " But how can you be here ? " ' Henri is on leave  --  his first . He is at the apartment . " She began to cry , drawing Matey and her little boy into a close embrace . " Oh , mete , when last night I heard that thy ship had been  --  " Matey drew back from her . " But , Mme. Vinet , you are missing some of Henri 's precious time at home ! " This might be the last time she would see Henri alive . " Ziza and Mimi are not my only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BEFORE she left home , Matey , guessing that her time would be limited and wishing to avoid repetition , had arranged to send the news by way of a round-robin letter , intended for all the family and neighbors . She had little to write , she told them , that was interesting . " Paris is as quiet as Rustdorf , " she reported , " and much darker at night . In fact Washington Street is like Forty-second Street and Broadway compared to the Champs Elysees after six o'clock . And nothing could be less like a vivandiere'slife than mine . I just keep house as usual . Adrian 's news is all there is . He is accepted as an ambulance driver and is goingp231to be sent Into service just as soon as he can get his uniform made and all the innumerable papers prepared . The mail service from the front is very good . I 'll hear from him every day or so except when something special is happening . Mme. Vinet gets a letter from Henri every morning . Petella watches out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the street although we 're four flights up  --  and runs down the stairs to bring Bonnemaman 's letter to her . Mme. Vinet wants the children to call her Grandmother . They get on very well together . She says some of Petella 's ways remind her of Priscilla . And I believe it 's true . The way she takes care of Brother , it is like the way Priscilla used to take care of me . And Brother thinks just as I used to , if only his big sister is there , everything 's sure to be all right . " Mme. Vinet is in bed now for a while by doctor 's orders . She was just about all in . Their little bonne had to go back to Quimperle to help her father on the farm because her brothers are all at the front  --  those that are still alive . Most of the other servants in Paris have done something like this , too , so it 's hard to get any help . The few that are left ask higher wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd been trying to do for herself , and she 'd never so much as boiled an egg before . You know how French bourgeoises always left household work to the slave-caste . . . especially those that have a profession , like Mme. Vinet . Her fingers that I used to think were like ten clever people on the piano keys act like idiots and maniacs in the kitchen . " Henri did n't have to go back to the front till after we 'd been here a couple of days , and he and Adrian and I had a regular French conseil de fondle about how to arrange things . You know I was n't any too sure they 'd feel all right about my paying the rent and our staying here . Adrian and I had some talking points ' all ready , what a help it would be to us if Mme. Vinet could let us in , and so forth . But all that sort of thing seems here like bowing and scraping over who 's going to step off into the lifeboatfirst ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner . Henri nearly cried with relief  --  extraordinary to see him leave behind so wholly that little caustic surface manner of his . He 's been nearly beside himself with anxiety about his mother , I imagine . You know they have always been like two halves of one person . He feels Polo 's death as much as his mother . Not to know232 THE DEEPENING STREAMP232anything about Ziza ! Henri and his mother keep on inquiring of Belgian refugees . But they have only found two people who have ever heard of the Conacqs . One was cook in a house in Ziza 's suburb and knew Ziza 's little maid , Melanie . But all she could report was that young Mme. Conacq was one of the few ladies who stayed on in her home . Just what we knew Ziza would do . The other news comes from a student of the University of Louvain . He did n't know Ziza and her husband , but he had studied German under old Professor Conacq , Ziza 's father-in-law . He tells us that the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him before night as part of the reprisals against sniping at Germans . " Henri and Mme. Vinet always speak of Ziza as though they were sure she is alive . But I 've given her up . It 's ten months since Mme. Vinet left her with the new baby . . . in Louvain ! If she were alive I 'm sure they would have had some word , through some refugee , by this time . Mme. Vinet always speaks of Ziza as though she might return any minute . To quiet her I 've put my bed in what we used to call the dining-room , because it is close to the front door . This has given her a chance to . go back to her own bedroom , and for the time being she is sleeping most of the twenty-four hours . Henri says he does n't believe she 's had two consecutive hours ' sleep since the beginning of the war . She was always jumping out of bed and running to the door afraid she had not heard the knocking . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have us here . Mimi wrote me a lovely letter about coming , too . Henri says she has been very much worried about her mother all alone here , but of course she must stay on in La Ferte to earn the living . There just are n't enough people left at the rear to do all that has to be done . " Our things came all right . The children were so enchanted to see some of their old Rustdorf playthings come out of the trunk . Adrian put the kiddie-car together the first thing , and now it trundles up and down the allees of the Luxembourg as if it thought it was still in Washington Street . Brother takes so much comfort in it . People turn to laugh at the fat little boy having such a good time on his odd vehicle . I 've put Padre 's photograph  --  it 's not a good likeness , is it , except the eyes  --  up on the mantelpiecein the living-room , opposite the photograph of M. Vinet , beside that glass-covered monstrosity of a clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  | " I ca n't tell you how queer it seems to me to have my children knocking around in the old children 's room where I spent so much time . And to take them out to play in the Luxembourg , just as Mme. Vinet used to take us ! I do n't believe a flower has changed in the flower-beds there , and I 'm sure the wall-paper in the children 's room is the same . Half the time I do n't know whether it 's then or now . " I do hope Petella will get over her shyness about speaking Drench . Brother 's learning it ten times faster than she . His English gets quainter every day . He said yesterday , Je veux avoir two oranges . I s'all have two oranges , because I got two hungries in me . ' It 's too funny to hear him make the same mistakes in English that French children do ! But Petella turns all colors and swallows her tongue if she 's asked to say a word . She 'd get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only feel at home in the language . " Matey stopped the letter there , leaving in the position of emphasis this first intimation she had given her American family that she and Adrian would not be going home in the autumn . ( Had she ever been sure the war could not last much longer ? ) She was worn out with the effort of keeping up that matter-offactreassuring tone . That would have to do for this time . She sealed the envelope and tiptoed to look in at Mme. Vinet . Her face , sunk in the pillow , was like alabaster . Her tiny emaciated body lifted the bedclothes . Henri had said , " You have saved my mother 's life . " Matey was n't so sure she had come in time . The children were playing in the children 's room . " Petella , let 's play soldiers . Soldiers going to smash Boches ! " Where did they pick up things ! Matey put her head in the door and asked severely , " Brother , where did you hear anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noires , " said Brother , " crawling in the cuisine under ze table . " " We 're all right , Mother , " said Petella with a reassuring nod . Yes , she was a responsible child , as Priscilla used to be . Matey went on into the living-room and found there the thought from which she had been running away . It was day after tomorrow that Adrian was going to the front . Their first separation . Forty-eight hours still . No , only forty-seven now . It was a thousand times harder than she had realized . For an instant Matey thought wildly that it was going to be harder than she could stand . After all , she was n't forced to stand it . All of this was voluntary . If it was too hard . Some one was looking at her . She felt a human gaze on her in the empty room . Oh , Padre 's photograph . She sat down and met those eyes . Presently she stood up and went into the kitchen to start dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Petella and Brother , storming in from the children 's room . " We did n't hear you anywhere , and we looked and you were n't with Bonnemaman , nor in your room . " " We look pa'tout . . . pa'tout ! " said Brother , expressing with a Gallic gesture how thoroughly they had looked everywhere . " You did n't look in the living-room , " said their mother . " Padre and I were having Meeting together there . " " Oh , " said Petella , looking hard at her mother to see what she meant . " Que-est-ce-que-c'est que Meeting ? Qu-est-ce-que-c'est que Meeting ? " clamored Brother , opening his hazel eyes very wide . " Brother , you 're forgetting all about home ! " said Petella , shocked . " WHAT do you think , Francis and Priscilla , " wrote Mateyin her round-robin , that autumn , " who do you supposeis peeling potatoes in our kitchen this minute , but Dominiqua ! Yes , Dominiqua Iturbe from Biriatou . You 'd recognize her in a minute . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest way in the world . Everybody keeps track of everybody in his circle , and when there 's need , they help out . For instance , you remember , Priscilla , the cross concierge here . Their son was badly wounded in a recent engagement . Nobodylikes them a bit , but everybody in the house is chipping in together to send the boy things to eat and to make it possible for his parents to see him in the hospital . And Mme. Vinet 's bonne , the one that went back to Brittany to help her father work the farm  --  she has three brothers still alive . Mme. Vinet sends somethingnice to them at the front every week or so , and sometimes one of them comes here for his furlough , instead of going all the way back to Quimperle . He sleeps in Henri 's bed and eats with us.  |p235Astonishing  to see such a dyed-in-the-wool old bourgeoise as Mme. Vinet invite her cook 's brothers to her table . " And more than this , Mme. Vinet keeps track through Henri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied regions whose families , like Ziza , have just dropped off the earth . Such fellows have now nowhere in their country to go to on furlough . Many of them have n't seen the inside of a home since they left Valenciennes or Tourcoing or Chauny or wherever they lived when the war broke out . Most of them are working-men who do n't know what to do with themselves for a week in Paris . They get awfully fleeced and done . One reason Mme. Vinet was so run down and thin when I came was that she 'd kept open house for such homeless fellows , doing for them as she does for Henri . She really starved herself to give them good things . They are coming and going , one or another , pretty much all the time . " Well , that was what I came to do , if I could find it  --  if I could find it ! Heavens ! How could I ever have wondered if I could find it ! And what I wanted to spend Aunt Connie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day for me to do it all without help in the kitchen . Mme. Vinet is better now , out of bed , but not strong yet , and anyhow worse than nobody for housework . I was wondering how ever I 'd find help . Well , one of the soldiers here on furlough happened to mentionhaving some Basques in his regiment and I thought of Dominiqua and her boy Jeannot , the one who was a baby in arms when we were children at Biriatou . She had another boy , too , younger . They must be , I thought , about twenty-five and twentythreeyears old , the age when they are most sent into the shock troops . I 've always kept some sort of track of Dominiqua , sent her a New Year 's card every year , and some little present , so I knew her address . I wrote offering , if she 'd tell me the military address of her sons , to do what I could for them in the way of sending packages . She wrote that her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remake shell-ruined roads along the northern front , where he got pneumonia and died . The younger son , like Polo , was lost in the battle of the , Marne . Jeannotis still alive , in the Chasseurs Alpins , shock troops , just as I thought . And Dominiqua was at her wit 's end to know how to live . Her tiny allowance from the government was scarcely enough to buy food . She had been working in the fields , digging potatoes , although she has a bad hernia . When I proposed to her to come here and work for us at good wages ( beata sancta Connie , again ! ) two whole mail days nearer the front , where she could hear from Jeannot with no delay , I got a telegram from the stationmaster at Hendaye reading , Mme. Iturbe arrives Paris Bordeaux Express tomorrow nine-thirty . ' " I went down to meet the train , taking Petella along for the , treat of riding home in a taxi afterward . I was wondering if I 'd know Dominiqua . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she had been labeled Basque from head to foot . There she was in her black dress , espadrilles on her feet , black coif twisted around her chignon , as Basque as a striped oxcloth . She knew us too , at least she knew Petella . As we ran up toward her , she cried out , Oh , le petit Francois , que voila ! ' She says Petella is the perfect picture of Francis at her age . " Well , she was terribly excited , first time she had ever been farther from home than up to Saint Jean-de-Luz . She called down on our heads the blessings of the Virgin Mary and all the saints she could lay her tongue to . And she wept all the way home in the taxi , and kept calling me there petite Mme. Meta , although she 's a tiny little woman like Mme. Vinet , and I 'm as big as the two of them put together , and she undid her bundle to get out Jeannot 's picture to show me , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then found it in her pocket ! It was a wild trip ! t thought I 'd been crazy to think of transplanting her . " But the sight of a kitchen restored her reason miraculously , like showing a laboratory to a distraught biologist , I imagine . She gave one look at it and said , Chi the casseroles should n't hang there ! ' in a perfectly natural human voice . I tiptoed out and left her hanging them somewhere else , to her immense satisfaction  --  and mine , believe me ! I suppose I seem as futile in the kitchen as Mme. Vinet does to me . If only the old Southerner does n't freeze to death this winter ( fuel 's scarce of course ) we 're all set . " There , thought Matey , pushing the paper away with a weary gesture , that might be a good place to stop , with that second intimation that they would be staying on right through the winter . No  --  she pulled it to her again  --  she must send some news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I inclose part of Adrian 's last letter from the front , which will tell you how things go with him , as much as he 's allowed by the censor to say . I 'll know more of course and tell you more , :  |p237when  I 've seen him . We do n't know yet when his first furlough will come , probably next February . " Autumn came , the gloomy autumn of 1915  --  one Russian defeatafter another , the murderous failure of the Champagne offensive , the savage invasion of Serbia , the Gallipoli tragedy . New disasters continually draped the French world in fresh black . French man-power never too numerous , seemed to be approachingexhaustion . Older and older men , younger and younger boys , were summoned from civilian life to military training . Women like Mimi who had boys of thirteen and fourteen began to count i he days . " But it ca n't last . We have come to the end of the rope , almost , " people said to each other in talk . Never in print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Petella had insensibly slid into French and was now learning in this Paris public school about the same information she would have absorbed in Rustdorf , the multiplication-table bulking large . Brother was in the kindergarten . He was a year younger than the , regulation kindergarten age , but the teacher of that class was an old friend of Mme. Vinet 's who had known Matey when she was a little girl . Room was easily made for the little boy of the American who had come to France to run an ambulance at the front . Along with other mothers and aunts and maids and little boys and girls , Matey and her children trudged down the wet gray street in the wet gray mornings to the door of the lycee . She clung to the children 's untouched zest in life almost as pitifully now as the men from the front en permission . Playing with Brother and Petella was the part of furloughs which the soldiers liked best . Now that she was separated from them most of the day , Matey understood more of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces to be kissed , had trotted off , hand in hand , to the mysteries within the lycee , and had left her standing on the muddy sidewalk , she often had a moment of panic at being left with her own thoughts and fears . But the never-ending list of things to be done built up another screen between herself and her thoughts . Mme. Vinet was not strong enough to be much on her feet , so she sat at home , writing the never-ending letters to the soldiers " on the list " or to their families with news of them , putting in order garments intended for refugees , wrapping up in the tiresomely exact manner pre-P238scribed by military authorities the innumerable packages of cigarettes , matches , chocolate , writing-paper , and woolen things which streamed out from the apartment to the front . Matey did the outside things  --  the long shopping expeditions to buy cigarettes , chocolate , and other things for the packages , the visits to the men in hospitals , the endless standing in line in bureaux of one kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in answer to requests from soldiers at the front for help to their families . One of the addresses to which she was sent in this way became very familiar to her . Day after day , she went in to help take care of a bedridden peasant girl , heart-broken by her husband 's death two days after her baby was born . He had been in Henri 's regiment , and from his death-bed had sent word to ask Henri 's American foster-sister to look out for his wife . He had no one else . His wife 's brother had been killed , her own parents were dead , his own family were under German rule in Valenciennes , nonexistent for her . Matey could find no link with life which had survived in her . She would not look at her baby , she turned her face away from the sun , she said nothing to Matey but " . Non , Madame , " " Non , Madame . " The concierge , whom Matey paid to take care of the baby , and a nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up . " She 'll be better off in Heaven , poor thing , " said the Sister devoutly . The concierge said , " There 's nothing to be done , Madame , with those peasants when they make up their minds to let go . . . . The baby will just have to go into an orphanage . He 'll have plenty of company . " Matey thought of the soldier she had never seen who , dying , had confided his helpless wife to her , and went on doggedly with her fumbling efforts to be a doctor to the soul . But her attemptsat cheerful talk sounded foolish , and flat as they echoed in the dark void of the tenement-house room . One day she stopped at a street flower-stand and bought a bunch of country violets , last flowering of an outdoor bed , to take to the woman who would not get well . Young Mme. Letellier looked at them , put up her hand to them before she turned her face away . " There were violets in our garden at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matey . She found out from the concierge that Mme. Letellier 's native village was Crouy , on the Ourcq . That was not far from La Ferte . Matey wrote to Mimi , explaining her plan and asking for information . Mimi 's answer was prompt , P239accurate , detailed , sympathetic , unlike anything the old Mimi could have written . A day came when Matey said to the listless invalid , " I have just heard about a piece of property that is for sale in Crouy . A small stone house , the Boutry family used to own it , near the canal , next door but one to the house where you lived as a little girl . I know of an American fund for war troubles , and if you liked , I could get from them money enough to buy this , as a place for you to bring up little Jacques . You probably remember the house . It has a big garden plot back of it . It would be nice , do n't you think , to have your little Jacques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The invalid did not stir or speak . Matey dared not stop . She went on , " A friend of mine who lives near there has gone out to Crouy to see it . She spoke specially of a fine old apple tree in the middle of the garden . " From the sick woman came faintly , " When we played hide-and-seek with the Boutry children , that tree was our goal . " The baby was about two months old when Matey carried him and led his white-cheeked young mother into the Gare de 1'Est , and settled herself with them in the train . After they had passed Meaux , Matey said , " You must tell me when we are near Crouy so that we can be ready to leave the train . " Mme. Letellier sat closer to the window . Presently she said , " Oh , that fine beet-field of the Auvarys ' going to weeds ! " Later , " They have n't cut those poplars yet on the Moronier farm ! They 'll certainly fall in some windstorm . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was led now . Mimi was waiting at the door of the tiny house . Matey scarcely knew her old playmate . This gaunt , masterful , steady-eyed woman , with gray in her carelessly arrangedhair , and machine-oil ground into her hands  --  could this be the pensive nonchalante Mimi ! There was no time for exclamations , for anything more than a sisterly embrace . There was but one train Matey could take back to Paris that day ; it left in half an hour , and she was not yet sure of success . Mimi 's manner was perfect . Not a trace of the old French bourgeois superiority to peasants , " I happened to have a little extra furniture , Mme. Letellier , " she said respectfully , " which I thougl't might be useful to you till you get settled . " ( This was what she and Matey had decided to say about the bits of furniturebought with Aunt Connie 's money . ) And , " Some of the neighborswho remembered you and your parents are coming to welcomeyou to Crouy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for you to take a turn about the house and garden if you like . Mme. Fort and I will stay here and take care of the baby . " She and Matey sat in the low , heavily beamed kitchen , the largest of the three small rooms of the house . Before them an economical French fire burned discreetly on a huge hearth . Matey noticed that Mimi had not only provided the necessary tables and chairs ; but had put white curtains at the low windows , and pots of flowering geraniums . " That was sweet ! " thought Matey . And with a motherly gesture Mimi took the fatherless baby on her knees . " I 'll stay till the last train back to La Ferte tonight , " she said . " I 'll stay overnight if she seems to need me . " The two old comrades had less than
