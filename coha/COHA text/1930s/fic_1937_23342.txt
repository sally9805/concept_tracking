A WOMAN LIKE DILSIE A STORY BY DAVID THIBAULT O N a Saturday in June , Easter , George , and John were walking home from the commissary , each with his rations slung in a gunny sack upon his back . Now and then a wagon passed them , going toward town . In one of these sat Aunt Minnie Graves , with her husband and the girl whom Easter had seen at the revival the August before . George pleasantly called the old man by name . " So dat 's Peter Graves , " commented Easter . " I know Mis ' Minnie since I wuz ' bout seventeen . " " Do n't you know ' im ? " George asked . " I seed ' im at chu'ch wid Mis ' Minnie . I figgered who ' t was . But I ai n't to say knowed ' im . " John laughed his slow , provoking laugh . " Now you done ax ' bout all of ' em but de onliest one you thinkin " bout . " " Who dal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who you think East been stud'in ' ? Not de team of mules . " " Shucks ? " said Easter . " I ai n't even knowed her name till now . " " She a fine gal , East . " For once George was not ribald . " Her or folks is fine too . You heahed of de Peter Graves lake ? A big cyp'us brake ovah across de bot-toms ? " " Co'se I is . " " Hit named fo ' him . He homesteaded fawty acres ovah dare . Good lan ' as a crow ever flew ocross . He got nigh twenty acres cleared . " " Dat 's all he kin clear , " said John , " lessen he hires catfishes an ' mud-turkles to roll de logs . De rest of it runs out in de lake . " But George pointed out that this was no tragedy because the pond acres bore a good stand of big cypresses . These Peter Graves felled and rived into boards and pickets . Everyone knew that Peter Graves kept a stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his count and his price were fair . " He done well ' fore he got agable , " George concluded . " Now he got to hire de timberin ' done . " Easter said no more . Here , after nearly a year , he was tapping information he had longed for since his first sight of Dilsie . It was a part of her peculiar effect on Easter that he had asked no one about her , not even her name or where she lived . He had been afraid of this girl , and then there was Annie C. , the kind of woman to occupy any hardworking man 's spare time completely . Annie had comfortable ways , she was cheerful and not at all terrifying . Once or twice a year she might fly off the handle and mark you with a bed slat or a poker , but she never hit as hard as she could , and ten minutes afterward she would be laughing and joking and comfortable . Easter could take a rest from her , and she could take a rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as though all were new . Easter left George and John at his own turn-row and tramped on alone to his cabin . He unlocked the door , stored his rations , and brought out a chair , which he tilted back against the walnut tree . Then he thought about marriage . It must be a good thing , after a man has run round over the bottoms like a stray boar-shoat , to marry a woman like Dilsie Graves . A man should do this in time to have his children coming up ready to lend a hand in the field when he began to fail and lose his teeth and get old . He wondered if Annie C. could have children even if she wanted to ; and he wondered why he thought of Dilsie , whom he had seen twice , in connection with marriage , and not of the comfortable Annie . " Annie she jest ai n't de marryin ' kind , " Easter muttered half aloud . To-day 's encounter with the Graveses had focused the dream of Dilsie which Easter had entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and played it against the immediate and usable flesh of Annie C. , his emotional setup was ideal . He could not have explained it , but that was why he had not sought to know more of Dilsie . Knowing her better he might have needed her , and the things she meant to him , intolerably . As it was he had of her all that he needed . Dilsie was merely a tenuous memory made into a beautiful dream which Easter delighted to evoke when , as now , he sat with his eyes half shut , his thoughts turned to pasture . This dream could not displace the grappling realities of Annie 's breasts and thighs . But neither could poor , everyday flesh , frankly real , obviously limited , destroy the dream . That afternoon Easter took his gun and struck out through the bottoms toward the Peter Graves lake . " I needs to kill me a squirrel fo ' some freshenin ' , " he told himself . " H 'm , " said Double-Actin ' . " De squirrel you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied it , a course always dangerous , because his conscience was irascible in argument , personal , and sometimes vile . " I is gwinna hunt me some squirrels ! " he insisted , and put a cap on each nipple ofhis gun . " Shor jeered Double-Actin ' . " Sho ' . But dis squirrel ai n't got no bush tail . " Stung and disgusted , Easter crossed half a dozen narrow straits between cypress ponds , skirted two fair-sized lakes , and came to the Graves ' clearing . The double loghouse was locked and still . Knowing the family was in town , Easter boldly approached the house . There was a front gallery and a water-shelf loaded with cans and buckets and broken crocks full of moss roses . The unfenced yard was clean-swept , the sizable woodpile was neat , and a sound wooden tub stood under the spout of the pitcher-pump . Between woodpile and pump , handy to chips and to water , two big washpots stood each with its three legs resting upon half-bricks . Look at the crops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , and the wash-place tell you about his womenfolks . True as a mirror everything here reflected Aunt Minnie Graves  --  brisk , clean , kindly . Easter turned back to the house . Against the house , under the gallery roof , hung festoons of red peppers , bunches of herbs , and loops of well-roped onions . On a tiny three-legged stand stood a handleless earthenware pitcher filled with old-fashioned " cabbage " roses . At this Easter looked long . He was sure Dilsie had placed those flowers there . He crossed the lead between the lake and a smaller pond adjoining it and plunged into the thick woods beyond . For two hours he hunted squirrels as he never hunted them before . By late afternoon he had killed eight . He tied their necks together with a strip of elm bark and returned to the Graves ' clearing . The place was still deserted . Easter ambushed himself near the footlog across the lead and waited . It was nearing sunset , and the mosquitoes were about him in booming clouds when he heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the house , Easter crossed the footlog and walked briskly forward , perfect picture of a belated hunter , hurrying homeward . Peter had helped his womenfolks out A WOMAN LIKE DILSIE 461 of the wagon and they were all three busy with their packages when Easter came up to them . " Well Lawd bless my heart ! " cried Minnie Graves . " It 's Easter , dat Malissa Thomas raised . How is you , honey ? " " I 's all right , Mis ' Minnie . " Then to Peter . " Kin I he'p you wid de team , Mistuh Graves ? " " Glad to see you , " said the old man . " Dems some fine squirrels you got . I kin unhitch . You go in an ' take a cheer . " Easter insisted on helping with the team . It staved off by so long the beatific terror of looking at Dilsie . But for all that , the corners of his eyes saw her demurely attending to her own business , helping her ma the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was miserably afraid . He presented Peter Graves with all the squirrels and prepared to bolt . The old man herded him with difficulty to the front gallery , calling cheerily to the women , " Dis boy done gim me all his squirrels . I 's gwinna make ' im stay an ' he'p eat ' em . " " Sho'l  --  course he is " Minnie followed her voice through the door . " Come in an ' have a cheer , Easter . " But the stiffening had gone from Easter 's bones . He reeled off lie after lie to get out of doing what he had schemed and worked half a day to do , rejecting the fruits of the victory he had not even dared to hope for . " Den effen you got to go , " said Minnie disappearing inside , " wait jes ' a minute . " She returned with a pie tin piled full of something over which a clean white cloth was tied . " Heah you some beef we bought in town . You kin bring back de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Graves . " Now you know de way , come an ' visit . Do n't many come across dese bottoms ? ' cepen a lot of boys dats a-settin ' up to Dilsie . " What barbed information for Easter to pack home across the swamps1 Easter cooked his supper and ate it , washed the skillet , pans , and cups , and then sat down on his door-block under June stars to think of Dilsie ; and he came to the image of her in his mind as a famished man faces manna . Not even old Peter 's mention of many rivals hurt him now . When at last he went to bed he was convinced that just thinking about a woman like Dilsie was more exciting than possessing any other woman he had ever known , except Annie C. Here he was thinking of those two at the same time again . He wished to goodness he could keep his thoughts about them separated . But it was n't his fault , he maintained to his vision of Dilsie . Thoughts of those two girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more different than they were alike . Sunday Easter attended meeting at Zion Wheel , hoping and fearing the Graveses would be there . They were not . He saw Loda Green , Annie , and Elsie in the congregation . How had he ever come to marry Loda ? Elsie 's remembered fascination was nearly as incredible . He studied her face as the sermon thundered on : a tired , leanish woman of forty , with one eye . . . . When his meditative glance fell on Annie C. she flashed her wide smile , and his lips flashed an answer ; but he was thinking of that broken pitcher full of pink cabbage roses on Peter Graves ' gallery . Monday morning Easter hoed in his own crop . Between quartering-time and noon it showered ; so little that he had trouble convincing himself that it would be too wet to work in the afternoon . However he managed it , and was just ready to set out across the swamps to return Aunt Minnie 's pan and cloth when Mr. Henry rode up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to help us out this afternoon . We 're chopping the upper eighty . " It had not occurred to Mr. Henry that it was too wet to work , and Easter did n't argue the point this time . That was the heartbreaking pattern of events for three weeks of grinding work . On the first Saturday following his visit to Graves ' clearing he had to drive the wagon to town for rations , substituting for Pink Dawson , who was down with chills and fever . Sunday , dressed in his best , he crossed the bottoms to find the Graves ' house locked and silent . He learned later that they had attended meeting . The following week his own crop needed him . A blessed thunderstorm halted field work Friday , but Mr. Henry sent Easter to town again , and on Saturday had him help issue rations in the commissary . Sunday Easter was at meeting again  --  and the Graveses were not . But Annie C. was there . " How come you ai n't been down to see me ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dey is tryin ' to work me down . W'en nighttime come , I jes ' falls on de bed . " " I b'Iieves you , East . Whut I wants to know is who wad ! " Easter had been thinking so often of Dilsie and so seldom of Annie that he looked half guilty , but Annie 's laugh made him comfortable again . " East , " she was solicitous now ; " you is lookin ' kinda ganted , sho ' nuff . Whatever you is doin ' , you better not do much of it as you is . " Wednesday of the next week he met Aunt Minnie Graves herself in the big road . " Easter , boy , why ai n't you been to see us ? " " I 's been layin ' off to come , Mis ' Minnie . I sho ' is . I ai n't forgot yo ' pan , an ' de cloth . I washed ' em good . " " I done forgot ' em myself ! I do n't need ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Youall be dare Sadday ? " " We 'll be dare all day Sadday . " " Den effen I lives an ' nothin ' happens , I 's sho ' gwinna come . " Seedy though he had felt for days past , Easter did strike out for the Graves ' clearing Saturday morning . Every step he took increased his lassitude . He began to feel a shiveriness despite the June sunshine , and every fifty yards he yawned . With about half his journey done , Easter was seized with nausea . Afterward he lay on the ground on the sunny side of alog and shivered . He and malaria were old acquaintances . He lay in the sun until the dumb ague passed ; afterward , when his fever mounted , he crawled into the shade and slept . It was noon when he awoke . No visiting that day . He knew he would feel comparatively well until next " chill-time " : the same hour to-morrow or the next day . But right now it would be well to get on up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week Easter wrestled with malaria . Mr. Henry knew the malady thoroughly , and fought it with broken doses of calomel and six ten-grain doses of quinine daily . By the middle of the following week Easter reported for work . He was still a bit " ganted , " but the hoe gang was busy again , and hoeing was child 's play to him . Easter finished next the leader , Flint , and resting on his hoe turned toward the gang which was strung out for a hundred and fifty yards back along the rows . When you finish your own row it is your privilege to rest until the others " cut out " ; but seemly conduct requires that you rest only a moment and then turn back and " he'p out " some slower hand . You pick a friend 's row or that of some woman whose favor you seek . It is an orthodox means of sparking as well as a gesture of friendliness . Also it is a point of honor for the leader not to start ahead of the gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each round . Easter turned to the row next his own , without noting who carried it . As he began chopping , three other men chopped out and hastened to that same row . But Easter was ahead of them , already several yards along the row . Astonished that so many should rush to a row far from the stragglers where most of the women worked , he looked for the first time at the hand he was helping out . It was a girl . ? . Dilsie Graves . For the moment Easter lost his awe of her in amazement and admiration . A gal carrying third from lead in a gang of fifty hoes ! When he and Dilsie met , the girl gave him a tiny scared smile . " Thank you , " she said , and they walked back to the end together . " How you been ? " Easter ventured . " I 's been well . Dey says you been sick . I hopes you is better . " " I is , " Easter mumbled . It was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's hoeing Easter ever put in . There were three or four of the best hands who raced him for the privilege of helping out Dilsie . He held his own and thanked his stars that the lead row was carried by Flint Winfrey , the best hoe-hand in the bottoms . " Do n't let ' em git de in-turn on you , East ! " Flint would chuckle . " I sho ' never saw so many lazy niggers hoein ' dis fast befo ' in my bawn days . Jes ' look at ' eml Dey 's kicking up dust like a cow a-runnin ' in de road . " Flint weighed close to three hundred . He moved his body as clumsily as an erect bear , but in his thick hands an eight-inch hoe became a rapierlike thing . Easter had time for no more than a quick grin acknowledging Flint 's banter . Nathan Grant , Dick Mickings , and others pushed him hard . Once or twice Nathan finished a stroke or two before Easter , and the latter was saved only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By quartering time that afternoon Easter knew he was slipping , though his performance gave no sign of it . " You is sweatin ' too free , East , " said Flint . " Hit ai n't dat hot , boy . " " I kin hol ' it . " Easter was in the grip of one of his fits of bull-headed stubbornness , and he would have hoed until he dropped . Dilsie saved him , on the very next round . When they met in finishing her row she said to Easter in a rush , frightened : " You mind he'pin ' out my mommer ' stead of me ? It shames her so to be behin ' all de time . " Thereafter Easter helped out Aunt Minnie Graves , and Nathan Grant , swiftest of the remaining rivals , got Dilsie 's shy , stimulating thanks . However much this stung Easter , there was balm in Aunt Minnie 's good nature , her appreciation of his help , and her evident liking for him . He refused to consider another palliating circumstance : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept to the racing clip . That same afternoon he learned of another of Dilsie 's accomplishments . The squad of women had begun to hum . Often art hour of this precedes actual articulate song . Finally , when even the men were leavened with harmony , one of the elder women called across to Dilsie , " Pitch it , gal ! " Clear and true Dilsie 's voice rose across the perfect accompaniment of their humming : " Oh , Cav-a-reee ! Hit 's a mighty high mountain ! " They all swung in with the mellow antiphony : " Look how He died ! Look how He died ! " Then Dilsie 's voice , alone as one star at nightfall : " Oh , Cav-a-reee ! Hit 's a mighty high mountain ! " And their response , deep from the men , wailing as Rachael 's own from the women : " Oh , do n't you hate dem cruel , cruel Jews ! " That carried them half down the field . That night Easter , loose-limbed with fatigue and the weakness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought of Dilsie . The day 's scenes flickered through his head : Dilsie 's hand on her hoe-handle ; Dilsie 's figure with the wind molding her skirts about her . He thought too of the girl 's popularity with all manner of folks . He had seen men race to " he'p out " gals before . . . but these wenches were of a pattern flamingly different from Dilsie 's . For the first time Easter stood Dilsie and Annie C. side by side in his mind and examined them without flinching ; he realized with joyous amazement that , after just one day 's association with Dilsie , it was Annie C. who was now the tenuous dream . " An ' Dilsie she got good hips an ' breastes her own self , " said Double-Actin ' . " I was n't studin " bout dad " cried Easter , perhaps aloud . " H 'm , " grunted Double-Actin ' . " Dat how come you sees ' em in yo ' haid so strong now ? " There was another glorious day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies to soaking rain , and work ceased . That was on Thursday . Friday morning Easter shouldered his ax and tramped across the bottoms to the Graves ' clearing . Long before he reached it the sound of three busy axes rang in his ears . Aunt Minnie had told him that Peter would be at work in the timber and that he had no one hired to help him . Easter was puzzled , chagrined , at the sound of the axes . His own purposed offer of help would depreciate if two hirelings were already employed , and the hirelings would not be pleased by it . But he found Peter Graves ' helpers were two young men with motives as high perhaps as his own : Nathan Grant and Dick Mickings . Easter had liked these boys before they had raced him in the hoe-gang for Dilsie 's favor . Since then he had marvelled at the faults with which they suddenly bristled . Nathan was plump and aggressive , and biggity . Dick smiled to himself all the time , like a ' possum , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work in the timber before he himself was seen and he came within an ace of turning back . His feet , more than his volition , carried him toward them . " Hello , East , " called Dick Mickings . " Good mawnin ' , Easter , " said Peter Graves . " Whut you doin ' ovah dis way ? " Nathan Grant asked , pleasantly enough , but with point that stung Easter to the quick . " / come ovah to he'p Mistuh Peter  --  same as you . " " He got he'p enough , " said Nathan eyeing the slight-built Easter Tess pleasantly . " Dat fo ' him to say . " Easter knew Nathan could lick him , but he would hold his ground . " We all done done ' nuff to earn a cold drink ob water , " said Peter Graves . " YouaIl come up to de house . " The three young men shouldered their axes and followed their host to the pump . " Diisle ! " called Peter . " Bring us out de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued conversationally , " done made my turnip groun ' just right to turn , but heah I is : Mistuh Keatts a-callin ' fo ' boards . Mistuh Mitchell a-callin ' fo ' two hundred posties , an ' ? " Here Aunt Minnie came out with the dipper . " Mawnin ' , Easter . Boy , you got no business ovah heah wid no ax . You been sick . " " I 's well now , Mis ' Minnie . " " Dat 's meld ) , whut I tole ' im , " said Nathan Grant . " A man whut is too light fo ' timber work when he is well ai n't got to be tryin ' it when he under de weather . " " You is been sick , " Peter Graves turned his kind old eyes on Easter . " I ai n't gwinna have you swingin ' no ax . " Easter protested , begged , became nearly eloquent . Peter and Minnie were too much for him . Finally Peter said , " Ellen you is bleedged to he'p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovah my turnip lan ' . " Easter preferred any field work to timbering , but under the circumstances this was defeat ; bitterly he hitched Peter 's team to the twelve-inch turnplow . Peter and his volunteer woodsmen prepared to return to their work . Minnie Graves stood on the gallery , the gourd dipper in her hand . " Easter , boy , " she called . " I'Il send Dilsie down wid some fresh water fo ' noon . " The turnip patch was stumpy , half subdued new ground , but Easter never knew the day when plowing was not fun to him . Now , besides this work-day satisfaction in it , he could hope for Dilsie 's coming . But hours went by and she did n't come . Finally he was sure she would n't , and he spoke sharply to the astonished mules . Easter stopped his team , swung them left in a right-angIe turn , and started the new furrow . This brought him facing toward the house , which was invisible behind an angle of a dense thicket of second-A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slowed up ; Easter followed their gaze , knowing a mule is harder to surprise than a watch dog . " Whoa ! " said he , and he stopped without knowing why . A moment later Dilsie came into view round the thicket . She wore a sunbonnet and dress of crisp blue , and she had a tin bucket in her hand . " Do n't you walk ' cross de plowed groun ' , " Easter called to her . " I 'll come git it . " He tied the lines to the plow handle , and stalked across his furrows toward Dilsie . " I ai n't scairt of her no Imo ' , " he thought . " Did n't I call out loud , and tell her not to walk in de plow dirt ? " " H 'm , " said Double-Actin ' . " Dat wuz jes ' part of yo ' plowin ' sense . Effen you ai n't scairt , how come yo ' heart pat-tin ' juber ? " Easter took the tin bucket from Dilsie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You jes ' keep de bucket , " said Dilsie , beginning to go away . " Effen you do n't mind you kin bring it up at noon . " " Dis groun ' turns good  --  after de rain , " muttered Easter . " It sho ' do , " Dilsie neither stopped nor continued her flight . She merely half turned , pausing like a swamp blackbird alighting on a swaying willow , wings still a-flutter . Easter 's craven tongue found no further words . He watched the blue figure recede across the clearing . When it vanished behind the thicket Easter uttered an impatient oath and dashed the untasted water to the ground . Through that summer and fall Peter Graves had no labor problem . Five or six stalwart young men placed their spare time at his command . Of these Nathan Grant , Dick Mickings , and Easter were most constant . And with the tactlessness of their kind , the old couple showed their strong partiality for Easter . The rivals must have felt it , since it was meant to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . Easter sensed it , even through the wistful panics and jealousies of his condition . He could turn the ad-vantage to no use . He worked the harder with plow , hoe , and cottonsack , winning golden opinions from the old folks , while bolder blades found the opportunities for laughing words with Dilsie which he was too fearful to engineer . And along another march circumstances built a wall against him : none of his serious rivals lived on Mr. Henry 's plantation . If he had been thrown with them anywhere but at the Graves ' clearing , Nathan 's biggitiness , Dick 's ' possum grin would have bred trouble , from which , since he had the lasting rage of a man of slow anger , Easter would have emerged perhaps badly beaten , but with his emotions unshackled . Not even this doubtful solution was possible . The boys , for all they thought of one another , were average good field boys . They were not bloodthirsty enough to seek out one another for a quarrel , and they met only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own work , and managed to help Peter Graves lay in wood , pick cotton , and pull corn . There were beautiful days when no other suitor was there  --  when Dilsie , her parents , and Easter were snug round the table at noontime . Peter Graves even let Easter build up the fire ; and any man who relinquishes that function in his own home expresses complete confidence in the one to whom he grants the privilege . Easter could n't think of any person in the whole world whom he would want tampering with his own fire ; not even Dilsie . God made men to build fires , and He made women to put them out . Those winter days were good days , and the clearing became home to Easter ; but he got no mastery over the panic that sparkled through his soul when he and Dilsic were alone together ; and in so far as he knew , he drew no step nearer to her . April came , and there was no change , and Easter was gaunt and lean-faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees fun-leafed , the bottoms full of water and roaring with Iife . It seemed to Easter that folks meeting him on the road grinned a Dick Mickings grin at him . But he could n't help it ; he had lived so long with his cowardice now that he knew which was master . if Dilsie had once made him angry , slighted him , or showed marked favor for a rival , the proper mechanism within Easter might have clicked ; but the girl minded her own business and dealt with her suitors with appalling equity . One day in mid-May he met Annie C. in the big road . Neither of them smiled . Annie spoke first . " East , you gwinna wan na take me to de dance week atter next ? " " Whut dance ? " " You knows . Dey is givin ' a frolic at de Tom Brown schoolhouse Thursday atter dis nex ' one comin ' . " " Gal , I 's workin ' so hard ? " " I knows whut you workin at . Dat ai n't none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fo ' dis frolic ? " " Den go ahaid on ! Who 's a-stoppin ' you ? " " Ai n't nobody , " said Annie musingly . " East , you ai n't got much sense , but I sho ' is liked you , boy , you long , rusty , no ' count blacksnake ! " " Who is no ' count , gal ? " " I 's done said . " Annie had to smile . She could go just so long without it . " Now git on . You 'll see me at de Tom Brown schoolhouse wid some lowdown mink whut ai n't no better dan you is . An ' me , I 'll see you a-buggin ' yo ' eyes at Nathan Grant a-dancin ' wid Dilsie Graves . " " Dilsie do n't dance ! She in de chu'ch . " " Well , git on down de road . " Annie smiled mysteriously and walked away . " You know how Iong it 's been gone since you been to see me , East ? " " Two-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , East . Ellen you wuz a ol ' sow , you could a-done drapped two litters ob pigs in dat time ! " Screaming with laughter , Annie C. swung away . Easter felt down in himself the full gallantry of her ; but there was nothing he could do about it . In five minutes he was absorbed in her news of the party , and had forgotten Annie . Would Dilsie go ? Would her ma and pa let her go ? Could he find courage to ask her to go with him ? He sidestepped that last by a craven inspiration : he would not ask Dilsie to go with him ; he would ask her parents , of whom he had no fear at all . Whether he could have carried through even that anaemic campaign was in doubt until he met Elsie Lewis in the big road . He would have grumbled a greeting and trudged on , but Elsie stopped him peremptorily . " Iiihar you gwine  --  shovin ' along de road wid yo ' head down , like a sow in heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jes ' down to George 's . " " Nowhar . You is right ! East , I could n't believe it till I seed you . Now I knows you is even a bigger fool dan dey says . " Elsie 's lean face was kind . She tilted back her head and looked steadily at Easter with her one eye . " East , " she said briskly , " I ai n't whut I wuz once , but I knows wimmins . Now listen at me : you standin ' off , an ' you standin ' on . But a woman want to be stood on all de time . You is he'pin ' her paw , an you 's he'pin ' her maw . But whut you doin " bout Dilsie her own self ? Git busy , boy ! Work like a red sow rustlin ' overcup acorns in deep leaves ! . . . How is crops up dis way ? " They exchanged the universal shoptalk of earth . When they parted Elsie called , " Do n't forgit whut I done tole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door-block . The two men walked to the rear to look at the frame of seed sweet potatoes George had bedded . " I ai n't bedded me out none , " said Easter . " I 'll have to buy me some slips , ' gin time to set ' em out . " " You knows you can git all de slips you needs heah . You been busy crossin ' de bottoms , " laughed George . " Ev'ybody I secs dey got to talk ' bout dat same or subject . " " Well , do n't git mad at me , East . Git mad at yo ' self . East , is dese damn blacks like Nathan an Dick makin ' you stan ' back ? You scairt  --  or is dat gal done tamed you ? " It takes a man to lay a man 's wound wide to the beginnings of healing . " She done tamed me , George . I ca n't lay a finger on her . I done lost my rabbit-foot on Dilsie . All I kin do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you ai n't et since sunup . My belly 's weak right across de middle  --  jes ' de same way . " " East , " said George , " you is ridin ' fo ' yourself a fall effen you do n't make ' ase . Too many good mens is around atter dat gal . She sho ' a fine ' un too . But East , ' tai n't but one way to git any of ' ern . You got to go atter ' em like guttin ' a dawg . " That night Easter recalled Elsie 's and George 's words with the wholesome resentment recipients of good advice should feel . One thing , " he was near bitterness as he crawled into bed , " dey is sho ' plenty folks to tell you whut to do in dis yearth . An ' plenty misery . " He believed that summed up and dismissed these two encounters . But back in his rational years he had regarded Elsie and George as experts . Doubtless what they had said worked deep down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard enough to pump his courage up to the point of asking Dilsie to go to the frolic with him . He put that request to Minnie and Peter . Peter promptly sidestepped , leaving the decision with Minnie . " Dilsie wants to go , " said Minnie ; " an ' two-three done axed her . I did n't want any gal of mine traipsin ' round wid jes anybody . But I do want her to have her pleasure . You wo n't make her dance , will you , East ? " " No ma 'm ! I sho ' wo n't . " He meant it . " Den you kin take her . " The horrible swiftness , the dazzling sweet torture of the days and nights which followed ! Finally the revolving earth turned up that particular Thursday morning , dealt out a day of May with soft clouds and slow wind , folded the clouds and put them away at sunset , and then  --  night . When they set out together through the young night and entered the path which tunnelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the gleam from the open cabin door , and it turned him weak ; he longed to run back there , to seek the peace of which that light and Minnie 's blurred figure were symbols . But life had him by the hind leg . He walked silently beside the silent girl , too afraid of the inexorable events which lay coiled in the hours ahead . Then , in crossing a footlog , he took her by the hand  --  for the first time ; and the stark business that had laid so heavy upon Easter broke up , leavened with light . But his warmed and glowing panic was still panic , and when he spoke to Dilsie his voice was oppressed . " Dem stars is a-winkin ' like mo ' rain . " " Sho ' is . An ' we do n't need none , does we ? " " Sho ' do n't . We needs choppin ' weather . " " Mr. Henry hirin ' any choppin ' ? " " He ai n't dis last past week . " Easter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They came to the next footlog , and the recurrent thrill of touching Dilsie 's hand swept Easter to new boldness . " We been choppin ' de lower field . It 's so fur a man ca n't go home at noon to cook himse'f suthin ' t'eat . " " Does you fix up a bucket at breakfus time ? " Dilsie 's own voice was stronger ; here was her province . " Naw . When my belly 's full of breakfus seem like I ca n't bother my haid ' bout lunch  --  wid it so fur off . " " Umph . Dat jes ' like a man ! " murmured Dilsie , and then her lips seemed to freeze at her own boldness , her panic swept through herself to Easter , and they walked on in silence . Without words and with no contact Easter knew , with swelling heart , that Dilsie loved him ; it made a white light of the gloom under the trees to know it ; but the surging lift of this realization brought with it new fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure the thin , strong barrier that held them apart would dissolve . But he could no more raise his two arms and put them about this girl than he could have plucked up one of the trees that made a leaky roof against the sprinkle of May stars . Each time their hands touched , whenever they were close together in the narrow path , Easter felt a warm , triumphant flood rise up inside him . And when it rose , and receded and came again , it came stronger and higher . When its heartening current flooded over , beyond his control , he could take this girl ? this woman Dilsie  --  in his arms ; but not before then . Shakily his mind compounded his vigorous strength , her slenderness , and the lonely dark into a compelling reason , a divine compulsion ; but reason and experience were no helps for him with a woman like Dilsie . The rising of the tide inside him was his only hope , and it receded after each intoxicating surge . They had traversed the woods ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wide fields about . Easter knew every step of the way as well as he knew the gear for his own mule , but to-night it was like walking out into a world remembered from a dream . He lifted his face to the night sky and got strength . Now he knew that the next wave of courage would sweep him out of his shackles . He wanted to sing his triumph as he walked , and he drew close to Dilsie in the path ; and she seemed to shrink away , without actually moving off  --  while leaning closer . They turned the angle of a dense thicket . Laughter floated through the warm air . A dim light glowed ahead . They had come to the Tom Brown schoolhouse . It stood at the edge of the fields . It had only one room , with windows three to a side . There were two kerosene ceiling lamps , but only the one farthest from the door was lighted . The rough school benches were lined up along the walls ; the tiny rostrum had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revellers could buy hard candies at ten cents a pound , a plate or sandwich of barbecued pork , coffee hot but tenuous , and lemonade mixed in a wooden tub . Easter and Dilsie were early , and with others they sat uneasily on the benches , waiting until numbers gave them courage to be gay . In the field , at work , that faculty never failed them . Stalking fun purposefully , focusing gayety in time and space , and going at it like laying rails require more practice than they could ever acquire . For that reason parties were oftener matters of excitement , hilarity , and brawl , than events of carefree pleasure . But sitting here in the dim schoolhouse , Easter could not imagine any event more exhilarating . His eyes shone ; he felt his lips stiff with involuntary smiling . He felt as though he had taken three fingers of whiskey . Later , when others had arrived and noise had warmed them , when they had begun to stamp and clap rhythmically , and the more sinful felt their feet tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind them , towering above the crowd , was Nathan Grant . The clapping and stamping settled into an even , compelling roar . Now and then a woman 's voice keened an excited " E-e-e-e Yahl E-e-e-e Yahl " in time to the jungle beat of it . It was not gay  --  it was as deadly solemn as lust itself . " Lemme at dat Ho ' ! " yelled Hezekiah . They pressed back , walling an oval opening with their heated bodies , and in this space Hezekiah capered . John Mack followed , then George , Nathan , and half a dozen others . Only sinners will dance , and this being a respectable party no women joined in ; but the boldest of them clapped and stamped , and when the rhythm drummed irresistible compulsion , they shouted an excited accompaniment to the clapping . The first mechanical austerities of the dance flowed off and into the grace of primitive abandon . They leaped and whirled , they shuffled and swayed , they wiggled out the full repertory of sound , earthy obscenities , interpreting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cypresses of Mylitta 's groves and the spotted canvas of revival tents . Easter did not dance ; he was too clumsy , and to-night he would have been too self-conscious . He clapped and stamped with glowing eyes . Sweat stood on his forehead . The women shrieked their high-pitched triple " E-e-e-e Yah I " and the schoolhouse quivered . Ziek Bell suddenly struck the bottom of a dishpan with his huge iron spoon . " Time t'eat ! Time t'eat ! " he bawled . The dancers stood , the clapping died a fluttering death like the stopping of a furious machine , the crowd broke , and the first gay shouts and genuine laughter of the evening swept through it . Ziek Bell 's hospitality was mercenary but hearty . Opulent couples crowded up to his table . Thoughtful men fingered through their jumper pockets under the intent , encouraging smiles of their women-folk . Easter led Dilsie to Ziek Bell 's table as soon as he had located the errant six bits among his pockets . Dilsie would have taken only coffee , but Easter pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bag of hard candy for them to eat on the way home . The other women greeted Dilsie pleasantly  --  until their men began offering to buy things for her . " I 's buyin ' fo ' Dilsie , " Easter stated boldly , and they desisted . The code was simple and plain . But this was a challenge Easter 's rivals could not ignore completely . " I b'lieves I 'll take Dilsie home my ownself , " said Nathan Grant genially . " I kin jes ' tuck her under one arm an ' East under de yuther . " " You ca n't make no crop wid one arm , " retorted John Mack loyally ; " an ' you 'd be sho ' to git one of ' em gnawed off . " When the laughter cased up , Dick Mickings said , smiling his dead ' possum smile , " Whut ellen Brother Nathan an ' me double-teams , an ' bofe takes her home ? Would he gnaw us bofe , Brother Johnnie ? " " Nawl East is got good toofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The crowd howled , Nathan and Dick with the rest . They were fairly routed ; they knew , besides , that Easter was fully backed by his friends and by the approval of Dilsie 's parents . " Tell you whut us kin do ! " cried George Mack . " All de mens heah kin make a congregation an ' walk home wid Dilsie an ' East  --  t'keep de snakes off . " " Shor they shouted , and John added good naturedly , " East he kinda timid anyhow . " " It ai n't only snakes he 's scairt of  --  round wimmins , " laughed Hezekiah Jones . Easter 's lips rolled out and his eyes blazed . The jest had been harmless in the hands of his two rivals . It was rapidly becoming fatal now that his friends had taken it up : there were so many of them . " Hot dawgl Dats de thing ! " said Hezekiah . " East ca n't do nuthin ' wid all of us ! " As the effects registered on Easter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain more fully the perfections of the scheme . " Ellen jes some of us tries it , East mout kill us dead . But effen all of us ? " They cut him short with shouts of acquiescence . The party had focus now , and a butt whom everyone liked and nobody feared . The ring formed again , the dance thundered into full fury . But now it was lightsome . The dancers would shout , " Who gwinna take her home , Lawd , who gwinna take her home ? " And the triple response came spontaneously , shouted to the accompaniment of redoubled clapping and stamping : " / isl I is ! I is ! " Easter looked at Dilsie . She was frightened and she tried to smile back at him . Suddenly a red wave inside Easter rose up behind his eyeballs , and he turned and plowed his way to the door . The old Tom Brown house , which had stood a hundred yards from the school , had been destroyed by fire years before . Easter knew he could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weedy ruins like a serpent for its hole . Where the old blacksmith had stood he saw the spread fingers of a ruined wagon wheel . The tire and felloe were gone . He laid hold of one of the spokes and wrenched it from its mortise in the hub . The spoke was sound oak , twenty inches long , tapered , and had the perfect balance of a war mace . It could crack a man 's skull like a walnut , but it was as handy as a rapier . Without haste , because the full flavor of his dish of martyrdom lay before him with no check and hindrance of sanity , Easter turned and stalked back toward the lighted door . " Whut you up to , East ? " demanded a voice at his shoulder . " Watch an ' see . " " Wait , East ! " Easter had not even recognized George Mack . " I ai n't waitin ' ! " " Stop , you dam ' took  --  listen ! I wants t'help you . " " Do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuthin ! Some of dem boys is got guns on ' em . " " I 'll gun ' em ! " George sprang from behind and pinned Easter 's arms to his sides . " I wants to he'p you , you mule-headed fool ! Listen ? " They wrestled , and despite George 's advantage of hold and greater strength , Easter 's madness would have prevailed if George had not pleaded and cursed . " I wants to he'p ! Listen , East : I knows how we kin do id " " Talk in a hurry den . " Easter rested panting . George did not relax his grip . " East , effen you starts a rookus dey'lI lay you out ? " " I do n't care ! " " ? an ' effen dey do n't , somebody 'll pull a knife or a gun ? " " I do n't care ! " " You will care  --  wid a bullet in yo ' guts ! Lemme tell you whut us kin do ? " " I ai n't gwinna leave . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ! But listen at me lust . " " Talk fast , George . " " I 's got my gun on me . You stan ' by de do ' . I 'll shoot out de light through one of dem back windows . Dese damn blacks 'll run . I knows ' eml Dey 'll run . You Stan ' at de do ' . ' Tai n't but one do ' , an ' de windows is nailed shut . When dey comes out ? " " Come on ! " " Wait ! " George released Easter now , sure of him . " Be sho ' you lays yo ' mark on all de men  --  not ' scusin ' Nathan an ' Dick . " " Come on ! " " Wait , fool ! Now listen at me , good : Effen you jes ' scares a nigger or jes ' lashes him , he mout bust you from behin ' a bush some day . But effen you makes yo ' mark on him wid suthin ' like a wagon-spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de do ' . Do n't show yourself till dey starts out . Dey 'll run ! I knows dese damn blacks . " George vanished and Easter moved to the door . He spat generously into his palm and sunk his fingers into the wagon-spoke . Almost at once George fired through the rear window nearest the lamp , and the party exploded with the noise and velocity of shrapnel . It took the third shot to fetch the lamp , and bring it crashing down . By that time the door was vomiting a screaming tangle of bodies , and Easter 's right arm rose and fell with mechanical regularity . Now and again he recognized a friend or a woman in the struggling mass , and tried to hold his hand with an effort that nearly stood him on his head . Mercy was impossible ; too many got by unmarked . He abandoned discrimination and went to work with grim thoroughness . Even when the frame of the glutted door fell down among them he missed no lick , and the clear crack of oak on skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heaped up . Those inside dived over the rampart of bodies . While fresh victims still fell , some of the first revived enough to stagger up , and these followed the impulse to run which had been interrupted by Easter 's wagon spoke . When the supply slackened , George 's pistol roared again , and stragglers who had huddled inside plunged out , often cheating Easter by tripping on the wrecked doorframe and stunning themselves on the ground . Finally after a quick eternity of bliss Easter found no fugitives under his club . The last of the fallen had made off . George 's pistol shots could evict no more . Only the shrieks of the women responded . They had not run with the men . Easter could see them in his mind 's eye : a pile of them , hugging one another , burrowing under one another 's bodies , kicking and scratching to crawl under , to put bodies between their own bodies and the terror  --  like a clot of lively fishing worms in a tin can . George came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' git her . " Easter snatched the matches . He was already going in . He dropped the wagon-spoke and cupped his hands round a lighted match . The women had crammed themselves under benches and in corners . A dozen were stuffed like tattered , shameless rag-dolls under the teacher 's table on the little rostrum . Their struggles had spilled Zick Bell 's edibles over the floor . Wild eyes caught the gleam of Easter 's match . " I wants Dilsiel " Easter called . His match flared and died , and while he lighted another he wondered how he could ever have been afraid of that girl . " Dilsiel " he called , and the next match blazed up . " I 's comin ' , " she quavered . Easter blew out his match . He did not wish to see her untangle herself from the mass of frightened flesh . He walked to the door and stood just outside in the starlight . When the girl came out to him he curved his right arm round her shoulders and led her through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . " My first wife , " said Easter , " lemme go hongry in de field . Whut you think of a woman like dat ? " " She ai n't hardly no woman  --  she jes ' a mess ! " " Effen a man make de money an ' bring home de rations of a Sadday , he got a right to find cooked grub in de house , come time t'eat . " " He sho ' is . " " An ' ? Dilsie , " Easter made the name precious in the saying , " I wants me some chullens . " " Do n't  --  do n't evybody want ' em , Eas-ter ? " It was enough now to walk under the trees side by side . When they came to the edge of the Graves ' clearing , Easter drew Dilsie off the path toward a new , clean log . " Not on it ! " he breathed when , half hesitating , she sat down upon it . " We kin sit on de groun ' an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew her down beside him on the short grass , which was cool with dew . The stars had steadied to the unshaken stair of deep night , and quiet lay on the wide bottom-lands . A cock crowed , and the sound came to them as strained silver through the miles of sweet air . " Don'ti  --  not t'night , Easter ! " Dilsie murmured , but she clung the closer as his arms , suddenly harsh and hurried with his long hunger for her , bent her down .
