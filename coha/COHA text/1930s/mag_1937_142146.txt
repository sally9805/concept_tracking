ARMY &; NAVY <P> The waters of the Pacific rolled blue and calm one day last week as a gunner aboard the U. S. S. Wyoming , engaged in war games off San Clemente Island , took his ramrod to seat a shell in the breech of a 5-in. gun which was participating in a barrage to cover a landing party of Marines . The gunner 's thrust was his last . As he shoved home the shell , up with a roar went the breech in a great red flare of flame and blood against the blue . " I saw one boy sort of drift past me , " recounted a survivor , " floating through the air , half of his head shot off , and land on the deck . It was awful . " <P> Apparently the fuse cap on the shell 's nose , which detonates it when it strikes its target , had exploded prematurely . When the smoke cleared , the captain and three members of the Marine gun crew were dead , three others lay dying , ten were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a training ship since the London Naval Armament Limitation Conference of 1930 , is the Navy 's second oldest battleship . A court of inquiry promptly met to investigate the Navy 's second fatal explosion on the San Clemente training grounds within seven months . The Navy 's most disastrous explosion along the Pacific Coast was off San Pedro 13 years ago when a blast aboard the U. S. S. Mississippi killed 48.
