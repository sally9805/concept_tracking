In Urbana last week , University of Illinois ' Psychology Professor Paul Thomas Young , who had solemnly been keeping track of undergraduates ' laughter and tears , produced these statistics : People laugh 400 times as often as they cry ; collegians laugh more than 20 times a day . Women laugh less than men and weep three times as frequently . Four times out of five tears are caused by the environment ; social contacts are responsible for 98% of laughs .
