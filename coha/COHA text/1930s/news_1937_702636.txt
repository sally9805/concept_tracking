YOUNGSTOWN , Ohio , June 2 . ? After two Republic Steel Corporation airplanes crashed today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop food into the Niles plant enclosure because a sniper 's bullet had severed a strut over the head of a pilot . The crashes occurred inside the Warren plant , fifteen miles from this city , where a regular schedule of food deliveries began today . At Niles , which is between this city and Warren , the food has been dropped from the airplanes which swoop down close to the marked field , but they have been the target of snipers for several days . Charles H. Elliott , operating vice president of the Republic Steel Corporation , called at the office of Sheriff Roy Hardman of Trumbull County , in Warren today , but the Sheriff was away beating the bushes in the vicinity of Niles to locate the snipers . To Deputy Sheriff Al Weaver , Mr. Elliott protested against the snipers ' attacks and demanded that the Sheriff furnish protection for food ? trucks which would begin making deliveries at Niles tomorrow . Mr. Elliott insisted that if the county authorities did not furnish guards to protect the food deliveries by truck the company would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers in the Niles plant , a relatively small one compared to the large plant at Warren which normally houses 6,000 employes . The deputy sheriff to whom Mr. Elliott made his request did- not give a direct answer , and said he would take the matter up with his chief . After the conference two deputies were assi- ned to watch for snipers in the vichiity of the Warren plant . No further sniping was reported late this afternoon . Company officials said that Republic , which never owned an airplane before , now has ten planes for its food delivery service . These ships have been commuting from a " secret " taking-off point to Warren , land with several hundred pounds of bread , condensed milk , bacon , ham , macaroni and vegetables , and then take off on fairly regular schedules . The Niles food dropping service was discontinued , according to Mr. Elliott , because four bullets struck on. ; of the planes . One plane landing at Warren struck a pile of lumber , bounded into the air , sideswiped a box car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot was shaken but it was reported that he was not seriously injured .. A " back-to-work " movement was started today when two independent associations , formerly company unions , in adjacent offices in a local bank building began taking signatures to petitions which stated that the signers wished to return to work at the ' earliest possible date , " provided that proper protection is guaranteed us on our way to and from work . " Several hundred employes of the two companies visited the offices which were picketed for several hours by Steel Workers Organization Committee members who were later ordered away by the police . Attacks Independent Union An assertion that the back-towork movement of " the so-called Independent Society of Workers of the Campbell plant of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company " is company-inspired was made by John Mayo , sub-regional director for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee , in a statement tonight . " The so-called Independent Society of Workers is a company union by another name , " said Mr. Mayo . " They spring up for a week or two as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still want to retain their petty graft from the company for serving in such capacities . " This group asks a series of trick questions , all of which were answered a week ago by the action of the steel workers themselves in going on strike for a signed contract , the same kind of contract signed by 157 companies and covering 380,000 steel workers . " The steel workers of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube , . and Republic Steel , are entitled by law to a signed contract . It was the refusal on the part of company management to give their wor men what they were entitled to , a , signed contract , that brougblpidgiolt strike . vid J. " Company management is thcgplY responsible for the strike . ** obvious because if the emplams 8 Youngstown Sheet and Tube were working for United States Steel Jones &; Laughlin or WheelirM Steel , or any one of 157 steel companies they would not be on stialat , In those mills managementrikess signed a union contract . ferenc " Of course , the steel workpreraill Youngstown want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signed contract . Mr. graft% Purnell and Mr. Tom Girdlestmee bring the strike to an end tozwe row by doing what their woe want them to do and whT presidents of 157 other stee panies have done , sign a co " There is no other issue present strike . The steel w of Youngstown know wha want and no company-in ' group like the Independent of Workers or the Independe eration of Republic Employes is going to sway them from getting it . " Confer on Rail Movements Union officials attended a meeting with the general chairmen of the labor brotherhoods of the five railroads entering this area and discussed the cooperation of all sides in the handling of freight-car shipments into and out of the strike-bound freight yards of the Republic and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company plants . No arrangement was made and the meeting will be continued tomorrow , upon the arrival of Philip Murray , chairman of the S. W. 0 . C. , for an important conference . Organizers will be here from Cleveland , Buffalo , Canton , Warren , Niles . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Republic Company announced that it would not be able to pay off its men on June 8 in the Youngstown , Warren and Niles plants because the pickets prevented the payroll clerks from entering and computing the pay due to the men . The Youngstown Sheet and Tube will pay its men tomorrow and Friday . With the public announcement that employes would be invited to signify their desire to return to work , the strike , opening its second week , entered into another phase today . The picket lines were manned-by grim , determined men , who told inquirers they were prepared for a long siege if necessary . Having missed a week 's pay , the non-strikers are anxious to get back to their jobs . Both sides claim the overwhelming support of the majority of the workers . The question of an election to determine the bargaining representatives of the majority of employes is a moot one in this section . Neither the union nor the companies are interested in an election . The company officials say that if the National Labor Relations Board ordered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not sign a written agreement if the union won a majority . They salt that they can not be made to sign an agreement . Union officials insist with equal emphasis that nothing but a signed agreement will satisfy their members . Affiliates of the C. I. 0 . will send speakers to address the strikers . Among these will be Sherman Dalrymple , president of the United Rubber Workers of America ; Homer Martin , president of the United Automobile Workers of America ; P. T.
