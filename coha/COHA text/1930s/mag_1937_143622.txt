In January 1935 Marshall Field &; Co. had the largest drygoods business in the world , the largest building in the world ( Chicago 's Merchandise Mart for trade exhibitions ) , the second biggest department store in the world and one of the biggest drygoods wholesale businesses in the U. S. It also had a reputation sacrosanct in Chicago and gilt-edged the world around . Nonetheless , in the previous four years it had lost $13,200,000 and the directors were so worried that they hired a business analyst named James O. Mc-Kinsey to study the matter . Hulking , robust J. O. McKinsey was born a poor boy , became a professor , had never held a corporate job . But when he made his report after four months work , the directors were so impressed that they took a step drastic in any business and completely unprecedented in Field 's 70-year-history of rooted conservatism-they made J. O. McKinsey chairman of the board and absolute dictator of company policy ( TIME , Oct. 21 , 1935 ) . <P> In the two years since then , Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . It is once more substantially in the black . But the process involved as ruthless a purge as anyone short of Stalin has ever produced and Field 's employes have found their jobs both less serene and less secure . Last week , however , it appeared that the quiet days of yore have returned . For after the sudden death of Chairman McKinsey , Marshall Field directors decided not to appoint another rude outsider as chairman but to return to the time when the company was run by a man who " knew how to wrap a package . " <P> That man is to be dapper , 55-year-old Frederick Dexter Corley , who began as a Field 's stockboy 37 years ago , rose in the best Field 's tradition to be president last year . As long as James McKinsey was chairman the presidency was an empty job . Now it is to resume its onetime importance . While President Corley last week pondered his future policies , certain hitherto unpublished details of the McKinsey management came to light . <P> It has long been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1932 , that what had dragged the company deeply into the red was its huge wholesale business . Chairman McKinsey 's first reform was to lop off the wholesale business entirely , along with 1,600 employes . This was an eminently smart move , as was also his reorganization of Chicago 's Merchandise Mart , each of whose first 19 floors contains six acres of floor space . The Mart has still to make money but McKinsey management rented <P> 87% of it , and it may soon show a profit as a Field investment . <P> Where McKinsey met something less than complete success vas in his handling of Marshall Field 's manufacturing division of 24 textile mills . These he consolidated into one closely-co-ordinated unit , reducing the number of products to 18 , all sold under the brand name Fieldcrest . Moving the manufacturing division to Manhattan , he marked out a program for it and commanded , in effect , " Now , boys , go ahead and do n't ask me for money . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
