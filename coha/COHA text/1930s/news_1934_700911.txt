txt Will Rogers Discusses The Transpacific Flights To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. , Dec. 5 . ? Having lunch in the studio caf ? Tuesday with Sir KingsfordSmith , the great Australian aviator . He was called to the phone . He come back and said , " They have missed the Hawaiian Islands and are down . That 's too bad . " Then he told how important navigation was , especially over the ocean . He paid great tribute to the American that took him to Australia and the Australian that brought him over this time . Gatty is a great navigator ; Lindbergh.and Post are a couple of the best pilot-navigators . Thousands can fly , but few can find a speck in the ocean . You got to be on intimate terms with astronomy . Never mind the carburetors or the feed line or the R. P. M. It 's old man sun , moon and stars that you want to be on speaking terms with . Yours , WILL ROGERS .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
