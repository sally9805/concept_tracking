CHAPTERS FOR THE ORTHODOX-Don Marquis-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . Last week , as usual since the world began , plain readers were more inclined to listen to the sweet unreason of kindly old fellows like Will Rogers and Don Marquis than to the expert kidding of more incisive minds . <P> For Don Marquis has endeared himself to the U. S. by padding his critical punches ; his fiercest uppercuts are the merest invigorating taps on a cheerfully welcoming chin . Many a critical reader of Chapters for the Orthodox will get no farther than Author Marquis 's prefacing remarks , in which he dedicates his book to wambling Christopher Morley ( because " I think you write better than anyone else writing in the English-speaking world today " ) . Less captious searchers will find something to hit their fancy in the twelve rambling tales that follow . Some of them : <P> Jehovah unsuccessfully offers to an aristocratic Manhattan spinster the honor of giving virgin birth to another Messiah . <P> Satan attends morning service at a fashionable church with a tycoon who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable behavior . <P> All the characters involved in the New Testament miracle of the devils and the Gadarene swine meet in court to establish the costs of the action . <P> An open-minded artist becomes the embarrassed recipient of the power to work miracles . <P> The legend of Faust is brought up to date and dramatized in Marquisian manner . Sample : " Faust : Is not a Good Woman one of the noblest works of God ? Mephisto : It is more terrible than that , even : God is one of the subtlest inventions of the Good Woman . "
