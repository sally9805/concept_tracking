Like National Broadcasting Co. in the U. S. , England 's British Broadcasting Corp . was started by radio manufacturers to give set owners something to listen to . B. B. C. founders in 1922 were the " wireless " firms of Marconi , Radio Communication Co. , Metropolitan Vickers , British Thomson-Houston Co. , General Electric and Western Electric . Four years later this private monopoly was given a ten-year royal charter , made a public institution somewhere between a Government Department and a commercial undertaking , independent in its daily doings but under the ultimate control of His Majesty 's Government . <P> Though it gets no air advertising revenue , B. B. C. has not fared badly . On its share of license fees paid by set owners it has erected its own building , entered the publishing business with three profitable weekly papers . Last week , with its charter essentially unchanged and renewed for another ten years , B. B. C. entered its second decade , a British institution apparently as solidly established as Big Ben , whose booming it uses for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-protected bureaucracy since its inception has been a shambling , pugnacious , 6-ft. 4-in . Scot named John Charles Walsham Reith . Knighted in 1927 , Sir John is monarch of all he surveys in Broadcasting House , the big white B. B. C. building which dominates Portland Place and , in the interests of acoustics , is sealed like a tomb and ventilated like a submarine . So obnoxious to many of B. B. C. 's 3,000 employes was the " Army " atmosphere of Broadcasting House ( e. g. , B. B. C.-ers were fired when they got divorced ) , that the Government stepped in and mildly recommended in renewing the charter that " the staff should be free from any control by the Corporation over their private lives . " Another standing complaint against B. B. C. is the dullness of its Sunday fare . At the Government 's suggestion , Sir John promised to seek " a better balance and a more attractive layout of the Sunday programs . " <P> To U. S. listeners , most of B. B. C. 's offerings seem dull stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its schedule . The Corporation pays ordinary performers poorly but will go as high as $2,500 for a broadcast by someone like Maurice Chevalier . Best thing done by B. B. C. is the production of radio drama . News bulletins are supplied by Reuter , Exchange Telegraph Co. , Press Association and Central News . When B. B. C. got a scoop on the announcement of the Duke of Gloucester 's engagement ( TIME , Nov. 11 ) . the Press yowled so loudly that everyone concerned agreed that such a thing should never happen again .
