txt Sergei M. Kiroff , one of Joseph Stalin 's principal lieutenants , who was shot down yesterday in Leningrad , was slain by a Russian , it was revealed tonight . The murderer is Leonid Vasilievich Nikolaev , 30 years old , a former employe of the Leningrad Workers and Peasants Inspection Service . This service , whose function was to check laxity in industry and agriculture , was abolished nearly a year ago and its duties were taken over by the newly created Soviet Control Commission . Nikolaev lay in wait for M. Kiroff in the corridor of the rambling old building which was an institute for noble young ladies before it became Lenin 's revolutionary headquarters . The young man shot his victim as he came from a meeting held in connection with the Soviet elections now going on . These are all the facts which have been permitted to filter through the screen behind which the most intense police investigation in years is now being carried on under the personal direction of high officials of the new Commissariat of Internal Affairs , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accomplices , whether his action was political or inspired simply by a personal grievance , real or fancied , was still undisclosed late tonight . In the Soviet press , which reflects the government and party opinion , there are repeated charges that Nikolaev is a " class enemy " and a " hired assassin , " but without any intimation of who might have hired him . Nicolay Bukharin in Izvestia , the government organ , linked yesterday 's crime to the old White Guard and " spies of capital , ' heroes ' who shoot from ambush . " " Enemies still creep into the camp of the revolution to try to silence the roar of history with one little shot , " says Izvestia . As to what effect the assassina- tion will have on the regime which I recently signalized its growing liberalism by reorganizing the Ogpu , one can only surmise . It is expected here that an even closer guard now will be kept for the safety of Soviet leaders . " This unprecedented crime will undoubtedly bring the masses to their feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Izvestia editorially . " This act of our enemies will have one result , the swift destruction of the foe . " Klementi E. Voroshiloff , Defense Commissar , and other military leaders , in eulogy of their slain comrade , said the Red Army would answer the treacherous shot " with further strengthening of its militant strength and closer rallying of its ranks around the Communist party and its leader , Stalin . " A stunned Moscow , draped with black-bordered red flags , waited silently but anxiously for any f rag:iient of news about yesterday 's murder . The crime has made a profound impression and Moscow , although perfectly orderly , is filled with an air of suppressed excitement . Long queues of men and women waited at newspaper kiosks to snatch copies of the newspapers , which delayed publication for hours . Memorial Meetings Held . All day the radio intoned eulogies of the slain leader . All official functions and many private parties were canceled . Factories and other organizations held special memorial meetings where speakers extolled the dead man , while people wept for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiroff 's body lay in state in the Uritsky Palace while thousands of the populace filed through . Theatres there were all closed . In the absence of authoritative news concerning the purpose of the crime , there is much speculation . In some foreign circles , there is a suggestion the assassination was inspired from outside the country , but no information has yet been adduced to support such a theory . Informed foreigners doubted Nikolaev could have been a member of any extensive conspiracy within the Soviet Union . For one thing , they felt if there was to be an organized attack on the regime , it would have come sooner  --  say at the end of the first Five-Year Plan  --  and not now when conditions are rapidly becoming less onerous . Then too , as Karl Radek recently pointed out , the revolution- destroyed elements which might have been a danger . And they point to the fact that Nikolaev is too young to be a carry-over from the old regime as a reason for thinking the crime was not politically motivated .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
