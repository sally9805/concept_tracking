The University of Washington 's arboretum is a lush , tree-planted , 260-acre park built by WPA , west of Seattle 's exclusive Broadmoor district . It was the scene last week of a really glittering occasion . After speeches , orchestra music , ceremonies broadcast by radio , plump , close-coupled Collector of Customs Saul Haas , Seattle 's Democratic patronage dispenser , lifted a pair of scissors , slashed the gauze covering of an ordinary-looking box . Out twinkled 200 fireflies . <P> Grownups and children alike watched raptly , for never before had fireflies been seen in Seattle . West of the Rockies is out-of-bounds for U. S. fireflies-either because the mountains are too high for westing wanderers to get over , or because the Pacific Coast climate does not suit them . <P> Seattle owes its new firefly colony mainly to a pretty , 19-year-old Grinnell College girl who lives far away in Washington , D. C. When Mary Ellen Appleby , daughter of Assistant to the Secretary of Agriculture Paul H. Appleby , was a little girl , she was terrified of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a daddy long-legs " ) except fireflies , which she loved . She began to read up on fireflies , learned a lot of things about them-for example , that what makes them flash is a luminous substance called luciferin secreted in their abdomens , that most entomologists believe the flash is a mating call . Mary Ellen does not plan to be an entomologist , however . At college she is minoring in music , plans to major in journalism . <P> One day last summer Seattle 's Collector of Customs Haas dined with the Applebys at their house in Chevy Chase , admired the firefly display on the lawn . Mary Ellen asked if there were fireflies in Seattle . Mr. Haas said no . Mary Ellen was grieved . She caught 40 of the little creatures , sent them out to Mr. Haas 's fireflyless home town . But they all died on the way or shortly after arrival . Concluding that adult insects could not be colonized , * Mary Ellen arranged to have 600 larvae shipped to Seattle , to mature after reaching there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew out of their box in the arboretum last week . <P> Not even the University of Washington 's Professor of Zoology Melville Harrison Hatch knew whether the Seattle firefly colony would survive , perhaps spread to other West Coast areas . They will keep on hatching and flashing for a few weeks , mate , lay eggs and die . Then it is up to the eggs . <P> <P> *Hollywood 's Columbia Pictures , however , once imported from Texas 200 fireflies as atmosphere props for a scene in a Grace Moore picture , and these were so vigorous on arrival that they got into the wrong places ( literally including the director 's hair ) , spoiled scenes by indiscriminate flashing , had to be cleared out . The firefly scene was shot with artificial electric fireflies suspended on wires .
