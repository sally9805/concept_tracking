President Hoover spent his second week-end on the Rapidan mulling over relief legislation . Senate Democrats had come forward with a program which called for a half-billion dollar Treasury bond issue for public works . Speaker Garner would double that figure . Other Democrats , William Randolph Hearst and Alfred Emanuel Smith among them , were asking even more . Upon all such propositions President Hoover frowned severely . <P> To amplify his objections he called a camp stenographer and dictated a 2,500-word letter to Herbert Samuel Crocker , president of the American Society of Civil Engineers , ardent advocate of a big public works program. * A courier sped the letter to Washington where Secretary of the Treasury Mills checked it over for fiscal facts and figures . Then it was mimeographed and passed out to newsmen at the White House . <P> " The back of the Depression , " the President wrote , " can not be broken by any single government undertaking . That can only be done with the co-operation of business , banking , industry and agriculture in conjunction with the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity . . . . What is needed is the return of confidence and a capital market through which credit will flow in the thousand rills with its result of employment and increased prices . . . . Such a program as the huge Federal loans for ' public works ' is a fearful price to pay in putting a few thousand men temporarily at work . " Setting forth his own program point-by- point , President Hoover reiterated these principal items : 1 ) a balanced Budget ; 2 ) no more public borrowing ; 3 ) credit expansion by the Federal Reserve Banks ; 4 ) local charity to relieve distress ; 5 ) a five-day government week ; 6 ) a Home Loan Discount system ; 7 ) authority for Reconstruction Finance Corp . to borrow an additional billion and a half dollars to be lent States unable to care for their needy and to private industry unable to secure credit elsewhere . <P> Thoroughly displeased would be President Hoover to see Congress take a recess over the national conventions with its legislative job unfinished . Senators calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session must continue until the tax and economy bills are enacted . Practically abandoned was the hope that Congress could shut up shop by June 11 and go larking to the party assemblies in Chicago . <P> Last week President Hoover got a new naval aide . Captain Charles Russell Train , after a two-year tour of duty at the White House , was transferred to the Naval War College . From command of the U. S. S. Northampton Captain Walter N. Vernou was summoned to the President 's side . <P> *Because " a stenographer made a mistake , " the letter was publicly addressed to a non-existent Richard S. Parker .
