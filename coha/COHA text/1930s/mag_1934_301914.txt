In Chicago last week New York 's Mayor LaGuardia climbed aboard a TW Airliner , found himself four hours later at Newark Airport . There he refused to deplane with the ship 's other passengers . Said he : " My ticket reads ' to New York ' , and I am going to New York . " TWA officials had him flown on alone to New York 's Municipal Airport at Floyd Bennett Field . <P> Thus did Mayor LaGuardia dramatize his city 's long fight to get the airline business away from Newark . Floyd Bennett Field , built five years ago on Brooklyn 's Barren Island at a cost of $4,000,000 , has been virtually deserted while Newark Airport grew fat &; famed as the world 's busiest commercial flying field . But the latter 's sagging runways , built on filled-in marshland , are so bumpy that airline pilots call it " Mount Newark . " For lack of hangar space at Newark , TWA has agreed to move to Floyd Bennett by Jan.1 . To hold other airlines at " Mount Newark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , no more municipal taxes on gas , oil , mail &; passengers . <P> Prime obstacle to Floyd Bennett 's capture of the airline business is the fact that Newark is the official metropolitan airmail terminus . The threat to move the mail elsewhere caused New Jersey 's Governor Moore last week to wire Postmaster General Farley : " It would be rather a shabby trick to play upon Newark after it had spent such vast sums $5,000,000 to facilitate the Federal mail service .
