In a long , bare room in the Portsmouth Navy Yard Administration Building last week , four white-gloved officers of the U. S. Navy inquired into the sinking of the U. S. submarine Squalus ( TIME , June 5 ) . Before the board of inquiry sat the 33 survivors , including the lost boat 's square-chinned , grave-eyed commander , Lieut . Oliver F. Naquin . Absent : the 26 who died . <P> Why did she sink ? Oliver Naquin as well as the board tried to get at the answer as fast and finally as possible . By Navy practice , he was recorded as the defendant . This technical procedure was very real to him , for any evidence or finding that misconduct or negligence had sunk the Squalus would sink him . <P> Luckily for Oliver Naquin , the Navy already knew that : 1 ) sea water pouring through an open air-intake valve flooded the submarine 's rear compartments , and 2 ) signal lights indicated that this valve was properly closed when the Squalus ' last dive began . <P> Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was wrong in time to halt the dive ? <P> Ten seconds after the first diving signal was given , officers at key posts throughout the boat reported all rigged for diving . The Squalus was 50 feet under the surface before " a hazy voice " from the engine room telephoned : " Take her up . The induction main air valve is open , " and seconds later : " The engine room is flooded . " <P> Weeks before the Squalus went down , the guilty valve failed to open properly but had never failed to close . It was disassembled , supposedly put in perfect order . On the Squalus and her sister boats , this valve is outside the hull , near the conning tower and invisible to those inside , who must depend on signal lights to know whether it is open or closed . The electrical signal system could have lied " if the mechanism was out of order . " <P> Should anyone have anticipated such an accident , devised means to prevent it ? <P> In September 1920 , the 5-5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was flooded through the pipes which supply a subrftarine 's Diesel engines and crew with air when on the surface . ( Undersea , battery-driven motors propel a submarine , stored air supplies the crew . ) A Board of Inquiry thereafter recommended steps to find out whether an automatic , interlocking control could be developed so that when air valves were open , the ballast tanks which weight a submarine with water and make it dive could not be filled . <P> Last week Captain William R. Munroe of the Squalus board asked Witness Naquin what would have happened if such a device had been in use . Slowly and damningly , Oliver Naquin replied : " I believe such a device could have prevented this tragedy . " <P> Just whom he damned was not made clear last week . Naval specialists lay down the specifications for submarines . The prosperous and secretive Electric Boat Co. builds some in its yards at Groton , Conn. , consults closely on the construction of others in Navy Yards . The Navy found that operations of the air valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also found that the machinery would be so bulky as to decrease a submarine 's combat value , therefore decided ( as usual in submarine designing ) that military necessity came first .
