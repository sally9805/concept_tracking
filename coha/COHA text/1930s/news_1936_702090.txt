txt Jean St. Clair , alias Anderson , 23 years old , was booked by the Cicero police yesterday on a charge of assault brought by Myron F. Wilkins , 4942 Potomac avenue , a taxicab driver . Wilkins charged that the woman engaged his cab in Cicero late Tuesday and forced him at the point of a revolver to drive her to Bloomington so she could keep a date with a married man from Chicago whom she refused to name . Wilkins told Capt . Martin Wojciekowski of the Cicero police that on his arrival in Bloomington he pretended he had run out of gasoline . Miss St. Clair permitted him to leave and he returned with Bloomington policemen who arrested her and turned her over to the Cicero police . Miss St. Clair , who has no permanent address , admitted that she was recently released from the women 's prison in Taycheedah , Wis. , where she served ten months of a one to three year sentence for a statutory offense . She will be arraigned tomorrow before Police Magistrate Henry Sandusky in Cicero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
