The New York World 's Fair 's amusement zone covers 280 acres - more ground than the entire Paris International Exposition of 1937 . Yet , although the biggest in the history of Fairs , the amusement zone sticks pretty close to any canny Midway 's rule-of-three : freaks , peeks and rides . The freak shows boast no overpowering monsters : there are the pigmies and giants , giraffe-necked women and two-headed cows . But of thrill-makers , the Fair has one wow , and for peepshows , in spite of police threats , it contains more public nudity than any place outside of Bali . <P> Peeks . At its worst , the Fair 's nudity is so much peeping tommyrot . Unalluring are the Arctic Girls , frozen inside cakes of ice . Twittering and skipping about with bows &; arrows , the droopy Amazons provide a mere comic-strip-tease . NTG 's frightened-looking Sun Worshippers make customers the victims of a skin game . <P> More attractive , although on the pretty-pretty side , are the girls in Living Magazine Covers . Eye-catching are : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crystal Palace , which ends in purple shadows and a lightning-quick strip ; 2 ) the Crystal Lassies show , where , one at a time , semi-nude girls do semi-classical dances in a domelike hall of mirrors which reflects their images a thousand times over &; over . <P> Far cleverer , far more alluring is the show opened last week by Surrealist Salvador Dali . A writhing plaster castle on the outside , it shrewdly combines surrealism with sex , inside , proves that there is plenty of Broadway method in Dali 's madness . <P> Upon a 36-foot , red-satin bed called " The Ardent Couch " an unclad Venus lies dreaming . Of her four uninhibited dreams , the first-an underwater vision called " Venus 's Pre-natal Chteau Beneath the Water " - is the real crowd-catcher . A long glass tank is filled with such subaqueous dcor as a fireplace , typewriters with funguslike rubber keys , rubber telephones , a man made of rubber ping-pong bats , a mummified cow , a supine rubber woman painted to resemble the keyboard of a piano . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilly-Dali over it . Into the tank they plunged living girls , nude to the waist and wearing little Gay Nineties girdles and fishnet stockings . Swimming , grimacing , doing the Suzy Q , milking the cow , playing the " piano , " these Lady Godivers , seen at close range and a trifle water-magnified , should win more converts to surrealism than a dozen highbrow exhibitions . <P> &gt; " The Lunatic Narcissus " reveals a bare-breasted girl , her face caged with roses , her image multiplied by mirrors . &gt; " The Beach of Gala Salvador " exhibits , against a Dali landscape embellished with exploding giraffes , many a famed surrealist emblem : the erotic white gramophone with a woman 's high-heeled foot coming out of the horn ; watches flattened out like flabby pancakes ; " The Aphrodisiac Vampire , " with the head of a tiger and a body studded with pony glasses ; " The Ex quisite Corpse , " its head and neck a curved umbrella handle , its chest a wooden chest , its thighs made of saucepans , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
