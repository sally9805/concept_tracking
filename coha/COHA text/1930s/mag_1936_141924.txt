Into the Kremlin 's gleaming white Hall of Soviets , where the Throne of Tsar Nicholas II has been replaced by a statue of Nikolai Lenin , crowded happily last week 2,500 Soviet Congressmen &; Congresswomen from every part of European &; Asiatic Russia . On the stroke of 5 p. m. a big-boned Asiatic in an unadorned Army tunic entered . Up leaped the 2,500 to cheer Joseph Stalin uproariously for 30 minutes and again at every pause during a two-hour speech in which the Dictator presented for ratification Russia 's much discussed new Constitution ( TIME , June 15 et seq . ) . <P> For the second time in Soviet history , J. Stalin had had himself put on the air , and all Russia could hear his thick and at times almost unintelligible Georgian accent as he tonelessly reeled off a speech so dry that even the Orator found it best to solemnly drink on the platform a total of five bottles of mineral water . The happy rural delegates , for most of whom a free trip to the Moscow All-Union Congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave their mass cheers with greatest goodwill at all the right places and even whooped merrily at J. Stalin , " Louder ! Speak up ! " <P> The 2,500 delegates in their exuberance had filed 43,000 amendments to J. Stalin 's Constitution-not that they expected these to be adopted or even debated but just for the fun of boasting afterward back home that they had filed an average of 17 amendment 's each . There was no doubt that the Congress would vote whatever the Dictator wanted in its entirety this week and J. Stalin , ignoring the 43,000 amendments , told the Congress crisply : " In ten days we shall have a new Constitution . " <P> Out of two hours of the Dictator 's speaking time he devoted 40 minutes to reacting in his Asiatic way to foreign criticism of the new Constitution . It is a document in which many of the original world revolutionary principles of Lenin &; Trotsky are toned down to dovetail into Stalin 's practical scheme of encouraging Communist parties to unite with Socialist and other parties throughout the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which , as pure Communists , they could only have struggled from without but inevitably they themselves will become somewhat watered down and followers of Trotsky are loud in proclaiming that with this Constitution the toiling masses are being duped and betrayed by Stalin . <P> It was beneath the Dictator 's dignity last week to notice or answer Exile Trotsky , but Stalin did address himself to a different school of outside critics . Many of these are Socialists , Liberals and Democrats vaguely sympathetic with some Communist aspirations but on the whole suspicious . They know that Soviet propaganda has for months been grinding on the theme that " this is the most Democratic constitution in the world , " but , although it grants universal suffrage for the first time in Russian history , they have wanted to know whether it also restores freedom to organize various political parties or leaves all power in Russia still in the grip of the highly disciplined Communist Party whose boss is J. Stalin .                 @ @ @ @
