Last week New Brunswick wrote the final sentence in a murder case rarely matched for rustic deviltry . <P> The backwoods Bannisters , for all their advantages of fresh air and beautiful scenery , lived in a condition of squalor equal to that of any city slum . Heavy , truculent Mother Bannister was the township 's " fast woman . " In peaked caps and corduroy breeches , her sons , pinheaded Daniel and grinning Arthur , snared rabbits in the woods . So irredeemably relaxed were the Bannister morals that a Salvation Army officer assigned to improve their lot ended by undoing 13-year-old daughter Marie . At about that time the Bannisters got their bright idea . <P> Mother spread consternation through the backwoods by announcing that she was about to have a baby . Stumped by the legal difficulties of adopting one , she bought a life-sized doll , swaddled it heavily , paraded it along the roads . She convinced a railway worker named Milton Trites that it was his . After that he bought the Bannisters groceries , the doll a crib . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his by her daughter Marie , but he declined to contribute . This boom-time for the Bannisters ended sharply when the railway worker expressed a desire for a long , close look at his child , whom he thought of by now as Thyra Milton Trites . <P> One night last January , the Bannister boys and their 15-year-old sister Frances tramped seven miles through the snow-muffled forest to the Pacific Junction cabin of one Phillip Lake who-lived with another man 's wife and his two children by her . He had a baby daughter who might be kidnapped and palmed off as Mrs. Bannister 's . The boys shot and killed Lake , chased his naked woman into the snow , clubbed her to death , left her 20-month-old son Jackie floundering in the snow beside her , set fire to the cabin . Jackie shortly froze to death . The Bannister boys kidnapped Lake 's six-month-old daughter Betty Ann . Arthur 's idea of destroying the evidence was to break his .22 rifle over the railway track and throw it into the snow . The boys ' tracks led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house near Moncton . There police soon found Betty and the doll , as well as the mate to a mitten dropped beside the dead woman 's body . <P> Son Arthur Bannister 's trial for murder in Dorchester was enlivened by tall , red-coated Royal Mounted Police Sergeant Bedford Peters ' fainting in the witness box , as he examined the late Phillip Lake 's gold teeth . Arthur was summarily convicted of murder . <P> Mother Bannister enlivened her trial , the first for kidnapping in New Brunswick , by howling so industriously in her wooden cage that the lawyers had to shout back &; forth . The jury acquitted Mrs. Bannister of kidnapping , found her guilty of extortion and of " harboring " Betty Ann , a crime involving a maximum penalty of three and a half years in jail . <P> Last week pinheaded Daniel Bannister was convicted of murder , the jury recommending clemency . The judge called up the two youths and , wiping his mouth with his handkerchief , muttered , " I sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls . "
