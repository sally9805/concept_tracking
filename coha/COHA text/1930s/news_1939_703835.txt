txt There is nothing in current business conditions or in the immediate outlook to indicate any interruption in the uptrcnd of automobile sales which got under way last fall . in the opinion of William S. Knudsen , president of General Motors Corp . Asked by The Wall Street Journal whether he felt there was any justification for the several published predictions that automobile production might show . a contra-seasonal levelling off in the spring . Mr. Knudsen replied : " Our schedules for the second quarter of 1939 call for an increase of about 10% over the first quarter . While production is subject to adjustment in case of a drop-off in sales , there is nothing in the sales figures at the moment to justify any expectation of change in this situation . " GM 's second quarter output on this basis would be about 80% ahead of the second quarter of last year . General Motors ' inventories now are on a nosmal basis , 30% below the dollar value of a year ago , Mr. Knudsen disclosed in discussing the prospects of the automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best customer of many of the country 's other Leading industries . " We are now buying materials on a regular basis , " he said . Questioned as to the possibility that the United Auto Workers Union internal fight might seriously interfere with General Motors ' production plans , Mr. Knudsen expressed the firm belief that the workers ' common-sense would see to it that little or no working time would be lost during the period of adjustment made necessary by the split in the union 's leadership . In 1938. for the first time in the industry 's history . assemblies in the June quarter failed to exceed those of the March quarter : General Motor 's output , on the other hand , showed a alight gain . The industry 's decline was due largely to excessive inventories in terms of current sales and to the drop in used car sales . The corporation 's assemblies in 1938 and 1937 accounted for roughly 40% of the industry 's total . Applying this ratio to General Motors ' schedule for the first six months of this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards of 2,300,000 units , as compared with 1.306,051 in the first half of last year . Incomplete but representative figures of other manufacturers tend to indicate a. similar first-half total . In view of the fact that output through the first half of 1939 seems likely to run at an annual rate of better than 4,000,000 units . Mr. Knudsen was asked if he would like to revise his previous estimate that the full year 's output of the industry would run to around 3,500.000 units , against 2.633,777 in 1938 . He answered that he still felt that 3.300.000 was a reasonable expectation , and added that the current uptrend probably would flatten out in the third and fourth quarters . In explanation , the General Motors executive pointed out that retail car demand had started to strengthen in the 193 ? third quarter and that the upturn was vigorous all through the final 1938 quarter . Reflecting both strong retail demand and the necessity of building up dealer stocks from the Sepember 30 record low point , the industry 's fourth quarter output last year rose to 1,012,707 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , is not likely to have the benefit of the understocked situation that prevailed last year .
