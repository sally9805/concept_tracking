Of all the shortage tales which have come out of the U. S. S. R. , one which came last week was most calculated to wring the hearts of Old Russians . The Moscow bimonthly Bolshevik reported a shortage not of shoes , not of black bread or tractors or clothes , not of roofs to sleep under-but of samovars . There is only one shop in all Moscow , said the Bolshevik , which will make , resurface or solder samovars . So busy are that shop 's tinkers that they can accept orders only for 150 on the 13th day of each month .
