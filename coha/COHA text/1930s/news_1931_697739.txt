txt Will Rogers Sees Some Jobs He Thinks Should Be Unfilled To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , April 3 . ? Just when the country was doing all it could to economize in government why along comes a law and says , " Every time your State gets so many thousand new population , they must all throw in , and hire another Representative to Congress . " Well , California foolishly grew , and now they got to pay for it . A dozen unemployed must be sent to Congress by the taxpayers . Well , California is split wide in two , the north of the State claim these new ones shall come from the south , and the south claim they should come from the north , and the taxpayers are so sore about having to hire extra ones that they do n't care where they come from , but are telling ' em where to go . Yours , WILL ROGERS .               @ @ @ @ @ @
