Smallest player on the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team is their reserve right wing , 137-lb . Ken Doraty . In a way his insignificant appearance is an advantage : opposing defensemen find it hard to be prepared for the sudden bursts of speed his short legs can achieve . A bigger man is a better target for a bodycheck . Last fortnight little Doraty , at the end of his first year in major league hockey , did something that should insure him more : he ended an historically long game ( 2 hr. 44 min. 46 sec. ) by scoring the goal against the Boston Bruins that put the Maple Leafs in the final play-offs for the Stanley Cup . Last week he proved his achievement was no fluke . In the third game against New York he slapped two shots past the Rangers ' noisy young goalie , Andy Aitkenhead . The Rangers tied the score but red-haired Reginald Horner of the Leafs , playing with a plaster-cast on his broken right hand , finished what Doraty had started , won the game for Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> That made the score for the three-out-of-five series 2 to i for the Rangers , who had won the first game in New York , the second in Toronto ( TIME , April 17 ) . Deprived of their chance to equal the three-in-a-row beating Toronto gave them last year , the Rangers played wary hockey in the fourth game , waited for a break that did not come until the seventh minute of an overtime period . With the score still <P> 0 to 0 , two Toronto players went to the penalty box ; Lester Patrick , Rangers manager , took out his defense men , sent in forwards to replace them . Butch Keeling took the puck at a face-off , whipped through the Toronto defense on the left side of the rink , made a pass all the way across the ice of which he later said : " If I had n't seen that Bill was there , I would have kept the puck myself . " Bill was Bill Cook , oldest active player on the Rangers , leading scorer of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of hockey before he retires to his Saskatchewan wheat farm . He took the puck without breaking his stride , feinted to bring tall Lome Chabot away from the Toronto net , then flipped the puck over Chabot 's shoulder for the goal that ended the game 1 to 0 , the series 3 to 1 .
