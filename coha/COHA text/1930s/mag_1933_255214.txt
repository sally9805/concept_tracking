By last week only seven States stood between the 18th Amendment and Repeal . With women Dry workers fruitlessly chanting " Vote the white ribbon ticket " from church steps and outside polling places , Maryland became the 27th consecutive State to approve the 21st Amendment . Minnesota followed suit , though Granite Falls remained 271-to-18 loyal to its Andrew John Volstead . As the 29th Repeal State , Colorado completed the week 's balloting . <P> Between this week and Nov. 7 , ten more States will definitely vote . So certain did Repeal appear that Montana 's Canadian-born Governor Frank Henry Cooney decided voting would be a waste of time and money . Said he : " Montana wo n't need to vote . Repeal will be in the basket by Nov. 7 and we can save our $100,000 and use it to feed our needy people . " <P> Footnote to Prohibition history : Boston 's Arthur Race , addressing the American Hotel Association last week at Del Monte , Calif. , said , " Last September President Hoover called me to Washington and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . He told me of the magnitude of the bootlegging and speakeasy industries . He said they should be eliminated as soon as possible . But still he would not tell the people of the U. S. that and he asked me not to make our conversation public . "
