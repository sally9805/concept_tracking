SCENE : The living room of an English country house not far from Brighton . It is not one of the " great houses " but rambling and informal and spaciously hospitable in a casual way . The garden seems almost to grow into the living room ; the French windows at the back merely to beach its efflorescence . Cross the garden and you are in another living room ; cross that and you are in another garden . The knack of combining an air of improvisation with solid comfort appears to be a special attribute of the British country house of this type . It is a sunny afternoon in spring . MRS . DINGLE , the ample housekeeper , and JOAN ELDRIDGE , an attractive young American girl , are awaiting the arrival by motor of two visitors . Each time they hear the sound of a car in the road which passes the house , JOAN leaps to the piano and strikes up " The Entrance of the Gladiators . " At the rising of the curtain JOAN is discovered in one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the piano ) There they are ! MRS . DINGLE ( Lumbering to the window near the hall-door left , whence she may scan the road ) I believe it is , Miss Joan ! ( JOAN plays the music triumphantly . But the motor passes and dies down ) p. 3 JOAN ELDRIDGE ( In despair ) This is impossible . ( She leaves the piao disconsolately ) I wish Lael had n't left me to receive them . I 'm getting more nervous every minute . MRS . DINGLE Nothing to be nervous about that I can see ! Your own father and your uncle Tell me , Miss Joan , does your Uncle Rand look like a hero ? JOAN ELDRIDGE That depends what your notion of a hero is . Besides , you 've seen his picture in the papers , have n't you ? MRS . DINGLE Do n't know as I have . JOAN ELDRIDGE He 's quite young , you know . And good-looking . MRS . DINGLE As good-looking as Lindbergh ? JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Considering it ) Different style . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big fuss over him in America ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Oh , no end . ( Sound of motor car . Same business . JOAN rushes to the piano and plays . MRS . DINGLE stands at attention at French window . Same result . Motor car passes and dies down . JOAN rises from the piano ) I give up ! p. 4 MRS . DINGLE Perhaps they had an accident . JOAN ELDRIDGE I do n't think so . It 's just Father telling the driver to go slow . He 's so damn cautious ! MRS . DINGLE ( Shocked ) What a way to speak of your own father ! In my day ! JOAN ELDRIDGE I know . In your day you suppressed your feelings ! Such a bother , Lael not having a telephone ! I 'd like to ring up my young man in London to find out if he 's all right . ( MRS . DINGLE starts to protest ; she decides it 's hopeless ) MRS . DINGLE You mean Mr.  --  Mr.  --  ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Barashaev . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will . With practice . MRS . DINGLE Is he your young man ? JOAN ELDRIDGE I 've been trying to persuade him ever since last winter in New York . Like him ? MRS . DINGLE ( Thoughtfully ) He 's a foreigner . JOAN ELDRIDGE Oh , Mrs. Dingle , how British ! MRS . DINGLE He 's worse than a foreigner . He 's a Russian . But he can play the piano . I 'll say that for him . He makes it talk . p. 5 JOAN ELDRIDGE Sing , Mrs. Dingle . He makes it sing ! ( Motor is heard approaching again . This time , JOAN does n't stir ) MRS . DINGLE ( Excited again ) Miss Joan , maybe JOAN ELDRIDGE They do n't fool me again ! MRS . DINGLE But maybe JOAN ELDRIDGE I do n't care if it is ! ( Motor stops with a squeak of brakes ) MRS . DINGLE They 've stopped ! They 've stopped ! ( MRS . DINGLE rushes out ) JOAN ELDRIDGE Really ? ( She rushes to the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " RAND enters , followed by his elder brother HOBART ELDRIDGE . RAND ELDRIDGE is a little over thirty , a Southern American and very attractive . The most attractive thing about him is a kind of shyness , a slightly uncomfortable awareness that he radiates an aura of fame which makes him conspicuous when really he would prefer to be unobserved . HOBART ELDRIDGE , at least fifteen years older than RAND , has none of his younger brother 's reticence . He understands completely the sources of his own power and is determined to insure their inexhaustibility . It is impossible for him to visualize a cosmos in which he and his kind are not the central suns ) ( JOAN rushes to her UNCLE RAND ) Hello ! Hello ! p. 6 RAND ELDRIDGE ( With his arms around her ) Joan ! How nice ! How very nice ! JOAN ELDRIDGE ( To her father ) Hello , Father . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Annoyed that she is here ) I did n't know you knew Lady Wyngate , Joan ! JOAN ELDRIDGE Oh , yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  She asked me down here to help entertain Uncle Rand ! RAND ELDRIDGE Where is Lael ? JOAN ELDRIDGE She had to run up to London . She left me to do the honors . HOBART ELDRIDGE Run up to London ! Did n't she know ? JOAN ELDRIDGE It 's a long story , Father . She said she 'd explain to Uncle Rand . ( She smiles bewitchingly at her uncle ) RAND ELDRIDGE It 's quite all right . I appreciate Lael 's not treating me as a guest . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Grimly ) If it 's informality you 're after , you 'll get it all right here ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( Looking round ) Sweet place ! p. 7 JOAN ELDRIDGE Wait till you see the garden ! ( To her father ) Shall I show him the garden ? MRS . DINGLE Perhaps Captain Eldridge would like to go to his room ? RAND ELDRIDGE No , thank you . JOAN ELDRIDGE This is Mrs. Dingle . ( MRS . DINGLE bobs ) RAND ELDRIDGE ( To MRS . DINGLE ) No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and talk to my brother for a bit . Seems we ca n't get talked out , does n't it , Bart ? ( He takes his older brother affectionately by the shoulder ) JOAN ELDRIDGE ( To MRS . DINGLE ) You might see that Rand 's bags are put in his room . MRS . DINGLE Certainly , miss , I 'll see to it . ( She goes out ) RAND ELDRIDGE ( To JOAN , affectionately ) Well , Joan , well ! Well ! It certainly was a great idea of Lael 's to have you here . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( With real admiration ) You 're looking wonderful . Very , very handsome . p. 8 RAND ELDRIDGE You , on the other hand , are quite repulsive . JOAN ELDRIDGE Wherever did you get that beautiful tan ? I thought it was freezing up there in the Antarctic . RAND ELDRIDGE It 's not up there  --  it 's down there . And coming back I passed through the tropics . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Amazed ) Tropics ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( Laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOBART ELDRIDGE Vagueness is a charm she inherits from her mother . RAND ELDRIDGE ( To JOAN ) I 'm a little hurt you did n't wait for me in New York . ( Drily ) Seen the reception I had . Might have impressed you . JOAN ELDRIDGE I wish I had ! How I should have loved to see you drive up Fifth Avenue . How was it ? Were you thrilled ? RAND ELDRIDGE Well , as you see , I survived that too . ( They laugh ) HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Breaking into this ) What 's the inn like here , Joan ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Very comfortable . Well , quite comfortable . p. 9 HOBART ELDRIDGE You might ring up and reserve me some rooms . It 's getting so late , I believe I 'll stay the night . RAND ELDRIDGE Do , please . JOAN ELDRIDGE There 's no telephone in this house . But I 'll walk over HOBART ELDRIDGE And while you 're about it  --  would you mind telephoning your mother  --  she 's at Wechsley , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart because I sha n't be able to get to Wechsley for her . JOAN ELDRIDGE Right ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Thank you very much . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( As she runs out ) So long , Rand . Be seeing you . RAND ELDRIDGE Oh , Joan . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Stopping ) Yes ? RAND ELDRIDGE How is she ? Lael ? Is she all right ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Oh , grand ! Top of her form . Wait till you see RAND ELDRIDGE ( Smiling ) I ca n't ! JOAN ELDRIDGE ( To her father ) I 'll get you the Royal Suite . The Royal Suite in the White Hart ! ( She runs off through the house . There is a long pause . RAND takes a turn about the room . He is sorry LAEL has n't been there to meet him , not for his own sake alone but because he knows the effect on his brother will be , from his point of view , unfortunate . Nor is he wrong ) p. 10 HOBART ELDRIDGE Well , this little incident illustrates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELDRIDGE ( Disingenuous ) This ? What ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Irritated at his evasion ) Well , her not being here ! It 's a bit thick , I must say . RAND ELDRIDGE I do n't think so , Bart , really . She 'll probably explain it perfectly . After all , she is a busy woman . She wirelessed me to come right down . HOBART ELDRIDGE I know ! Come right down . Dying to see you . I wo n't be there , but come right down ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( Remonstrating mildly ) Bart HOBART ELDRIDGE It all comes under the head of being Bohemian , I suppose . RAND ELDRIDGE Come now ! Lael 's not Bohemian . HOBART ELDRIDGE Artistic , then . If you 're artistic , you can be rude . I must say I 'm not comfortable with artists . I get on much better with people who do things . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Shyly ) Bart I HOBART ELDRIDGE Yes , Rand . p. 11 RAND ELDRIDGE You do n't like Lael much , do you ? HOBART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sort either , Rand  --  that 's what I 'd like to make you see . RAND ELDRIDGE Bart HOBART ELDRIDGE She 's all right in her place , I suppose , but RAND ELDRIDGE Before you say any more , Bart , I want to tell you  --  I must tell you HOBART ELDRIDGE Well ? RAND ELDRIDGE I 'm going to ask her to marry me . That 's why I came to England . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( After a moment ) Rand RAND ELDRIDGE Yes , Bart . HOBART ELDRIDGE You know I love you . You know how proud I am of you . You know how much your career and reputation mean to me . RAND ELDRIDGE And you know how grateful I am to you . I never speak of it , but do n't think , Bart , I do n't appreciate  --  deeply  --  all the money you 've spent on my expeditions HOBART ELDRIDGE Nonsense ! What 's that ? What 's money compared to what you 've done for our name  --  the Eldridge name . I want that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAND ELDRIDGE ( Pleading for a clean bill ) There is n't anything against Lael , is there , Bart  --  nothing  --  serious ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Well , it depends on what you call serious . RAND ELDRIDGE Well , is it anything to do with  --  anything to do with ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Nothing as far as I know  --  not in that way . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Completely relieved ) Thank God for that ! That 's all I care about . HOBART ELDRIDGE Her private life 's all right , as far as I know , it 's what you may call her  --  public life  --  that bothers me . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Ridicules idea ) Oh , if that 's all ! HOBART ELDRIDGE It 's more important than you think , Rand . A little affair here and there I would forgive . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Pained ) Please , Bart ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Sorry . But the sort of thing Lady Wyngate goes in for RAND ELDRIDGE ( Teasing him , completely relieved now and very happy  --  a sexual aspersion was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , what sort of thing does she go in for ? p. 13 HOBART ELDRIDGE Hardly know how to explain to you . Her reputation RAND ELDRIDGE What is her reputation ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Well , she 's commonly considered  --  to put it mildly  --  eccentric . RAND ELDRIDGE How do you mean eccentric ? HOBART ELDRIDGE For one thing her husband was little better than a fire-eater . RAND ELDRIDGE Did you know her husband ? HOBART ELDRIDGE No , but I know plenty who did . I know the paper he edited  --  which her money supported and still supports . RAND ELDRIDGE She showed me a copy of it in New York . Seemed harmless  --  full of book reviews . HOBART ELDRIDGE It 's communistic ! That 's what gets on my nerves  --  a woman of her class  --  whose fortune has been built up by a lot of hard-working manufacturers , supporting the Clarion  --  a Liberal weekly that 's very dangerous  --  that wants to destroy the system that gives her her income . A woman of fine family whose father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of the best people , surrounding herself with a lot of riff-raff . RAND ELDRIDGE I do n't see any riff-raff. p. 14 HOBART ELDRIDGE You will if you stay here  --  but I ca n't stop for that . What I have to convey to you is this : In the last year or so , while you 've been away in the Antarctic , my mind has gradually crystallized to an important decision . I 'm going to settle down permanently here in England  --  make my headquarters here . RAND ELDRIDGE Does n't Phoebe want to live in America ? HOBART ELDRIDGE It 's got nothing to do with Phoebe ! I 've decided to give myself up , in a manner of speaking , to public service . I can see my way clear to becoming an influence , a power , not only here but , from here , in America as well . In fact  --  in fact RAND ELDRIDGE ( Intrigued by the mystery ) You 're wonderfully clever , Bart  --  you always were ! HOBART ELDRIDGE I 've formed a connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be startled , I think , if I told you who it was . RAND ELDRIDGE ( With perfect sincerity ) The Prime Minister ! HOBART ELDRIDGE No , no ! Lord  --  his name would be anathema in this house  --  Lord  --  ( He whispers the name to RAND ) RAND ELDRIDGE ( Registering the expected astonishment but still not having the faintest idea ) Really ? Who is he ? p. 15 HOBART ELDRIDGE Well , I 'm surprised . Do n't you ever read the papers ? RAND ELDRIDGE We do n't get the papers in the Antarctic . HOBART ELDRIDGE Of course . Of course . Anyway , you 'll soon learn about him . He admires you very much . RAND ELDRIDGE Admires me ? Really ? HOBART ELDRIDGE In fact  --  curious as it may sound  --  you are a factor in our schemes  --  an unconscious factor  --  but still a factor  --  none the less powerful because unseen  --  unspoken . RAND ELDRIDGE I ? How ? But how ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Your name . Your magic name . RAND ELDRIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring himself to mention the sacred name . He looks around ) RAND ELDRIDGE ( Interested ) You mean that Lord HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Stopping him before he utters the name ) Yes ! He 's one of the most powerful newspaper proprietors in England  --  in the world . Before a week is out I shall be definitely associated with him in a newspaper venture of great importance . I 'm putting a good deal of money into it , but what he wants chiefly , I fancy , are my American connections . And I know you will be glad to hear that in my opinion your name , your unblemished and heroic reputation , finally turned the balance in my favor with Lord ( His voice hushes ) One of those imponderables that sometimes very subtly outweighs the greatest considerations . Yes , my instinct tells me you have been invaluable . You have aided me. p. 16 RAND ELDRIDGE ( With complete sincerity ) Nothing you could say to me would make me happier . HOBART ELDRIDGE No man ever had a more loyal brother than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence ) Now you see , Rand  --  you understand what I am telling you is in the strictest confidence . RAND ELDRIDGE Oh , absolutely HOBART ELDRIDGE That includes Lady Wyngate  --  she 's the last person I 'd want to have know . RAND ELDRIDGE Of course , Bart . I never talk to Lael about things like that . HOBART ELDRIDGE Well , sometimes one thing leads to another . RAND ELDRIDGE ( With his half-shy smile ) I hope so ! HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Clears his throat ) You see this venture I am going into with  --  the person I mentioned  --  is more than a newspaper venture . Much more important than that . The affairs of the world , as you probably know , are in a critical state . RAND ELDRIDGE You mean  --  the depression ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Behind that  --  beyond that  --  beneath that . p. 17 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Dimly ) I see ! HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Grimly ) The line is becoming clearly marked . The issue is joined . At least we know which side we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do for the unemployed young men  --  get them interested in physical culture , give them jobs , give them something to live for  --  it 's really wonderful , Bart  --  just like you  --  HOBART ELDRIDGE We 've got to do something for them  --  or they 'll drift into chaos , crime , anarchy  --  it 's the New Crusade ! ( He is struck suddenly by an overwhelming idea ) My God , Rand ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( Alarmed ) Bart ? What 's the matter ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Nothing . Nothing . An idea ! A terrific idea ! The New Crusade  --  a motto  --  a picture slogan  --  for our masthead  --  do n't you see ?  --  The New Crusade  --  a Crusader in an airplane  --  do n't you see  --  right on the masthead ! RAND ELDRIDGE Masthead ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( His hands in front of his eyes to conserve the creative process ) You at the wheel ! p. 18 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Delicately ) Stick ! HOBART ELDRIDGE You at the stick  --  in a Crusader 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  communism  --  decadence  --  into the New Order  --  it 's magnificent  --  I must telephone at once to Lord RAND ELDRIDGE Wo n't it look as if you were trying to publicize me ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Not a photograph of you  --  nothing realistic like that  --  an idealization  --  if I do say it myself , it 's wonderful  --  how it bridges the centuries  --  the moral fervor of the ( Feels around for the century  --  ca n't remember it , compromises quickly ) Middle Ages  --  the science and heroism of the twentieth  --  it 's superb ! RAND ELDRIDGE Yes , I think it is , Bart . I think Lord ( He is about to say the sacred name . HOBART is terrified ) HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Looks about room to see no one overhears them ) Sh ! RAND ELDRIDGE Well , I think he 's very lucky to have you for a partner ! HOBART ELDRIDGE When I explain to you more clearly what it is we stand for  --  and when you 've had a chance to observe Lady Wyngate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll understand better why a marriage to her would be  --  well , to put it mildly  --  inexpedient . ( Rises and starts to pace back and forth ) p. 19 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Rises ) But why ? I do n't see why . She 's lovely . Everybody adores her . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Facing RAND ) The right people do n't adore her . After all  --  what do you know about her ? You met her when she was on a flying trip to New York . RAND ELDRIDGE When I went down to Washington to get the  --  the medal from the Geographic Society . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Turning away ) Well ? RAND ELDRIDGE I met the British Ambassador . HOBART ELDRIDGE Well ? RAND ELDRIDGE I asked him about her . HOBART ELDRIDGE Well ? RAND ELDRIDGE His face lit up . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Indulgently ) That , my boy , might mean many things . RAND ELDRIDGE He said he adored her . HOBART ELDRIDGE When he 's in Washington , it 's safe for him to adore her . RAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what is it  --  what is it that  --  ? p. 20 HOBART ELDRIDGE Shall I be blunt ? RAND ELDRIDGE ( Dreading it ) Please  --  HOBART ELDRIDGE For a man in your position  --  with your reputation  --  to marry Lady Wyngate RAND ELDRIDGE ( Very tense ) Well ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Feeling for an analogy that RAND will understand ) Well  --  it would ( Hitting on it at last and pouncing on it happily ) Well  --  it would be like Lindbergh marrying a young Emma Goldman ! ( At this point , and before RAND can protest , LAEL WYNGATE comes in . She goes at once to RAND , embraces him , kisses him ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE Rand ! RAND ELDRIDGE Lael , darling ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Can you forgive me ? You must think me most unbelievably rude . I left Joan here to receive you . Did she do well by you ? ( HOBART clears his throat ) RAND ELDRIDGE This is my brother , Hobart Eldridge . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Joan 's father ? p. 21 RAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) I 'm so glad to see Mr. Eldridge . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Formally ) How do you do ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Such a morning ! Do sit down ! I went up to London to pick up a German refugee . I found him so alone and so charming that I 've brought him back with me . You 'll adore him . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Sensing illustrative material ) German refugee ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Yes . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Sensing it equally and to protect LAEL ) We did n't mind a bit waiting . HOBART ELDRIDGE What sort of refugee ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Did n't I say ? German ! HOBART ELDRIDGE But what sort of German ? Communist ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I do n't know . We did n't talk politics . He 's a literary and music critic . A very prominent one . His name is Willens . Hugo Willens . RAND ELDRIDGE No ! Willens ! Not really ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do you know him ? p. 22 RAND ELDRIDGE I know him well . Where is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . RAND ELDRIDGE Well , imagine . Hugo Willens ! Great chap . We used to go skiing together . HOBART ELDRIDGE Where was this ? RAND ELDRIDGE Near Munich . When Phoebe was staying there . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Phoebe ? RAND ELDRIDGE Yes , Hobart 's wife . Met him through Phoebe , as a matter of fact . Great friend of Phoebe 's . HOBART ELDRIDGE Oh ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , then you know him too , Mr. Eldridge ? HOBART ELDRIDGE No . I do n't know all my wife 's friends . Phoebe travels around quite a bit . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , I see . Well , wo n't it be nice for him to see you again ? He has n't the faintest idea , of course . And Mrs. Eldridge will have to come too . But , Rand , tell me ! How splendid you look ! How long were you gone this time ? RAND ELDRIDGE Eight months ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Were you ? And did you have a triumphal on your return ? Were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Seemed ! Do n't tell me . When Americans are glad , they 're glad ! How I adore them ! And how is my dear , incomparable New York ? RAND ELDRIDGE It 's still there . Waiting to see you again . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Makes an impulsive engagement ) I 'll go back with you . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Eagerly ) Will you ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( To HOBART ) You must be very proud of him , Mr. Eldridge . You 're staying for the week-end , are n't you ? HOBART ELDRIDGE It 's Tuesday . I 'm afraid the week-end 's over . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I mean next week-end . Do stay . You live in England , do n't you , Mr. Eldridge ? HOBART ELDRIDGE I intend to . LADY LAEL WYNGATE It 's a great compliment to us . It 's so reassuring for us that we attract Americans like you . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Bows , and a little angrily ) Thank you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You know your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why I adore him so . I 'm so happy to see you again , Rand . What times we had in New York  --  what good times ! Really , I believe I never had so much fun anywhere as I did in those two weeks . ( To HOBART again ) In any case , Mr. Eldridge , whether you stay the week-end or not , you must stay for dinner . p. 24 RAND ELDRIDGE I want you to meet Willens , Bart . How 'd you corral him , Lael ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Through Joan . HOBART ELDRIDGE Joan ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE When Joan 's young man made his dbut in Berlin , Herr Willens gave him a great send-off . Yes , decidedly , it 's one up for Joan . RAND ELDRIDGE ( To HOBART ) Has Joan a young man ? That 's why she would n't wait for me in New York ! Well , Bart , are you prepared for that ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Oh , Joan 's young men come and go . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll meet him in a minute . He 's staying here . A young Russian-American , Sascha Barashaev . Plays the piano . HOBART ELDRIDGE Oh , then it 's certainly not important . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Between ourselves  --  all technique  --  magnificent  --  but not much feeling . Not what you 'd expect , is it ? Do you think Latins and Slavs actually have more feeling than we have ? Do you , Mr. Eldridge ? They 're more expressive and that gives the impression of warmth , but actually I do n't think they feel more intensely than we do , do you ? p. 25 HOBART ELDRIDGE Latins and Slavs are not my specialty , Lady Wyngate . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , well . It 's that I get so tired of hearing about Anglo-Saxon coldness . We 're such a sloppy , sentimental race . Only yesterday I ran into Lord Abercrombie at lunch ( As she mentions , so casually , the dread name , RAND is visibly struck ) What 's the matter , Rand ? Do you know him ? RAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY LAEL WYNGATE Very amusing , inflated , wrong-headed little man . Do you know him , Mr. Eldridge ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( With some fervor ) He 's the hope of England . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Has he told you that too ? He believes it . He actually believes it . I hate messiahs . Fake ones , charlatan ones I enjoy . It 's amusing to watch them do their stuff . I met Aimee McPherson in New York  --  you know , the woman who was lost in the desert  --  I found her in a cinema theatre . Now there 's the kind of blonde messiah I like . But sincere ones , zealot ones I ca n't abide . When they tell you they 're the hope of anything  --  and they 're not faking  --  they 're hopeless . But I 'm not persuaded entirely about Lord Abercrombie . Are you , Mr. Eldridge ? Perhaps he practises before a mirror . p. 26 HOBART ELDRIDGE In my opinion , Lady Wyngate , he is the LADY LAEL WYNGATE I know ! But on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have n't quite given him up . He may be  --  what do they call it in America  --  delicious word  --  a phony ! Shall we bet on Lord Abercrombie , Mr. Eldridge ? ( JOAN comes in , followed by MRS . DINGLE with the tea things ) JOAN ELDRIDGE Oh , Lael , I 'm crazy about him  --  I 'm just mad about him ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's not news . Ah , tea . Thank you , Mrs. Dingle . JOAN ELDRIDGE Not Sascha . The new one . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh ! Tea ! Tea ! Are n't you coming , Mr. Eldridge ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Did you see about the room in the inn , Joan ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Yes , Dad . I 've reserved the Royal Suite for you . He 's so charming . HOBART ELDRIDGE Did you telephone to your mother ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Yes . She 's meeting you . He 's so distinguished ! So different ! And he 's been in a concentration camp . ( SASCHA and HUGO WILLENS come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ! Well , Herr Willens , I hear you 're distinguished and different . How different are you , Herr Willens ? RAND ELDRIDGE ( Stepping forward ) Hello , Hugo ! HUGO WILLENS ( Astonished ) No . Not really ! ( As they shake hands cordially , to LAEL ) Why did n't you tell me ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I did n't know you and Rand were old friends . RAND ELDRIDGE This is my brother , Hobart Eldridge . HUGO WILLENS ( Shaking hands with HOBART ) How do you do ? HOBART ELDRIDGE How do you do ? RAND ELDRIDGE Phoebe 's husband . HUGO WILLENS How do you do ? ( HOBART about to sit , looks at HUGO after the double greeting ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE And Mr. Eldridge , Mr. Barashaev . SASCHA BARASHAEV How do you do ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Oh , so you 're Mr. Barashaev . LADY LAEL WYNGATE And Captain Eldridge , Mr. Barashaev. p. 28 SASCHA BARASHAEV How do you do , Captain Eldridge . I 've heard a lot about you . RAND ELDRIDGE Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Please sit down ! RAND ELDRIDGE Well , well , Hugo ! What on earth 's happened to you ? HUGO WILLENS That 's a long story . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Herr Willens has just emerged from a concentration camp . RAND ELDRIDGE Whatever for ? HUGO WILLENS ( Still rather quietly ) It was rather boring . RAND ELDRIDGE I mean  --  what did they put you in for ? HUGO WILLENS That 's part of the long story . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What was it like ? HUGO WILLENS No luxury . Plain . Simple . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Showers or tubs ? HUGO WILLENS Barbed wire and truncheons . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Both ! How generous ! ( Pours HUGO 'S tea ) SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Gloomily ) That could n't have been any joke . p. 29 RAND ELDRIDGE Well , I ca n't conceive  --  Hugo , why ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Holding HUGO 'S cup ) Before I give you tea ( A glance at HOBART ) We must know this  --  are you a Communist ? HUGO WILLENS I assure you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAEL WYNGATE Thank heaven ! Cream ? HUGO WILLENS ( Standing ) Please . ( LAEL pours cream into cup and hands it to HUGO , who thanks her and sits down ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( As she pours the second cup ) Mr. Eldridge ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Straight , please . I beg your pardon  --  plain . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Rand ? I know how you take yours . ( LAEL hands HOBART his cup . She pours RAND 'S tea . JOAN rises and pours for SASCHA and herself . Gives SASCHA his cup then sits down again ) You know , Herr Willens , Captain Eldridge has just discovered a new world  --  a bright , new , fresh , untainted world . HUGO WILLENS Yes ! I know ! ( Quietly  --  to RAND ) What a let-down it must be to return to this old one ! p. 30 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Quite buoyantly ) Oh , I do n't know . I like it down there , but it 's nice to be back too , Lael ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets it and sits down again ) It seems to be easier to discover new worlds than to run them once you 've found them . HOBART ELDRIDGE England has done pretty well . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Has she ? It 's generous of you to say so , but some of us do n't feel in the least complacent about it . HOBART ELDRIDGE There 's plenty of strength in England . In America , too . It 's not unified . It 's not co-ordinated . Power not in the right hands , that 's all . LADY LAEL WYNGATE So Lord Abercrombie was telling me just the other day  --  his very phrase  --  " Power is n't in the right hands . " He means to put it there . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( To HUGO ) Tell me Herr  --  Herr LADY LAEL WYNGATE Willens . HOBART ELDRIDGE Herr Willens . You say you 're a music critic . HUGO WILLENS I was . HOBART ELDRIDGE You 're not a political writer then ? p. 31 HUGO WILLENS Not at all . HOBART ELDRIDGE You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at all . HOBART ELDRIDGE Then may I ask why you were put into a concentration camp ? HUGO WILLENS I wrote a pamphlet . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( In triumph ) Ah ! Communist ! HUGO WILLENS Not at all ! It was satiric . HOBART ELDRIDGE Making fun of the government ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE If he did make fun of the government , Mr. Eldridge , does that justify , in your opinion , his being put in a concentration camp ? HOBART ELDRIDGE It 's a government trying to make headway against tremendous odds . They 're justified in putting down opposition . The Communists about whom we 're so sentimental nowadays LADY LAEL WYNGATE Are we ? HOBART ELDRIDGE They did it with bullets . They were n't sentimental . We might learn from them . HUGO WILLENS As a matter of fact , Mr. Eldridge , my pamphlet had nothing to do with politics . It was pure fantasy . p. 32 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Really ? RAND ELDRIDGE What was it about ? HUGO WILLENS I called it " The Last Jew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did me the honor to burn it  --  ( Deprecatingly ) with other important works . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hugo Willens ! Of course ! I remember reading the title in the  --  fire list . " The Last Jew "  --  Hugo Willens . I remember thinking : Now who is Will  --  ? I beg your pardon . HUGO WILLENS Well , now , you know . I thought it amusing , really . As a writer on music I had , as a matter of course , innumerable Jewish friends . I was touched personally by their sudden misfortunes . Also , as a lover of music , I was devastated by what the Aryan standardization was doing to my world . I resented this gratuitous disturbance of my professional routine  --  so I sat down and wrote this pamphlet . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What was it about ? HUGO WILLENS Well  --  LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , do tell us , we want to know . RAND ELDRIDGE Yes , do . p. 33 HUGO WILLENS With the extermination of the Jews , the millennium has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-organized machine the purpose is all but accomplished . They are all dead  --  but one  --  the last Jew . He is about to commit suicide when an excited deputation from the All-Highest comes to see him . There has been a meeting in the sanctum of the Minister of Propaganda . This expert and clever man has seen that the surviving Jew is the most valuable man in the Kingdom . He points out to the Council their dilemma . Let this man die and their policy is bankrupt . They are left naked , without an issue , without a programme , without a scapegoat . The Jews gone and still no millennium . They are in a panic  --  till finally a committee is dispatched  --  and the last Jew is given a handsome subsidy to propagate  --  LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Claps her hands in delight , jumps up ) Where is it ? I must get my hands on it . I want to publish it in my magazine . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Maliciously ) The Jew accepts the subsidy , I suppose ! HUGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he makes them double it . You see , Mr. Eldridge , he is not an idealist  --  he is a practical man . Idealism he leaves to his interlocutors. p. 34 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Why not ? A subsidy to propagate for destruction . As an Imperialist Fascist , Mr. Eldridge , you must understand that perfectly . Where is your pamphlet , Herr Willens ? HUGO WILLENS It is destroyed . I have no copy . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You must rewrite it  --  from memory . HUGO WILLENS Why ? Why should I be the Jewish apologist ? I 'm not a Jew . That is to say  --  LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh ! Oh HUGO WILLENS I had a Jewish great-grandmother . LADY LAEL WYNGATE But what an indiscretion ! What an indulgence ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( To HUGO , sympathetically ) Well , I never heard such nonsense ! Do you mean to say they actually  --  HUGO WILLENS Yes , and my father was a minister in the Protestant Church . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Inexorable ) Still  --  that speck  --  that unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather proud of that speck  --  when I thought of it  --  which was n't often  --  it was not unpleasant to remember I had it . This odd and mysterious strain  --  did it give me sympathy and flavor , intellectual audacity , impudence and intensity ? You see , Mr. Eldridge , it was rather like being left gold bonds in a vault  --  bonds which could n't be touched but which , nevertheless , paid one an unseen and incalculable dividend . That 's how I felt about  --  the speck . I was a Nordic with an interesting racial fillip . I was secretly vain about it  --  until it began ! p. 35 LADY LAEL WYNGATE The chromosome-hunt ! HUGO WILLENS The chromosome-hunt ! A curious experience  --  to find myself overnight a marked person , a special person . Curious discomfort . I kept saying to myself : What is it ? What is it you feel ? You are the same  --  in spite of these looks , these sudden stillnesses in conversation , this restraint  --  you are the same . But within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was in the ghetto . HOBART ELDRIDGE Imagination , of course ! HUGO WILLENS ( After a look at him  --  agreeing ) Of course  --  imagination  --  the only reality . The world in which one really lives and feels . And then the strangest thing happened can not  --  still I can not understand it . Atavism ? The  --  speck  --  took possession of me . I became its creature . I moved under its ordering . I began to ask myself whether subconsciously I had n't written the pamphlet to defend my antecedents . LADY LAEL WYNGATE But  --  how absurd ! Really , do you have to go to Freud to explain an act of simple humanity ? You wrote the pamphlet because you are a generous human being . Do n't you think  --  do n't you really think  --  that the subconscious has been done to death and that it 's high time someone re-discovered the conscious ? p. 36 HUGO WILLENS ( Amused ) I admit that leaving the Fatherland has restored my balance a bit . I am quite over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LADY LAEL WYNGATE And very welcome you are . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Rises and puts down cup on tray . Warmly ) You bet you are ! It 's grand seeing you , old boy ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Joan , will you like him even if he is an Aryan ? JOAN ELDRIDGE I 'll try . Sascha , come and play for me now , will you ? I want to hear music . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What 's the matter with this piano ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Sascha likes the tone of the upstairs one better . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Realizing that they might want to be alone ) Oh . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( To SASCHA ) Come on . SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Surly ) What if I do n't feel like playing ? HUGO WILLENS Sascha , I 'd love some Bach . SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Capitulating at once ) Of course . p. 37 HUGO WILLENS ( Rising ) If Lady Wyngate will excuse us ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Certainly . JOAN ELDRIDGE He 'll play for you , Herr Willens . I 'm jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY LAEL WYNGATE How did you get this hold on Sascha , Herr Willens ? HUGO WILLENS ( Quizzically ) By appreciating him  --  publicly . SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Eagerly ) You know , I still carry that notice around with me . Whenever I get depressed , I read it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Where is it now ? SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Taking a German newspaper clipping from his breast pocket ) Right here ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Really ! HUGO WILLENS Let me see it ! ( SASCHA hands it to HUGO ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE May I see it ? JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Wearily ) He 's read it to me fifty times . ( HUGO and LAEL look at the yellowed clipping . In it he sees epitomized his vanished career , and another life . After a moment he gives the clipping back to SASCHA ) p. 38 HUGO WILLENS Thank you . ( A moment 's pause . Then in a bantering tone ) I wanted to assure myself that I had actually once had an identity . I must have had . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them to stay away  --  they stayed away . Quite incredible , but it seems to be true ! SASCHA BARASHAEV My next appearance after that notice was sold out . JOAN ELDRIDGE Yes , but what about the Bach ? SASCHA BARASHAEV I 'm out of practice . JOAN ELDRIDGE Are pianists ever in practice , Herr Willens ? HUGO WILLENS Not good ones . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( As they go out ) I 'll join you presently . ( To RAND and HOBART ) Now then ! Is n't he nice ? RAND ELDRIDGE Oh , he 's swell ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Imagine your knowing him ! HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Rises ) If you 'll excuse me , I 'll walk down to the post office . I have to send a telegram . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I can give Robert the message and he can HOBART ELDRIDGE Thank you . As a matter of fact , Phoebe  --  my wife p. 39 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Where is she ? HOBART ELDRIDGE She 's picking me up at the White Hart . We were driving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to dine , of course . I 'd love to meet her . RAND ELDRIDGE She 'll probably want to see Hugo . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Yes , of course . RAND ELDRIDGE Be sure you tell her he 's here . HOBART ELDRIDGE I will . RAND ELDRIDGE She and Hugo were great pals . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , were they ? Do make her come then . It will be so nice bringing them together again . HOBART ELDRIDGE I 'll do my best . Thank you very much ! I 'm sure she 'll be delighted . Besides , Mrs. Eldridge has n't seen Rand yet . In his eagerness to come here he stopped for nothing  --  for nobody . ( Piano is heard from upstairs  --  " Organ Fugue in G Minor " ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'm very flattered . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Heavily facetious ) The bridegroom runneth to his chambers . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Now you 're committing him and you do n't want to be committed , do you , Rand ? I 'll expect you both for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Grimly ) She loves to fuss . Thank you very much . Good-bye . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Good-bye . HOBART ELDRIDGE See you later , Rand . ( He goes out . In the moment that follows LAEL and RAND turn and face each other ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , Rand RAND ELDRIDGE Awfully good of you to invite my entire ( They are in each other 's arms . After a bit , from this close embrace emerges a whispered conversation ) Why did you run away from me ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Muffled ) Had to . RAND ELDRIDGE It was hateful of you LADY LAEL WYNGATE It was . But I had to RAND ELDRIDGE You wo n't again . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I will again . I 'll have to again . RAND ELDRIDGE Why ? Why ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE If you give me a chance I 'll tell you RAND ELDRIDGE My dearest ! I 'll never let you go again  --  never let you go again ! ( They stand in silence a moment longer , locked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing quite close , looking at each other ) p. 41 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Tell me now  --  what was it like ? RAND ELDRIDGE What ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Your triumphal return . I saw pictures in the news-films . How I wish I could have been there ! How I wish . I could have fluttered telephone books at you ! I 'd have given anything  --  I adore parades . RAND ELDRIDGE Shall I tell you how it was ? It was incomplete . It did n't mean much  --  because you were n't there . I 'll never forgive you  --  for not being there . LADY LAEL WYNGATE How very sweet of you ! I 've never had a nicer compliment . RAND ELDRIDGE It 's true . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What was it like ? What were you thinking about ? I 'm enormously interested in fame . What is it like to be famous ? To know  --  to be aware  --  that when you enter a room , its temperature alters ? To be the Prince of Wales or Einstein  --  or yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Not even when you 're shaving ? ( They laugh ) Oh , come now , you must think of it when you 're shaving . As a matter of fact I 've never  --  and I 've known very many famous people  --  I 've never met anyone so genuinely modest , so unconscious of being haloed , as you . p. 42 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Quite unaffectedly ) It bewilders me . I do n't understand it . You know  --  I was thinking in New York  --  riding up Fifth Avenue  --  when they were making all that fuss  --  I was thinking  --  I remembered LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's just what I 'd love to know  --  what does one think of on climactic occasions like that ? RAND ELDRIDGE I remembered  --  it 'll sound foolish . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Please tell me ! RAND ELDRIDGE When I was a kid  --  I hated school  --  I simply could n't study . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Did you like mathematics ? RAND ELDRIDGE I loathed it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't add or subtract ? And these days with the papers full of that awful rigamarole about inflated currencies and what not I 'm very unhappy  --  when I read about frozen assets I really shiver  --  and the very idea of earmarking gold makes my nerves tingle , like gears grinding . But go on  --  tell me . RAND ELDRIDGE There was a hill  --  Mount Wachusett  --  it was n't much more than that  --  I could see it out of the window of the little country schoolhouse , misty blue and very far away . One spring morning , when I should have been studying , I found myself looking at it  --  I had such a wish to climb it  --  to climb it , to discover it , for myself . I 've never understood what came over me . But I just put down my book , left the schoolhouse and made for it . p. 43 LADY LAEL WYNGATE How old were you ? RAND ELDRIDGE I was eight . It was farther away than I thought . When I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a barn . At sunrise I got up and climbed to the top . I 'll never forget that instant  --  when I got to the summit and looked around at what seemed to me the whole world . LADY LAEL WYNGATE How glorious ! Like finding a Pole . RAND ELDRIDGE Much more thrilling because more definite . You would n't know you were at the Pole if your instruments did n't tell you so . When I got to the top of Mount Wachusett , I knew ! But what I did n't know was that my poor mother , frantic with anxiety , was scouring the countryside for me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Did you catch it ? RAND ELDRIDGE Did I ? That 's what I remembered  --  that incident riding up Fifth Avenue . And it seemed so funny  --  all this acclaim for doing what I 'd been spanked for as a kid  --  the same thing exactly  --  for having fun  --  it was fun for me then  --  it is still  --  I do n't know what they make all that fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sincerely and tenderly ) I 'm really frightfully flattered  --  that you should have left all that adulation and come to see me. p. 44 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Hating to confess it ) And all the time I was remembering that I felt bitter against you  --  for not being there . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'm sorry . ( A moment 's pause ) RAND ELDRIDGE ( To reassure her ) I kept your photograph in my cabin on the Odyssey . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Did I give you a photograph ? RAND ELDRIDGE I cut it out of the rotogravure section in a New York newspaper . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Did I behold those awful vastnesses ? Did I share those lonely vigils ? RAND ELDRIDGE ( Laughing a bit ) We both did . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do you know , when I was a young girl , I met Admiral Scott ? RAND ELDRIDGE ( Excited ) Did you really ? What was he like ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , rather like you . Very good-looking . RAND ELDRIDGE You 'll give me a swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you ever read Scott 's " Diaries " ? p. 45 RAND ELDRIDGE Yes . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do you remember that passage about the death of Captain Oates ? ( Quoting from memory ) " We knew that poor Oates was walking to his death , but though we tried to dissuade him , we knew it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman . We all hope to meet the end with a similar spirit and assuredly the end is not far . " RAND ELDRIDGE Think of your knowing that  --  by heart . You 're wonderful ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Quietly ) Anyone can memorize a heroic bit of prose , Rand . To live that sort of thing  --  as you do  --  is much more difficult . ( He is embarrassed . She laughs ) Sorry ! You ca n't bear praise , can you ? I wo n't do it again . Promise ! ( A pause . He is hung up . He wants to make love to her ; he does n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . She hesitates , herself , to approach the explanation she must give him ) Your brother does n't like me much , does he ? I shock him , do n't I ? And , I must tell you , Rand , I do n't mind a bit shocking him . I enjoy shocking him . What did he say to you about me ? I wager he 's frightened to death . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Very uncomfortable ) Well , you know Bart ; he 's a little strict . p. 46 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , that 's what it is . Strict ! RAND ELDRIDGE He 's the kindest brother a fellow ever had , only LADY LAEL WYNGATE Rand ? RAND ELDRIDGE What ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ' Fess up . Are you afraid of your older brother ? You are ! It 's too delicious ! Never mind , Rand , I 'll do my best to protect you . Tell me , what did he say about me ? RAND ELDRIDGE He did n't say anything . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Very severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAND ELDRIDGE ( Miserably ) Well , he thinks your friends are a little peculiar . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Peculiar . He thinks my friends are peculiar . Well , did you defend me ? What did you say ? RAND ELDRIDGE Oh , that you were just kind-hearted  --  that you did n't mean anything , no matter whom you associated with . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Understanding perfectly ) Amiable but misguided . RAND ELDRIDGE I want you to know , Lael  --  anything you do is all right with me. p. 47 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Please do n't idolize me , Rand . I 'm not worth it . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Simply ) I love you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Rand  --  RAND ELDRIDGE I want to marry you , and I 'm going to . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Rand  --  RAND ELDRIDGE That 's why I came over here . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Overwhelmed , does n't know how to explain to him , worried about herself ) Oh , dear ! RAND ELDRIDGE Are you in love with anybody else ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE That would make it simple . RAND ELDRIDGE Why did you run away from me in New York ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE That is precisely what I did . I ran away from you in New York . I ran away from you this morning . I 'm going to stop running away from you . I 'm going to face you , Rand . ( She looks at him squarely ) RAND ELDRIDGE What is it ? What is it , Lael ? p. 48 LADY LAEL WYNGATE How can I tell you ? I must make it plain to you . RAND ELDRIDGE What ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 've thought of marrying you , Rand . I 've thought of it often . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Overjoyed ) Lael ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE No  --  wait . It 's not as simple as that  --  I 've been greatly tempted to marry you  --  but it 's a temptation I 've finally managed to put aside  --  and it 's not been easy to put aside . RAND ELDRIDGE But , Lael , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you  --  LADY LAEL WYNGATE We should marry and be happy forever after , eh ? RAND ELDRIDGE Yes ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's what we should n't be ! RAND ELDRIDGE But why  --  why ? We have everything to go on with ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE No , we have n't . That 's just the point . We have very little . What we have would soon exhaust itself and  --  " Two opinions do not accord well on the same bolster . " RAND ELDRIDGE What are you talking about ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's a saying by an old English worthy named John Aubrey . It 's profoundly true . Has n't it occurred to you , Rand , that there 's hardly anything in the world  --  hardly one single important thing  --  that you and I agree about ? p. 49 RAND ELDRIDGE No  --  it has n't . We 've never discussed anything  --  How can you tell ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Laughs ) We have n't discussed anything because I 've steered clear  --  I knew if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could n't bear to quarrel . It 's so uncharacteristic of me , Rand , all this . I do n't understand it myself  --  it 's an aberration . RAND ELDRIDGE But why ? What 's the matter with me ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'm not  --  in a sense  --  I 'm not up to you , Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Hurt ) Do n't make fun of me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I mean it literally . You 're direct and sincere . You have an adorable simplicity  --  I 'm involved and  --  compared to you  --  I 'm  --  Machiavellian . RAND ELDRIDGE I do n't believe it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE It 's true . For instance , just now , with your brother  --  I was having him on ! RAND ELDRIDGE Really ? How ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I see a few people . I know about his scheme to start a paper with Lord Abercrombie  --  to enlist the Anglo-American youth for Fascism . p. 50 RAND ELDRIDGE Well , what 's wrong with that ? LADY LAEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know , Rand , I think , with practice , I could work up a first-rate feud with your brother . RAND ELDRIDGE Please do n't . I ca n't tell you how much I want you two to like each other . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Unable to resist ) Do you want us , as you say at home , to get together ? RAND ELDRIDGE ( Literally ) Yes . I do . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , Rand , you make me ashamed of myself . You 'd probably always make me a little bit ashamed of myself . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Miserably ) I do n't know what you mean  --  really I do n't  --  we like each other and LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Determined to be ruthless ) But do n't you see  --  We 're worlds apart . RAND ELDRIDGE Simply because you imagine we disagree theoretically  --  LADY LAEL WYNGATE Your defence of me to your brother was touching but it only proves how little you know me . What did you say ? I 'm good-hearted and mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rand  --  I try to mean a great deal . I 'm a determined woman . Are you terrified ? p. 51 RAND ELDRIDGE No . LADY LAEL WYNGATE How can I put you off ? How can I finally put you off ? RAND ELDRIDGE Do you want to ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE No ! RAND ELDRIDGE There you are ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Self-reproachful ) You bring out the worst in me , Rand  --  the most feminine . I have n't had this kind of conversation since before I married , when I lived in Heartbreak House . RAND ELDRIDGE Where ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE It 's a fancy by Mr. Shaw . I 'd like you to meet him . He 'll probably put you in a play . Being a sedentary vegetarian he adores men who fly to unknown worlds and administer torrid continents . You and Lawrence RAND ELDRIDGE Lawrence LADY LAEL WYNGATE Colonel , not D. H. I refer to the exploit with Arabia  --  not with Lady Chatterley . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Laughs ) I do n't mind . Usually I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You make me though ! p. 52 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Very sceptical ) Oh , yes ! I 'm sure I do ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE You do . Also you make me feel a little  --  horrid . ( RAND , stung by this , suddenly takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately ) RAND ELDRIDGE Do I ! Do I ! Do I ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( After recovery ) It is pleasanter off the pedestal , I admit . ( Sighs ) Oh dear ! RAND ELDRIDGE What is it now. ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I have an awful foreboding that eventually I 'll succumb to you but I feel I owe it to my conscience to put up an awful fight . RAND ELDRIDGE I want you  --  forever . LADY LAEL WYNGATE No , you do n't . RAND ELDRIDGE I 'll never want anyone else but you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE If you thoroughly knew me , you 'd be bewildered by me  --  you might even be horrified by me . RAND ELDRIDGE ( His arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  do you LADY LAEL WYNGATE What ? p. 53 RAND ELDRIDGE Do you have affairs with men ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Between annoyance and laughter ) My dear ! RAND ELDRIDGE Do you ? I must know . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Disengaging herself from him finally ) Well , if it 's any comfort to you , I may tell you that though I 'm intellectually sympathetic to any indulgence , emotionally I 'm fastidious and even puritanic . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Fervently ) Thank God ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Bursts out laughing ) Oh , Rand ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( Offended ) What 's so funny ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE You make me feel that any progress is hopeless . How are we going to break down the indurated conservatism of men ? RAND ELDRIDGE What 's progress got to do with it ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Imagine finding you  --  a great explorer , a hero  --  so  --  sex-ridden . It 's disillusioning . I 'm ashamed of you , Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE Sex-ridden ? I love you ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually monogamous , no other foible I might have could matter to you . I might be nourishing an idea to destroy the universe . I might be the incarnation of malice , a well , deep and poisonous ; I might be anti-Christ , but so long as I did n't  --  well  --  you would n't mind , you would n't enquire . Your psyche , my dear Rand , is sex-ridden . It 's obsessed . It 's maggoty with possessive desire . p. 54 RAND ELDRIDGE How can you say that when I want to marry you ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE How dare you marry me without knowing me ! Much better if we  --  er  --  well  --  till you find me out ! RAND ELDRIDGE I could n't . You mean more to me than that . LADY LAEL WYNGATE If I did n't know this rejection sprang from the purest chivalry , I should be humiliated . RAND ELDRIDGE Please do n't be clever . ( HOBART enters ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Addressing them both ) Most men simply ca n't imagine any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that too , Mr. Eldridge ? I imagine you are ! HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Wary ) I would n't think of answering a question like that without preparation . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'm sure you are . An amusing instance of it happened during the one serious quarrel I ever had with my husband . It was during the Sacco-Vanzetti trial in America . I 'd read everything there was to be found about it and felt passionately . I was coming up here one day in the train  --  I was living here alone then  --  for the moment Nick and I had separated . I had just read Vanzetti 's farewell letter ; I sat there thinking of this man being shunted in and out of the death-house , facing ignominious death and sitting down to write this patient , forgiving , beautiful letter and I began to cry . I just sat there  --  crying . A stranger was in the same carriage ; I had forgotten his existence  --  a nice old Anglo-Indian colonel . He put his hand on my arm  --  " My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come ! A pretty young woman like you ! " Life did n't seem long enough to explain to him that I was not crying about a lost lover but about Sacco and Vanzetti . " Think of all life has in store for you , " he said . I was thinking about death but I could n't help laughing . " Do you think so ? " I asked . " That is right , " he answered . " Keep a stiff upper lip ! " p. 55 HOBART ELDRIDGE Maybe your soldier friend was n't far from right . Maybe your personal unhappiness was mixed up with those tears , Lady Wyngate . LADY LAEL WYNGATE There you are ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Maybe it was yourself you were crying for , after all . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I see your resemblance to your brother , Rand . I 'm sure you despise women , do n't you , Mr. Eldridge ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Well , I would n't exactly say that . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Have you men been so successful in running the world that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely you ca n't complain of Rand on that score ? He 's idolatrous . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( With a dazzling smile at RAND ) I certainly do . I complain of his idolatry more than of your contempt . He tells me , for example , that I do n't mean anything at all . RAND ELDRIDGE I did n't say that . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You know better than that , do n't you , Mr. Eldridge ? You know that I mean a great deal . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Showing RAND how fair he is ) I think that you do mean a great deal  --  but  --  you 'll forgive me  --  I think that you 're not nearly so certain of what it is that you mean . If you could visualize the ultimate implications of your conduct , I 'm sure that you 'd probably p. 56 LADY LAEL WYNGATE What nonsense ! But that would mean foreseeing to the end of time . It 's difficult enough to visualize the immediate implications  --  and you talk about ultimate implications . What  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldridge ? Did n't you go to fetch Mrs. Eldridge ? HOBART ELDRIDGE She had n't arrived at White Hart . I left word for her to join me here . I hope you wo n't mind . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Of course not ! That 's utterly delightful ! You know , I can hardly wait to know you better because I am certain that the better we know each other the less we shall agree . I foresee enchanting vistas of antagonism . I love opposition . It solidifies my own position . HOBART ELDRIDGE What  --  you will forgive me  --  what conceit ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Delighted  --  vamping HOBART ) I am beginning to see why you and Lord Abercrombie hit it off . He 's a Puck . HOBART ELDRIDGE I beg your pardon ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE He 's a Puck  --  and so are you  --  a malevolent Puck ( JOAN comes in ) Hello , Joan . What 's Herr Willens doing ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Arguing music with Sascha. p. 57 LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's one thing musicians can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Herr Willens ! What is he going to do ? I have it ! ( To HOBART ) Why do n't you let him review music for your new newspaper ? HOBART ELDRIDGE We 're not going in for that sort of thing . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What are you going to fill it with ? HOBART ELDRIDGE I 'll send you advance sheets of the first issue . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Please do n't trouble . I can imagine . Racial solidarity and a higher tariff on wool . Rand , would you like to see the river view ? RAND ELDRIDGE ( With alacrity ) I would indeed ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE We must find something though for that poor fellow Willens . To find yourself suddenly without a job and without a country I 'll take you on the most enchanting walk you ever ( To HOBART ) @x SCENE : The same as ACT ONE . Afternoon , four days later . CLENDON WYATT 'S voice , SASCHA accompanying on the piano , is heard singing a spiritual . NIKOLAI JURIN sits by , listening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . WYATT is an attractive young Southern American who won a Rhodes Scholarship for making a spectacular dash on the football field . JURIN is an aristocratic Russian , middle-aged , tired , very gentle . CLENDON WYATT Away up tharMy massa 's settin'Settin ' onHis judgment chairHe looks down onAll creationHe sees sorrowHe knows care He sees sorrowHe knows care . ( There is a moment 's pause when he finishes singing ) NIKOLAI JURIN Thank you , Mr. Wyatt . I have always wanted to hear one of these songs . Sascha , please SASCHA BARASHAEV Yes ? NIKOLAI JURIN This spiritual which Mr. Wyatt has just sung for us  --  did it make you think of anything , did it remind you of anything ? SASCHA BARASHAEV Musically , you mean ? p. 59 NIKOLAI JURIN ( Eagerly ) Yes . Musically . SASCHA BARASHAEV Not especially . Why ? NIKOLAI JURIN Ah , that 's because you were never in Streilna before the Revolution , where Maria Nikolaevna used to sing the gypsy songs . ( He closes his eyes and sings ) Utro TumannoyeUtro SedoyeNivi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance ? CLENDON WYATT I see what you mean . SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Argumentative ) Not a bit alike ! The Russian is sensuous , earthy ( LAEL comes in . Grouped around the piano , the others do n't see her at once ) NIKOLAI JURIN ( Trying to persuade SASCHA ) But in the melancholy of both , there 's CLENDON WYATT I know what it is they have in common  --  resignation ! NIKOLAI JURIN Yes ! Resignation . Yes ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Coming up to them ) What 's this about resignation ? ( They all rise ) I do n't approve of it . I think people ought to fight . p. 60 NIKOLAI JURIN ( Standing above his chair ) There comes a day , dear lady , when you can not fight  --  then you need resignation . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Briskly ) I do n't admit that day ! NIKOLAI JURIN Had you been in Russia when the Bolsheviks came , you would have recognized such a day . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , I 'm prepared to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of hibernation of the soul  --  but you ca n't be resigned forever . That 's Buddhism . NIKOLAI JURIN No , pardon me , dear lady , but I do not agree with you . There comes a day when you wake up and you find yourself , though you are living and breathing , a part of the past . ( HUGO enters ) You are historic . You realize that you have survived yourself . That 's sad . That 's strange . And for that day you need resignation . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , I understand it , but temperamentally I 'm against it . NIKOLAI JURIN But really to understand it , you have to undergo persecution and contempt . SASCHA BARASHAEV It 's no joke the way things are going nowadays . LADY LAEL WYNGATE It was never a joke at any time the way things were going . Was there ever a moment in history when you were n't surrounded by blood and tears ? ( HOBART enters . He is fingering a telegram and is very businesslike ) It depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this she has said looking at HOBART ) Oh , hello , Hobart . p. 61 HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Aggressively ) I 've got to go up to London . Where 's Rand ? CLENDON WYATT On the tennis-court I believe . Shall I get him for you ? HOBART ELDRIDGE If you please . ( With a look at LAEL , WYATT goes out ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'll join you in a minute , Clen . NIKOLAI JURIN What a nice boy that is . How does he , an American , happen to be at Oxford ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE He 's a Rhodes Scholar . He says he 's so grateful to Mr. Rhodes for letting him stay at Oxford that he 's always wanting to write him a bread-and-butter letter . NIKOLAI JURIN ( Puzzled ) But I thought Rhodes was dead ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Laughs  --  in explanation to JURIN ) American humor , Jurin ! ( JURIN rises and kisses her hand ) SASCHA BARASHAEV I 'll find Joan and we 'll play doubles . Mrs. Eldridge does n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JURIN I 'll do my best . ( To HUGO ) Perhaps you would like to play , Herr Willens ? p. 62 HUGO WILLENS Thank you , no . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( To SASCHA and JURIN ) We 'll be out in a second to watch you . ( SASCHA and JURIN exit ) Now , then , Hobart , why must you go up to London ? Why ca n't you relax ? You 're always so busy . HOBART ELDRIDGE I 've just been down to the post-office LADY LAEL WYNGATE I could have a ticker-tape in your room ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Smiling grimly ) A telephone would be some help . But this is n't the Stock Market . I 've got to go up to London . ( RAND comes in flushed from tennis ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( To RAND ) Your brother 's going up to London . I 'm hurt ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Just for a few hours . And I 've got to take Rand with me . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Appalled ) Oh , now , Bart HOBART ELDRIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , anyway . RAND ELDRIDGE But I 'm right in the middle of a set . HOBART ELDRIDGE An hour to London  --  half hour in Fleet Street  --  an hour back . p. 63 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Unable to resist it ) Shall I ask Lord Abercrombie here ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Horrified ) Rand ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Nonsense . Rand did n't tell me . I told him . Shall I ask him here ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Recovered ) Do n't think you could get him . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Wickedly ) Shall I try ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Fearful of her magic ) No , thank you . I 'm afraid you might succeed and I 'd rather see him in London  --  away from you . Probably , like everyone else , Lord Abercrombie ca n't resist you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , up to a point he ca n't resist me . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Looking at his watch ) Please get ready , Rand . The longer you take RAND ELDRIDGE ( Turning to obey ) Right ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lael ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Shall I , Hobart ? Look how frightened he is . No , I ca n't leave my guests . p. 64 RAND ELDRIDGE ( To HOBART ) Sure we will be back for dinner ? HOBART ELDRIDGE If you hurry . RAND ELDRIDGE Be right down . ( RAND exits ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( To HUGO ) Mr. Eldridge is organizing an Anglo-American Youth League . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Surprised that she should speak of it to HUGO ) Hum ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( To HOBART ) Oh , it 's everybody 's secret . What are you going to ask the Anglo-American Youth to do for you ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( As if he had memorized it ) We are appealing to the generous spirit of the youth of both countries to mobilize against the subversive forces current in the world today . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Are you appealing to it because it 's generous or because it 's uncritical ? HUGO WILLENS It 's a myth about the generosity of youth . Youth is bloodthirsty and savage  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's only the exceptional man . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I do n't agree with you , Hugo . I think the impulse of youth is to be generous . p. 65 HUGO WILLENS When it 's well-fed and romping it may be occasionally , out of excess of energy  --  but normally it is n't . But then , normally , who is ? No point in being quixotic , is there ? Excuse me , Lady Wyngate , I think I 'll watch the tennis . ( HUGO saunters out ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE I hate Youth Movements . They all come to the same thing . Boy Scouts with bayonets . Do you want a private army , Hobart ? Have you a little dictator hatching in your brain ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Urbanely ) As a matter of fact , Lady Wyngate , it 's commonly acknowledged that democracy is pass . At home , the historic system of " checks and balances "  --  ( He utters the phrase derisively )  --  has brought us where we are . And your Parliament is  --  what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He calls it vestigial ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Exactly . Vestigial ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE I hate dictatorship because it implies omniscience , and I do n't believe in omniscience . That 's theology applied to politics , and I believe it 's dangerous . I can believe in God only if He 's invisible . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Patronizingly ) Very good ! p. 66 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Thank you ! HOBART ELDRIDGE There 's one thing about you  --  and people like you  --  that I do n't understand LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , is there ? HOBART ELDRIDGE that I 'd like to have explained to me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I have no secrets from you , Hobart . HOBART ELDRIDGE I can understand people who have n't anything being Communists . Naturally they want to take things away from the people who have . But why people like you , who have everything to lose by the destruction of our system , should be Communists , I never will understand . It baffles me . Frankly , it does . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communist . That 's just an epithet that people like you apply to anyone like me who does n't happen to share your prejudices . In the second place Oh , dear HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Patiently ) In the second place ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Dear , oh , dear , I find the prospect of arguing with you appals me . HOBART ELDRIDGE Why ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Because the possibility of enlightening you  --  if you 'll forgive me , Hobart , seems so  --  shall we say  --  remote ? ( He smiles benignly , patiently ) That benign smile ! p. 67 HOBART ELDRIDGE At least , I know where my interests lie . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'm sure you do . HOBART ELDRIDGE You do n't . I am fighting your battles . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Thank you ! HOBART ELDRIDGE You ought to pray for my success . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I will , if you insist . HOBART ELDRIDGE It means the continuance of a world in which you can entertain Communists like Mr. Jurin and LADY LAEL WYNGATE Because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put two and two together  --  get a colossal sum  --  typical financier . As a matter of fact , Mr. Jurin is a victim of the Communists  --  as anti as possible . HOBART ELDRIDGE Humph ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE That irritates you , does n't it ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Still very bland ) Dear Lady Wyngate , inconsistency of any sort irritates me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Yes , I suppose it would . HOBART ELDRIDGE If I favor dictatorship as against democracy , it is because I 've applied dictatorship in my business and in my private life , and have made it successful . p. 68 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Who is pondering , while he is talking , another problem ) Have you ? HOBART ELDRIDGE I flatter myself I have . I am a very rich man , Lady Wyngate . I should never have become so through a system of divided powers . In the political realm also such a system is impractical . The state of the world today proves how impractical it is . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( On whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Misunderstanding ) Do n't tell me you agree with me . That would make me dubious of the soundness of my own premises . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Lighter , Bart , lighter I 'm afraid these heavy broadsides are wasted on me . Do you know what 's been worrying me while you 've been making these pronunciamentos ? Rand ! What has Rand to do with all this ? Why are you rushing him into town to meet Lord Abercrombie ? Of course it 's perfectly obvious  --  the whole scheme . Really , it is a trifle shabby . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Olympian ) What is shabby , Lady Wyngate ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Deliberately and firmly ) Exploiting your brother 's name and reputation for a movement the real motive of which he does n't understand and which he 'd loathe if he did understand . p. 69 HOBART ELDRIDGE And may I ask what makes you think he 'd loathe it ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Warmly ) Because he 's generous-hearted and your movement is n't ! HOBART ELDRIDGE In your opinion it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and approves thoroughly . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Will you risk my explaining it to him  --  from my point of view ? HOBART ELDRIDGE That would hardly be fair . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Why not ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Because you are a lovely woman with whom he happens to be in love . ( This gives her pause ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Slowly , realizing HOBART is cleverer than he seems ) . That 's the most effective appeal you could have made . But perhaps I 'll stop Rand joining you anyway . I must remember that people like you regard chivalry in others exactly as strategists in war regard weakness in defence . Shall I stop him ? I can , you know . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Steely now ) If I were you , Lady Wyngate , I really should n't try . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Probably not . After all , why should I ? p. 70 HOBART ELDRIDGE That 's wise . LADY LAEL WYNGATE It 's because I do n't believe in your survival , no matter how many Youth Leagues you organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because if you do  --  I will stop him . I 'm perverse , you know , Hobart ( RAND comes back . He has changed into a traveling suit . HOBART rises  --  looks at watch ) RAND ELDRIDGE ( Transparently reluctant ) Well , here I am ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Her customary chatter ) Of course , any hostess with a nature less adorably angelic than mine would simply poison you for taking away her most celebrated guest in the middle of the day like this . The trouble is you 're so used to Rand you have no idea the glamor he sheds . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Significantly ) I have some idea . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I take it back . Of course you have ! RAND ELDRIDGE I hate to go . ( He smiles at his brother ) I wish , Hobart , you were n't so important ! HOBART ELDRIDGE You two make me feel like the villain in the play separating the lovers . But it has to be done . Please , Rand p. 71 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Obedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for just a second . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Looking at his watch ) I 'll give you ten . ( Faces LAEL ) Not so bad , am I ? Any message to Lord Abercrombie ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Give him my love  --  that 's ambiguous enough . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( With a laugh ) I will ! ( Holds up both his hands to RAND ) Ten ! ( He goes out . RAND goes to her . Takes her in his arms . She is not very responsive ) RAND ELDRIDGE What a bore ! I have to go ! ( He sits on arm of LAEL 'S chair ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE I think so ! RAND ELDRIDGE I ca n't very well refuse Bart , can I ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I suppose not . RAND ELDRIDGE He 's done so much for me . It seems little enough to do in return . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Does it ? RAND ELDRIDGE After all  --  a few hours in London  --  I 'll be back at the latest by p. 72 LADY LAEL WYNGATE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To what then ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE This illustrates what I mean when I Oh , well , never mind . ( She was about to tell him how it illustrates the essential incompatibility between them  --  his leaving her to go on a mission she detests  --  but she is inhibited by recalling HOBART 'S accusation of unfairness ) RAND ELDRIDGE But you must tell me . This illustrates  --  what ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I ca n't tell you now  --  your brother 's waiting for you  --  there is n't time . RAND ELDRIDGE There is . Tell me . Please , Lael , tell me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I promised your brother I would n't . RAND ELDRIDGE But LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , dear , life is very complicated ! RAND ELDRIDGE You make it so . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do I ? RAND ELDRIDGE I love you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You should n't . RAND ELDRIDGE I do though . p. 73 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , then  --  I should n't . RAND ELDRIDGE As long as you do ! LADY LAEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you come back RAND ELDRIDGE Will you tell me then what all this mystery is ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I will . I 'll tell you then . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Smiling at her ) A showdown ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's it ! A showdown ! RAND ELDRIDGE That 's what I 've been waiting for . We 've got to get clear . ( Takes her in his arms ) Good-bye , darling . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Good-bye . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Starts to leave , stops and faces her ) Come with me to the car , Lael , please . ( He has returned to her ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Crosses the room , stops at door and faces him ) All right . Rand  --  RAND ELDRIDGE Yes , Lael ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Will you do me a favor ? p. 74 RAND ELDRIDGE Anything . LADY LAEL WYNGATE After you 've talked to Lord Abercrombie , tell him that before you make a final decision about anything you have promised to consult me . RAND ELDRIDGE Certainly I will . LADY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit through arch in alcove , laughing ) ( HUGO comes in through the French windows from the garden , crosses to the end-table by sofa , picks up a cigarette and lights it . From the garden also PHOEBE ELDRIDGE comes in , blonde , exquisitely dressed , an adorable Kewpie ) PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Are you afraid of me ? HUGO WILLENS Why , Phoebe ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You seem to avoid me . HUGO WILLENS Not at all . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You 've changed . You know that . You 've got a lot of new lines in your face . HUGO WILLENS Well , do n't rub it in . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE At lunch I watched you . I thought : What is it about him that 's changed ? HUGO WILLENS Age , my dear . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE No , not age . You do n't somehow look older . Trouble , suffering . And I stopped hating you . p. 75 HUGO WILLENS ( Suddenly Mephistophelean , making passes with his fingers over his forehead ) Look , I erase the little lines . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HUGO WILLENS I do n't want to be loved for a blemish . I am too vain ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I did n't say that I loved you . I only said that I did n't hate you . HUGO WILLENS In that dubious region between love and hate PHOEBE ELDRIDGE What ? HUGO WILLENS Nothing . I succumbed to the cadence of that opening phrase . It seemed to be an opening phrase . Seemed to lead somewhere into some superb aphorism . But it does n't . It does n't lead anywhere . It gets ready to be magnificent and then dries up . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE There 's one thing that I 'd like to know  --  that I have a right to know . HUGO WILLENS ( After a moment ) Well ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE About her ? HUGO WILLENS Her ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE The woman . HUGO WILLENS What woman ? p. 76 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE The woman for whom you left me in Munich . HUGO WILLENS Oh ! That woman ! What do you want to know ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Are you still in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Are you trying to comfort me ? It 's nothing to me . I 'm just curious . HUGO WILLENS Well ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Where is this mysterious woman now ? HUGO WILLENS I have n't the least idea . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Have n't you ? Are you sure you have n't ? HUGO WILLENS Quite . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You must wonder why I 'm so curious . Really it 's for the most trivial reason . You know how feminine I am . HUGO WILLENS Yes , Phoebe , I do  --  I do . I assure you , Phoebe , that like the whole of my life  --  this woman  --  is part of the past . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE When you left me in Munich  --  that last time  --  where did you go to meet her ? HUGO WILLENS Where ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Yes . p. 77 HUGO WILLENS Oh , er  --  Bayreuth , was n't it ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You know perfectly well it was Bayreuth . As a matter of fact , you heard " Tristan " with her  --  and you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him ) You do n't see her any more , do you ? You do n't know where she is , do you ? HUGO WILLENS What are you ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE This Wyngate woman HUGO WILLENS What ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE The moment I saw you together I knew it . I felt it . And then I found out . I was talking to her before luncheon . It was n't difficult , clever as she 's supposed to be . HUGO WILLENS Phoebe , Phoebe ! Of all your intuitions , this is the most brilliant . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I found out where she was that summer  --  in Bayreuth  --  where you went to hear " Tristan " " Tristan . " You and your wonderful titled Englishwoman ! HUGO WILLENS Phoebe , does it occur to you that there must have been several hundred titled Englishwomen in Bayreuth that summer , that month , that day ? You must believe me , Phoebe . This is a fantastic caprice of your imagination . p. 78 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Is it ? HUGO WILLENS I never saw Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to London to meet me . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE It 's no use , Hugo . HUGO WILLENS Very well , have it your own way . There 's nothing to be done about it , is there ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I ca n't help it , Hugo . I love you still . I 've never stopped thinking of you . I ca n't do anything about it . I used to wonder who the other woman was . For three years I 've wondered . I felt if I knew , it would be easier . Well , now I know  --  and it is n't . HUGO WILLENS Phoebe ! Phoebe , whatever you think about Lady Wyngate and me , it is n't true . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Why did you come here then ? HUGO WILLENS I had to go somewhere . Phoebe , I assure you PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Do you still love her ? HUGO WILLENS Oh , Phoebe ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Is there anything between you now ? HUGO WILLENS Not a thing . You 've got to believe me . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Promise ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor ? HUGO WILLENS ( Stands at attention and clicks his heels ) Word of honor . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Leans back in chair , then speaks ) Still  --  I suppose I 'd better leave here today . HUGO WILLENS ( In panic  --  dreading a scene ) No , no ! Do n't do that ! You must n't do that ! ( Going closer to her ) Phoebe , I want you to stay . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Coquettishly ) You do n't  --  you do n't in the least . HUGO WILLENS I do . When I saw you here today , I felt PHOEBE ELDRIDGE No , you did n't  --  you did n't feel anything . HUGO WILLENS That 's not true . Stay , Phoebe , and I 'll show you how wrong you are . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Rises  --  about to put her arm about his neck ) All right , Hugo . I 'll give you a chance to explain . ( JURIN enters from the French windows . He sees that he is interrupting and starts to leave ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted , grasping this as a means of escape from PHOEBE . He calls out to JURIN , but remains standing at right of PHOEBE ) Oh , come in , Mr. Jurin , come in ! I 've been wanting to speak to you . It 's most important that I speak to you ! NIKOLAI JURIN ( Crossing to left of PHOEBE 'S chair ) Please ? HUGO WILLENS Are you fond of music , Mr Jurin ? NIKOLAI JURIN Naturally . HUGO WILLENS Ah ! Then you can help me . You can help me no end ! NIKOLAI JURIN Can I ? HUGO WILLENS Yes . I want to do an article on Russian music . NIKOLAI JURIN ( Interested ) Oh ? HUGO WILLENS Russian music since the Revolution . From Glazounov to Sostakhevitch . Did you by any chance know Glazounov , Mr. Jurin ? NIKOLAI JURIN No . ( Sensing something is amiss , glances amusedly at PHOEBE , then continues ) I admire him greatly  --  but as a matter of fact HUGO WILLENS ( Interrupting him ) You see the point I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only Russian art which has eluded political dictatorship  --  now Sostakhevitch p. 81 NIKOLAI JURIN As a matter of fact , Herr Willens , Sostakhevitch PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Unable to bear any more , rises and speaks to JURIN  --  rather coldly ) When you 've both finished this fascinating subject ( To HUGO  --  warmly and sincerely ) I 'll be waiting for you down by the river , Hugo . ( HUGO and JURIN bow to her . She goes to the French windows and exits . JURIN and HUGO watch her go and then HUGO looks at JURIN and sinks into the chair ) NIKOLAI JURIN ( Quite aware of the situation  --  slightly teasing ) You see , Herr Willens  --  I left Russia in 1917 . Sostakhevitch is a post-Revolutionary phenomenon . The first time I heard anything by Sostakhevitch was not in Russia but in the Bowl . HUGO WILLENS ( Absent-mindedly ) The Bowl ? NIKOLAI JURIN Yes , the Bowl , in Hollywood . HUGO WILLENS Oh . NIKOLAI JURIN But it is a very interesting topic , although I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some difficulty in proving your point . These days it would seem nothing eludes political dictatorship . Not even music . To hear people talk you might think that music is a form of political pamphleteering . Hindemith is Bolshevik . Strauss is reactionary . Sostakhevitch is the orchestrator of the Five-Year Plan . Even dead composers are pulled out of their graves to hang in effigy . ( HUGO is slumped in his chair . JURIN goes to him and glances off after PHOEBE ) However , my dear chap , if I can help you still further in any way , I shall be delighted . p. 82 HUGO WILLENS Thanks . NIKOLAI JURIN You 're welcome . ( LAEL enters ) HUGO WILLENS ( Suddenly conscious of JURIN ) Mr. Jurin , have you been wandering over the face of the earth since 1917 ? NIKOLAI JURIN Since 1917 . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Amused ) You ought to publish a refugee 's hand-book , Jurin . NIKOLAI JURIN A time-table ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE There ought to be a marvelous place set aside somewhere for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Lady Wyngate ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE A little bigger , Jurin . My accommodations are so limited . A semi-tropical paradise set aside by the League of Nations . A government of refugees  --  by refugees  --  for refugees . What sort of a government would it be , I wonder . NIKOLAI JURIN ( Humorously ) Probably a  --  dictatorship ! ( JURIN exits through French windows into the garden ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE Great charm , that man ! One of those rare souls whom suffering does n't embitter but makes mellow somehow . Oh , dear  --  I 'm very depressed , Hugo . I 'm in a funk . I want building up . p. 83 HUGO WILLENS Then I 'm afraid I 'm the last person you want . LADY LAEL WYNGATE If you let me talk I 'll gradually build myself up . I 'm irrepressible . Do you ever despise yourself , Hugo ? HUGO WILLENS Just now  --  before you came in here  --  I had occasion to despise myself . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Did you ? So did I ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLENS ( Quickly ) Yes ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I was strongly tempted to coquette him into doing something for me  --  like a film vampire shedding sex-appeal . Not nice ! HUGO WILLENS Well , we 're even . LADY LAEL WYNGATE How do you mean ? HUGO WILLENS Just now I overheard myself almost beginning to make insincere love to a woman for whom I feel nothing whatever  --  God knows why  --  but it was probably the only thing to do at the moment . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( After a moment  --  understanding ) Oh . Mrs. Eldridge ? HUGO WILLENS You know then ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I found out today . p. 84 HUGO WILLENS Did you ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Yes , just before luncheon . HUGO WILLENS ( Realizing that PHOEBE had n't put anything over on LAEL ) Oh . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Nothing so thankless as to warm over an old love affair , is there ? HUGO WILLENS ( Rises ) Two weeks ago I was in a land suddenly hostile to me . I thought : If ever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I am out and I find myself dawdling about and being agreeable where agreeableness is indicated . Really , human nature is too resilient ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Is n't it lucky it is  --  How often  --  if it did n't bend , it would break ! HUGO WILLENS Better to break ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's too austere . That 's Calvinist . HUGO WILLENS ( Smiles ) Just now , while I was being agreeable to Phoebe , I kept saying to myself : " Why do n't you tell her the plain truth  --  that you ca n't endure her ? " I could n't though . I kept on being agreeable . LADY LAEL WYNGATE But of course you had to . The other would be too cruel . p. 85 HUGO WILLENS Would it ? I wish I 'd told her long ago in Munich  --  instead of what I did tell her then . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What did you tell her then ? HUGO WILLENS I was so desperate to get rid of her and so determined to be ruthless that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WYNGATE Was n't there ? HUGO WILLENS Not a soul . Pure improvisation . " Titled Englishwoman . " I told her I was leaving her for a " Titled Englishwoman , " a phrase from a tenpenny novel of " High Life . " I heard it again today , the same phrase  --  she 's treasured it : " Titled Englishwoman ! " LADY LAEL WYNGATE Did she demand to know who the " Titled Englishwoman " was ? HUGO WILLENS She did . Morbid curiosity . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Not morbid at all . I 'd have wanted to know too . HUGO WILLENS ( Suddenly overcome by the grotesqueness of the situation , he bursts into laughter ) Really , it 's too funny ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE I suppose you could n't tell her there was nobody . No , that would be too pointed . HUGO WILLENS Having improvised a rival , she tried to force me to produce one for her and since , for obvious reasons , I could n't do that , she 's done the job for me  --  conjured one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY LAEL WYNGATE What ? HUGO WILLENS You ! You are the " Titled Englishwoman . " She is certain of it . Nothing I can say will dissuade her of it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE But I HUGO WILLENS One of those sudden , irrational convictions jealous people get . The evidence is incontrovertible . A : You are a titled Englishwoman , are n't you ? B : You were in Bayreuth during the Wagnerian cycle of the summer of ' 32 , were n't you ? C : So was I. A  --  B  --  C LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Laughing ) Q. E. D. HUGO WILLENS ( Ironically . Rises and bows to her ) I congratulate you ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Enjoying it all ) But I think it 's marvelous ! ( All graciousness ) And I may say  --  I congratulate you ! HUGO WILLENS ( Sits again on sofa beside LAEL ) I 'm terribly sorry . LADY LAEL WYNGATE But why ? I do n't mind , if you do n't . HUGO WILLENS It 's too silly . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were to be upset by rumors about me  --  this is mild compared to some . I 've given up years ago worrying about what people say . Do you know why ? Because everybody else in the world is anonymous really except those few  --  it can never be more than a very few  --  who really matter to me . One , at most two absolute friends . p. 87 HUGO WILLENS ( Not too seriously ) There 's no such thing as absolute friendship . Like everything else , friendship is relative  --  a thermometer of expediency . LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's too cynical . Not bad as an epigram though . But you ca n't compress the truth about anything into a sentence . It 's like pressing a drop of blood on a slide and saying : " This is the stuff that flows in your veins ! " It is n't though . When it 's in your veins it 's something different . HUGO WILLENS I 'm glad you can believe in friendship . It must be a great comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you really ? HUGO WILLENS I did once . LADY LAEL WYNGATE During the trouble at home  --  did no one stand by you ? HUGO WILLENS I was aware of one friend . He was an unknown playwright . I felt this man to be , though he was even then middle-aged , the freshest and the most living voice , since Ibsen , in Europe . In my first published book a large part was devoted to him . But the book brought me more success than it brought him  --  as a result of it I was invited to lecture in America . I took his plays with me , I translated them and lectured on them from New York to San Francisco . Now , you must understand that in all this , I was exalting myself ; it was the most any critic can be , a disciple of greatness . p. 88 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Knowing he has begun to be afraid she will think him conceited ) I understand , Hugo . HUGO WILLENS And I had the greatest reward such discipleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious phenomenon took place ; the fame I created for him in America reverberated to Germany  --  and we began to accept him at home ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE You mean Lehrmann , I suppose ? HUGO WILLENS Yes , Lehrmann . LADY LAEL WYNGATE He 's your Grand Old Man , is n't he ? HUGO WILLENS Something like that . He 's over sixty . I 've hero-worshipped him for thirty years . I came to see him , sure that in his mellow greeting I would be in some sense  --  restored . Because I actually felt a wavering of sanity . I had sent him the manuscript of my pamphlet . I began to tell him how disturbed I was by the New Dispensation when I detected a new look in his eyes , a new manner . He had not smiled in greeting ; he had not given me his hand . He refused point-blank to read my pamphlet ; in a hard voice he advised me to tear it up . " This is a new day , " he said to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oriental ! My family had lived in Germany for hundreds of years . I sat there staring at him . In his eyes , already glazed with mortality , I saw something impenetrable , incurably hostile , something that no appeal to the past could soften . That look did for me . I 'd never had such a sense of helplessness . For in his youth this man had been the voice of the submerged  --  he had written the saga of the oppressed and the poor ; he had been a living instrument of justice . There he sat , impersonal , hard , fanatical . He let me go without asking me to come to see him again , as you let go a servant who has cheated you and to whom you refuse to give a reference . Friendship ! ( A pause . He tries to gather himself together and speaks lightly ) After all  --  it 's none of your affair , is it ? p. 89 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Very quietly ) That 's the unkindest thing , I think , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry . But , really  --  I came here a complete stranger to you  --  you invite me to stay out of a fantastic goodness of heart . The least I can do in return is to be  --  jolly . As a matter of fact , I 'm going away and that is partly why . It 's too unfair to you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You must n't go until you 've had a chance to get a perspective on yourself . Besides , where would you go ? HUGO WILLENS I was going to borrow from Sascha passage-money to America . They 've started something there they call the University in Exile . Maybe I could get into that . I 've cabled the director . LADY LAEL WYNGATE We 'll see what can be done for you here . HUGO WILLENS It wo n't be easy . To be at once an migr and a critic  --  that is a double parasitism . Before I can be eloquent I need a masterpiece and before I can be witty I need something which fails to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard yet from America ? HUGO WILLENS Not yet . p. 90 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , I do wish you could feel welcome here , Hugo . Do n't you like me ? HUGO WILLENS You 've been very  --  gracious . It 's that  --  ! I feel  --  ! ( He does n't finish . She gives him a quick look . She realizes that she has a problem on her hands that will not yield to simple tact merely ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hugo  --  HUGO WILLENS Yes ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do you mind if I speak to you  --  frankly ? That is to say , critically ? HUGO WILLENS ( Smiles quizzically ) Do you think I 'm thin-skinned ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 've avoided rather speaking to you about your  --  special experience . I 've avoided it in a mistaken effort to keep your mind off it  --  but are n't you mistaking a mass antagonism for a personal one ? Hugo , you do n't want to develop a persecution mania . HUGO WILLENS Is it a mania for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAEL WYNGATE No . The truth is there 's a pest over all the world just now , an epidemic of hatred and intolerance that may engulf us all . That is perfectly possible . People have suffered too much during the last twenty years  --  they ca n't stand any more , that 's all . In one way or another they 're letting off steam  --  the form it 's taken against you is peculiarly detestable . Everyone here abhors it . The whole world revolts against it . That is what you must remember . This is a different climate , Hugo ; you are like a man who continues to shiver when he 's left the Arctic  --  and moved into the tropics . There are other worlds , you must remember , than the one you 've left . p. 91 HUGO WILLENS Are there ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , I know what you 're saying to yourself : " It 's easy enough for her to talk . She 's at home , she 's comfortable , she 's secure . " Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of history , any security for anybody . What security should I have , as a liberal person , if the world goes Communist ? Or Fascist ? I think Hobart Eldridge and Lord Abercrombie might be  --  to say the least  --  unsympathetic to me . In any dictatorship , subtleties of opinion and temperament are swept away ; you 're either black or white . HUGO WILLENS ( Quizzically ) But you 're not a luxury commodity ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE I beg your pardon ! HUGO WILLENS Like the race of which I find myself suddenly an involuntary member ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE But , Hugo , these days every hereditary aristocracy is a luxury commodity ! HUGO WILLENS ( He takes her hand and kisses it ) You 're very sweet  --  but I 'm afraid the analogy is not quite complete . They , I suppose I ought to say we , are like passengers on a vessel that lets them stay on board  --  and even enter the first-class salons occasionally  --  as long as the weather is fair  --  but ho ! for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and our art are tolerated and even praised while the economic level is high . Once the golden stream is dammed and constriction sets in we are the first to be squeezed . Of course the world has suffered , we among the rest , but , in its misery it singles us out to levy a secret and an ageless revenge . p. 92 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( After a moment ) Where is your legendary patience , your legendary capacity for endurance , your legendary  --  resignation ? HUGO WILLENS ( Almost gleefully ) I have n't it ! That 's my special dilemma . I am neither patient , nor resigned , nor enduring . You forget I am only a Jew by fraction ! I suffer the disabilities without the hereditary armors . The Aryan seven-eighths of me wars against the Semitic eighth  --  wars and retreats  --  and I 'm afraid nothing can be done for me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE That , Hugo , is a challenge to my resourcefulness ! Promise me that you wo n't run away  --  if only because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) If you do n't enjoy adapting yourself to Phoebe  --  adapt yourself to me . HUGO WILLENS ( A slight pause , sincerely ) Shall I ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( After a second  --  candidly ) No . Do n't . HUGO WILLENS The idea tempts me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Resolutely ) It was automatically flirtatious . You deserve better than that of me  --  and so do I ! p. 93 HUGO WILLENS ( Rather darting out at her ) You 're in love with Rand ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( After a moment ) One 's an awful mixture , Hugo . HUGO WILLENS ( Accepting it instantly as a fact ) Do n't you feel a sense of  --  incongruity ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE All the time . Yes . Keenly . It does n't help though . ( A moment 's pause . She walks about the room impatiently . He watches her ) One gets so tired of one 's own complexities . There 's Rand , a symbol of simplicity , courage and directness . There , in a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUGO WILLENS So eloquent  --  and so unconvinced ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Looks at him quickly , then away ) You 're shrewd , Hugo . You 're diabolically shrewd . HUGO WILLENS ( Watching her ) Am I ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Of course I 'm unconvinced , but whether I 'm convinced or not  --  there it is ! HUGO WILLENS ( Shrugging his shoulders ) Why attempt to rationalize the  --  elemental ? p. 94 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( As if to herself ) Is n't it extraordinary how one can go on being agreeable and alert  --  so-called normal  --  and all the time nourish an obsession that has a life of its own , independent and arrogant  --  a fugue that seeks stubbornly its own resolution  --  at no matter what cost  --  to oneself ? ( Rises and faces him ) Hugo HUGO WILLENS ( Rises ) Yes ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Throwing away her pretences and appealing to him pitifully ) In you I feel  --  a special friend . Do n't go . Please stay . HUGO WILLENS ( Crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With great intensity ) But not as a friend . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Almost whispers ) Hugo . HUGO WILLENS Not even as a special friend . LADY LAEL WYNGATE On any terms . HUGO WILLENS But because an obsession  --  may be destroyed . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Realizes the implication of what he has said and looks at him in surprise ) Hugo ! p. 95 HUGO WILLENS ( Terrific determination ) Yes ! It may be destroyed ! ( His hand closes on her arm . They stand near together , close and warm spiritually also . PHOEBE comes in . She is eaten with jealousy , blind with rage , behaves almost like a person paralyzed with drugs . Speaks and walks as if in automatism ) PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Do forgive me ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hello , Phoebe . Wo n't you PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Without waiting to discover the invitation ) No , thank you very much . ( She stands at door leading to staircase and addresses HUGO ) Liar ! Liar ! Liar ! ( She disappears ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? HUGO WILLENS ( Drily ) Well , she demanded to know whether there was anything between us , and I said there was not . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Mischievously ) Well , you really should n't have lied to her , Hugo . HUGO WILLENS That was twenty minutes ago  --  and I did n't know ( She is amused and provoked and still a little disturbed by PHOEBE 'S plight . He stands looking at her , enchanted by her ) QUICK CURTAIN p. 96 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO/Scene Two SCENE : The same . Later that evening . Around 10:30 . JURIN and WYATT are playing double patience and talking . CLENDON WYATT I wonder why the two Eldridges went so abruptly to London ? NIKOLAI JURIN I can not suspect why . CLENDON WYATT Did n't you feel a strain at dinner ? NIKOLAI JURIN Not especially . Mrs. Eldridge seemed a bit CLENDON WYATT Did n't she ? ( A moment 's pause . They play in silence ) NIKOLAI JURIN The way Lady Wyngate rushed them all off to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , did they ? Whether they wanted to or not , to the cinema they went . You could tell she did n't mean to stand an evening of that by herself . CLENDON WYATT The German did n't help much , did he ? NIKOLAI JURIN Not much . CLENDON WYATT A burst of brilliance and then NIKOLAI JURIN A burst of brilliant silence ! What do you think of him ? p. 97 CLENDON WYATT I do n't know . I ca n't tell . I think Lady Wyngate likes him . Do you like him ? NIKOLAI JURIN As a fellow refugee , I feel a sympathy for him . Poor fellow , he does n't realize yet what being a refugee means . CLENDON WYATT Maybe he does ! NIKOLAI JURIN He 's new ! I 've had seventeen years of it . CLENDON WYATT I can imagine  --  it 's no fun . NIKOLAI JURIN Half mendicant  --  half vagabond . CLENDON WYATT Surely not for you  --  with your gift for languages . NIKOLAI JURIN The English are really very kind . You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study Russian ! ( WYATT laughs ) They start with such enthusiasm , a mingling of philanthropy and really a romantic yearning to learn the language . But very soon , unhappily , they find that between the yearning to learn and learning is a gap which can only be bridged by a certain amount of hard work . This work is irksome and soon they begin to look on me , unconsciously perhaps , as a disagreeable taskmaster . They begin to miss lessons . They insist on paying for these missed lessons  --  at first I refuse to accept  --  now I accept for a little while till it becomes only too apparent that the fees are only gifts . My pride intervenes . And I think : you have two children who must be fed  --  what right have you to pride ? Pride is the last luxury one can train oneself to give up  --  like the traditional dress suit of the impoverished swell . So it goes . Ah ! The king I wanted . ( He puts the king in place ) p. 98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JURIN Oh , she misses them but with her it is different . When she misses a lesson it is because she really has something else to do . She works at it ; she has made progress . But there is only one Lady Wyngate . CLENDON WYATT Yes , is n't it lucky there is one ! NIKOLAI JURIN Oh , then why did n't you go along to the film ? CLENDON WYATT I have to cram for an exam . ( He gets up . HUGO and PHOEBE come in , PHOEBE in evening dress ) NIKOLAI JURIN So soon back from the film ? HUGO WILLENS I left at the point where the first Lord Rothschild makes a loan to the Allied Powers out of sheer altruism ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE The stuffy place gave me a headache . CLENDON WYATT Where is Lady Wyngate ? HUGO WILLENS Still there , I suppose . We could n't find seats together  --  we got separated . CLENDON WYATT Captain Eldridge came back just after you all left . Did he catch up to you ? HUGO WILLENS Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 99 NIKOLAI JURIN ( Looking triumphantly at his cards ) There  --  I 've defeated myself  --  a brilliant victory  --  but a financial loss . CLENDON WYATT How is that ? NIKOLAI JURIN I bet against myself  --  quietly . ( PHOEBE goes to fireplace and sits by herself staring into it . WYATT gets up ) CLENDON WYATT Of course , Mr. Jurin , what you 've been saying makes me timid about asking you to give me Russian lessons . NIKOLAI JURIN My dear friend ! CLENDON WYATT ( To HUGO ) Mr. Jurin 's been telling me what a hard time an migr has even in a country as friendly as this is . NIKOLAI JURIN Oh , please , I beg of you , do not repeat what I 've been saying to Herr Willens ! HUGO WILLENS Why not ? NIKOLAI JURIN We do n't want to discourage a novice ! HUGO WILLENS There is no novitiate in being a refugee . You are a veteran after you 've left your country one day . NIKOLAI JURIN ( Deprecatingly ) Well p. 100 HUGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost cause . And people are bored by defeat . NIKOLAI JURIN There have been refugees who have returned . HUGO WILLENS Like Napoleon ! When you still hope to return , you are not a refugee . NIKOLAI JURIN ( Wistfully ) May not a lost cause be glamorous ? HUGO WILLENS ( Brutally ) In the amber of literature or history  --  yes . But not when it is contemporaneous . For a moment sympathetic people and generous people may be kind to the victim , but the average man has nothing but contempt for anyone who has been so footless as to put himself permanently in the wrong in the country of his origin . I saw it in people 's faces the moment I crossed the frontier . A flicker of chivalry  --  merging almost instantly into a guarded boredom . No , it 's a shabby martyrdom at best and if you will tell the truth , Mr. Jurin , you will have to admit that this is true . NIKOLAI JURIN ( Sadly ) There are exceptions  --  that is to say , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true . ( A moment 's pause ) CLENDON WYATT Mr. Jurin , if you do n't mind I shall insist on studying Russian with you  --  not because you are a refugee  --  but because I want to learn the language . p. 101 NIKOLAI JURIN You will be unique among my pupils . CLENDON WYATT Good night . ( He goes out ) ( JURIN and PHOEBE and HUGO sit in silence . JURIN looks from one to the other , has some understanding of the situation and tries to stir up a little fire of conversation in these ashes ) NIKOLAI JURIN Evidently , Lady Wyngate likes the picture better than you did . HUGO WILLENS I do n't know . We were n't sitting together . NIKOLAI JURIN It would n't matter if she did n't like it . She never can bear to leave anything in the middle . She always feels , she says , there may be something wonderful at the end . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Oh , does she ? NIKOLAI JURIN Incorrigible optimist , is n't she ? ( A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back after the film ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I do n't know . They said something about going to a Pier dance at Brighton . ( With perceptible irony ) Lady Wyngate thought that would be fun ! NIKOLAI JURIN I wo n't wait up then . Will you say good night to her for me if she does come back ? p. 102 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Yes , I will . NIKOLAI JURIN Thank you , Mrs. Eldridge . ( To both of them ) Good night . ( He walks to French windows , stops ) I think I 'll stroll through the garden . Really , the roses are overpowering at night . In the daytime I think they relax . ( He goes out through the garden windows . HUGO and PHOEBE are left alone . He is so angry at her , he can not bring himself to face her . He paces the room ) PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( At her most martyrish ) You 're terrible ! You act as if I had committed the grievance , as if I had hurt you ! ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You did n't say a word to me all the way here . Did n't you want me to leave the cinema with you ? I could n't sit there alone . How would it have looked afterwards  --  with Lady Wyngate and Rand ? If you did n't want me to go , why did n't you say so ? HUGO WILLENS You 've got it into your head that Lady Wyngate is the woman for whom I left you in Munich and nothing I can say will dissuade you of it . If you want to know the truth , there was nobody  --  nobody at all . I left you  --  not to meet Lady Wyngate nor anybody else  --  but for the blissful release of being away from you . p. 103 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You 're very chivalrous , where she 's concerned , are n't you ? Anything to protect her ! HUGO WILLENS Well , whatever you may think , I want to be left alone now ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I said I wanted to leave here this afternoon . Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why ? You 'll be much more comfortable here without me , I should think . As for me , I 'm quite reconciled , I assure you ! HUGO WILLENS ( Tensely ) Are you ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You flatter yourself ! HUGO WILLENS You 're behaving like a jealous schoolgirl . You 're not a schoolgirl after all , Phoebe . You 're the mother of a grown daughter . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I know . HUGO WILLENS You might behave with some dignity . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Well , you need n't worry about it any longer . HUGO WILLENS You say I need n't , but I do just the same . You act the martyr . You suffer . You whine . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Hugo HUGO WILLENS Um Gottes Willen , I want to be left alone ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Why did n't you tell me the truth then ? p. 104 HUGO WILLENS Truth ! Truth ! What truth ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE This afternoon when I asked you if you still loved Lady Wyngate ? You said you did n't . Why did n't you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare your feelings . Like all my other lies to you to spare your feelings ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Gets very comfortable , then speaks ) Thank you , you need n't . HUGO WILLENS Besides , you 've always bullied me in your quiet way and I wo n't let you bully me any more . For that cowardly consideration I 've always displayed to you  --  I apologize to you . I 'll tell you the truth now  --  for all time . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Hugo HUGO WILLENS The truth is I ca n't endure you . Whether I love Lady Wyngate or anybody else ca n't possibly matter to you because I do n't love you and never have . I detest your best qualities : your amiability , your patience , your clinging sweetness ! You make me feel a cad and a sadist . You 've done it for years and I 'm sick to death of it . I repudiate it . I ca n't endure it . You drive me mad with boredom . You have almost from the beginning . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You loved me before she came . p. 105 HUGO WILLENS You bored me before anybody came . The only reason our affair lasted as long as it did was because we were separated months at a time , because I hardly saw you for more than a few weeks each year . I beg of you , Phoebe , get interested in somebody else . Take up folk-dancing , or needle-work , but for pity 's sake , do n't cling to me . Leave me alone . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Not militantly ) All right , Hugo . You need n't worry . I will . HUGO WILLENS You have a way of cringing before a blow when I speak harshly to you that 's made a liar and a hypocrite of me for years . This conquest of me through meekness and patience and understanding has eroded me for years , and I 'm not going to let it any longer . Do you understand that finally  --  not any longer ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE It 's a pity your charming hostess wo n't make up her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Sweetly ) Whether she wants Rand or you . She sets her cap for him in New York and she got him over here . Why does n't she make up her mind ? Or maybe she 's just using him . That 's not very generous , I should say ! HUGO WILLENS ( In despair of her understanding  --  rises and faces her , then , as though explaining to a child ) Nothing would make any difference between you and me . How can I make it clear to you that if Lady Wyngate were blind or deaf or in a nunnery , it would make no difference to you and me ? Nothing would make any difference between you and me ! p. 106 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE All right , Hugo . ( He sits back in chair . She faces front . A pause ) No ! No matter what you say to defend her  --  it was all right between us till she came . ( With quiet hatred ) I owe this  --  to her ! ( JURIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ) Oh ! Really , it is criminal to stay indoors on such a night . It is pure magic out there . Forgive me  --  one drink and I go . ( JURIN comes to the secretaire and begins to mix himself a highball . PHOEBE and HUGO sit occupied with their own thoughts . HOBART enters . His face is set and grim . He has not had a happy or successful evening . LORD ABERCROMBIE has proved , at the critical moment , to be elusive ) HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Taking in the frozen group ) Um ! How very cozy ! NIKOLAI JURIN Oh , good evening , Mr. Eldridge . HOBART ELDRIDGE Good evening . I 'll take a whiskey and soda , too , if you do n't mind . I need it . Where 's everybody ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Rand is at the cinema with Lady Wyngate . So are Joan and Sascha. p. 107 HOBART ELDRIDGE Should be back soon , should n't they ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE They said something about going to Brighton to a Pier dance hall . HOBART ELDRIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mingling with the people ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Damn nonsense ! I want to see Rand ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You may have to wait up pretty late . NIKOLAI JURIN Whiskey and soda , Hugo ? HUGO WILLENS ( Rises eagerly ) Yes , thanks . NIKOLAI JURIN ( After a moment ) Why do n't you all come out into the garden ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Why ? What 's in the garden ? NIKOLAI JURIN ( Poetically ) The night . ( HUGO understandingly pats JURIN 'S arm and then goes to left of the sofa . HOBART looks at JURIN disgustedly and crosses to get another drink . JURIN then turns to MRS . ELDRIDGE and speaks to her from rear of the sofa ) Will you come , Mrs. Eldridge ? p. 108 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE No , thank you , Mr. Jurin . HUGO WILLENS I 'll go with you . NIKOLAI JURIN ( Gallant ) I 'd rather have Mrs. Eldridge , if you do n't mind . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I 'm sorry . NIKOLAI JURIN Then , thank you , Hugo . ( Crosses to above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOBART and indulging suddenly a personal sense of humor begins to declaim ) The moon shines bright : In such a night as this , When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees ( HOBART crosses to the right end of the sofa with his drink . He and PHOEBE exchange an incredulous glance and then he continues to the stool where he sits ) And they did make no noise , in such a nightTroilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls ( JURIN stops , glances at HUGO , then leans over and speaks to PHOEBE ) What comes next ? ( Phoebe looks at him and then at HOBART . JURIN then turns to HUGO ) What comes after that ? HUGO WILLENS ( Smiling ) I only know the original In solcher NachtErstieg wohl Troilus die Mauern TrojasUnd seufzte seine Seele zu den ZeltenDer Griechen hin , so seine CressidaDie Nacht in Schlummer lag . ( JURIN taking his arm affectionately ) p. 109 NIKOLAI JURIN Still you must admit  --  " And Sigh 'd his soul toward the Grecian tents , where Cressid lay that night " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a translation ! ( They both go out , carrying their highball glasses with them . HOBART has drained his highball and he goes to the tabouret to pour himself another . PHOEBE watches him ) PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Dovelike to him suddenly ) What 's the matter , Bart ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Gruffly ) Why ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Whenever you start drinking in that determined way , I know you 're disappointed about something . HOBART ELDRIDGE Tired . Long day . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( After a moment ) Why did n't you and Rand come back together ? HOBART ELDRIDGE I had to stay on to finish up with Lord Abercrombie . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Did you finish up ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Extraordinary interest you take in my affairs suddenly . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE If I know anything about them at all , it is n't because you confide in me. p. 110 HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Mechanically ) What 's the matter ? ( He knows there is something , but he 's not interested much . He can not possibly attribute gravity to PHOEBE 'S preoccupations ) PHOEBE ELDRIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drinking ) Rand get back in time for dinner ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE No . Just after we all left for the cinema . HOBART ELDRIDGE Everything go off all right ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Of course . Not that it would matter  --  Rand is so in love he 's in complete oblivion as far as anything outside Lady Wyngate is concerned . He would n't notice anything anyway . HOBART ELDRIDGE What would there be to notice ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Nothing . Nothing much . HOBART ELDRIDGE Well , what do you mean nothing much ? What 's on your mind ? Speak up ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Bart HOBART ELDRIDGE Well ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I think Rand ought to be warned HOBART ELDRIDGE Warned ? p. 111 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE about Lady Wyngate . HOBART ELDRIDGE How do you mean warned ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( With an air of dropping the whole thing ) Well , perhaps I 'm crazy . ( A pause . HOBART pours himself a third drink . PHOEBE walks about . He stands still , thinking , drinking his drink more slowly ) I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts for garden doors , throwing a glance at him . He does n't turn his head . She has to go through with it now and starts out , through the garden doors . At the last second , he calls her back ) HOBART ELDRIDGE How do you mean warned ? About what ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE It does n't matter . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Steely ) Come here . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE You 're obviously in no mood to talk . ( A pause . He goes to her ) HOBART ELDRIDGE What did you mean ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I meant HOBART ELDRIDGE Well ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Her feelings get the better of her and she pours them out ) I meant simply this : that Rand 's precious idol is having an affair with that  --  immigrant  --  this Hugo Willens ! ( This makes considerable of an impression . So much so that , the moment she has uttered it , PHOEBE feels a bit frightened ) p. 112 HOBART ELDRIDGE ( After a pause ) What ! PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Yes . HOBART ELDRIDGE Since coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . It 's been going on for years . HOBART ELDRIDGE How do you know ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I know . HOBART ELDRIDGE How ? This is important to me , Phoebe . More important than you realize . How do you know ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( More scared still and fighting for time  --  she realizes she has n't worked her scheme out sufficiently in her mind ) I ca n't tell you that . HOBART ELDRIDGE You 've got to . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE I ca n't . HOBART ELDRIDGE You 've got to . You will . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE Later perhaps  --  now I ca n't . HOBART ELDRIDGE Why not ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE It involves a friend . HOBART ELDRIDGE Who ? PHOEBE ELDRIDGE That I ca n't tell you . You 'd guess if I told you . I mean ( She has said it before she realizes it might be a clue . She is in a funk now about the whole thing . There is a pause . HOBART gathers himself together ) p. 113 HOBART ELDRIDGE ( At his cunningest ) Nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOEBE ELDRIDGE What do you mean ? HOBART ELDRIDGE It 's absurd . Your notion is absurd . It 's not possible . Willens ? It 's not possible . Somebody 's been pulling your leg , my dear . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Now she feels her quarry slipping from her and she is furious  --  determined not to let it go at all costs ) Have they ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Of course they have ! ( He pours himself another drink ) Better go to bed , Phoebe . You 're overwrought . ( He turns away from her , his back to her as he drinks his highball . She feels the ground slipping from beneath her , her enemy escaping . A mania seizes her , a mania of cruelty and revenge  --  at any cost she must destroy LAEL . That is the first condition of her further being . Mixed in it is a desire to wound HOBART also , to destroy his complacency , to hurl a dart into that strong arrogant back ) PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( A new voice ) Am I ? HOBART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 114 PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( After a second ) Do you really want me to tell you  --  how I know ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Knows he 's got her , but his face revealing nothing  --  the poker face ) In the morning will do . I 'm not interested much in female gossip . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Her voice rising ) Are n't you ? HOBART ELDRIDGE I advise you to go to bed , my dear . PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( With an outburst of hysterical laughter ) You fool You complacent fool ! Ca n't you see that ( The sound of laughter and voices off stage  --  RAND and LAEL ) HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Very annoyed at this interruption , still making the best of it ) You 'd better PHOEBE ELDRIDGE ( Hate in her voice ) She 's back ! I ca n't bear to HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Close to her , quickly ) Go to your room . I 'll join you there in a minute . ( She crosses the room swiftly to opposite door and goes out . Left alone , HOBART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concludes there is no point in meeting LAEL now . Besides , it will delay the revelation he knows now he can get from his wife if he follows it up . He follows PHOEBE out . For a moment the stage is deserted  --  the voices and laughter of RAND and LAEL growing louder . They come in . They are in full evening dress . One gets a sense from LAEL that she has missed HUGO and is rather on the look-out for him ) p. 115 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Where is everybody ? RAND ELDRIDGE Do you miss them ? I do n't . ( Following her ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE After all , I am a hostess . RAND ELDRIDGE Let 's go to the Pier dance . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Looking around toward the garden ) Shall we ? Oh , Rand , remember that wonderful dance place in New York you took me to  --  all crystal and chromium and stratosphere ! RAND ELDRIDGE I went there once afterwards without you ; it was no good . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Sometimes I get such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be there on the instant  --  must walk those glittering streets , breathe that electric air . RAND ELDRIDGE Come back with me . I 'll let you walk and breathe all you like . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do n't spoil me . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Putting his arm around her shoulder ) Would n't I love to ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( In a dream of her own  --  rather drifts away from him ) Oh , Rand ! p. 116 RAND ELDRIDGE ( A slight pause  --  feels her mood ) Now , Lael , do n't do that . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What ? RAND ELDRIDGE Drift away from me . Every once in a while you drift away from me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Coming back to the moment ) Little excursions . You take such big ones . Do n't deny me the tiny ones . RAND ELDRIDGE Well , I do n't like it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Tyrant ! RAND ELDRIDGE I want to be with you on all the little excursions , do you hear ? On all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're letting yourself in for . If you knew  --  in a day  --  in an hour  --  the thousand absurd and silly impulses I get . I wake up in the morning a sober woman with a sense of responsibility . An hour later I feel that I ought to be somewhere in Bali or Tahiti going native . RAND ELDRIDGE Well , why do n't we ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE A graph of my impulses , Rand dear , would make you rather dizzy . ( They both laugh . LAEL sits on arm of RAND 'S chair ) I wonder  --  I wonder where Hugo is ? p. 117 RAND ELDRIDGE ( Immediately and sharply ) Why ? Do you like him ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( His tone attracts her attention ) Yes , very much . Do n't you ? RAND ELDRIDGE ( Coldly ) I was brought up not to like his kind . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Looking at him ) Oh ! ( Looking away from him ) One is brought up with so many prejudices . RAND ELDRIDGE ( After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments before ) Let 's go to the Pier dance , Lael . LADY LAEL WYNGATE No , thank you , Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE Why not ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I do n't feel like it , really , Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE You said we 'd drop in here to see where the others were and that if they were n't about you 'd go on with me to Brighton . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Rises ) I felt gay before . I do n't any more . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Watches her ) Do I depress you ? p. 118 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Sadly  --  facing him ) Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE I 'm sorry . LADY LAEL WYNGATE It 's my fault . I 'm sorry , Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Irritated into demanding results ) Now , look here , Lael  --  you promised me a showdown and I mean to have it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Backing away a step ) Please , Rand , not now . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Following up ) Now ! You 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give me an answer . And it 's going to be yes ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Thank you for the choice . RAND ELDRIDGE Well , if it 's no  --  I 'm going to damn well know why . Lael , you 're mixed up with a lot of funny notions about politics and theories and God knows what ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Am I ? Perhaps I am . RAND ELDRIDGE Do you think I 'm going to let a lot of complicated isms stand between us ? Well , I 'm not . You 've told me enough to let me see that once you let yourself go I can make you happy . All this " highbrow " atmosphere and these seedy people you have surrounded yourself with  --  it 's all not you , Lael . I want to get you out of it  --  into some different environment where you can stop all this thinking . And where you can breathe deeply , and I 'm going to do it . p. 119 LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , Rand , I 'm so fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Finally ) It 's all I can offer you . ( A moment 's pause ) I 'm sorry . RAND ELDRIDGE But you told me only the other day that some day you 'd give in to me  --  and I believed you , Lael  --  I believed you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE What I told you then was true . But since then RAND ELDRIDGE What 's happened since then ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE I ca n't bear to hurt you , Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE What 's happened since then ? I must know , I tell you . I 've got to know . ( HUGO and JURIN appear in the French windows ; they are talking German to each other . LAEL rather rushes to them , grateful to have escaped the immediate necessity for inflicting on RAND the dreaded " showdown " ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE My two lost children ! Hugo , I 'll never forgive you  --  never as long as I live ! HUGO WILLENS Wo n't you ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE For leaving that film  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what happened ? p. 120 HUGO WILLENS Did Lord Rothschild go to heaven ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE He did and in color , my dear , in color ! Suddenly and with divine unreasonableness , Lord Rothschild and everybody else became iridescent . ( Everyone laughs ) He went to a big ball in the palace to be slapped on the back by the King . Good old Rothschild lends money to the Allies for patriotism and four per cent . You could see his pearl shirt-studs glisten with pride  --  you simply must come with me to see the end of that picture ! NIKOLAI JURIN I want to see it too . LADY LAEL WYNGATE We 'll all go . ( HOBART enters . He has received PHOEBE 'S information and stands there looking like Thor ) Now let 's have some supper , shall we ? Oh , there you are Hobart  --  just in time for supper . Mrs. Dingle 's outdone herself . ( She sees HOBART standing there like an angry and sullen god ) What 's the matter , Hobart ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you give Lord Abercrombie my love ? Did he send me his ? HOBART ELDRIDGE He did ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , that evens things up , does n't it ? ( Crosses the others and goes to HOBART ) Let 's go to supper  --  come on , everybody ! p. 121 HOBART ELDRIDGE I 'm in no mood for supper , thank you ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Oh , Hobart , do something for me , will you ? Try to enjoy life . What can we do to cheer you up ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Nothing , I 'm afraid . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Turns to others , appealing ) Jurin , Hugo , Rand  --  think of something . ( To HOBART ) Lord Abercrombie is much more cheerful than you are , Hobart . I can always make him laugh . HOBART ELDRIDGE I 'm sorry . My sense of humor is defective , I guess . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Too bad . I wonder what we can do about it . Now let me see  --  I 've known some very difficult cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy baby . Is that what it is ? But anyway , do you mind if we have supper ? HOBART ELDRIDGE No , thank you ! I must speak to Rand alone . RAND ELDRIDGE What about ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE You 're always taking him away from me . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( His tone is such that a chill falls over them ) Does that distress you , Lady Wyngate ? RAND ELDRIDGE Bart ! p. 122 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Quietly ) Of course it distresses me . ( To HUGO and JURIN ) Shall we go ? RAND ELDRIDGE I do n't like your tone , Bart . I must tell you I do n't like your tone to LADY LAEL WYNGATE Nonsense , Rand , Hobart and I understand each other . HOBART ELDRIDGE No , we do n't , Lady Wyngate  --  we do n't in the least understand each other . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hobart , if you have a grievance against me I wish you 'd tell me what it is . HOBART ELDRIDGE Shall I ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Please do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later ; so you may as well know now . ( To LADY WYNGATE ) I hope at least , Lady Wyngate , that you 're giving Rand value received . RAND ELDRIDGE What ! HOBART ELDRIDGE You fool  --  you blind fool ! The least she can do for you is to give up her present lover and take you on ! RAND ELDRIDGE Hobart ! ( HUGO and LAEL exchange a sudden look of comprehension . It dawns on them both at once what has happened ) p. 123 HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Thundering at RAND and pointing accusingly at LAEL and HUGO ) Look at them ! You have only to look at them ! RAND ELDRIDGE Lael ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Phoebe 's just told me . And she ought to know because Lady Wyngate is her successor ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( To LAEL ) So that 's what you were going to tell me . That 's why you kept putting me off ! You were wondering where he was . Well , here he is ! HUGO WILLENS Captain Eldridge  --  RAND ELDRIDGE ( Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Horrified ) Rand ! HUGO WILLENS It 's all right , Lael . This makes me feel quite at home . HOBART ELDRIDGE You swine ! Maybe those people over there are right . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hobart , please remember  --  Herr Willens is not only my lover ; he is also my guest . ( Smiles at HUGO ) @x SCENE : The same . Afternoon of the next day . JOAN and SASCHA . JOAN is rather drawing SASCHA out ; he is sulky and uncommunicative . He is at the piano with sheets of manuscript paper open before him making notes for an arrangement . JOAN ELDRIDGE Something certainly happened last night , but I ca n't discover what it is . It 's very tantalizing ! ( SASCHA does n't answer . She looks at him . He has been especially taciturn lately . Also , there are other things which make her less than contented with him ) Have you seen Hugo ? SASCHA BARASHAEV Yes . JOAN ELDRIDGE Did he say anything ? SASCHA BARASHAEV What about ? JOAN ELDRIDGE About  --  anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOAN ELDRIDGE Was there ? SASCHA BARASHAEV Between him and Rand . I must say I blame Hugo for it . JOAN ELDRIDGE What was it about ? SASCHA BARASHAEV I ca n't tell you exactly . I wish Hugo would forget this race business . p. 125 JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Studying him ) Why do you want him to forget it ? SASCHA BARASHAEV He 'll bring a lot of trouble on himself . He has already . JOAN ELDRIDGE You manage to avoid trouble . SASCHA BARASHAEV If everybody were as sensible about it as I am there 'd be no problem . JOAN ELDRIDGE By sensible you mean  --  ashamed . SASCHA BARASHAEV There 's too much said about it . It 's not important . JOAN ELDRIDGE I notice any time the question comes up you shy off . SASCHA BARASHAEV Well , Hugo 's too conscious about it . He 's out of Germany now . Why does n't he forget about it ? It 's the individual that 's important . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Slowly ) I understand better now , Sascha , your enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SASCHA BARASHAEV Oh , that 's it . Now it comes out . ( As one above that sort of thing ) Jealous ! JOAN ELDRIDGE Is n't she a bit elderly for you , Sascha ? SASCHA BARASHAEV I think she 's marvelous . She 's a marvelous woman . p. 126 JOAN ELDRIDGE How could you tell ? SASCHA BARASHAEV Well , she 's so  --  for one thing , she 's so musical . JOAN ELDRIDGE Is she ? SASCHA BARASHAEV She invited me to play at Brierly . JOAN ELDRIDGE Did you tell her your fee ? SASCHA BARASHAEV Do n't be vulgar ! JOAN ELDRIDGE When is it going to be ? SASCHA BARASHAEV Thursday . JOAN ELDRIDGE Funny she did n't invite me . SASCHA BARASHAEV I 'll ask her if you like . JOAN ELDRIDGE No , thanks . I 'm proud . As long as you 're back on Friday for our jaunt to Cornwall . SASCHA BARASHAEV Oh , Joan JOAN ELDRIDGE Yes ? SASCHA BARASHAEV I 'm staying the week-end at Brierly . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Who knew it was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date for Friday ? SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Rather miserably . He has dreaded it ) I thought I 'd better pass it up . On account of Frankly , Lady Worrell can do a lot for me. p. 127 JOAN ELDRIDGE I dare say she can . You 'll meet a lot of duchesses at Brierly . You 'll like that ! SASCHA BARASHAEV What 's wrong about liking duchesses ? They 're as good as other people , are n't they ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Better . Their blood is so much bluer ! ( A moment 's pause ) SASCHA BARASHAEV ( Deciding it 's expedient to conciliate her , faces her ) I thought you were interested in my career . After all , I 'm only doing it for you , you know  --  in a way . Once I get really established here in England I can turn my back on anybody I want to . JOAN ELDRIDGE Can you ? SASCHA BARASHAEV Except you . I can be independent . And then we  --  you and I  --  JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Turns away from him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARASHAEV ( Aggrieved ) Simply because I 'm going to Lady Worrell 's for the week-end ! ( Realizes his mistake and controls himself  --  quietly ) Now , Joan , please , I 'll get her to ask you and we 'll go together . JOAN ELDRIDGE I do n't want to go . I 'm through . p. 128 SASCHA BARASHAEV I 'm not quite sure I understand . JOAN ELDRIDGE ( Turns on him  --  emotionally ) I think you do ! Not that I 'm not in love with you . I am and I 'll have to take it , but I 've always felt it . You 're cold and calculating , and this about muffling your race is characteristic ! SASCHA BARASHAEV What do you want me to do ? Shout it from the house-tops ? JOAN ELDRIDGE It 's characteristic ! Instead of being proud and thrilled about it you are ashamed . That 's contemptible , Sascha . SASCHA BARASHAEV Oh , come now , Joan , do n't take it so big . We 'll talk it over when I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will we ? SASCHA BARASHAEV I 'm going up to practise . ( SASCHA walks up the stairs leaving her alone . She crosses to the piano seat and sits down . After a moment HUGO enters from the garden through the French windows ) HUGO WILLENS What 's the matter , Joan ? JOAN ELDRIDGE ( After a slight pause ) Well , the jig 's up , Hugo . Between Sascha and me . He prefers duchesses . p. 129 HUGO WILLENS Does it surprise you that he should ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Yes . It surprises me . HUGO WILLENS But why should it ? Like so many insecure people , Sascha is a snob . ( LAEL comes in . She takes them in . A moment 's pause ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hello , Joan . You must have come back very late last night . How was the dance ? Did you have a good time ? JOAN ELDRIDGE Not very . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'm sorry . How was the Pier dance ? Was it fun ? JOAN ELDRIDGE It was very fashionable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the lower classes go to dance . ( She goes out . LAEL watches her . A moment 's pause ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE What is it ? Sascha ? HUGO WILLENS Yes . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Sascha 's stupid . HUGO WILLENS Yes . He is stupid . He is also cunning and unscrupulous and greedy  --  and an exquisite artist , a superb artist ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE It 's unfair that these attributes should go together . Poor Joan ! What a pity she ca n't love the artist  --  and let the rest go ! p. 130 HUGO WILLENS Pity the psyche is n't operable ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Lightly ) According to you  --  it is ! An obsession , you say , may be destroyed ! ( He looks at her . A pause . He lights a cigarette . His hand trembles slightly as he does so . She notices it ) Hugo ! Your hand is trembling . Hugo HUGO WILLENS No sleep . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I 'm glad at least that you did n't sleep . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello , Rand . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Stiffly  --  it 's a great effort for him to do it ) Herp Willens HUGO WILLENS Yes , Captain Eldridge . RAND ELDRIDGE I want to apologize to you  --  for last night . For making a scene . HUGO WILLENS Please do n't . I understand it perfectly . RAND ELDRIDGE Whether you understand it or not  --  I beg you to accept my apology . HUGO WILLENS Of course . ( To LAEL ) You will excuse me . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You need n't go , Hugo . p. 131 HUGO WILLENS I want to speak to Sascha . ( HUGO exits through French windows ) ( LAEL looks at RAND . RAND is abject and broken . He has aged overnight . The fresh look in his face is gone . RAND looks at her , unable to speak . LAEL is stirred with pity for him ) LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Involuntarily , moving toward him ) Rand RAND ELDRIDGE ( In a dim voice ) I beg you  --  Lael  --  do n't be nice to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( In an ecstasy of self-reproach ) The Death of a Hero ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE What do you RAND ELDRIDGE There was a picture of me once in the Sunday section of the newspaper in my home town . In color  --  very beautiful . Crossed flags over my head . Rosy cheeks . Perfect uniform . Clear-eyed look . Heroic expression . I joked about it when I saw it but now I realize  --  now that it is gone forever  --  that I took that picture seriously . I did . It was this picture of me which I 've carried about in my mind all these years . It was my notion of myself . Decent fellow . Cleancut . Well , he went to pieces last night  --  this wonderful effigy  --  smashed to bits like a lot of cheap crockery . p. 132 LADY LAEL WYNGATE After all , you thought you had some provocation . You must n't RAND ELDRIDGE ( Pacing about ) Do n't tell me . I wanted to kill him . I wanted to tear him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her suddenly ) All last night I was up  --  walking those roads  --  wishing I had him home . So I might lynch him . That 's what I am ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Poor Rand ! RAND ELDRIDGE That 's what I am ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Rises and going to him ) In one way or another  --  that 's what everybody is . Why do you suppose we 're all staggering pitifully toward some incalculable abyss ? Because , in one way or another , that 's what everybody is . I 'm sorry , Rand dear , that I had to take you out of the Happy Hunting Grounds into the Cave of Despair . RAND ELDRIDGE ( Sits in chair before her ) Well , you 've done it all right . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Gently ) Well , it 's better than whistling away in the Never-Never Land . RAND ELDRIDGE What is there left ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Instead of an effigy  --  a human being . p. 133 RAND ELDRIDGE Pretty poor specimen . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Not so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitterly , without looking a her ) Do you ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Now you can begin to live more  --  RAND ELDRIDGE After all these years ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Why not ? You 're so young ! And you 'll find it 's much more wholesome ! RAND ELDRIDGE ( Jumps to his feet facing her ) Wholesome ! Do you call this wholesome ? Do you think that because I 've apologized to him that I 've forgiven him ? Or you ? Do you think my telling you cures me ? I forced myself to apologize to him and while I was doing it I  --  and for me you 're in spite of anything I can say to myself  --  you 're  --  you 're  --  tainted ! Now you know ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Greatly troubled ) Poor Rand  --  what have I done to you ? ( He looks at her a moment , turns and walks out swiftly . LAEL starts to follow him , stops , realizing that her explanation will only increase his despair . She is overwhelmed herself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bringing human motives into some conformity with sanity and decency overwhelm her . Into the disturbed silence comes the sound of SASCHA upstairs playing the " Intermezzo in A Major " by Brahms . She lights a cigarette . HUGO comes in . He looks at her a moment standing there and comes to her impetuously . He is very tense . He has reached a decision and he must unburden himself to her ) p. 134 HUGO WILLENS Lael  --  I must speak to you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Yes , Hugo ( Before he can go on HOBART enters . He sees them together ; to him this is another " Love Scene . " He is carrying a highball glass and crosses to the secretaire to mix himself another drink . He has been drinking steadily since last night . His eyes are bloodshot and he is quite drunk really but he holds his liquor wonderfully well , and , though he is quite shaky , you would n't know he was drunk first off unless you watched him closely ) HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Seeing them ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so am I ( Holds up his glass ) at this ! Just different ways of killing time , that 's all . I 'm not what you call a drinking man ordinarily ( Takes a drink ) but lot to be said for it  --  makes you see things in  --  proportion ! ( To HUGO ) What is there about you fellows anyway that makes women go crazy about you ? ( To LAEL ) What is it , Lady Wyngate ? Mystery ? Romance ? Passion ? What is it ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Starts to go ) Perhaps I 'd better Is Mrs. Eldridge ? p. 135 HOBART ELDRIDGE Do n't go . I 'm not drunk  --  not very , anyway . I wo n't be objectionable  --  promise . Been all day without a soul to speak to . Phoebe has one of her headaches  --  she 's had ' em for years . You ca n't go near her when she has a headache . ( With a glare at HUGO ) I ca n't anyway . ( He and HUGO look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing boisterously ) Maybe you think it 's on account of Phoebe I 'm drinking ? Do you think that is the sorrow I 'm trying to drown ? That 's good ! That 's very good ! I 've got more to worry about than that , my good fellow . You 'll be glad to hear , Lady Wyngate , that my negotiations with Lord Abercrombie have broken down . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Have they ? I 'm sorry . HOBART ELDRIDGE Why should you be sorry ? Besides , you 're not sorry ! You 're glad ! He 's a very clever man , is n't he , Lady Wyngate ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Yes . He 's clever ! HOBART ELDRIDGE Knows a hell of a lot , does n't he ? That little smile of his  --  those little wrinkled eyes . Well , I thought I had him . Thought he realized how serious things were for us  --  the haves against the have-nots  --  the last fight . Thought he knew it , thought I 'd convinced him of it . Thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all of sudden  --  last night  --  felt him slipping away from me  --  he began to joke  --  little jokes  --  flippant  --  then he told me p. 136 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Curious ) What ? HOBART ELDRIDGE That , " on mature consideration , " he 'd decided the idea of Anglo-American Youth League would n't go down . He 'd be glad to advise me on any project I 'd care to undertake , but he made it clear he could n't be in on it . Press of business in London  --  demands of his papers  --  all that rot . He 'd just decided  --  God knows what decided him  --  to let me down . ( Fanatically ) I tell you he does n't understand  --  none of them understand ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Understand what ? HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Same voice ) The danger  --  the danger they 're heading for  --  we 're all heading for  --  all last night I sat up facing it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Facing it ! Facing what ? HOBART ELDRIDGE Losing everything I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for . For money  --  for money  --  I 've given up everything . My wife hates me , and my daughter  --  all of that  --  but my fortune and the power it gave me  --  were mine . Now they 're threatened . They 're in danger  --  terrible danger  --  and nobody 'll do anything about it  --  nobody . ( Turns on HUGO suddenly ) They 're in danger from you ! You think it 's my wife I 'm worried about ? I 've got a deeper grievance against you than that . You think it 's because you killed Christ that we fear and hate you  --  No ! It 's because you gave birth to Lenin ! p. 137 HUGO WILLENS ( Murmuring ) You over-estimate us ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Really , Hobart , you must n't drink any more . HOBART ELDRIDGE ( In despair ) What is there left but to drink ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Nonsense . Your fortune 'll last you your lifetime . You need n't worry . HOBART ELDRIDGE What do you know about it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in danger I 'm as sensitive as a cat . I can tell you because I know . Better than Abercrombie with his cynical manner and his flippancy , better than anybody . We 're doomed  --  all of us rich men . It 's a question  --  as such things are reckoned  --  it 's a question of minutes  --  and it 'll overwhelm us all . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , you 'll be no worse off than the rest of us , will you ? HOBART ELDRIDGE No worse off ! No worse off ! Where 's the comparison ? You do n't care about money . You 're sloppy about money . You do n't love it as I do . You do n't count on it as I do . It does n't sustain you , it does n't compensate you for everything else you 've missed . And yet you say I 'll be no worse off . You 're as near-sighted as Abercrombie . LADY LAEL WYNGATE He has as much to lose as you . His lightness should give you hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a newspaperman  --  not a financier ! When the Last Trumpet calls , it 'll be just another headline to him ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Well , you 've had your innings  --  and a very good time too . If you have to give way  --  well , put a good face on it . Buck up . Be sporting . HOBART ELDRIDGE Ca n't  --  ca n't Who 's going to pay for everything  --  that 's what I 'd like to know ? ( He again confronts HUGO ) Who 's going to pay ? Will you Communists pay ? HUGO WILLENS If you capitalists lend us the money HOBART ELDRIDGE ( A bit taken back ) Well , you sha n't have it ! And there 's Rand ( Very confidentially to HUGO ) Do you know what his expeditions have cost ? Do you know what I 've spent in my lifetime for hospitals , scientific research , even art ? Who 's going to pay after we 're gone ? Who 's going to pay ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Bart , please HOBART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poles ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE Bart , please ( Into the room from upstairs comes the sound of SASCHA playing the " Intermezzo in E Flat Minor " of Brahms ) p. 139 HOBART ELDRIDGE ( Turning to LAEL for sympathy this time ) Do you know , since the surtax , my income 's shrunk to nothing ? Do you know what I pay each year to the Government  --  State and Federal ? ( He begins to weep . He becomes aware of the music and rushes to the foot of the stairs in the alcove , crying as he goes ) There 's another one ! Listen to him up there ! ( At the foot of the stairs ) Who 's going to pay for your Goddamn concerts ! ( Rushes to the secretaire and grabs a bottle of whiskey ) You 'll see ! ( He starts out , crying like a baby , and through his blubbering says ) You 'll want us back ! ( He goes out . There is an embarrassed pause . During the following scene between LAEL and HUGO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world only one thing  --  and to face losing that  --  well , as Sascha might say , it 's no joke ! LADY LAEL WYNGATE In the sixteenth century  --  when people went to the Tower to be executed  --  it 's always struck me how casually they died . Something beyond gallantry . Just before they put their heads on the block  --  it 's extraordinary how they prayed for king and country . We 've lost that . p. 140 HUGO WILLENS They merely faced death . Mr. Eldridge faces extinction . LADY LAEL WYNGATE That 's true . Suspicion and fear HUGO WILLENS To be accused simultaneously of killing Christ and giving birth to Lenin  --  quite a feat , I must say ! Just the same , Mr. Eldridge would do pretty well if he had the upper hand . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Smiling ) Hobart 's an American and does n't really understand democracy . HUGO WILLENS He 's drowning in a reality he does n't understand . He hates me because LADY LAEL WYNGATE He does n't hate you . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocating the world . HUGO WILLENS How 're you going to get rid of them ? Through some cosmic psychoanalysis ? LADY LAEL WYNGATE Through understanding . HUGO WILLENS While you 're understanding the enemy , he will destroy you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE The eternal impasse . HUGO WILLENS Unless  --  you destroy him first . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( A moment 's pause ) You 're inexorable , Hugo , ruthlessly analytical . You 're always looking for the motive behind the motive . p. 141 HUGO WILLENS ( He looks at her a moment , then crosses to her , sitting beside her on the sofa ) Yesterday I fell in love . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Hugo . HUGO WILLENS All through dinner , sitting near you in the car going to the cinema , in the theatre  --  I was in love . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I know . I too . HUGO WILLENS I thanked God for the miracle that filled me with longing for you . From my being alone , from my isolation , from the less than nothing I had to offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on me , and Rand , too , I felt strong , omnipotent  --  but when you turned to me so magnanimously before them all , that did for me . I felt like a thief in the pillory to whom a sentimental bystander throws a rose . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Your pride is devastating . HUGO WILLENS Yes . And then I went up to my room . I sat at the window and looked over the garden , asleep in the moonlight . Enchantment . And suddenly the unreality of everything , of my presence here in this house overcame me . I thought : What can I hope for  --  what can I foresee  --  vistas of bliss in this pleasant country-house  --  with you . But what would it end in  --  a self-indulgent day-dream . I thought : What am I doing here ? What am I ? p. 142 LADY LAEL WYNGATE What am I ? HUGO WILLENS It 's your home . You belong here . But for me LADY LAEL WYNGATE But , Hugo , do n't you see ? I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceless world . HUGO WILLENS I hoped for love  --  without philanthropy . LADY LAEL WYNGATE How untrue half truths are . I sat up last night too  --  thinking  --  about Rand and you  --  everything  --  For the first time in months it seemed to me I felt clear  --  I felt free . I had thought that never again would I be lost in an emotion that I could accept entirely without reservation . To love and not to be ashamed to love . This miracle I felt would never happen to me again  --  and now it has . HUGO WILLENS ( Kisses her hand ) You are all there is left in the world for me to love . I 'll never forget you . Your radiance , your goodness , your compassion . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( After a moment ) That has a valedictory sound , Hugo . HUGO WILLENS Yes . I must leave you . I must go . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Where ? HUGO WILLENS Back to Germany . p. 143 LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Almost in terror ) Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll  --  stop you . HUGO WILLENS I must risk it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Do n't go , Hugo ! HUGO WILLENS I must . I must . Look at my career  --  a public taster of the arts  --  a dilettante in everything , except that I was paid . Behind this decorative curtain I was forced to discover that there is a harsh reality . Well , I must investigate this reality further . To stay here , to go to America would only be a continuation of my life before . Intellectual squirearchy ! I was able to feed my vanity with the comfort of knowing that I made and unmade reputations . Lehrmann  --  I made Lehrmann  --  I created a world in which Lehrmann was king ; and what sort of a world is it ? Out of egotism and vanity I created worlds without testing the foundations on which they rested . A criminal architect who builds houses that topple on their hapless tenants . I see now that there is only one thing left : To destroy the inhuman  --  to discover humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity  --  as if it were an abstraction  --  an essence like the elixir of life which you might find somewhere in a bottle and dispense . Hugo , listen , humanity is here , all around us . I tell you what I wish you 'd do . Humor me . Let me take you for a holiday through our shires and let me show you our common folk . You 'll find them kindly and gentle . In their faces you 'll see how impossible , how far beyond them , are ferocity or brutality or mass-hate . Let me take you , Hugo , and you 'll see  --  you 'll be comforted . p. 144 HUGO WILLENS But I do n't want to be comforted . I do n't want to be soothed . What you say about England is true . I feel it in you who are the best of England . But what right have I to this immunity ? A sybarite in a famine . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You 're an artist , Hugo . What have you to do with feuds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as I see it ? You see , I believe in England . I believe in gradualness . I believe in muddling through . I believe  --  a poor foolish illusion . I suppose  --  I believe that in the main people are reasonable and corrigible and sweet  --  fragments of God . HUGO WILLENS That is n't a belief . It 's a mirage . A self-hypnosis . A wish-fulfillment . LADY LAEL WYNGATE I allow for that . And is it your dream that the world , overnight , can be scrubbed clean of injustice and left glowing with humanity ? HUGO WILLENS It 's that I must find certitude at last , and , having found it , if necessary , die for it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Or kill for it ? HUGO WILLENS Or kill for it . LADY LAEL WYNGATE You are leaving to fight a mania as ravaging as a forest fire that burns down everything before it , leaving stumps and ashes where there had been strength and growth . I do n't want it to consume you , Hugo , dearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it  --  and to me. p. 145 HUGO WILLENS Dearest Lael  --  I ca n't stay because of one thing  --  that I remember the past year . And what I remember LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Understanding completely ) Would n't let you rest . HUGO WILLENS No . I 'm determined at last to view the world  --  including myself  --  completely without illusion . It 's a matter of life and death . I see now that goodness is not enough , that kindness is not enough , that liberalism is not enough . I 'm sick of evasions . They 've done us in . Civilization , charity , progress , tolerance  --  all the catchwords . I 'm sick of them . We 'll have to re-define our terms . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( Seeing the inevitability of their separation ) The iron has entered into your soul , Hugo . You have crossed some frontier  --  into some region  --  where I can not follow you . HUGO WILLENS If I can ever return  --  it will be to you . LADY LAEL WYNGATE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a genius for wandering and a genius for remaining behind . There is the shooting star and the fixed . Perhaps when you come back  --  you will find that in our own way we have realized your dream . p. 146 HUGO WILLENS I know this  --  that while you live  --  one need n't despair . LADY LAEL WYNGATE Then you need never despair . For nothing will destroy me . ( With deep feeling , her valedictory ) I shall live forever and so will you . Our enemies will beat against us and find that we have a strength beyond their clamor , beyond their forces . ( HUGO and LAEL look deeply into each other 's eyes without moving . Then HUGO turns and goes out . LAEL watches him until he has left the room , starts instinctively to follow him , stops . RAND enters from the garden ) RAND ELDRIDGE Lael ! ( LAEL stops but does n't face him . She is looking away into some vision of her own ) RAND ELDRIDGE Joan 's just told me , Lael  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . I ca n't tell you how I feel  --  how humiliated  --  If there was any way I could make you see how deeply ashamed I am  --  you 'd  --  you 'd ( There is the sound of a motor leaving the driveway )
