CAPTAIN HORATIO HORNBLOWER-C . S. Forester-Little , Brown ( $2.75 ) . <P> It was bargain day this week for adventure-story readers . For the price of one big book , they could get three . Captain Horatio Hornblower is an omnibus of Cecil Scott Forester 's three novels ( the first two , Beat to Quarters and Ship of the Line already published ) of an English naval genius in Napoleonic times . More imaginative than Mutiny on the Bounty , it is that rare book , adventure romance treated realistically , lively entertainment with sound historical background , fast narrative with subtle characterization . Captain Horatio Hornblower stacks up with the most exciting and best written adventure stories in the language . <P> Captain Hornblower has no actual prototype , though he somewhat resembles Admiral Nelson . A tall , slightly paunchy sea dog with thinning hair , Hornblower is a highstrung , self-doubting man who gets seasick at the start of a cruise , worries about losing his job , goes clammy at the start of a fight , pales at the sight of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for imperturbability . <P> What love interest there is in the story plays only a minor and ironic part , centres around the younger ( mythical ) sister of Sir Arthur Wellesley ( later Duke of Wellington ) . Forester 's big guns are trained on Hornblower 's spectacular sea fights , his three engagements against the 50-gun Spanish man-of-war Natividad off the coast of South America , his daring raids on French men-of-war in the Mediterranean , his recapture of a British 10-gun cutter at Nantes , his escape from Napoleon 's firing squad . <P> Finale to Hornblower 's saga is unconventional . As England 's great hero of the hour , knighted , rich , free to marry his Lady Barbara , he suddenly realizes in the midst of his triumphs that from then on he is not going to have any more fun at all . <P> The Author . Wiry , soft-voiced , 39-year-old Cecil Scott Forester has written more than 20 books , took 15 years to find the public 's range . Born in Cairo , Egypt , the son of a British civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a medical student at Guy 's Hospital , London . His interest in the sea began on trips between Egypt and England during his boyhood , on one of which he was wrecked off Malaga . Between the ages of 23 and 26 , while writing ads , peddling verse and carpets , he wrote several novels and biographies , prefers not to be reminded of them . Payment Deferred , his grim study in murder , was a success on the stage and screen ( it started Charles Laughton on his career ) , but did not sell well as a book . The Gun , an adventure story of the Peninsular War , and The African Queen , a story of a virgin and a Cockney on an African river , won him critical success among adventure connoisseurs , but sold only moderately . His best book , The General , a subtle attack on stuffed-shirt generals , sold 1,935 copies in the U. S. By Teutonic mistake , Author Forester 's fame is particularly bright in Germany , where The General is still widely regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
