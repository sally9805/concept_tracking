txt A flurry was created in the Manchester Cotton Exchange by the announcement of breakdown of negotiations for the connection of more looms per weaver . Employers and weavers have been unable to come to an agreemer t as to the amount of minimum wage to be assured under the system . The differences between the two parties narrowed down to betwen two and three shillings per week , but when this point was reached both sides were adamant It is hoped that the breakdown is not final , but opinion rules in the market that negotiations will not be resumed , without outside intervention . Dull conditions have prevailed in the Manchester cotton market . Cloth inquiry has been restricted and most offers are so low that even the neediest manufacturers have refused to consider negotiations . There has been no improvement in the demand from India . A feature of the market has been buying from China of various kinds of poplins . Trade has been moderate for finishing cloths with Egypt and smaller Near East markets . Home trade has been quiet , due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand from the Continent . Spinners in the American and Egyptian yarn sections are inactive . The news of the breakdown in negotiations between employers and weavers in the Manchester sections in connection with increase in operations of more looms by each weaver appeared to have little effect as a factor in the local market . Comment was made that operations there have been on a much reduced scale .
