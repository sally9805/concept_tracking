No , I 'm all right now . It was just my head , and it 's all right now . I guess it scared Mr. and Mrs. Clement . I felt so funny . I did n't know what had happened to me , hardly . I never fainted before in my life , if you call that a faint . They tell you what I did ? Mr. Clement was reading the paper , and I was dryin ' the dishes and settin ' ' em up . The Grahams was here and we 'd used the good dishes . I said to Mrs. Clement at supper it was a pity Teacher was invited out when we had such a good supper , but you had just as good or better where you was , I expect . It 's nice to get a change of cooking , anyway . I was setting up the goblets , and I come in with two in each hand , and opened the cupboard latch with my thumb , to set them away , and Mr. Clement was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy spell and my knees just would n't bear me up . I turned half round , and down I went with my back against the cupboard . I suppose they told you how it was . And when I was goin ' down I remember thinking , ' My soul , Mrs. Clement 's goblets ! ' and I rested them in my lap , and though I loosed my hold on them when I fainted away , they was safe in the slack of my apron , and I knew they was before I let go my mind . Five is all she 's got left of her wedding set , and I know she 'd never a said a word , it happening the way itdid , but I 'd hate like everything to a broken one of them . They lifted me up , and when I 'd come to a little they helped me upstairs , one on one side and one on the other , and she took off my shoes and got me my gown , and Mr. Clement , he went down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my feet , and a bottle of cherry wine and poured me some . They was just as anxious and concerned . They 've never made me feel anything but at home and one of the family . There 's never anyone sat down at their table they would n't want me to set a plate for myself with . They 're good people . It was the oddest thing to faint away like that . I felt so foolish before Mr. Clement when I come to . I was glad the Grahams had left , anyway . Mr. Clement was reading the paper and I was settin ' the goblets up , and I sunk down and I could n't a lifted a hand or opened my eyes to save me . They tell you what it was he was reading ? Well , I 'm glad they did n't . It 's a relief to me . I guess they did n't even notice , then , or think a thing . He was reading the Gaylord items . Ever drive over by Gaylord ? It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms over beyond . I used to work over past there , and my folks , they lived in Gaylord . I guess there 's nobody ever thinks now I ever did work any place but here . And there 's some thinks I 'm 549 related to Mrs. Clement 's folks . Of course the people in my own church know better . I 'm no relation at all . My folks lived in Gaylord , and I worked out with a family that lived over beyond . You may a heard of somebody goin ' over to Wingates ' for apples . They have the orchards . You never saw so much land in apple trees . I was there the year after the old part began to bear , and I helped set out some of the new part myself . I worked there . And Mr. Clement did n't mention to you what he was reading out to Mrs. Clement and me ? What he 'd just read out when I fainted away ? I guess they did n't notice . I guess there was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it , really , except for the baby 's burn , and everyone knew that . But no one blamed me , not even Mrs. Wingate , and the doctor kept pattin ' my shoulder and said , It 's no fault of yours , Minnie . ' Oh , you never know ! You think a thing is over and done with and buried deep , and then you hear an item read out like that from the weekly , ' They are cutting down the old part of the Wingate orchard , ' and faint dead away . II Ah , it was a nice place ! But work , though ? plenty of work . But I was strong as two girls then , and I never cared . Mrs. Wingate was poorly . She suffered from sick-headache spells , suffered with ' em so ! They always kept a girl . First , when I first came , she 'd get up and come out in the kitchen and walk around with her hand on her head , and the other out in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and tell me what to do . It was n't only her head , but her back , too . All she wanted was to lie down with the blinds drawn . After I 'd been there three or four days , and she seen I could do all right , she left me plan , and cook , and wash , and everything . She said she 'd never seen the like in a girl , and she was so glad she just cried . Seems she had n't had good luck with girls . Land , I did n't know anything different ! To home there was nine of us , and five girls , and we could all cook and sew . I ca n't remember when I could n't , hardly , and if we 'd a shirked we 'd a caught it . Anyway , I liked to cook and have things nice . And their baby ! She could n't say a word when I come , and I taught her to talk and to say her prayers , and one for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sewed for her , too . Mrs. Wingate would say , ' Minnie , are n't you tired ? Come on in here and sit down where it 's cool awhile . She 's got plenty . You do n't need to sew for her . ' But you know , I 'd rather . Pink or blue , she wore one as good as the other , and I 'd make her little dresses and skirts and panties , smock ' em and cross-stitch ' em , and make tatting edging . And when I 'd get her in a new dress and set her up in her high chair and curl her hair round my finger , she was just a picture , just a flower . And I never spoiled her , either . I was firm with her if she got into things . Just one good spat and she 'd remember . Oh , she was sweet , and her eyes were blue . Mrs. Wingate 's eyes were brown . It was his was the blue . But I ought n't to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . This has kinda shaken me , I guess . Mr. Wingate ! You do n't see any men like that now . There ai n't any , I guess . Men used to be bigger and a lot finerlookin ' , it seems to me . I helped outside and in . He 'd whistle for me , and I 'd see the baby was strapped safe in her chair , and Mrs. Wingate was all right , and out I 'd run and help him lift a rack on a wagon , or get a sow back in , or whatever he needed . And always , ' Thank you , Minnie . ' Just that . It was summer when I came , and I was seventeen and had n't ever worked out before , or been away from home , even . First night I cried and cried . It was so queer and lonesome to be in a bed by myself . I got up and lit the lamp again and read my Bible . And in the morning I asked could I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Of course , ' and was glad of it . So then she slept with me . I was so strong then . I could wash and iron the same day , and if I was a little tired I 'd go to bed right after I got the supper dishes done and get up at five , and never feel it . Mrs. ' Wingate did n't get up for breakfast , hardly ever . She liked her tea and I 'd bring it to her in bed , and she 'd drink it without cream or sugar and go back to sleep if her head would let her . Poor thing ! She was wretched . I kept everything up nice . I 'd sew and I 'd mend , and can and put up , and look after the chickens , and the little garden up by the house . And I liked it . Sometimes I 'd be moppin ' up in the morning , maybe , or sprinklin ' down the clothes , and the smell of the clean things , and the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? oh , my heart would swell , and I 'd feel like it was all mine , and no harm or wrong in it , either . I was so young and so green ! Why , if anybody 'd said to me a man could care about a girl besides his wife , ? a married man like that , and a good man , ? I 'd a laughed . We did n't take a paper to home , and I did n't even know there was such things as that happen . When I 'd play it was mine , the baby and all , it was like a little girl would . He was Mr. Wingate , and she was Mrs. Wingate , and I worked there and got my two dollars a week . I do n't know as it is a thing to tell , or that I ought to , or got a right . We 'd eat breakfast , Mr. Wingate and me , and I 'd wrap the baby up in a blanket and bring her out in the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other part of the house . And the baby ' d wake up most of the time as soon as I did , and I 'd bring her out and set her in her high chair while I got the breakfast . He always built the fire . And when I 'd brought Mrs. Wingate her tea in bed I 'd set the table . He 'd come in with the milk , and while I took up the breakfast he 'd dress the baby ? stand her up in her high chair , and pull her gown off over her head , and hold her little undergarments for her , and get her into them . And she 'd plague him , little as she was , and put her foot in the wrong leg hole , or when he was puttin ' on her shoes and stockings she 'd go limp and throw her head back and laugh and laugh , and he could n't do a thing with her . She 'd just make a monkey of him , and I 'd have to come straighten her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Wingate got up to eat or not , just as she felt like ? and I was running out to help him whenever he whistled for me . And I never thought a thing then , and neither did he , so far as I know . My folks was stern and I was brought up right ? to work , and mind , and to read my Bible every night , and I did . I 'd sit with something round me and read five or six chapters sometimes , after I was in bed , and learn a Psalm or some verses by heart . And I prayed for the Wingates the same as for my folks , and give thanks I had such a good place . Winters there was n't so much to do , and I knit . I knit a big shawl , navy blue , for Mrs. Wingate , and a little pink sweater , and cap and mittens to match , for the baby , and she was so proud of those little mittens she wore one round so much I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made a pair for Mr. Wingate , too , black with red in the ribbing . Everything was all right , and if it had n't been for the blizzard maybe nothing would ever have been different , and maybe it would have come up anyway , sooner or later . I do n't know . Here I am telling you this , Teacher , and no other soul knows it . III There was this big snow , a blizzard . It come up all at once . Mr. Wingate went out for the cows , and there was a heifer he could n't find , and he come in to get the wood for me and then went out again to look for her ? would n't set down to his supper . Mrs. Wingate ate and was n't worried . But I worried . I could n't help it . I put the baby to bed , and then I just walked up and down . I could n't knit or anything . And Mrs. Wingate said , ' Why do n't you go to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , and always indoors like she was . She was like a baby . I opened the door and let the snow drive in , once , just to show her , but she did n't have the life to scare . She says , ' He 'll be all right , ' and went to bed . And I waited up . By and by I put on my overshoes and my wraps . I was goin ' out to look for him . Mrs. Wingate heard me , and called to me to come in and get down another comfort and spread it over her . She seen I was wrapped up , and she says , Do n't go out , Minnie . I do n't want you to go out and leave the baby . ' She was scared for the baby , but she was n't scared for him . Maybe you do n't think a woman would be so sick she would n't be scared for her husband ? Well , they do get that sick . A body can be so sick they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got to be pretty sick not to think of their children . She thought he could stand anything . And he did come in at last . When I heard him at the door ? oh , if you do n't know , you just do n't know , that 's all ! My heart ! I could a sung . She called and says , ' Is that you , Mr. Wingate ? ' He was so beat he could n't even answer her . He just dropped in a chair by the stove . I called that it was him . And I took off his mittens and his cap and his shoes and socks . He thought his feet was froze and I thought they was too . I brung in snow and rubbed and rubb4d ' em , and then I poured cold water in the pan and rubbed ' em more , and by and by he says , ' They 're all right , Minnie . ' And then I did a thing ? I do n't know what you 'll think ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he put his hands on my head and started to say something to me , and we could n't talk , not him nor me , and he lifted me up and hugged me so , and put back my hair from my face . He did say something and then he kissed me . And what he said I ca n't remember . Mrs. Wingate called to him pretty soon to come to bed , and he let me go , and I took up my lamp ? it was the kitchen lamp I used ? and went in my room . I prayed , but I did n't read my Bible . I felt I was n't to touch it . The thing I 'd done ! I thought I would n't close my eyes , but I did . When morning came it was still bad and the wind howling . I heard him come out to the kitchen and fix the fire . When he 'd gone to do the chores , I went out in the kitchen to dress , and then I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the milk , and he came in where I was and I whirled round , and he says , ' Do n't be afraid of me , Minnie . I ca n't have you afraid of me ! ' And I says , ' I ai n't afraid , Mr. Wingate . It was me , too . I just do n't want to go away and leave the baby . ' That was what come into my mind to say . And he said I was n't to go , ever , and if he ever did the like of that again I was to pick up a stick of cordwood and hit him over the head with it , and that I was a good girl . You 're good yourself , ' I said . The baby woke and cried then , and I went and got her and he dressed her . He meant that , what he said , too , and he give me no cause to go . He would n't hardly talk to me after that , lest Mrs. Wingate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to help him he 'd be so short with me . I did n't care , though , not so long as he 'd leave it so I would n't have to go away . I was n't going to have a married man kissing me ? not one I worked for , most of all . I knew what was right . Mrs. Wingate got to feeling better there for a while and was up and around , but she overdid and got the grippe and we moved a cot out in the kitchen for her and set it along between the windows , and had the doctor out for her . And she 'd watch me while I worked and said it was just a pleasure to see someone swing a bucket of water up on a table like that and it not hurt her back . One day I was working bread and she said to me , ' Minnie , if ever anything happens to me , I want you to have the baby . I 'd rather you than anybody in the world . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within one of breaking down and telling her about that night of the blizzard and us kissing , but I thought better of it . It was him too , and if he wanted her to know it he was the one to tell her . I was workin ' the bread , and I stood there bitin ' my lip and the tears running and my hands in the dough , and she called me over to her where she was on the cot bed , and took the corner of my apron and wiped my face . And she never thought a thing ? never . She was n't nervous in the way most women are , that sick . She was n't jumpy . She was just limp and quiet , and all she wanted was to lie still and not have the sun in her face . Her sleepin ' there in the kitchen , we 'd never talk over a whisper while we was havin ' breakfast . And I was glad to have her there . It was easier , and that 's a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was better and wanted back to her own bed ; and after that , eatin ' with him alone again ? oh , I did n't know how it was goin ' to be ? day in and day out . One morning I said I was homesick and I wanted to go home to see my little sister confirmed , and he said it was all right for me to go . He drove over and got a neighbor woman to stay a few days , and I went home to Gaylord with the mailman , and helped finish up my little sister 's dress and went to church , and all . But I was restless and could n't sit still to visit . All I wanted was to go back to Wingates ' . And I went with the mailman before they expected me , and the baby come running out to meet me and her arms held out , and Mrs. Wingate was worse . The woman could n't get on with the baby , had her crying and was tattlin ' on her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at noon , to see his face ? he was so glad I 'd come ? and everything was all right , and I made a coffee cake for supper . Then the trees budded out and it was lovely . You 'd be washing dishes and the smell of the trees would come in at the window and at the door , like a wave of the sea . And so pretty every time you looked out . I took the baby out in the orchard in the afternoon and made her a crown of just blossoms and grass , and Mr. Wingate , he come out where we was , in the orchard , and come right up and dropped down beside us where we was , and I thought , ' This is nothing ? this is nothing to run away about . He ' 11 do all right ; he means just as well as I do , ' and he kissed the baby and she took the crown off her head and set it on mine , and he kissed me . When he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he kissed me and did n't let me go she just stood there , her hands apart and her eyes wide , and he seen and I seen that that little baby knew it was wrong . Yes , she did , a little baby like that that could hardly talk yet . He let me go and I run on into the house . Mrs. Wingate 's room was on the other side , and when I went in she was asleep , and a wet cloth over her face . I was goin ' to tell him I had to go now , but I seen ? why , he could n't eat his supper . He was as sorry as I was , and I thought if I went away , what would I do ? To gilie up a good place like that and Mrs. Wingate so nice to me and everything , and what could I tell my folks ? They did n't need me at home and was glad I had such a good place . And if I told them they 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I told you was all there was to tell . That night it turned cold again and he went out and built fires in the orchard , ? not too big ones , but small , to keep the blossoms from frosting , ? and I had to go out and help him , and all night we was out there going from fire to fire along between the rows , puttin ' on a little wood where it was needed , and the sky was so clear and starry , and the firelight come up pink on the apple tree blossoms , so pink you 'd think they was peach instead of apple . And all the flickerin ' and dancing , the light on the branches and the fires , and us passin ' each other again and again and again , and our arms full of wood , and neither of us speakin ' , except about the fires . Then it begun to get light , the birds to call , a few , and he come and says , ' Go on in and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laid down in my clothes , I was so tired , and in the morning , early , Mrs. Wingate got up and come in and took off my shoes , and I never knew and did n't wake till almost dinner time . V And in June they had some money left them , left to Mr. Wingate , and he had to go away to see about it and was gone a week . They had one of those German boys over to do the chores and what work he 'd laid out to be done , and I went out and helped him and it was so nice to be out and around . So long there I did n't go out at all , unless he 'd whistle , and he hardly did any more . Only for the eggs and the chickens and to work in the little garden up by the house , that was all I 'd be out for , and then while the boy was there I went out and helped milk , and feed the calves , and everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought a new suitcase besides the one he took away with him . There was a lot of toys for the baby , a doll that walked , and a plainer one for every day , and rhinestone side combs and goods for two good dresses for Mrs. Wingate . He opened up the things and gave them to them , and Mrs. Wingate called him over and said something to him , and I knew she was askin ' had he forgot to get anything for me , and I was so vexed and ashamed , and I went out to the cave , to put the butter and the cream away , and when I came in // he 'd gone out and she said she wanted me to have one of the dresses . Said that she never went out at all , and had n't any need for it , and that I was to take my pick , and I held out I did n't need it , and was n't going to take it when it was her present , and she just insisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the blue . And I was hurt with him , and pretty mad . And when round supper I went out to get some water , he was there by the well and drew the bucket up for me and set it on the curb , and then he said , ' Did you think I would forget you , Minnie ? Did you ? ' And he took a red box out of his pocket and opened up the lid and took out a bracelet , solid gold , and put it on my wrist . It was a heavy bracelet , wide , and rounded out , and carved on the outside was flowers ? blossoms , or maybe a wild rose ? and inside was my name , in fancy writing ? Minnie . I did n't know what to do and he thought I was n't going to take it , and he begun to beg me , and he said if he was n't goin ' to be good to me would n't I a known the night we kept the fires ? And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that day in the pantry was a promise , and he 'd never make me sorry if I 'd keep the bracelet and stay on . And I said I 'd stay , but that I would n't wear it , at least not daytimes , and he said , ' Would you wear it when you sleep , Minnie ? ' And I said sometimes I would . I cut out and made Mrs. Wingate her dress , but the blue one I had her put away , and she says , All right , Minnie . It 's so nice , you save it and maybe it will be your wedding dress . ' One day I lied to her . I wore the bracelet at night . One morning early the baby woke up and would n't get back to sleep , and she found the bracelet on my arm and wanted it . It was barely getting light , and I took it off and let her play with it , and she played a long time and I went back to sleep . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands , and I loosed her fingers from it and took and put it in my handkerchief box where I kept it under my Sunday handkerchief . And that afternoon I was sewing and it was time for Baby 's nap and her mother was trying to put her to sleep , and she kept askin ' and beggin ' for something , and kept saying , ' Ring , ring . ' And her mother took off her ' wedding ring and give it to her to hold a little and she threw it on the floor and says , ' Big ring . ' Mrs. Wingate says to me , ' What on earth does she want , Minnie ? ' The baby got down off the bed where she was , in my room , and run to me , and felt of my wrist and cried , and I said to Mrs. Wingate , ' I do n't know . I have n't any idea . ' I had n't been reading my Bible then , not since the day he kissed me in the orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd read and I 'd pray too , and I did , but I could n't tell her that I lied because there was him , and what would she think ? I thought I 'd say some morning , ' This is what she wanted . ' Bring it out to her and show her and say he give it to me for my present for helping save the fruit ? and I could n't . Then one day a thunderstorm come up and he come in and said I 'd better get my little chicks in , and I run and got them covered , and when I got in it was just dark blue outdoors and the sickest light over everything . And he called me to the kitchen door to hear the rain on the corn , hear it before there was so much as a drop on the cottonwood fluff there in the yard . Then the rain come ? come just like a wall . And there was such a clap of thunder ? not like in the sky but in the earth , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder right on it ! And I yelled , and put my head against him and he put his arm around me , and then he let me go , and Mrs. Wingate was callire me to come and shut down the windows . I done that when it thundered ? I put my head against him . And in her room I looked in the dresser mirror and there was the print in my forehead of the overall suspender buckle , and he had n't done a thing but put his arm around me . Did n't kiss me ? only put his arm around me . That was in July , and there was all that hot long summer , and we never done a thing to plague each other , but I said to myself I was sure now that it was all right for me to stay . And he was proud to see how sure I was . They were n't church people , though I guess they used to be when she was well , but they knew what was right , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples , and he got the German boys in again , and I went out and helped ' em , and I was n't scared of them ? I do n't know why . We started singing , and we sung and sung , pickin ' up the apples and loadin ' ' em , and me and the boys played catch with ' em , and laughed and fooled around , and Mr. Wingate he just stood there with his hands hangin ' and so surprised , like I was a different person , and half mad and half it . Next morning when we was alone and having breakfast he says that maybe he was wrong , and he was a pig to keep me on there , and maybe I 'd better go to town and tell my folks it was too lonesome out at Wingates ' , and get me another place so I could go more and be with young folks more . He said he 'd be glad to say a good word for me and so would Mrs. Wingate , he knew , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I asked him was that what he really wanted me to do , and he says , You know , Minnie , what I want is to have you here all the time . ' And I said , ' Then I 'll stay . I 'll stay so long as things are the way they have been all along . ' And he pushed back his plate and reached across the table and took hold of my hand , and says , ' So help me God , Minnie ! ' Then the German boys drove in the yard and he went out to tell them where to pick . That afternoon he sent the boys to town with a load , sent the two of them because the team was fractious . I was makin ' apple butter out of apples that was n't good to sell , and had it in the big iron kettle on the stove . And I seen the boys drive out of the yard with the wagon , and both of them waved to me . Mrs. Wingate was lyin ' down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rennin ' around and askin ' me somethin ' over and over , or just sayin ' , ' Minnie ! Minnie ! Minnie ! ' for fun . It was such a day ! Still and warm , but not really hot , with the smell of apples out of doors and in , and the air just humming . He was out in the orchard . I was stirring the apple butter and minding it so it would n't burn , and the baby was talking and talking away . And all at once I heard him whistle for me . I do n't know . I was used to him whistlin ' for me when he wanted me to come out and help him . I do n't know what it was , but something spoke to me and said , ' You stay in , Minnie . ' The baby put her head on one side and listened and said , ' That ' s Daddy . That 's Daddy whistlin ' , Minnie . ' It was hot in there , over the stove . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for me , and I thought , I 'll run out a minute . He needs me for somethin ' . I 'll run out and tell him what I been thinkin ' ? that maybe it would be better if he had a boy to help . If we had him always at the table , and to help outside , it would be easier , and nicer , too . ' He 'd had that money left him , and he could easy keep a hand . I said that to myself , but all the time I knew it was different , and that he did n't really need me . He just wanted me to come . And I wanted to . I took up the spoon , ? it was a big wooden spoon , ? and cracked the butter off it on the edge of the kettle , and laid it up on the warming oven and slid the kettle to the back of the stove . I untied and took off my apron , and hung it on a chair . The baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go too . ' And I said , ' No , ' and took a yellow comb down that he 'd brought home from town when he took the apples in the day before , and she 'd cried for it , and I give it to her to play with and told her to stay in . He whistled again , and something said , just the same , and plain , ' Do n't go , Minnie . ' And I went out on the step and shut the screen door behind me , so it did n't slam , and then I ran . He was there under the big tree where he kissed me that other time when the baby was with us . And when I was almost there I tripped , tripped on a root and fell , fell on my hands , and he run and helped me up and stood holding me , his face lifted up and his eyes shut . And I was there under the tree and him holdin ' me , and I knew what a sin it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gone back ? no , not to save my soul . And then she screamed , the baby , and come runnin ' out between the apple trees , screaming and callin ' , ' Minnie ! ' And her little hand raised up over her head , and round her wrist was a ring of fire . I got to her first and smothered the fire out with my dress . It was burned deep in her little flesh and clear round her wrist . She 'd stuck the comb in the stove grate , and it had caught fire and blazed up and had curved right around her little wrist . I carried her in . She was cryin ' so , and I was holding her and dippin ' cold sweet cream on the burn . Mrs. Wingate got up and was there by then . And Mr. Wingate looked at me and I looked at him , and he saw what I saw , that it was around her wrist like a bracelet . He run out to the pasture and caught up a horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town to get the doctor . I set there on the kitchen floor and held her in my lap and was bathin ' her wrist in sweet cream , and Mrs. Wingate kept saying , ' Do n't cry so , Minnie . It 's not your fault , ' and when the doctor come he said the same . And Mr. Wingate , he stood there , and I could n't look up at him . The doctor said she would n't lose her-hand , not even though it was burned deep like that and clear around . I 'd been so afraid she would . I waited till it was late night and then I got up and went out in my gown , and took a ladder , and dumb up to the . fork of that apple tree he was by when I run out to him , and I took the bracelet and pressed it down deep in the fork of the tree , till it was fast there . In the morning I mopped and baked and had everything right , and I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to work I told Mrs. Wingate I was leaving and going home to my folks . She said she wished I would n't take it like that and said again I was n't to blame in any way , and neither of them would ever think so , and when she saw I was bound to go she went in her room and came out with the blue dress goods and said I was to take it , and I told her to keep it and make it up for the little girl when she was bigger . I undressed the baby and put her to sleep on my bed . She laid on her back and her head to one side and her curls wet on her forehead . Her hands were up above her head and the bandage on her wrist . And then I packed my things and went out to the road to wait for the mailman to come back that way . And Mrs. Wingate walked out with me , and kissed me good-bye . It was n't bad to home . They 'd heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , but they said it was just as well . Clements had come wantin ' a girl to help , and I went over next morning , and here I 've been . That was before their second girl was born . I been here all these years and seen the Clements ' children grown and married . VII I come pretty near getting married once . I was goin ' to be . He went to our church , and my folks liked him and the Clements liked him and I thought I wanted him , myself . And one night I told him how I did that time ? run out there to Mr. Wingate in the orchard and about the baby all there was to it , that was nothing . And after that I could n't stand him , and things I used to think I 'd get used to about him , and we did n't get on and I let him go . There 's things I read in the Bible and knew by heart should have held me , if I 'd hearkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back there at the first . ' Remove thy foot from evil , ' and ' As a man thinketh in his heart , so is he . ' And even that last day I heard as plain as could be , ' Stay in , Minnie , ' and yet I went . And the baby got the bracelet burned around her wrist . There 's not a night I have n't prayed that it would all be forgiven us . And I think that I 've been heard , too . He 's been blessed . Mrs. Wingate , they got a new doctor for her , and he helped her so much , and she got lots better and had three boys , all strong and well . And the orchard done well and the rest of the place , too . Before their girl got married , they built a new house ? a big one with a fireplace that 'd take a four-foot log . I 've never seen it ? never been back there or seen a one of them . They asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I 'd go , but I did n't . I cent a present , though , and the girl wrote me a little letter , and I 've got it yet . Said she remembered me a little . They been blessed . To-night Mr. Clement was reading the paper , and he read the Gaylord item out , and the room went round and my knees give way and let me down . I fainted . They ' II be cutting the big tree , too , and hauling it up to where they saw and chop . One of the boys will be splitting chunks up for the kitchen , and he 'll cut into the bracelet . It 's solid gold and soft , and he 'll cut right through it , and he 'll call and say , ' Look at this , Dad . ' And Mr. Wingate will come and take the pieces in his hand and rub them on his sleeve and see the ' Minnie ' graved inside , and think back . Or maybe they wo n't split that chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fireplace , and carry it in some night when their girl and her children are over there for supper . And he 'll sit there and watch , and smell the apple wood burning . It 's the sweetest-smelling wood to burn there is . And the gold will melt , and run ? drop , drop ? into the fire . Like as not he 'll see it , and like as not he wo n't . For the kitchen , or for the fireplace ? what do you think ?
