How 62 prosperous German Jews were forced to run a bloody gantlet at Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp was reported last week in the Liberal News Chronicle of London . Two long ranks of Adolf Hitler 's personal Schutzstaffel formed the gantlet , down which the 62 Jews were forced to run . " As they approached between the ranks , a hail of blows fell on them , " said the News Chronicle . " As they fell , the Jews were beaten further . The orgy lasted half an hour . . . . Twelve of the 62 were dead , with skulls smashed . All the others were unconscious , some with eyes out and faces flattened in . ... Police , unable to bear the cries , turned their backs . " <P> Before the Bar . This nauseating atrocity , whether or not the honest News Chronicle was correctly informed as to exactly what happened , is undoubtedly the truth in the sense that such atrocities do occur today in many parts of Germany , especially the countryside . <P> The case for antiSemitism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week before the bar of German public opinion . It is to be kept there for many weeks , with more than 1,500 major anti-Semitic mass meetings , scheduled throughout Germany , plus countless anti-Semitic lectures-all under the showmanship of Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels . <P> Dr. Goebbels is sometimes described in print as a barking , brawling , screaming propaganda maniac . Actually the Minister for Propaganda &; Public Enlightenment is one of the great political orators of this century . He opens suavely , is restrained most of the time , mellifluent , knows how to whip a point over with the sting of humor , a trifle crude at times-or very crude if Dr. Goebbels is radiorating to the masses . <P> The importance in Dr. Goebbels ' mind of the " educative campaign " he was starting last week caused him to summon 2,000 of his picked Nazi stooge-orators to meet him in the Kroll Opera House . <P> " I have never made anti-Semitic propaganda in the outside world , " said Orator Goebbels softly . " The dear Jews have done that for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jews awaken it . ... All we have done is to eliminate Jews from public life in Germany . Let the English say what they will , what we do is our business ! . . . After five-and-one-half years of National Socialism , the Jews still have in Germany proportionately four-and-one-half times as much wealth as the Aryans ! " <P> From this Dr. Goebbels proceeded to an economic attack on the Jewish Question . According to him , if the average German owned as much as the average German Jew still owns today , the national wealth of the Reich would be not as at present some 200 billion marks but over 900 billion marks . <P> Without the Mask . As though for a Liberty Loan Drive , the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment rushed to German " educative meetings " Dr. Goebbels ' brand new " educational film " prepared weeks ago-Jewry Without The Mask . <P> This was not all , by any means . With typical German thoroughness , Dr. Goebbels forced the Jewish Theatre of Berlin , which wished to remain closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz Wisten brought directly from a concentration camp to put on a comedy , The Wind And The Rain-or else .
