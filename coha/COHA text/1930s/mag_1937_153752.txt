The Coming of the Lord . . . Great Confusion Upon Earth . . . September 16 , 1936 was announced last year in Manhattan by a Mrs. Edna Bandler in Vol. 1 , No. 1 of a magazine called The Prophet . Last week , Mrs. Bandler turned up in the news again , conducting a " Week of Prophecy " in Town Hall , daily donning a white veil and prophesying for the 25 to 100 people who dropped in , admission free , to hear her . <P> Edna Bandler is the white-haired intense-eyed widow of a rich diamond merchant . Until two years ago she lived in a mansion , full of gilt and marble , which John D. Rockefeller built years ago in West 54th Street for his son John D. Jr . She now dwells , and conducts prophetic services for a small band of followers in a lushly-furnished duplex studio in West 57th Street , a neighborhood in which nourish many swamis and faith-healers . <P> Mrs. Bandler prophesies in a helter-skelter flow of words which many a listener last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British " Pyramidologists , ' ' who believe that in the courses of masonry and many tunnels of the Great Pyramid of Cheops are to be found prophecies of the world 's history until the year 2045 . Pyramidologists thought Sept. 16 , 1936 was to be epochal for the world , but Prophetess Bandler now denies that she predicted anything like the world 's end . She insists , however , that , known only to her , 300,000 people were slaughtered on Mt . Carmel on that date . Sample Bandler prophecies : <P> Fascists are the Philistines . Mussolini is the Biblical " beast of the iron teeth , " and he will take over Spain . <P> The twelve most powerful nations on earth are the twelve Tribes of Israel , of which Prophetess Bandler will identify only England ( Ephraim ) , France ( Reuben ) , the U. S. ( Manasseh ) . <P> President Roosevelt , to be the last U. S. President , is God 's anointed . Because he is divinely ordained , and also because man 's span is 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Supreme Court Justices as he pleases . <P> The world 's redemption will come through love . " I 'm giving the last love-call for the world before the tribulation comes . " <P> " When all communications between the U. S. and Europe are cut off . when radios go dead , when we are forbidden by decree to speak the name of Jesus , when David , Duke of Windsor , takes an airplane to Jerusalem , then we will know the conflict is at hand .
