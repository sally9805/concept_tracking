YOUNG man named Periander had become boss ? or tyrant , as they called it in those days ? of his home town , Corinth , and was desirous of learning his trade from those who knew it best . So he sent a messenger across the sea to a gentleman named Thrasybulus , who had been in the tyranny business for some time , and with notable success , asking him what a young tyrant ought to know . Thrasybulus took the messenger for a walk through a wheat field and listened to his questions , and answered not a word . Only as they walked along Thrasybulus kept looking at the wheat ; and whenever he saw a stalk protruding above the rest he neatly snicked off its . head . The messenger went home and reported that Thrasybulus was not only a boor who refused to answer questions , but a fool who destroyed his own property . But Periander understood . There were men of consequence in Corinth , men who towered above the crowd , men who might furnish leadersfor an opposition if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snicked off their heads as Thrasybulus beheaded the stalks of wheat ; and thereafter , though he became insufferable enough , he had his own way in Corinth . It paid him , at the moment , to reduce the intelligence and capacity of the citizen body to the dead level of the average ; but in the long run it did much harm to the state , and if Periander , who was the state , had lived long enough , he would have realized that he had merely been committing sabotage on his own property . All of which is ancient history ; but the lesson is so plain that it is rather disturbing to see the American people more and more inclining to follow the policy of Periander . Nothing seems to please the voters so much as snicking off the political head of a man who protrudes above the level of the average , who thinks and speaks for himself instead of falling in with the sentiments of the crowd . This is an old story perhaps ; stiffnecked individualists have never been popular with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he got his first presidential nomination because he looked as if he could carry New York , and his subsequent nominations because it would obviously have been suicidal for the party to nominate anybody else . ) But the habit seems to be growing worse ; and as the rewards of political cowardice and the penalties of courage and independence become more and more obvious , we increasingly see the effects in the morale of politicians . More and more , our chosen rulers try to turn themselves into rubber stamps for the majority , or for any group of voters that can make enough noise to sound like a majority . We owe this recent decadence very largely to the tactics of the Anti-Saloon League ; and a good many people must have felt that it was only poetic justice when , last spring , some of the most loyal servants of that organization suddenly announced that they would change sides as soon as they could be sure it would pay them . When Senator Wesley Jones , author of that famous five-and-ten law that was to dry-clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by referendum lie would bow to the will of the people , and when such other stainless knights of prohibition as T. J. Walsh and Morris Sheppard admitted that they might do the same , the late Wayne B. Wheeler 's chickens came home to roost . Now the point about Jones and Walsh and Sheppard is that they are sincere Drys , dry in their personal habits and convictions as well as in their votes ; men who honestly believe ( in so far as holders of elective office can be said honestly to believe anything ) that a victory for the Wets would be a disaster to the nation . But do they stand firm in the breach against the cohorts of the rum rebellion ? Not a bit of it . No nonsense of here-Istand - God - help - can do - nothing-else about these heroes . Their motto is , " Here I stand till I see that it would be safer to step down . " Senator Sheppard comes from Texas . A hundred years ago there were men in Texas who did not find it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority at the Alamo , but Travis and Bowie and Crockett chose to fight it out anyway . Santa Anna had a majority at San Jacinto too , but Sam Houston beat him , and thereby made possible the election of the Honorable Morris Sheppard to the United States Senate . This is what is known as the ascent of man . Still , you can hardly blame the politicians , granted their sincere belief that self-preservation is the first law of nature . We had in New York a few years ago the notable case of Senator James W. Wadsworth . He was a man of admitted intelligence , capacity , and force ; he was a conservative , but that would not have hurt him if he had paid the Iip service to liberalism which has been accepted from other men as sufficient indemnity for conservative behavior . Wadsworth talked the way he thought and acted , and thus made enemies . Also he was wet , and his party was dry ; so when he ran for reelection in 1926 a dry Republican candidate was set up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did this help men who believed in prohibition and felt that New York ought to have a Senator who would vote for its enforcement ? Not at all ; Mr. Wagner , the Democrat candidate , was just as wet as Wadsworth . But in the eyes of the Anti-Saloon League the difference between a wet Democrat and a wet Republican was the difference between a free man of color and a fugitive slave . Wadsworth was punished not for being wet but for being honest . Wagner was a man of merit , as it happened ; but it was Wadsworth 's merit that elected him , not his own . Al Smith also was candid about his wetness . It does not seem that he could have been elected President even if he had straddled the fence ; but he might FOUNDING FATHERS AND STRADDLING SONS 587 have carried one or two more Southern States . These lessons appear not to have been lost on the Honorable Frank-IM D. Roosevelt . Whether he is wet or dry nobody knows at this writing ; and his friends arc doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic National Convention of 1932 . There may be some few Democrats who will not vote for a straddler ; but no politician would make the mistake of supposing that there are enough of them to count . When Mr. Dwight Morrow , campaigning for the Republican Senatorial nomination in New Jersey , came out for repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment , his courage and candor were widely acclaimed . Well Mr. Morrow has a good record for courage and candor , and he stated the case for repeal very ably ; but it takes about as much courage to favor repeal in New Jersey as to favor Mussolini in Rome . Also , within a week after Mr. Morrow 's bold pronouncement his friends were going about among the Drys , spreading the rumor that though he talked wet he was really dry ; just as wet Eastern Republicans in MS insisted that though Hoover talked dry he was really wet . Hoover , it turned out , meant what lie said , and probably Morrow did too ; but the practical men around them both felt that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of man who would stand by his opinions . I believe that the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment would be a good thing for the country ; but I think it would be safer for the country to be governed by honest Drys , men who stand by their convictions even if it seems likely to cost them their jobs , than by men who are willing to be wet or dry , whichever seems likely to be to their advantage . Who are these unbending stalwarts I have in mind ? I hesitate to name them , for fear that before this is printed they too will have announced that they are ready to bow to the will of the people . II Well , if cowardice seems the first requisite of a successful career in politics , whose fault is it ? The stream can rise no higher than its source ; though as Mr. Owen Wister remarked in HARPER 'S for June , it can go considerably lower . Voters who refuse reelection to men who say what they think have only themselves to blame if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Sam , like Thrasybulus , walks through his wheat field snicking off every head and what of lice holder does not ? ) very naturally stoops his shoulders , pulls in his neck , and says what he thinks on controversial issues only when he is pretty sure that the majority agrees with him . He may be a coward , but he is at least no fool ; he obeys the law of self-preservation . Not even that much can be said for Uncle Sam . Like Thrasybulus , he destroys his own crop , commits sabotage on his own property . Well , says the patriot , America seems to have got along pretty well , in spite of all this . True ; though not quite so true as it was before the 24th of last October . The men who told us in 1928 that it was the virtue of the American people which made us prosperous are telling us now that the virtue of the American people will restore prosperity ; but the story is not getting over quite as well as it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , have displayed immense energy and ingenuity ; they have also had the advantage of an unequaled stock of natural wealth ; and they have had a great deal of luck ? so much luck that earnest citizens are apt to call it not luck but divine favor , and to argue that we are a chosen people . Another people , once upon a time , regarded itself as chosen ; and during one of its political crises a gentleman whose party had fallen from power offered the following parable . " The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive tree , Reign thou over us . But the olive tree said unto them , Should I leave my fatness , wherewith by me they honor God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ? And the trees said to the fig tree , Come thou , and reign over us . But the fig tree said unto them , Should I forsake my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said unto the vine , Come thou , and reign over us . And the vine said unto them , Should I leave my wine , which cheereth God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ? " Then said all the trees unto the bramble , Come thou , and reign over us . And the bramble said unto the trees , If in truth ye anoint me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow . " Those were difficult times , when that parable was spoken ; the office sought the man , and it is no wonder that the olive and the fig and the vine preferred the peace and comfort of private life to the hazards of public service . But when the trees , in a critical moment , turned to the bramble , he accepted the nomination . He accepted it , no doubt , with a high sense of his responsibility , a firm resolve to do the best he could . But for all his good intentions , he was only a bramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have offered ; we refuse to give our olives and figs and vines a chance . Sometimes they get into office ( usually by behaving as much like brambles as possible during the campaign ) ; but as soon as we find out what we have got , we are likely to beat them when they come up for reelection . Brambles are what we want and what we usually get ; and if things ever get really hot , we may not find much shelter in their shadow . III The fall from popular favor of a Cleveland or a John Quincy Adams wasintelligible enough ; they stood for what they conceived to be the general welfare , and the average voter is chiefly con cerned with his particular interests or his particular prejudices . But it begins to look as if even representatives of particu .. tar interests are likely to be retired from public life if they happen to be suffi , sufficiently forceful and outspoken to raise up a crowd of enemies . Consider the case of the Honorable Joseph R. Grundy . A good many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm for a protective tariff were disturbed by the refusal of the Republicans of Pennsylvania to renominate Mr. Grundy for the Senate seat which for a few months he filled by appointment . It is not contended that Mr. Grundy is a great man , or even a wise one ; but he is a man , who stands up on his hind legs and says what he thinks , whether people like it or not . You may not think he was a good Senator , but most of the Founding Fathers who started this nation going would disagree with you . He was not their ideal of the perfect Senator ; but he was about as good a Senator as most of them would have expected to get . The Founding Fathers , as every historian knows , distrusted the people . ( Schoolboys were not permitted to know it when I went to school . ) Some of them distrusted the people more , some less ; but in some degree the distrust was general , and the Constitution which they wrote , with its checks and balances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to curb what one of the more liberal of the Founding Fathers called " the turbulence and follies of democracy . " They decided to let the people have something to say ( though not too much ) in selecting their rulers ; and then those rulers were expected to be governed , during their stated terms , by their own judgment and their own consciences . The men who made the Constitution had had a classical education ? some of them directly , in the schools ; others indirectly in the atmosphere of the eighteenth century which ? FOUNDING FATHERS AND STRADDLING SONS 389 constantly looked back to classical models . Most of them had read , and all of them would have approved , that description of the ideal public servant which a classical author has set down : " The just man , tenacious of his , pur-pose , not shaken in his firm resolve by the countenance of the menacing tyrant , or by the passion of citizens bidding him do evil . " ( Or even , Horace might have added if he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll . ) The Founding Fathers had stood up against the menacing tyrant , and had got rid of him , but it had begun to look as if they bad jumped out of the frying pan into the fire . Ardor civium prava jubantium meant something to men who had lived through the years between Yorktown and the Constitutional Convention , especially men who had something to lose . The turbulence and follies of democracy ould not be blamed for all the troubles of those years ; weakness and mismanagement and selfishness above played a part , as well as ignorance and selfishness below . But one great source of weakness and mismanagement lay in the fact that delegations in Congress , under the Confederation , acted as ambassadors of the governments of their States . The Founding Fathers had had enough of that . When they wrote into the Constitution the provision that " each Senator shall have one vote " they supposed that he would use that vote according to his own judgment . It never occurred to them that the day would come when the nator would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control from back home . They hoped that just and tenacious men would be chosen for public office and that they would not be shaken by popular outcries ; also , that they would govern solely with an eye to the public interest . That was an ideal , and the Founding Fathers knew it . Men who have conducted a successful revolution have seen a good deal of human nature and are unlikely to expect the impossible . They hoped for men dispassionately devoted to the public good ; but what they expected to get , in the main , was men who represented the interests of their region and their class . And they felt that by getting together able men and letting them argue out the conflict of interests a tolerable and workable compromise might be achieved . Now Pennsylvania , in Mr. Grundy , got just about such a representative as the Founding Fathers expected . " I feel that my big job here , " he said when he took his seat in the Senate , " is to promote the interests and prosperity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do the Northwestern Senators with whom Mr. Grundy presently became embroiled admit that they represent the interests and prosperity of Idaho , or Washington , or North Dakota ? Not a bit . They vote that way ; but when they talk they represent the interests of all humanity . Mr. Grundy 's enemies may say that he identifies the interests of Pennsylvania with those of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers ' Association , which he organized and directed . Well , in so thoroughly industrialized a State there is some color for that identification . He had been promoting the interests of Pennsylvania and its manufacturers long before the general public had ever heard of him ; but he had been working behind the scenes . He was renowned as the most diligent and successful of Republican money getters . He sat ? ? the smoke-filled room where Hare ' was nominated , and gave his assent ; collected from his industrial friends ha , a million dollars to help elect Coolidge. seven hundred thousand dollars to help elect Hoover ; and he never pretended to be altruistic about it , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation was bound up with the welfare of Pennsylvania manufacturers . " Because you have enjoyed much ; he told his Pennsylvania friends in 1924 " you must contribute liberally in sub-stance and energy . " They did con-tribute liberally ; and when the time ? minna few what came to make a new tariff , Mr. Grundy reasonably held that they had a right to some more enjoyment . He was prepared to help make this tariff , as he had helped make others , by coming down and telling Congress what Pennsylvania wanted ; but an accident sent him to the Senate to do his tariff making at first hand . We all know why Senate committees of investigation have taken the bit in their teeth and run wild in the past few years . It was because one Senate committee , in uncovering the oil scandals . performed a great public service that would otherwise have been Ieft undone . That committee , displaying a universal inquisitiveness , asking some rather brutal questions , made the discovery that very respectable persons had been guilty of grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been extended to all Senate committees ; not unnaturally , Senators have got into the habit of believing that every witness is guilty , and that any amount of prying and bullying is justified , whether it brings up any results or not . ( Except , of course , as a more recent instance shows , when the witness happens to be a Bishop who shepherds a few million Methodist votes . ) A witness can be punished , and witnesses have been punished , for contempt of the Senate : but Senators are not punished for insults to a witness . So every Senate committee had its witnesses thoroughly cowed in advance , till they got hold of Grundy . The Founding Fathers would not have understood the great sigh of relief that went up all over the country when at last a private citizen dared to talk back to a Senator . Still less would they have understood the Senators , and the Washington correspondents , who took the things he said as no better than treason or blasphemy . Some of the Founding Fathers came near thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a matter of occupation ( Jefferson appears to have believed that there was something inherently holy in farming . and something inherently base in making money by other means ) ; but none of them , so far as I recall , thought it was a matter of geography . Even if they had foreseen the Northwest ( Cincinnati was Northwest in their day ) they would have failed to understand why all Senators from Northwestern Slates are supposed to average a higher content of righteousness Lha.n Senators from anywhere else . I do not altogether understand it myself , but I suspect that one reason is that Northwestern Senators take more time off to advertise their righteousness . Also , for years past they have held the balance of power , and used it ; the Democrats have been only the tail to the Northwestern kite . They have done some good things , fought well against policies advocated by selfish Eastern interests . But when they dip into the Treasury to help the Northwestern farmer , or vote for a protective tariff on the products of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are not governed by selfish 0 interests of their own , but only by the purest considerations of public welfare . But Grundy , unterrified by all this , told the Northwesterners and their Democratic auxiliaries that some of the States they came from were backward f commonwealths , paying so little taxes that they had " no chips in the game . " He admitted that Senators from those States might rightfully have their say about such matters as " Junior Red Cross and outdoor relief , " but argued that when it came to dealing with the tariff interests of Pennsylvania , " Idaho ought to talk darn small . " Now most of us ( unless we are Pennsylvania manufacturers ) feel that this view is , on the whole , unsound ; but it is at least a contestable opinion . Grundy said no more than a good many of the Founding Fathers had said when the Constitution was being framed . He admitted , when pressed , that he thought it had been a mistake to give each State two Senators ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOUNDING FATHERS AND STRADDLING SONS 391 population . Well , that doctrine was vigorously advocated in the Constitutional Convention by the larger and wealthier States ; the smaller States , very naturally , would not hear of it , so the issue of representation was compromised , like most of the issues that came before the Convention . The compromise worked well ? better , in all likelihood , than complete concession to either large States or small would have worked ; Mr. Grundy was flogging a dead horse . But the Founding Fathers would have regarded his opinion as perfectly natural , even if politically unwise . They would not have understood why speaking disrespectfully of Idaho should be regarded , even in Idaho , as the sin against the Holy Ghost . TV Mr. Grundy had gallantly stood up for Pennsylvania against the Senate ; and the Senate was about to hit back . Mr. Vare , elected Senator from Pennsylvania three years previously , had been kept waiting all this time on the doorstep because he had spent a great deal of money ? nearly eight hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand in Pennsylvania is not much more than forty thousand in Idaho , if you count expenditure per head ; but that did not matter . The Senate pronounced Mr. Vare unworthy of the high companionship to which he aspired ; his seat was declared vacant , the Governor of Pennsylvania had to fill it by appointment , and he appointed Grundy . Why not ? If ever a man had powerfully served the interests of his State , both economic and moral , Grundy was the man . I do not know how far Governor Fisher who appointed him was actuated by this lofty consideration ; Grundy had done more than anybody else to get Fisher elected . Still , it was the appointment the situation called for ; and it was taken by the whole country as a joke on the Senate . The people laughed , and the Senate sputtered with apoplectic rage . " The appointment , " said Senator Wheeler of Montana , " could not be regarded as otherwise than a challenge to the people of the country who believe in a free government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ italics are mine , in print ; 1 do not doubt that they were also Mr. Wheeler 's , in his emotional reaction . At any rate , it soon became evident that the people of the country who believe in a free government were throwing no fits over a challenge to the Senate ; the Senate had to home-brew its own indignation , and of course it does that sort of thing very well . " If the Grundy appointment stands , " said Mr. Nye of North Dakota , " it will mean that the Senatorship from Pennsylvania has been awarded to the highest bidder . " The ground for this doctrine lay in the fact that more than twice as much money as Mr. Vare spent had been raised for the joint interest of the Senatorial candidate whom he defeated , and of Governor Fisher who was elected at the same time . Mr. Grundy personally had tossed three hundred thousand dollars into the pot , besides raising a good deal more among the manufacturers . It was the theory of high-minded Senators that the whole thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , Fisher was to appoint Grundy . Be it far from me to say that this was not the case ; the intricacies of Pennsylvania politics are too devious for the innocent New Yorker . But there was no proof of it ; and on mere considerations of chronology it looks rather improbable . At any rate , the only way the Senate could , with any color of reason , refuse a scat to Grundy was by setting up the doctrine that it had a right to pass on gubernatorial elections in any State . That extraordinary theory was actually advanced . Mr. Nye introduced a resolution setting forth that the spending of so much money in a primary was " destructive of the value and merit of an election climaxing sic a campaign of such expenditures . " Said Mr. Cutting of New Mexico ( normally a man of sense ) , " No election was held in Pennsylvania in 1926 , " For a few days it looked as if the Senate might declare itself a sort of Supreme Inspector of elections all over the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see to it that the will of God and the Northwestern Senators was duly enacted , whether the people liked it or not . But this was a little too much . There was a general public uproar ? or at least a general outburst of newspaper editorials , which is the nearest approach to a public uproar that we are apt to get in this extensive country . Just what are the limitations , if any , on the right of the Senate to be judge of the qualifications of its members , had never been settled ; but it was evident that a good many people felt that it was going pretty far to hold that Pennsylvania could send up only such Senators as would have been chosen in North Dakota . The New York Sun looked forward to the time , not far distant , when the Senate would consist of three members , Borah , Brook-hart , and Blease , all other successful candidates in Senatorial elections having been voted unworthy of membership in that august body . Newspaper disapproval might not have affected the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to realize the implications of this doctrine ? especially Southern Senators . If the principle were established that the Senate could hold that the Governor of Pennsylvania was illegally elected , what was to prevent a Republican majority in the Senate from holding that Democratic Governors of Southern States had been illegally elected ? The Nye resolution was quietly shelved , and Mr. Grundy took his seat without further opposition . Victory Number Two for Grundy and Pennsylvania ; and a victory , incidentally , for the constitutional principle that no State , without its own consent , shall be denied its equal representation in the Senate . The issue should never have been raised , would never have beenraised but by men in whom the hothouse atmosphere of Washington had induced a swollen sense of their own importance . But it was raised , and for the time , at least , it was settled . If one more reference to the Founding Fathers , who have been dead a long time , may be permitted , it might be observed that they would have been scandalized at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of Senator Pennsylvania chose might not suit North Dakota , they would have argued that it was none of North Dakota 's business . North Dakota could have its remedy by electing , to represent its own interests in the Senate , somebody competent to meet a Grundy on equal terms ; somebody more formidable than a Nye . V Once in the Senate , Mr. Grundy got to work . A year before he took his seat he had told his friends of the National Association of Woolen Manufacturers that " in Congress , from my experience , the fellow that makes the most noise , and the fellow that makes the most demands , the fellow that keeps his problem in front of him all the time , he gets service . " Mr. Grundy 's friends had not been getting much service in the Senate till he arrived . The well-organized Republican majority in the House had passed a tariff bill , the highest in history ; but in the Senate the Democratic-Northwestern coalition had been chewing it to pieces . The fellow who ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senator Smoot , was making only ineffectual noises in his throat ; and Jim Watson , titular leader of the administration forces , was displaying a capacity about equal to his enthusiasm . But Grundy went into action and began to get service . He had never held public office before , except that of Borough Councilman of Bristol , Pennsylvania , but he had dealt with office holders long enough to know what motives actuate them . The maFOUNDING FATHERS AND STRADDLING SONS 393 jority of the Senate was opposed to a protective tariff which would fatten producers at the cost of the consumer ; but not many Senators would oppose protective duties which might fatten producers in their own States ? the people whose votes would reelect them ? at the expense of consumers living somewhere else . The tariff , as the unlucky General Hancock saw too soon , is a local issue , or rather a conglomeration of local issues on the good old principle of " I scratch your back and you scratch mine . " Mr. Grundy got together enough Senators who wanted protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everybody . It was an amazing one-man triumph , even if Grundy was unable to hold all his gains when the tariff was turned over to a conference committee . Tariff bills are known by the names of the chairmen of the committees that put them through ; but the measure that began as the Hawley-Smoot tariff is already known as the Grundy tariff , and will probably be the Grundy tariff in the histories of the future . V Mr. Grundy deprecates this attachment of his name to an act which he came to consider painfully inadequate ; he is an idealist , only a tariff as high as Mount Everest would suit him . But it turned out a good deal higher than it would have been if he had not taken hold when Smoot and Watson were licked . They call Grundy a - fighting Quaker " ; and a good many people could not help contrasting him with the non-fighting Quaker at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , who waited a year and a half for whatever tariff Congress chose to send up to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania turned him down . When he came up for nomination in the primary be got half a million votes , against three-quarters of a million for Mr. James J. Davis . What are the merits of Mr. Davis , that he triumphed so brilliantly ? He has been Secretary of Labor in three cabinets , but he never made much impression on the public till last winter , when he insisted fervently that there was no unemployment problem ; and then that there had been one last month but was none this month ; and so on . Grundy may not be a tall cedar of Lebanon , but Davis has shown no evidence that he is anything but a bramble . What was the matter with Pennsylvania ? Well , Mr. Vare and the Philadelphia vote which he controls opposed Grundy ; the Pennsylvania Railroad opposed him ; labor opposed him . Also certain local politicians on whom he had counted went over to the enemy . When even Pennsylvania political experts called it a confusing primary , it is not for the outsider to attempt to probe these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania , or intelligent understanding of the interest of the State , Grundy would have been nominated without opposition . He has his faults , and he wears them on the outside where everybody can see them ; but he is a man , and there are not so many men in the Senate that we can afford to spare him . He has done good service for Pennsylvania ; if other States think he has done a disservice to the nation , let them send men to the Senate who are good enough to withstand him . Mr. Nye of North Dakota , meanwhile , had been appointed chairman of a special committee to investigate campaign expenditures in Senatorial primaries , the Senate having abandoned for the moment the contention that it was the Grand Elector of state officers as welt . In his capacity as Eye of the Senate , Mr. Nye watched over this primary , and found nothing in it to which he could object . No wonder , since by its own vote Pennsylvania had deprived itself of its equal representation in the Senate . VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs men of courage and farsightedness . How can we bring men like that back into public life ? Well , we are so tangled up in the machinery of political organization that we can not do much all at once . We can only , as each opportunity arises , vote for men of courage and against pushovers , in the hope that eventually the politicians will realize that it is safe to nominate men who are not afraid to stand up . Ten years ago the President of the United States had been defeated on a highly important issue by a party in the Senate ; and on that conflict fought out within the framework of the government , the voters were about to pass judgment in a great and solemn referendum . The result of that referendum was a foregone conclusion , so it is a purely academic criticism that the Democrats ought to have renominated Wilson , whose record was their record ; or , if illness disqualified him , ought to have nominated McAdoo who was in the dynastic succession , instead of picking a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Republicans ought to have nominated Lodge . He was a man of courage , capacity , and shrewdness ( whatever else you may think he was ) ; he had to be , to win that fight over the treaty . Also he was the incarnation of the leading issue . In a country governed by the parliamentary system , it would have been a matter of course that Lodge should succeed Wilson . It had been shown that the President could not govern in the face of serious opposition in the Senate ; it was then the Senate 's turn to govern , to put into force its own policies after it had rejected the President 's . The Senate chose to govern , but from behind the curtains . Its own foreign policy was purely negative so it did not insist , as it might have done , on the appointment of a Secretary of State who would represent its views . To do that would have entailed responsibility , would have required initiative , the difficult mental labor of working out an affirmative policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State ; and for the presidency the dominant Senatorial group chose a man whose sole merit was that there was nothing against him ? then . Mr. Harding did the best he could , tried as well as he knew how to live up to his job ; but he was a bramble and there was room for nobody but the Ohio Gang in his shadow . Who was to blame for the corruption of Harding 's administration ? Harding , or the men of greater capacity who selected him rather than undertake the burdens of the presidency themselves ? Or the voters , we the people of the United States , whose behavior for a hundred years had taught the politicians that they could safely nominate an incompetent man ? Well , we survived Harding ; why worry ? What difference does it make who is President ? A good many people asked that question in the days when the only real interest of the American people was the rising stock market . As Mr. Bernard Fay put it , if we nominated candidates who meant something and fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stirred up ; but when elections were only auctions won by the bidder who promised most prosperity , nobody need take them seriously . That was a plausible doctrine in the Seven Fat Years ; I find , on reflection , that I have advocated it myself , in the pages of this magazine . But in the Year Two of the Era of the Abolition of Poverty it begins to seem that we might be a little more careful in choosing our rulers . The time may come when this nation will have to hunt the shade , and will not find much of it under a bramble . But have we not survived every crisis ? Yes , we have , so far . We won our independence and established a nation thanks to a generation of statesmen who were about the ablest lot of men that has ever served any nation in modern times . Some of those men were good politicians , but few of them could be elected to public office to-day . We muddled through to a draw in the War of 1812 because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign wars with serious adversaries till we got into trouble with the Germans . Then we proved the organizing ability for which America is renowned by being ready to fight a year and a half after war was declared . If we had got into that war single-handed , if we had not had allies to hold the enemy off till we got ready , the loss of a single fleet action would have ruined us . We have recovered from panic after panic ? because of our innate virtue and industry ? Perhaps ; but our immense natural resources helped ; also the fact that any man who was dissatisfied at home could go West and homestead a quarter section . We have about come to the end of that happy time , and perhaps our natural resources will not last forever . We have learned a good deal lately about cushioning the shock ofpanics ; but the optimists who wrote the obituary of the " business cycle " were a little premature . We may have latent in the citizen body as much governmental ability as the great Revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and when it does we enthusiastically reject it , and choose somebody who announces that his private convictions will never be allowed to stand in the way of the people 's will . Once , in a crisis , we got a Lincoln . Providence ? Maybe ; it certainly was not popular foresight . Nobody knew that Lincoln was Lincoln when he was elected ; and his subsequent conflicts with the leaders of his party suggest that if his quality had been appreciated he could never have got the nomination . We can hardly count on Providence to deal us a Lincoln off the bottom of the deck every time we need one .
