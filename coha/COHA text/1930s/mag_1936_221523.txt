A delegation of local bigwigs , some 6,000 citizens and five women 's fife &; drum corps were waiting in Buffalo , N. Y. 's railroad station one morning last week when Nominee Alf M. Landon 's special train rolled up to the turning point of his Eastern campaign tour . Nominee Landon , rid of his lingering pleurisy , waved his hat , cried " Hello everybody ! " and singled out two small boys for special greeting . Stepping out of his way to shake their hands , he asked : " How do you do , little men ? " <P> After a ride through packed streets to his Buffalo hotel , the Republican candidate attended a Party luncheon , spent the afternoon receiving political callers and a People 's Mandate Peace Committee whom he told : " I recognize that war is the greatest threat to Freedom and Democracy . " For dinner and the night he went to the home of Publisher Edward H. Butler of the Buffalo Evening News . Next morning he attested his eligibility for high place by revealing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective story , The House on the Roof by Mignon Eberhart . <P> When Governor Landon left Topeka fortnight ago , his journalist-advisers were considerably worried because the preliminary drafts of the speeches he was to deliver contained so little of the political zip and zing that make helpful headlines . The G.O.P. nominee argued that the East did not know him , that he was going to introduce himself first by a discussion of general principles and not deal with specific campaign issues until later . His West Middlesex speech was , in fact , so fundamental that the Democratic high command did not bother to controvert its generalities . At Chautauqua Governor Landon discussed Education in a broad way , made news principally by breaking with William Randolph Hearst , his No. 1 press supporter on the worth of Teachers ' Oaths . <P> If at Buffalo he did not get down to campaign cases and blast the New Deal on some concrete issue , even his admirers began to feel that he might as well have stayed in Topeka . <P> After a second day of conferences during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New York 's Republican gubernatorial nomination , Nominee Landon repaired to Buffalo 's ball park to deliver his hardest-hitting , most specific speech to date . Hammering at the New Deal at what he considered its weakest point , he declared : <P> " ... The fundamental principles ot government finance are exactly the same common sense principles that we follow in the handling of our own family finances . Now , what are these principles ? In broadest terms there are four of them : <P> " The Government must guard and preserve its source of income . <P> " The Government must make sure that it gets a dollar 's worth for every dollar it spends . <P> " The Government must not get in the habit of spending more than it receives . <P> " Finally , the Government must prepare for the rainy day . . . .
