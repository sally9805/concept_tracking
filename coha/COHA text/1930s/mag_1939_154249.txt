JHVH , one of the several names of God in the Old Testament , was considered so awful that Jews never pronounced it , and in reading it substituted another name , such as Adonai . There are no vowel characters in Hebrew , and scholars guessed that , with the missing vowels supplied . JHVH should be written " Jehovah , " pronounced " Yah-weh . " This belief was followed in the 1901 American Standard Bible- U. S. edition of the English Revised Version of the King James Bible . Today , scholars have their doubts about the authenticity of the word " Jehovah . " Last week , Yale Divinity School 's Dean Luther Allan Weigle announced that " Lord " would be substituted for " Jehovah " throughout the Standard Bible , added : " Jehovah is not a functioning religious term . People do n't use it ; they do n't think of praying to Jehovah . "
