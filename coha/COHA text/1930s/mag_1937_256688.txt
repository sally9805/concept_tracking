About 3,000,000 of the telephone poles now standing are products of Joslyn Manufacturing &; Supply Co. of Chicago . This is less than one-twentieth the number that U. S. travelers see flicking past them on the highways of the land , but it is enough to make Joslyn the biggest independent U. S. telephone pole supplier. * From Idaho it gets trimmed poles of western red cedar , 25 to 35 ft. tall , creosotes them at its Chicago plant and sells them for $5 to $7 . The company also manufactures a complete line of cross-arms , insulators , brackets , pins and other power line equipment which happens to be very much in demand by public utilities , now loosening up after years of pinching on maintenance . So last week Joslyn reported something notable : on sales almost doubled since 1936 , six months earnings amounted to $573,025 , an increase of 250% in one year . <P> President Marcellus Lindsey Joslyn tried to explain this away as a product of the company 's pension system started in 1919 . If his pension system did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 18 years quite as notable as this year 's increase in profits . The company neither advertises nor seeks publicity , so the Joslyn plan never made much stir until last winter when the company prepared to sell $1,350,000 worth of common stock . Financial writers then discovered Marcellus Joslyn 's old labor policy , adopted during the post-War period of strikes and labor migrations , and Father Coughlin presented him with an oratorical laurel wreath . Scholarly President Joslyn-who is 64 , and often mistaken for a doctor because of his black goatee and spectacles , and who still goes to the office every day except Wednesday , when he stays home to read to his wife while she knits-enjoys a great deal of pride in all this . And his company has enjoyed 18 years of labor peace . The plan : <P> After three years with the company , each Joslyn officer and employe , must begin to pay from 2.5% to 5% of his salary into a trust fund to which the company gives not less than 10% of its annual earnings and not more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of disability or age , Joslyn workers receive the fruits of their savings and the company 's profits in a lump sum which often not only provides for them but makes them comparatively rich . The fund now totals $742,600 and payments totaling $266,000 have already been made . One recent pension was a check for $35,000 . A Joslyn worker who has contributed to the fund since 1919 now has a retirement credit nearly half of all his wages during the period . If he retires or is discharged before he is 60 he gets all he put in but only half what the company put in for him , plus compound interest . <P> *Western Union and American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. supply their own poles .
