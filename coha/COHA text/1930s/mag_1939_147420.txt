North Dakota 's isolationist Senator Lynn Joseph Frazier last week intimated that Franklin Roosevelt was playing politics with World War II . Most other Republicans refrained from such crass accusations . Yet one thing was certain : the President was engaged in an extraordinary political operation . <P> Woodrow Wilson in 1914-17 drifted with the U. S. people until he and they swirled into World War I. When at last he had to act he had the people behind him . In the world of 1939 where Dictators strike fast and hard , a democracy which takes three years to make up its mind is at grave disadvantage . No man ( perhaps not even Franklin Roosevelt ) could say for certain last week what the President of the U. S. really wanted to do about war . <P> But all signs pointed to the fact that Franklin Roosevelt had resolved not to let U. S. public opinion drift . In World War I months if not years passed before millions of U. S. citizens began to think in terms of a world struggle . Last week Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did so by proclaiming a " limited " emergency . He did so by adding three new members-Loan Administrator Jesse Jones , Works Administrator John M. Carmody , Security Administrator Paul Vories McNutt - to his Cabinet " for the duration of the emergency . " * Practically his every act-from announcing that Congress would be called , to ordering increases in Army and Navy-was a reminder to the people of the U. S. that the world is now facing a crisis and that the U. S. will soon have to make decisions . He had begun to play the part of El Hombre , for which South America looked to him ( see p. 28 ) . <P> Franklin Roosevelt 's character , and the implication of his preparations both indicated that the decisions which he will ultimately urge for staying out or getting into war will be vigorous if not aggressive. + Whether the public , pushed to a decision , will agree with him is another matter . But last week his advisers believed that he had already won the first round : that Congress when called into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neutrality Act to permit export of arms ( see p. 10 ) . <P> &gt; " In order that the nation may not again be caught unaware , " the President realigned his executive organization . Within " the White House Office " he grouped his Presidential secretaries ( Steve Early , Brigadier General Edwin M. " Pa " Watson ) ; his three administrative assistants ( Lauchlin Currie , William McReynolds , James Rowe and his Executive Clerk Rudolph Forster ) . Into his compact organization he also brought the Budget Bureau ; the National Resources Planning Board , a new office " for personnel management " and the National Emergency Council ( renamed the Office of Government Reports ) . <P> &gt; Moving swiftly to stop rocketing food costs ( see p. 64 ) Franklin Roosevelt suspended import quotas , domestic marketing regulations on sugar , thus lifting all planting and producing restrictions . Cuban producers readied 800,000 tons of sugar for shipment as benefit payments went out the window .                   @ @
