THE World 's Fair Bar and Grill has just opened at Forty-ninth Street and Third Avenue . We dropped in the other afternoon and ordered a beer  --  for delivery in 1939 . MAJOR GREEN , the slayer , denied all knowledge of the crime at first . Detectives tried to break him down and failed . But after a while , someone brought in a dollar chicken dinner and set it before him . Major Green ate , and presently began to talk . This is a thing we have all seen in our own homes . Guests arrive sullen , tight-lipped . After cocktails and the soup course , they readily admit their complicity in the day 's affairs , and are soon recalling even the shoddiest little anecdotes of their often very dull lives . The phenomenon should inform criminal procedure . Many a culprit who can withstand being beaten with a rubber hose would he a garrulous fool after some canaptlis , two Bacardis , and a good dinner with one green vegetable and a suitable , full-bodied wine . WANAMAKER 'S , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new note in their advertising the other morning . They were plugging a trip to Havana ( there and back for less than a hundred dollars ) or a weekend in the Berkshires ( for as little as seventeen dollars ) . The ad not only told how much the trips would cost , and what kind of clothes to wear , and what store to buy them at , but it told what the trip might do for you , based un case histories . " We know a gal , " said I.Vanamaker 's in their slangy manner , " who 's had her salary raised because she came back from Palm Beach with one brilliant idea . And we know a man who returned from Placid so inspired he finished a manuscript that had been lying around his desk for months . " Now , this interests us greatly  --  us who stick around the office because there 's no place like a rut . Wanamaker 's , however , have merely tweaked our appetite , and are holding out on us . Who is this girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her position by a trip to Palm Beach ? What 's her name , where does she work , where did she stay in Palm Beach , and what was her one brilliant idea ? We deserve to know . And who is this man who finished his manuscript after coming back from Placid ? What 's his name ? Was there much snow in Placid ? What was the manuscript about ? Has he sold it , or merely finished it ? To whom did he sell it , and when is it coming out ? All these things are pertinent . It 's asking too much of us to pack up and go to Havana and the Berkshires on the strength of a couple of mysterious geniuses whose identity is concealed behind a lot of Kitzbilhel ski suits and calico beach frocks . MUCH of the time we feel young as a kitten , but there are moments when the years sit heavy on our hack . We felt old suddenly the other day at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-seventh Street , where the unnerving thought crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mature enough to be photographed by Pink MacDonald . AN astrologer writes in to say that no good will come from shifting the inauguration from March 4th to January 20th . He claims it is going to boggle the whole scheme of the Founding Fathers , who had a definite planetary idea in setting up our constitutional structure . Benjamin Franklin and several other American primitives were , he rightly points out , members of the Masonic order and were well versed in astrology ; and he believes that in rigging up the Constitution they deliberately gave it the benefit of the Masonic symbol  --  the triangle . By determining three fundamental dates they thought they could create a perfect tripod-like base of planetary influences which would make . the Constitution impregnable against disaster . Starting with July 4th and the declaration of independence , they did a little calctdating and hit on the first Tuesday after the first Monday for election , and on March 4th for the inaugural . This divides the year into three . So long as these dates were adhered to , our form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripod be disturbed , and there would be no telling . Well , one leg has been disturbed . There is , if we are to pin our faith on the stars , no telling . THE maid who works for us had a death in her family , an uncle ; and her great concern was that he escape pauper burial . It was a matter of raising enough money for a cemetery plot and the services of an undertaker , and it was quickly clone . We sometimes wonder why people care so deeply about " decent " burial . If they had ever paid a visit to potter 's field , as we once did , they might feel differently . New York 's unclaimed and impoverished dead lie in a spot far more beautiful than any of the well-to-do graveyards in town  --  they lie under the horse chestnuts on Hart Island , in Long Island Sound , near a bell buoy which forever mourns them and beneath a single inscription which commits them generously and equally to God . Of course , there is a prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners . But so must the living : we saw a bank teller only yesterday with a look in his eyes . Solution ANNUAANNUALLY , in business offices , LLY , is trouble with the stenographers , who are likely , in the first weeks of January , to write " 1936 " instead of " 1937 . " Or whatever the dates may be . You 've heard lots of jokes about it , but it 's a serious thing  --  gets the files all mixed up , and so on . An executive we know put a lot of thought on the matter , and finally instructed each of his little minxes to put a wad of chewing gum on the " 6 " key . That way , you ca n't make a mistake . Might remember it for next year . New Dragon IF you go to hear " Siegfried " at the Met this Friday , you 'll see Fafner , the dragon , in a much improved condition . This may not mean very much to you , but it 's a big thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes onstage , at the end of the second act . They have to make Fafner prance around , champing his jaws and spreading his fins , and , except for a little help they get from an overhead cable attached to the dragon 's papier-miche brow , they have to support his weight . The old-style Fafner weighed well over 250 pounds , principally because he had metal scales . By giving him a new canvas hide with painted-on scales , the property department succeeded in taking a hundred pounds off his weight . Fafner 's front legs , Charley Walters , and his back legs , Paddy Downey , are grateful . The NValters-Downey team has been playing Fafner for fifteen years , and life has steadily been getting easier for them . Away hack , they used to suffer considerably on account of the fact that live steampipes ran through Fafner ( for the smoke that comes out of his nostrils ) ; about five years ago Fafner was air-conditioned , by replacing the live steam with a vapor made from ammonia , muriatic acid , and rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat the place up . The rose water is included just to make things pleasanter for Siegfried . Charley and Paddy , who are stagehands when they are n't being Fafner , were n't chosen for their rifles for any special reason . " I just told them to get in there one day , " Phil Crispano , the head property man , explained to us , " and they did . Worked out all right , so I kept them . " They get three dollars extra on " Siegfried " nights , and a certain amount of good-natured fun . The clouds of smoke from Fafner 's nostrils and the flashing of his eyes are taken care of backstage . ( Fafner , as you may have noticed , never comes completely out of his cave ; the pipes and wires are run in through the part of his tail that remains hidden . ) Paddy works Fafner 's eyes and fins with strings , from his hind-legs post , while Charley opens and closes the jaws . Neither of the boys can see out . Charley gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property rock . " Open , Charley ! Close , Charley ! " he yells , adding considerably to the Wagnerian thunder . To keep Charley from bumping the tenor with Fafner 's head , Mr. Crispano guides it with a thin cord . When Melchior is singing , Mr. Crispano sometimes lets Fafner hit him , just for the hell of it . Lots of tenors , he explains , are scared of the dragon  --  wo n't get anywhere near it , and spoil the whole scene . " But this Mr. Melchior , now , he 's a peach . When I see him corning , I say , Go to it , Charley . Give it to him , Charley . ' And Paddy and Charley give him the works . " ? THE other morning a little , grayish man was strolling down Lexington Avenue , in a pleasant alcoholic glow . He was n't bothering anybody  --  just murmuring , every time a lady passed him , " Madam has a funny hat . " No Anthem IT looks as if New York would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , as you may remember , ASCAP , the songwriters ' organization , offered a prize of $2,000 for a suitable one ( words and music ) , and Mayor LaGuardia sponsored a contest to select it . When the contest closed , on August 15th , about two thousand entries had been received , and a committee of thirty-one citizens  --  among them Gene Buck , Judge James G. Wallace , F. P. A. , Mrs. Henry Brecldnridge , and Bill Robinson  --  set to work judging them . The original plan was to select half a dozen promising anthems and let the public make the final choice at a concert on the Mall or in the Stadium . This , it turned out , was just wishful thinking , because the committee did n't turn up even one promising anthem . Sometimes the words would be all right , and sometimes the music , but never both in the same anthem . As things look now , the contest will be reopened for an indefinite period , in the hope that something will turn up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . Three-quarters of them dealt with Broadway , the white lights , night life , things like that . A good deal of confusion was caused by Mayor LaGuardia 's rule that if one of the boroughs was mentioned in the song , the four others had to be included , too : if you wrote something about " the lights of Manhattan " ( and lots of people did ) , you had to find some way of working in the Bronx , Richmond , Queens , and Brooklyn . The most favored rhyme for " Bronx " was " taxi-cab honks , " while the only solution many of the authors could find for " Queens " was " city o ' my dreams . " This , also , may be called a typical rhyme : I 've wandered all through Dublin and Cork , But there 's no place like New York . When you have said that you prefer New York to Cork , you 've said something , of course , but not enough for an anthem . Some of the entries were written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme , and were done up with ribbons and colored pictures of the New York skyline . The committee , of course , did n't allow themselves to he affected one way or the other by these touches . Neither were they affected by the elaborate musical composition , completely scored for symphony orchestra and chorus , that came from a man in Austria . Judge Wallace , chairman of the committee , summed up the whole thing for us : " The people who sent them in were literate , but they just lacked inspiration . " Water Buffalo ONE of the strangest stories of the week  --  and certainly the most pointless one  --  is about a sculptress who made a small statue of a water buffalo , and took it home from her studio to her apartment . As she was going clown in the elevator of the studio building , the elevator boy said , " That 's a nice water buffalo you got there . " Water buffaloes are rather exotic animals , and the lady was a little surprised that the boy recognized one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked . " Oh , I been in the East , " he said airily . When she arrived at her apartment house and entered the elevator , that elevator boy 's first words were , " Say , that 's a pretty good water buffalo you got there . " " How did you know ? " she began to ask , but he cut her off a little austerely . " I 've travelled quite a bit in the East , " he said . The whole episode made the lady thoughtful for several days . Not thoughtful about anything in particular , just thoughtful . Arnold , TN the advertising department of AL Arnold , Constable &; Co. , the department store , there is a young man named Arnold Constable . This is a little surprising , because the firm name is properly punctuated with a comma : Arnold , Icommal Constable &; Co . And , anyway , Arnold could n't he the boss 's son , because the boss is named Mr. Liberman . We brooded about the problem for a while , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing in no time . He 's no relation to the store people , and was named Arnold just by coincidence . " They had to call me something , " he said . He got into the store through the good offices of a friend in the advertising department , who recommended him to the attention of Mr. Liberman . We asked how Mr. L. acted when he learned Arnold 's name . " He was surprised , " Arnold told us . He does n't know whether or not his name had anything to do with his being employed ; thinks it was no handicap , at any rate . In two years , he worked up from stock boy to advertising production manager . " Mr. Liberman became interested in me , in a small way , " he says modestly . In his stock-boy days , he aroused a certain amount of suspicion among his colleagues , who thought he might be the son of an official ; even now lots of people are incredulous . Arnold calls up , says , " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , in parting , if it gave him a thrill to see his name in front of the store , in big block letters , as if he were an actor . " Well , it did at first , " he said . " But it sort of wore off . " Encounter HERE 'S yet another Dali story , this one a happening at the Julien Levy Gallery during the Dali show . A small , middle-aged , firm-corseted New York matron was doing the exhibit by herself , catalogue in hand , and in a secluded corner chanced upon M. Dali , standing alone and thinking dark , mixed-up thoughts , while all around news photographers flashed their bulbs . She gasped , started to scuttle away , then gathered her courage and addressed him . " while the young man looked at her , then lowered his eyelashes . At last he spoke , expressionless in face and voice , detached and pallid : " Au contraire . " Contents THE other day a young man with nothing better to do made a canvass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of finding out just what it is that doormen carry in those leather cases they have slung over their shoulders . He then hurried right around to see us , and told us the results , which , to our mind , fall somewhere in the borderland between instructive and uninstructive information . In the first place , it seems that not all doormen are pouch-hearing . The Plaza doorman has n't got one , nor have the doormen at the Waldorf-Astoria , the Savoy-Plaza , the Biltmore , and the Roosevelt . Lee , of the Ritz , does carry a case , and willingly let our friend peep inside . There were $10 in hills , some cards with memoranda scribbled on them , some cards of the Atnorosi Garage , a paper with a dozen or so licence numbers written on it , and a letter addressed to Lee . The money , Lee explained , is to pay the cab fares of forgetful people ; he pays about six a day , almost always for ladies . The Amorosi Garage is where the Ritz sends people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi , Amorosil ) . The paper with the licence numbers dates back to the time of the elevator strike ; contains data about cars bearing squads of strikers , of whom Lee was to beware . He just has n't bothered to throw it away . The letter our friend judged to be Lee 's own affair . Max , at the St. Regis , had more or less what Lee had , and , in addition , an address book and some car-number tickets  --  the latter used , as you probably know , for calling private cars by means of a signal light above the doorman 's hut . The doorman at the Astor ( our friend did n't catch his name ) had nothing of interest except a typewritten copy of a little song : This , our friend gathered , had been sung at the staff Christmas party . F.A . is Fred Muschenheim , president of the Astor Hotel Corporation ; R.K.C. is Robert K. Christen berry , vice-president and general manager . That 's all our friend found out about doormen 's pouches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandman ALITTLE girl who lives out Port Washington way recently entered into a deal with the CocaCola people whereby , in return for a certain number of empty bottles and a little cash , she was to receive a nice doll with open-and-shut eyes . The doll was sent to her all right , but its eyes would n't close . Her father could n't make them close , and neither could her mother . Finally the three of them sat down and wrote a polite but reproachful letter to the Coca-Cola folk . It got immediate results . Next day a huge Coca-Cola truckand-trailer combination drew up in front of the little girl 's house , and two young men jumped down off the driver 's seat . " We have had your communication , " one of them said to the little girl , who happened to be playing outside in the yard . " Could we see the doll ? " She went inside and got the doll . One of the young men took it in his arms and , very gently , tapped the bisque head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. W. R. KNIGHT , who lectures on eagles , is staying at the Gotham , with an eagle named James . This is not the first time an eagle has lived at the Gotham . Captain Knight lived there last year with an eagle named Mr. Ramshaw . " Come and have a look at James , do ! " the Captain shouted jovially when we called on him . " He 's a dramatic thing . " He opened the bathroom door , and there was James , sitting in the tub , a leather hood over his piratical face to keep him from biting people . James , the Captain told us , is two and a half years old , a fine , upstanding specimen of Martial hawk eagle from South Africa , considerably larger than an American eagle . He ( James ) was moodily tearing the bathmat to hits with his talons . Captain Knight brought him out into the bedroom , removed the hood , set him on the back of a chair , and put a raw turkey head on the window sill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turkey head as neatly as if he had been 4 sparrow . " Damned fine bird , that , " said the Captain . " Take a cock pheasant on the wing . Thump . All over , what ? Oh , rather . Sometimes takes Persian cats . Catholic taste . " He then put James hack in the bathtub , to keep him fresh for an appearance before the Yale Club that evening , and told us something about the eagle business . Seems that Captain Knight became interested in falconry while he was still in school , in England . He bought a young hawk that had fallen out of a tree , and taught it to follow a bit of meat tied to a string . " I fancy I had a flair for it , " he says . " No good at games , you know . Loathed cricket . " Falconry has never quite died out in England , and the Captain picked up some pointers from old-timers . Pretty soon he found himself branching out from hawks to eagles , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yachtsman . Eagles are trained the same way hawks are , but they 're bigger and more dangerous . Captain Knight 's first eagle nearly tore his face off , and since then he has worn a mask while breaking in new eagles . For years , he has been taking moving pictures of eagles in flight , and lecturing on them , with a personal-appearance flight by some reliable eagle to climax the show . When , in the Town Hall , he looses James over the heads of the League for Political Education , the effect is tremendous . On one of his visits here , Captain Knight was accompanied by two eagles , three hawks , and two owls , all of which lived with him in a suite at the Wentworth . Last year , at the Gotham , Mr. Ramshaw flew out the window and down to the sidewalk , where he was bagged by a cop and taken to the station house . " I 'm eternally grateful to the bloke for not bashing poor old Ramshaw over the head , " the Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He thinks people in general ought to be more in sympathy with eagles , and deplores the shortsighted attitude of farmers who make a fuss about losing an occasional lamb . " Damn it , " he says . " Must we be governed entirely by self-interest ? " As for the stories about eagles ' carrying off babies , " Why , eagles ca n't lift more than ten pounds , " he tells you . " A very small infant , p'raps , if it were left where it could be got at , but nothing more . I wish you 'd get rather onto that . " We got onto it and flew away .
