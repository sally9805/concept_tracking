Year ago , the highly reputable National Bureau of Economic Research got a fund from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Association of Reserve City Bankers to study instalment credit . It found a red-haired University of Pennsylvania professor named Ralph Young , and a black-haired Hunter College girl named Blanche Bernstein who knew her onions , having plowed through difficult statistical jobs with NRA , WPA , U. S. Department of Labor , etc . These two , with three assistants , were set up in N.B.E.R. 's financial research workshop-an estate ( next door to Arturo Toscanini ) , in swank Riverdale , N. Y. , with tennis court , swimming pool , view of the Hudson . Handed to them was a stack of raw material : statistics on the purchases of 60,000 U. S. families , collected by white-collar WPAsters in 1935-36 . <P> Last week the Bureau published The Statistical Pattern of Instalment Debt , a 23-page pamphlet , which told the results of the study of non-relief families in 1935-36 . Prime facts : <P> &gt; Nearly one in four U. S. families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was among families with revenues of $1,750-$2,000 . <P> &gt; The 1935-36 recovery caused 70% of instalment-buying families to increase their instalment indebtedness . The net increase amounted to $407,000,000 or $580,000,000 when single persons and relief families were included . <P> &gt; Automobiles were the largest item of instalment buying in dollar volume , accounted for 50% of the gross increase . Next : furniture ( 18% ) ; electric refrigerators ( 15% ) . <P> &gt; Heaviest instalment buying was in biggish cities ; small cities have less , metropolises like New York and Chicago ( where fewer families own automobiles ) still less . Farm families did least instalment buying of any .
