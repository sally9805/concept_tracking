To its victims , hay fever is no laughing matter . Every summer , over 6,000,000 people in the U. S. are racked by its sneezes , blinded by its tears . For half the sufferers , the 15th of August , when ragweed fever begins , is their last sneezeless day till frost . Why the disease always strikes on August 15 is no nasal mystery , but merely another indication of Nature 's regularity . As August 15 approaches , the shortening of daylight hours allows the ragweed plant precisely enough sunlight to ripen it on that day . And the number of hours of daylight and darkness for a given date is the same from year to year . <P> Most hay fever victims understand little about their malady . No mere irritant of nose and throat , the pollen , when inhaled , affects the bloodstream , is repelled by specific " reagins " the body produces to fight the irritating grains . Hence neither inhalants nor drops in the eyes bring more than temporary relief . But fairly reliable insurance for a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness : a doctor scratches a patient 's skin , applies various types of pollen extract ; the one which produces wheals and itching is then administered in subcutaneous injections of refined , sterilized pollen . How the immunization works , nobody knows . Immunity is not permanent , injections must be resumed every year , are sometimes given all year round . <P> Similar in effect to injections are the pollen pills first introduced by Detroit 's Sherman Laboratories last spring . Ten days before he starts sneezing , the patient swallows a few pills , gradually increases the amount until his physician calls a halt . Medical opinion is now divided on the efficacy of the pills , some physicians holding that the pills cause serious upsets in the digestive system . <P> Aids but no cures are air-conditioned rooms ( expensive , confining ) and electrically charged masks ( cumbersome , unbecoming ) .
