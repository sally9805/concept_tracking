Ominous from a religious viewpoint was a symposium of personal credos by 38 assorted intellectuals which was published this week. * For only one of the 38 , Catholic Jacques Maritain , believes firmly in a personal God or in traditional Christianity . As individual as their authors , who range from Humorist James Thurber to Explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson , the credos still managed to agree that the world 's state is parlous , that organized religion offers no real solution . <P> Most specific in his condemnation was British Novelist E. M. Forster : " I can not believe that Christianity will ever cope with the present world-wide mess , and I think that such influence as it retains in modern society is due to its financial backing rather than to its spiritual appeal . It was a spiritual force once , but the indwelling spirit will have to be restated if it is to calm the waters again , and probably restated in a non-Christian form .
