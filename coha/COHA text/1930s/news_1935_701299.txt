txt War on Tent Caterpillars . Every one who has been outside the metropolitan area lately must have observed that the countryside is taking on the appearance of a devastated area , due to the tent caterpillar . No place seems to be free of them , and while it is true that the pest now seems Lo prefer to eat the less valuable trees and shrubs , its taste might change . I wonder if people generally realize how simple it is to destroy these tents and their inhabitants . First make a torch by wiring a small bundle of rags to a stout stick , saturate the bundle with kerosene , light it and holding the flaming mass close underneath the caterpillars ' tent , burn it out thoroughly , including the caterpillars . If each householder in the suburbs were to treat as many trees as he conveniently could , we would be a long way toward conquering this pest . H. GINDORFF .
