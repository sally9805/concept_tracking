txt Senator Clark disclosed on the floor of the Senate today that his father , Champ Clark , always believed that William Jennings Bryan " betrayed " him at the Baltimore convention of the Democratic party in 1912 , and that members of Mr. Clark 's family felt " animosity " toward Mr. Bryan for his part in preventing Speaker Clark from obtaining the Presidential nomination in place of Woodrow Wilson . The statement came as part of Mr. Clark 's general defense of his part in putting into the record of the munitions committee , of which he is a member , matter on which Senator Nye , its chairman , based his remark on Wednesday that President Wilson " falsified " in certain testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1919 . Mr. Nye 's eharge related to a declaration by Mr. Wilson that he knew nothing of the secret treaties between the World War allies until the peace conference in Paris , whereas State Department archives indicated , it was charged , that the wartime President knew of them shortly after this country declared war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " In Washington " column of THE NEW YORK TIMES , by Arthur Krock , which appeared Thursday , Senator Clark said : " Mr. President , before I conclude , may I be pardoned a personal word ? Hits at Attacks in Press . " For the past several days a studious effort has been made on the part of some newspapers in the United States to make it appear that my own part in the conduct of the examinations of the Munitions Committee was actuated by personal animus because President Wilson defeated my father for the Democratic nomination for President in the Baltimore convention in 1912 . " Mr. President , that matter is very easily disposed of . There was never the slightest animosity between my father and President Wilson or toward the memory of President Wilson by any member of my father 's family . My father was a candidate at the Baltimore convention , as he had a right to be , and he received a majority on nine ballots . " He was subsequently defeated by President Wilson , who was also a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , so far as I have ever been informed , did nothing improper or blameworthy in connection with that fight . " Such animosity as my father had , such animosity as I have felt , or as other members of my family have felt , was directed toward another man , a delegate instructed as a delegate for my father under a law which he drew himself , and who betrayed my father at the Baltimore convention  --  namely , William Jennings Bryan .. Denies Personal Feeling . " And it must be obvious that were I actuated in the slightest degree by personal feeling , that the last thing I should desire to do would be to introduce in the record any testimony or any exhibits which would necessarily tend to justify the position taken by Mr. Bryan , as Secretary of State , or as a private citizen , in contradiction to the position taken by Woodrow Wilson or any one else . " Mr. President , it seems to me that that is a proposition so plain , so obvious and so concise that even such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE Nsw YORK TIDIES ought to be able to grasp it . " On this , the third day of almost continuous bitter attacks in the Senate against the Munitions Committee for its activities , matters were so confused that committee officials suspended all- plans for further hearings until a decision could be reached by its members . Indications have been given by several Senators that they will vote against any further funds to continue the investigation , and the committee has expended all but a few hundred dollars of the $125,000 which the Senate placed at its disposal . Replies to Glass Attack . When Mr. Clark took the floor today , he began to reply to the impassioned speech Senator Glass made yesterday in defense of Woodrow Wilson . " I regret that the Senator from Virginia saw fit to pour the force of his powerful vituperation , invective and abuse upon an individual member of the Munitions Committee ( Mr. Nye ) rather than dispassionately and soberly to read the record of the testimony which has been adduced with a view to learning therefrom what led to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , " said Senator Clark . " The purpose of the investigation which has been conducted since the convening of Congress early this month was not for the purpose of a basis for criticism , or praise , or of laudation of the work of any man , or even the course of any man , whether he be alive or whether he be dead . " I submit that it is no reflection on the memory of President Wilson , no reflection on the memory of Secretary Lansing , no reflection on the memory of Secretary Bryan , or of any member of the House or Senate who opposed the declaration of war in 1917 , to soberly and dispassionately examine them in connection with the circumstances which finally brought us into the World War , a war in which victory was - followed by calamity , a war which , viewed in the perspective of twenty years , can only be regarded as one of the greatest , if not the greatest of calamities that ever befell the United States in its entire history . " Does Not Concur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times ; and finally asked Mr. Clark whether he concurred in the charge Senator Nye had made against President Wilson . " So far as I am concerned , " he replied , " I have never said , and I do not now say and I do not believe , that President Wilson had personal knowledge of the treaties prior to the entry of the United States into the war . " " Why did not the Senator include in that ( referring to the Munitions Committee 's record ) the Zimmerman telegram in which Germany proposed an alliance with Mexico conditioned on the fact that in the event of victory a number of States , including Arizona , New Mexico , Texas and a great territory , should be given back to Mexico ? " Senator Connally demanded . Mr. Clark answered that he did not consider the incident a " material contributing cause " to this country 's entry into the war . Mr. Connally then returned to his charge of yesterday , that the committee had violated the conditions of Robert Lansing 's will in examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " that Mr. Lansing left his private diaries to his wife with the injunction not to publish them within twenty years , because of the living characters mentioned in them , and that Mrs. Lansing upon her death left them with Mr. Dulles and he turned them over to the Library of Congress . Is it true that the committee subpoenaed those documents from the Library of Congress ? " Byrnes Makes Challenge . Mr. Nye interrupted to reply that , according to his recollection , the Library of Congress did not comply with the committee 's subpoena until it had the consent of the Lansing estate . Senator Byrnes , chairman of the Audit and Control Committee , challenged Mr. Clark or Mr. Nye to introduce a resolution calling for additional funds to continue the committee 's investigation . He promised that the Audit and Control Committee would report it to the Senate in ten minutes and that the Senate could then and there decide whether it wanted the investigation to continue . Mr. Nye declined the invitation , although Mr. Byrnes offered him a resolution already drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the introducer . The Munitions Committee chairman said he would need a little time to ascertain exactly how much money his organization would require to complete its work . Senator Glass said that the committee 's record to date did not constitute a " revelation worth $125 , - 000 , or even 25 cents . "
