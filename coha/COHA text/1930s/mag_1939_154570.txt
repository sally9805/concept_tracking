Colorado 's Supreme Court decided in May that the privately owned retail outlets of Gamble-Skogmo , Inc. ( auto parts ) were not a " voluntary " chain of stores and therefore fair game for the State 's chain-store tax . Right then U. S. motormakers began to anticipate trouble . Last week to General Motors , Colorado sent a bill for $234,655 ; to Ford went one for $102,470 ; to Chrysler , Hudson , Studebaker , Nash and Packard went others totaling $193,995 . Grand total : $531,120 , billed to the seven motormakers for four years ' chain-store license fees ( $2.50 to $300.50 a store ) . Grounds : their licensing and supervision of dealers made them members of a chain . <P> Auto manufacturers saw more trouble ahead : 19 other States with chain-store taxes may take the cue from Colorado and submit their own bills for license fees . If such taxes can be made to stick they will play hob with the entire system of automobile distribution , not to mention other articles similarly merchandised.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
