Dictator Stalin 's veteran favorite , Lazar Kaganovich , big-nosed and brutally effective in driving Soviet bureaucrats to greater Five-Year Plan zeal was last week gazetted a Vice Premier . Thus was promoted a man who is one of the few remaining Old Bolshevik top-rank members of the Government , deserving of promotion if only for the amount of trouble he has shouldered . But even such good news as a promotion was a reflection of a purge . The announcement made passing mention of " former " Vice Premiers Vlas Chubar and Stanislav Kosior . Chubar and Kosior recently failed of election to either the Legislature of their native Ukraine or that of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic . Secretive Soviet officials would not say whether or not this prominent Bolshevik pair are still Vice Premiers , but in journalistic Moscow they were rated " finished . " <P> Meanwhile , it was reported last week that : 1 ) the Commissariats for Food , Machine Building and Purchases had been purged and given new heads ; 2 ) the Commissariats for the Navy , Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten officials of the Azerbaijan Agriculture Commissariat were executed for " plotting to overthrow the Soviet Government and sabotage animal husbandry . " <P> Visitors to Moscow report that a few Russians whose love of fun-* is greater than their discretion are now saying : " Is n't it too bad , Comrade ? They say our beloved leader has lost his last friend and the poor man has had to start shooting mere acquaintances . " <P> - *German funsters , like Russians , are still willing to risk their necks with political wisecracks . A recent conundrum which they thought sidesplitting : " What is the difference between Russia and Germany ? " Answer : " Russia is much colder . "
