Ever since being reluctantly forced to recognize Adolf Hitler 's annexation of Austria last fortnight , the State Department has been pressed by liberal and racial groups to think up a practical way to express the U. S. Government 's disapproval . Last week . Secretary Cordell Hull thought he had found one , gave out a statement describing it : <P> " This Government has become so impressed with the urgency of the problem of political refugees that it has inquired of a number of governments in Europe and in this hemisphere whether they would be willing to cooperate in setting up a special committee for the purpose of facilitating the emigration from Austria and presumably from Germany of political refugees . Our idea is that , whereas such representatives would be designated by the Governments concerned , any financing of the emergency emigration referred to would be undertaken by private organizations within the respective countries . " The statement added that the committee would in no way interfere with work on the same problem currently being done by existing agencies ; and that no country would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws permit . Invitations to help set up the committee went to Great Britain , France . Italy , Belgium , The Netherlands , Denmark , Sweden , Norway , Switzerland and 20 South American republics . <P> Whether or not Secretary Hull 's idea of a refugee committee amounts to much more than a grandiose gesture , its reception last week was magnificent . In the U. S. , it was unanimously praised by Jewish welfare groups , the Federal Council of Churches and the nation 's press . Abroad it was indicated that prompt official acceptances would be forwarded from Great Britain , France , The Netherlands and Belgium . Meanwhile , before details of the plan had been worked out and before the State Department had explained precisely what the committee would be expected to accomplish , Franklin Roosevelt told a Warm Springs , Ga . press conference that he hoped the U. S. would maintain its 150-year-old tradition by becoming an asylum for political refugees not only from Germany and Austria but from Russia , Italy and Spain as well . Whether or not his invitation included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President did not say . <P> Operating problems of turning the U. S. into a haven for the oppressed consist of 1 ) getting them out of where they are and 2 ) getting them into the U. S. On the first , Adolf Hitler last week was surprisingly polite . Said he in a speech at Konigsberg : ' I can only hope and expect that the other world , which has such deep sympathy for these criminals , will at least be generous enough to convert this sympathy into practical aid . We , on our part , are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries , for all I care , even on luxury ships . " Rudest German comment on the plan came from the Schwarze Korps , official organ of the Secret Police : " We still offer in free Hamburg a well-assorted stock of Jewish lawyers , well-preserved and well-rested women doctors , specialists for skin and social diseases , also Jewish business heads and raw material wholesalers and Jewish salesmen , the last item with considerable rebate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
