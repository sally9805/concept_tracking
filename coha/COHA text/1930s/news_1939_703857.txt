txt The chance of freeing the people of Europe " from a nightmare that haunts them and from an expenditure upon armaments that beggars them " was pictured by Sir Samuel Hoare , British Home Minister , in a speech tonight . as the " greatest opportunity that has ever been offered to the leaders of the world . " " Five men in Europe  --  three dictators and the Prime Ministers of England and France  --  if they worked with singleness of purpose and unity of action , " said Sir Samuel , " might in an incredibly short space of time transform the whole history of the world . " These five men , working together in Europe and blessed in their efforts by the President of the United States of America , might make themselves eternal benefactors of the human race . Our own Prime Minister has shown his determination to work heart and soul to such an end . I can not believe that other leaders of Europe will not join him in the high endeavor upon which he is engaged . " Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' this flight of official imagination followed up yesterday 's authoritative hint that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain foresaw disarmament discussions later this year " if all goes well . " Would Offset Arms Talk It was an attempt by the most effective speechmaker in the Cabinet to turn Europe 's thoughts toward peace . There was an element of wishful thinking in it , as there was in yesterday 's statement by a highly placed government spokesman , but there is reason to believe it was intended to offset the emphasis that had been placed upon the armed strength of this country in recent weeks . The Chamberlain government is still trying to drive the twin horses of armaments and " appeasement " without letting either run too far ahead . Having announced this week that it was planning to send nineteen divisions to France in case of war , the govarnment is now issuing reminders that it is thinking of peace as Sir Samuel 's references to five nen , instead of to five governnents , suggested Mr. Chamberlain vas playing with the idea of an ) ther meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegations from each country . The mention of " three dictators " could only be taken to mean the inclusion of Joseph Stalin in such a meeting , although Mr. Chamberlain 's previous contacts with heads of States have been limited to the four Western European powers . Altogether Sir Samuel 's dream tonight seemed to bring back the idea attributed to President Roosevelt three years ago of a great meeting of the heads of States to settle the problems of Europe around a table ? an idea which , by the way , has never found the slightest encouragement from the British Government until now . Sir Samuel did not suggest that Mr. Roosevelt should attend such a meeting . and in an earlier passage , speaking of " solidarity of effort in the three great democracies , " he went out of his way to say that the United States was in a " different position " from Britain and France . " It is out of Europe and does not wish to be drawn into European entanglements , " said the British Minister . " It has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by foreign obligations . We realize these differences ; we accept them , and we should be both meddlesome and foolish if we attempted to run counter to them . " The American democracy will go its own way and no one here will try to deflect it . But this is not a significant fact at the present moment . The significant fact is the simultaneous rejuvenescence of democratic strength in each of the three great democracies , not least the American , and the equal determination of all three to resist and resist victoriously any and every attack upon its life and liberty . " There was much more in this confident strain in the earlier part of Sir Samuel 's speech , especially when he talked of the huge sums Britain was spending on armaments and of the results now emerging " with ever-increasing effect . " " They show , I am convinced , that we could not be defeated in a short war by any knockout blow , " he declared , " and that in a long war our almost inexhaustible resources would insure final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the United States , he went on , were " much more than repairs of gaps in the national defenses . " " They are outward and visible signs , " he said , " of the strength and vigor of the three countries and of their unshaken resolution to ward off any attack on their historic liberties . Never in , our memory has there been so fundamental a unity or so firm a resolve in all three democracies , each differing from the other in almost every respect and each forming its conclusions in its own way , but all three inevitably impelled upon the same program of national defense . " All this , however , had been said before in different words , so had the emphatic assurances in the British Minister 's speech that the democracies had " no intention of attacking any one if only others will leave us alone . " But what was new and significant was the stress he laid upon " friendly discussion , " not only on trade problems but on the wider issues now troubling Europe . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere favorable for starting disarmament talks ; his spokesman yesterday was careful to explain that such discussions could only begin after the Spanish war had been finally settled and after a FrenchItalian reconciliation had taken place . Nobody seriously believes as yet that there can be comprehensive limitation or reduction of armaments for a long time . The best that is expected at first is , as the spokesman explained yesterday , a slight measure of agreement that would help confidence in Europe . Why , then , is the present moment being chosen for hints of a conference and for a show of public optimism in the highest quarters ? The first reason , as has already been said , is to keep the idea of conciliation alive . The air has been full of warnings to the totalitarian powers , in the form of vigorous speeches and colossal armament estimates , not to start any rash adventures in Europe . Mr. Chamberlain and his advisers are said to feel that the British Government 's ultimate objectives may have been blurred by all this emphasis on the risks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis powers of what peace might bring . The second reason is a desire ? natural in a business man like Mr. Chamberlain  --  to improve business confidence , not to mention the fortunes of the Conservative party in a general election year . A third fact  --  attested to by all visitors to Downing Street this week  --  is that Mr. Chamberlain feels he has genuine reason for optimism in the reports reaching him from the Continent . All accounts agree that Germany is preoccupied at the moment with economic problems , and there are even rumors of assurances from Rome that the Italian claims against France will be put forward in peaceful discussion , as the British have always hoped they would . be . Mr. Chamberlain 's record as a prophet of good times is not , of course , unblemished . On July 26 of last year , on the eve of the worst crisis since 1914 , he told the House of Commons the " oppressive " tension had been relaxed and the atmosphere lightened . Many competent observers here believe Mr. Chamberlain 's spokesman yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French-Italian reconciliation . Winston Churchill warned in a speech tonight that the " danger is by no means over " ; that a " most anxious period lies ahead and the utmost vigilance and energy will be required from all . " Nevertheless London was just as cheerful today as it was " jittery " six weeks ago . The optimism is especially strong at 10 Downing Street , and tonight 's speech by Sir Samuel Hoare , like yesterday 's authoritative statement , was a reflection of Mr. Chamberlain 's confidence . " Suppose , " he said , " that political confidence could be restored in Europe . Suppose there was a fiveyear plan immensely greater than any five-year plan that this or that particular country has attempted in recent times , and that for the space of five years there were neither wars nor rumors of wars . * * * Could we not then devote the almost incredible inventions and discoveries of our time to the creation of a golden age in which poverty could be reduced to insignificance and the standard of living raised to heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
