His Imperial Majesty , Reza Shah Pahlavi , Shah of Iran , ceremoniously hammered a golden spike into a railway tie last week . Later , excited Iranians in Teheran watched the first train to make the trip from Bandar Shahpur , on the inlet Khor Musa of the Persian Gulf , pull in to Iran 's inland capital . Thus the Trans-Iranian Railway , most spectacular , most expensive railroad enterprise undertaken since the World War , was pronounced completed . The railroad is the dream come true of a westernizing , wilful ruler who still believes in the 19th-Century notion that railroad-building is a matter of national prestige . <P> It took eleven years to complete the 865-mile railway which more than tripled Iran 's previously existing lines . Heading north from the Persian Gulf , the railroad crosses the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. ' s pipeline ; passes through Ahwaz , where Alexander the Great 's fleet landed 2,263 years ago ; bridges the swift Karun River ; climbs mountains to reach Dizful , famed city of rats . Thence the line passes northeast through Sultanabad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Shi'ites , to reach Teheran . From the capital the road continues east , northeast , over a 7,200-foot-high mountain pass to reach Bandar Shah , new German-built port near the ancient city of Astarabad and on the semitropical shores of the Caspian Sea . A train will now be able to haul oil from the southwest to the granaries of the northeast , can return to the Persian Gulf loaded with Mazanderan cotton and Caspian Sea caviar . How much the freight charges will be is another matter . <P> Little did it matter last week to loyal Iranians that the railroad had cost $160,000,000 , that its financing out of revenue had bled the country white , had caused a prohibitive tax to be levied on sugar and tea and forced down the exchange value of the currency . Not one rial of foreign money went into its construction . Skipping most of Iran 's largest centres , crossing mountain ranges , connecting with no foreign railways , the line is patently uneconomic . But Danish engineers , with the help of U. S. , German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking engineering job with its numerous spectacular tunnels ( one a bizarre spiral affair ) , many high bridges , frequent gorge-crossing viaducts.
