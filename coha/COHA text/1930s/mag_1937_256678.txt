Another step in the practical consolidation of the Hearst empire ( TIME , July 5 et seq. ) was accomplished last week when International News Service took over Universal Service . Universal was the personal mouthpiece of William Randolph Hearst . It went to his morning papers , carrying news written to reflect the Chief 's most cherished ideas . It also carried his biggest personal scoops , like the positive statement last November that Edward VIII would marry Mrs. Simpson . <P> While Universal operated always in the red , International News Service had inched into the black in 1935 , doubled its list of clients to over 700 papers , mostly evening . The merger makes I. N. S. a 24-hour-service and gives it such feature writers as Damon Runyon , Bugs Baer and Louella Parsons . <P> Barry Farris continues as editor of expanded I. N. S. ; Universal 's Seymour Berkson takes charge of the night wire ; and at the top remains smiling Joseph V. Connolly as president of I. N. S. and prosperous King Features Syndicate .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
