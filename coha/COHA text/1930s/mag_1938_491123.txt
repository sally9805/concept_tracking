/ T GOES as far back as I remember ; the time my father , on being asked by a neighbor about his family , pointed also to me , saying , " And he 's going to America ! " When young , I was picked to be an immigrant here , as were members of virtually every family with children in our little village of Fedamore , of virtually every family in Ireland . I had no say about it. , and I accepted it naturally . I was really an exile in my mother 's womb . So , from the time when I first trod across the floor and lisped in numbers , my thoughts daily were directed toward America . I was taught that Ireland was a place to he born , reared in and leave , and because I was smart in school I was picked as one of the lucky ones bound for a land where there was a future . Ireland was but a way station on the long transatlantic line to America . And the day came when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , I cut the home ties , which are nowhere stronger than in Ireland , that is called " the Land of the Family .

Plaintive and hopeless strains , because in very few cases was the poetic , request realized , and most of us were " lost to the race and the sod . " The ship was crowded to capacity with emigrants , and I found myself but one in the unending stream of Irish expatriates who had been coming here for years on top of years , to atone for the accident of birth that made them Irish . The last sad farewells , and the ship , filled with a home-Loving folk accustomed to no more travel than a visit to the nearest market town in the barony , headed west for 3000 miles over the gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight , mystic under the paly cusp of a horned moon . and its topless towers piercing the dusk ; and at last I was come to the Ultima Thule of an Irishman 's dream , the dream 1 , of exile , created , evoked and fostered in his heart by the tribulations of a tragic history until it had become an obsession of the national mind and consciousness , a racial mania . We touched the free shores of America , which we called our " second motherland , the greater Ireland beyond the seas . " Immigrants Become Emigrants T HAT was in 1912 , just another normal year of Irish immigration here , when every Irishman was in his heart a potential American , and his greatest wish was to become a naturalized American Citizen . Times change , however , even among the Irish . In 1937 , the Irish not only failed to fill their quota , but did not even fill a fraction of it . And it is stated that for the 400 and some odd immigrants from the Free State with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housing and piled up above the broad wings of the blades . The two lighted head lamps , high on the face of the cab , looked down like the eyes of a mammoth bug ; the whole immense machine , squatting on its long snowy eats , seemed to be breathing rapidly . As he ran toward it , Eaton saw the cab door standing open and the helper trying to lilt the driver from his seat . ? " He 's got the frost cramps , boss , " the helper reported . " Got the what ? " Eaton roared . The doctor , shouldering him away , thrust his own head into the cab and popped it out again , commanding , " Take him inside . . . . No , he ca n't walk . Carry him . " His voice rose and the helper , sensing authority , dived in and came out with the driver on his shoulder . " Get his feet warm ! " the doctor shouted after him . " Give him hot soup ! Half a cup ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eaton said . " Come on . " " When she-calls again , boss ? " Ole was howling . The doctor stumbled on the snowy eats , starting to climb to the cab of the plow . Eaton yelled , " No , no ! You follow in your car . I ca n't take time to bring you back ! " " Wo n't do any good going , if I do n't get there quick . " The doctor floundered in his two coats toward his own coupe , dropped his black bag into a drift . stooped awkwardly to pick it up . " Your man 's still hollering at you , Bob ! " he shouted . Eaton yelled back , " To hell with winter sports ! " " Eh ' " the doctor said . The motor drowned all voices . Eaton braked the left-hand eats , threw right-hand into gear and swung in a reckless clattering circle . He scraped the fender of the doctor 's ear , but did not look back . The machine rolled into the roadway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat feet on the pavement , body trembling with all its ten steel tons , big as a machine shop and twice as noisy . Vibration shook snow from the rearview mirror ; in the glass Eaton saw the coupe following him . Its image was blurred . Details overlapped , just as his thoughts did . Joe 's plow , with a broken axle , was at Kewadiu , fourteen miles beyond Acme , straight out this state road . The sick boy was at Williamsburg , six miles east of Acme on the county highway . He could turn off at Acme , break a path to the boy and then go on to Joe . But what about the senator 's dozen miles of private road ? He would pass it first , just four miles out of town . If he stopped now to plow it - No chance . It 'd take him two hours , in to the woman 's lodge and back . The doctor , the boy could n't wait . for that . Or , if he went back and plowed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he went on to Kewadin - In that case , with Joe 's broken plow idle all these hours , the state road through Acme and Kewadin , a main artery from Chicago to the Strait , would fill up right and the whole traveling public be delayed . If he did n't plow Senator Mttek 's road at all - Who 'd get this job , anyhow , if he were fired ? Eaton gunned the motor . The two windshield wipers , slapping back and forth , made clear half circles on the glass . Through them and through the thick blowing snow , he could see drifts at the roadside deepening . At Indian Trail they angled four-feet high across the concrete . Eaton felt the double blade take hold , and the weight of snow piling into the wide-mouthed hopper , where the thundering fan caught it and flung it in a. tall white arc beyond the shoulder of the road . He put on speed . The motor roared and the rotary wallowed . Hungrily it advanced on drifts , chewed its way through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four miles an hour ? He 'd told his men so , often . Warned them against speed . He was doing three times four miles right now . It was only midafternoon , yet darkness was boxing in the snowy world .

She 'd call in half an hour , she 'd said , to give her final orders . That must be twenty minutes ago . Ten minutes left . The woods on the right thinned , gave way to empty fields . A line of spindly telephone poles broke from the highway and tottered southward across the drifted flats . Her telephone poles . Her private line , to raise hell over , about her private road , which took off here , too , beside the poles . Too bad she had a telephone . Eaton sat straighter , forgetting the burning auger holes in his frosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suddenly threw both cats out of gear and set the brakes . The headlights of the coupe drew close behind him and halted too . The doctor piled out . He waded forward , yelling , " Not here , Bob ! Do n't turn here ! Go east from Acme for Williamsburg ! " Eaton did not reply . He geared the left-hand eats and swung the plow slowly until it faced the senator 's road . The doctor 's dogskin glove was thumping the cab door . " Out the way ! " Eaton bellowed . He put both cuts into gear . The plow jerked forward . It crossed the shoulder of the highway and shot ahead . The first pole stood only three feet From the blade . Eaton could see snow clinging to the north side of it . He rammed into it , felt a slight jar and braked the tractors . Above the rumble of the engine and the roar of storm he barely heard the brittle crack of the pole . Icy wires danced . The pole stood upright for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gust of fiercer wind struck it and the wires snapped , and it dropped suddenly , buried itself in the deep snow and disappeared . Eaton backed the plow . Let her try to call now ! Let her try to tell him just when to start ! He need n't plow it till she gave the order-was n't that what she 'd said herself ? The doctor was thumping the door again . He yelled , " If you ca n't see where you 're going , Bob - " " We 're going to Williamsburg ! " Eaton yelled back at him . At Acme , he swung east into the hills ; in thirty minutes halted in a farmhouse yard . The doctor , passing the plow , yelled , " Thanks ! " Eaton opened the door . " Good luck .

" The people of Iceland , it is stated , could understand what Irish was , due to the traffic carried on between the two countries . A company of Irishmen also are said to have sailed with Eric the Red , and it is recorded in the archives of Seville that one " William Ayres , an Irishman of Galway , went with Columbus to America . " Coming to Colonial times , the extent of Irish immigration is debatable , and there has never been any authoritative studymade of it . When the Irish claim that " half the American Revolutionary Army was Irish , " they , perhaps , exaggerate . But their figures of immigration are larger than generally supposed . To one American , who , to this day , remains the closest of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given credit for causing many Irishmen to come here , and he was Benjamin Franklin , who made two visits to Ireland , in 1769 and 1771 , where he was " most cordially received . by my good and dear friends of Ireland , " only to be treated in " so ignominious a Manner " in England , as he wrote to the Pennsylvania Gazette of April 22 , 1774 . He wrote a document there called , An Address to the Good People of Ireland on Behalf of America , which remains among the most remarkable documents of his life , and which , oddly , seems to have escaped the notice of American historians , since it has never been included in any of the editions of Franklin 's works . Most of the copies were confiscated . From September , 1819 , to December , 185:5 , of 4,212,624 immigrants from Europe , 1,747,930 were Irishwith 1,000,000 crossing between 1815 and 1845-1,206,087 German , and 207,492 English . From 1861 to 1900 , the Irish came at the rate of 50,000 a year , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century of the republic they outnumbered the English in their coming by a million . It was the hegira of a people unprecedented in the annals of Christendom , when , beaten down amid the dust and the tears , they flocked into the " coffin ships " which laid the basis of the transatlantic lines of today . In 1816 one could sail from Dublin or Derry to America for three pounds and ten shillings-for six pounds from Belfast , while three children could cress over for one adult fare . Later the standard rate became ten pounds . The falling off of Irish immigration to America is in many ways at once the most interesting and significant ethnological phenomenon of the postwar period , and especially so in the light of Irish immigration here from Colonial times to the present day . A study of the tabulated figures , herewith , of this immigration is revealing-that is , figures from 1841 to the present day . There are three unique aspects of Irish immigration here . First , the Irish shift had no connection whatsoever with the movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration , because Ireland was isolated from Britain and Europe ; secondly , that while from other lands it was the custom for whole families to emigrate , out of Ireland went only individual members , leaving behind them broken social and economic units  --  an especially disastrous form of emigration  --  and , thirdly , that none of the Irish nobility came here . The nobles fled to the Continent in every case , to found there families today spread over Europe , such as the O'Donnells , of Spain ; the O'Rourkes , of Russia ; the Lallys , /vInealahons , Briands and Hennessys , of France . The peasantry flocked to America , where , on the whole , it reacted well to the new freedom , and from whose loins have sprung artists like Macdo  --  ell , McNeill Whistler and Saint-Gaudeus ; pioneer princes like Fitzpatrick , Hill , and Johnson of the Mohawks ; doctors like MacNeven , Emmet and Murphy ; financiers like Ryan , Corcoran and Mackey ; sports figures like Muldoon , Tunny and Dempsey ; dramatists like O'Neill ; architects like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Morse . An American friend of Irish descent showed great surprise when told of the stoppage of Irish immigration here , and asked what was for him a natural question : " But what will they do now ? Where will they go ? " And when told they would stay a t home mostly , he ejaculated : " Stay at home ? What ? Stay in the OldCountry ? " He evinced n. common American concept about . the Irish . The Great Dispersion There are valid racial reasons behind this Irish volte-face , and they are the more clearly seen by a glance at the reasons behind the immigration itself . Above the striking statistics of the Irish movement here looms a signal fact still more striking . It is that the Irish never came here voluntarily . They were driven here in the process of Britain 's peculiar philanthropy of trying to befriend them off the face of the earth . They became the children of the Great Dispersion , and they were lamented by their poets in sobbing ballad , rann and song as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth noting that , alone among peoples , the Irish at home to this day refer to their people in America as " exiles . " For the most important fact in their immigration here was the consequences left behind for their own land . That is the way the Irish at home felt about it and the way , to this day , they regard it ; and the most fearful word in the long vocabulary of the nation 's sorrows was " emigration , " or " the curse of exile , " which threw the country hack centuries . The impelling motive behind this shift of a people is found in the wars , famines and diseases which swept the land at periodic intervals , and in the agrarian troubles that came with the last century . In fine , the exodus of the Irish race to America was not so much a migration , which is a free act of some inly urge , as it was a movement enforced from without . It was the spectacle of a people in flight who had made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty mission movements to the Continent , the home of arts and crafts and industries , of a people owning their own soil lawfully , well instructed in their traditions and loyal to the national ideal , which went into eclipse under the brunt of long-continued aasault . The phenomenon of Irish immigration was an accident of history  --  one of the most tragic accidents in Irish history . But races of any account do not succumb to such accidents . That the American chapter of Irish immigration is now closed is a historical readjustment . The causes that brought about such a movement no longer exist . That the Irish should cease coming here was an eventuality bound to occur , not as the result of any accidental circumstance but as the necessary outcome of forces at work in the racial mentality , since any permanent solution of the problem had , naturally , to come out of the race itself . Nor is it so much of a stoppage of an age-old racial movement as it is simply a movement in another direction , the opposite direction . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or goal , toward which they aspire . Instead of westward , the Irish now are turning their eyes eastward toward their own country , the British Isles and Europe , because that is the sphere where they naturally and properly belong . For the Irish are uniquely a European people , and in such light only may they be fully understood . In that sense , the American chapter is extraneous to the main course of their history . True , they have been divorced from Europe , deliberately cut off from any contact whatsoever with the Continent and with the currents of Continental civilization . An ironical circumstance , since Ireland contributed more than any other country to Europe . In her Golden Age , from the sixth to the ninth centuries , she gave impetus to a spiritual and intellectual movement without parallel in Christian annals and laid the foundations of a new Europe , with such emissaries as Dungal , Dichuil , Scotus Eriugena , Columbanus and Columbkille ; men whose like Europe has not since seen . It was Ireland which gave to France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celtic culture , which in turn produced the miracle of Gothic culture and brought it to flower . " And in the tenth century , Ireland produced , herself , a culture immeasurably in advance of all the rest of Europe , " states Professor Porter , of Harvard , in his book , Crosses and Culture of Ireland . The fact remains that the Irish were cut off from that tradition , and from the ninth century until the present day , a thousand years , were not only severed in racial consciousness from the Europe to which , geographically , they belonged but also they were forbidden to have any traffic with Europe , save by stealth . But that is history . It is in Europe that henceforth the Irishman must play his part in working out his racial destiny , from which he has hitherto been withheld ; he has to resume where he left off a thousand years ago . He is again a conscious part of the European scene . America has passed out of the picture . The Irishman has a hard time living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is still the Irishman of legend here , likely at any moment to wave a clay pipe , shout " milia murther " and pull a shillelagh from his breeches . He is defined as romantic , reckless , sentimental , volatile , humorous , melancholy , light-hearted , cheerful , pessimistic of the future , and , on the whole , quite confident that nothing will ever succeed . There is the glamour of a certain lunacy about him . He is accused of an unserious attitude toward life ; he is regarded as the spoiled darling of nature , most truant child of all creation . He is a paradox incarnate , a hying bundle of antitheses , It was Thackoray who said that all Irishmen seemed " to belong to a Mutual Advertisement Society , they so praise one another , " while Doctor Johnson saw them as " a most fair-minded people , because they never speak well of one another , " and Viscount Morley called them " diabolical . " Of all inimical reports about . them , the Irish say that if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are forged , admitting themselves that , " We 're a mighty peculiar people , glory be to God " ? and the apostrophe must stand . But the genuine Irishman is not like any of these pictures . He is more real than the caricature that exists about him in the popular and living imagination of America . Maris he distinguished for the dishonesty sometimes attributed to him here  --  not in his homeland , where people may leave their doors open  --  and , as far as any dishonesty in matters of money , it is worth recalling that in Ireland the cardinal sin is avarice , and murder is minor beside it . Nor is he lazy ; the history of his country since the native government was established proves it . The frish  --  Arnerican Legend The Irishman of stage and of legend must , once and for all , be thrown out , and the Irishman of today deserves to be looked at with new eyesight . It is the same with his country , the Old Sod , which , too , remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed through a mist of fake sentimentality . It was not the Irish but rather the Irish-Americans born here who have drawn this picture , and when they think of Ireland , they remain heirs to the wild dreams of exile handed down by their sires and grandsires as emigris of a long-dead day . They still argue about Cromwell , Tone , Emmet and the Penal Days , setting up a lot of traditional casuistries for a country and still wishful of taking it out on England . It was the Irish-Americans who brought over to Ireland the slogan " republic , " to bruit it over the country with disastrous results , It was shouted just as a name , with the idea of separation from England behind it , and held no content whatsoever or any theory of government . These Irish-Americans still speak of sunbursts , and hope for a republic all done up in green ribbons , revealing a kindergarten attitude that is today dishearteningly anachronous and wholly out of touch with the new order of political ideation in Anglo-Irish relationships . Mr. De Valera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , today is no longer a prisoner of his past , and the " republic " madness is passing before the more important outlook of unity between North and South . The Old Sod must be thrown out too . It was really an abnormal land . War ever stresses the declama tory , external and accidental aspects of a people 's being ; and under the strident clamor of conflict , the real essence of the country was for centuries unknown . It was a land , far-strange , high , a place of hidden verities , holding aloof from the world because there was " a stranger in the house " ? symbolic Celtic idiom for the invader . The Irish came to be called the secret people , who drew the mantle of their fallen day about them ; and the national being was hidden in glen and valley , under the broken rooftree and in the quiet of hearts that would not reveal themselves before the conqueror . It was a national being older than any existing records and emerging at no recognizable date of history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legendary origins , a sort of quasi-spiritual essence no more to be reckoned or measured according to the extent of territory after which it is named than , say , the Athenian spirit . could he appraised by the boundaries of little Hellas . That national being is now revealing itself , and the blind operative forces of the race are beginning to shape themselves . With a domestic government , the essentials of freedom and concomitant peace , the real Ireland is unfolding itself . It stands for peace , first of all . Where once it rocked the very foundations of empire and stood as the wedge of disunion and discord between America and Great Britain , the new ideal is to become the cement of friendship and the link of unity and peace . That 's the new Ireland , not the Old Sod as we know it. , holding a unique place because she envies no nation , seeks no dominion over others , covets no territorial aggrandizernents . Her people , by their destiny of dispersion , today permeate the structure of society through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , the sciences , government , the services , the press and the clergy . They are what some writer has termed them , " the leaven of democracy everywhere . " The Anglo-Irish Struggle Above all , Ireland is working for rapprochement with her historic enemy , England . The hushed hate that used to beat in Irish hearts against the sister nation was not innate . The Irish animosity was not sprung from downright maleficence of race prejudice , and it was malevolent. only in so far as it resented oppression and demanded equality as the necessary condition of any true moral relationship . The English . with less cause , also held animosity toward the Irish , and it was Daniel O'Connell , the great Irish leader , who said , " it is logical that they should , and is founded in human nature , for they have injured us too much ever to forgive us . " The interracial ill-will of the past depended on a primary instinct of patriotism that has now died away . The Irishman , perhaps , cherished the emotion longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and final political reform . Nations deprived of that ideal must necessarily retain a certain animosity . The Anglo-Irish struggle endured for 700 years , the longest conflict between two peoples in European history . That it is now closing and that a new order of equilibrium seems arising is in many ways one of the most salutary and farreachingphenomeria of post war Europe . These two peoples , hitherto held to be so diametrically opposed to each other in national temperaments , are corning now to be of the common mind to stop stressing their differences because of the identical sameness of their larger interests . Indeed , the differences of peoples have been too much emphasized in the past , to the end of losing sight of the true harmony that may come from the friendly competition of opposites ; and the greatest epochs in man 's history have arisen when those . periods have even momentarily reigned . The ideal of the rew Ireland is to create a social state based on a rural civilization , and to re-create the old Celtic concept of life in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern state on the solid foundations THE SATURDAY of the past , based on the ideal of individual effort and on the restraining principle of the well-being of one 's neighbor , with a wider distribution of property and a more even share in a general prosperity . It rejects collectivism , for the Irish , with their kindred , the Scots and the Welsh , form a force in Europe diametrically opposed to Communism , and the racial instinct runs against it ; the people believe in the family and the country , in the hierarchy of human values and in the hierarchical structure of human society . Their religion , too , is a bulwark against Communism . Next to the resurgence of their homeland which is reorienting the mentality of the Irish people comes the new status of Ireland in the British Isles and in the Commonwealth of Nations . She holds a curious position , being really regarded as a dominion , but refusing to accept the term as definitive of her relationship . The Irish are yet insisting on hill and absolute co-equality with England as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . It is a family row still being waged with Britain , but this time over the council table . And their attitude for complete co-equality with England is based on the premise that Ireland , too , is a motherland and is , ipso larto , to be differentiated from such states , say , as Canada and Australia , which owe their existence to and had their being through the British Empire , while such is not the case with Ireland , which antedates the Empire . Thus they have for the time being accepted dominion status , but with such reservations as to render meaningless the usual conceptions of such status , and if they still in a manner acquiesce to the monarchial frame of the Commonwealth . they subject it to so restrictive an interpretation as virtually to render it null and void in form and substance . The emphasis of distinct nationhood dominates from the very outset the whole policy of the country , even to such matters as flying her own flag , singing her own anthem , making her own money and postage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , but profoundly significant as symbols of the tendency in national thought . And it is President Do Valera who has brought about the EVENING POST more important consequences of this attitude . Today a rigid constitutionalist , and one who has presided at League of Nations assemblies , Mr. De Valera has won many concessions of external sovereignty which are not granted the other dominions . He has secured the right that the new state be allowed to use its own great seal . Ireland , too , has the right of legation  --  the right to send and receive diplomatic representatives  --  and now has ministries in Washington , Paris , London , Berlin , the Vatican , and so on . A papal nuncio in Dublin has again founded official relations between Ireland and Rome , thus formally recognizing a unique spiritual association which , since St. Patrick , has existed in one nation of Western Europe that was cut off from the influences of the Reformation . It was the Dublin government , it is worth noting , which was primarily responsible for the passing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government 's legislating for any dominion without the latter 's consent . The statute is regarded by international jurists as the greatest document of democracy in modern British colonial history , in that it did away with the loose and general formula applicable to the political units of the Commonwealth as mere dependencies  --  an antiquated colonial idea cumbered with constitutional mysticisms which had come to be regarded as sheer anachronisms , to be removed with time . Because of the statute , the states of the Commonwealth now have a new classification and a new organic character , implying a system of international co-operation among the dominions which does not correspond to any relationship hitherto recognized in international law . Until recently , the Irish were taken up with the dilemma of staying in the Commonwealth or getting out of it . Extremists and certain subversive elements upheld the latter alternative , but the moral sanity of the people at large has won through to the viewpoint that Ireland can fulfill her destiny perhaps better within than without the Commonwealth . And Mr. De Valera 's latest statement  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed the theory of separation in the background , and all that now concerns him is unity and the fusion of the North and South . " Separation from England " was ever but a phrase , never a theory of government , though moneys time and again were sent by Irish-Americans to achieve the utopian ideal , which is not only unworkable but quite unnecessary . The Problem of Unity The major problem is that of unity . Before Dublin can become wholeheartedly reconciled with London in an external association of co-operation , the paramount issue of the Ulster problem must . be met and solved . That problem is far too complex to be vivisected within the limits of this article . The Irish have their work out out for them , in the British Isles and in the European mosaic of which the Isles have come now to form such an important part . The handicaps under which the Irish worked out their destiny in the past have now virtually ceased ; the frictions of Anglo-Irish affairs which disturbed not only Englaud and Ireland but alienated Irish expatriates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are fading . The British Isles , as motherlands and as the vital nerve center of an empire of 500,000,000 souls , ' have a most significant part to play in the world of the future ; and to that end the Irishman also is bound in the larger unity of the British people  --  using the term in a generic sense  --  which is the new and genuine unity , internal and definitive and logical , and an inspiration toward the future . As the Englishman abroad looks back with love to his motherland , so henceforth may the Irishman be able to look back to his motherland with feelings unsullied by any rancor . The ideal of the Irishman , and of the Scot and the Welshman , has ever been to have his native Land restored and to perpetuate whatever is worth while in it , and he is capable of doing it well . The ideal 's realization today brings closer the Anglo-Celtic reconciliation or synthesis , which has been the dream of leading Englishmen and Irishmen for many years . For there is being born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irishman of the future will not be an Irishman so much as he will be a Celt , and at one with his Scotch , Welsh and English brethren . A Celtic Renaissance Already we see signs of the revival of the ancient Celtic ideal with the resumption , after a lapse of centuries , of such immemorial institutions as the Welsh Eisteddfod , the Scotch Mod and the Irish Feis , or Festival : ceremonies which are similar in concept and program , and not to be regarded as isolated events of an extraneous or ephemeral nature , but as manifestations that the Celtic influence , hitherto kept in the background through historic causation , is again coming to the fore . The intellectual ammunition which the Celt has hitherto squandered in seeking to gain political justice will now be directed toward a common and constructive objective . And his fine record in the Europe of the past will find its counterpart to meet the needs of the modern time .

The circumstance calls for an entirely revised concept of the Irish people by Americans and those of other nations , who are yet little aware of the rebirth of this new race sentiment , so uniquely and ethically reasonable , constructive and peaceful . Call it metamorphosis , or what you will , but no rattle of drums sounds around the Irishman today . He takes the stage quietly , conscious of his new part to play in the world of the nations .

The Irish have fitted well into the American scene and fused easily with its people ; they have not stayed apart nor utilized any ethnic cohesion in order to retain their racial identity . Like . the Germans , they have spread from New York and other ports of entry westward over the country and their name is also written in the epics of pioneer days . It is true that they settled mostly in the cities , East , West , North and South , which has surprised racial sociologists , because the Irish are noted for being a predominantly rural and pastoral people .

R was the Irish settlement in the cities that gave rise to Irish political power . But that power today is fading , as is shown in New York , known over the world as the mightiest stronghold of the Irish in America . More fecund races in the cities have successfully challenged the Irish supremacy . But the Irish , one hopes , have contributed something besides politics , and it is a saying that no real or genuine Irishman ever enters politics . It is true that history has here set them down , in the main , as the hewers of wood and drawers of water , as the builders of the canals and railroads ; in fine , an American definition of an Irishman in the early days heresummed him up as the " tail end of a wheelbarrow . " They had no ideological values then to offer , because the race itself had at home been cut off from its own cultural fountainhead for centuries , but despite that there are latent and strong forces of idealism within the race that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are intangibles . We might remember in this connection the itinerant . Irish schoolmasters in the America of the Revolutionary period . And side by side with rural co-operation there , the other great movement in Ireland today is the cultural revival of the nation . The Irishman in America now is an American , and ho has undergone a superior development which is bringing his best instincts to the top . He has had his faults here , which expatriation magnified . But the Irishman has made , on the whole , a good citizen , and with his own unheavenly tolerance , he is never critical of the faults of others . Let . it be said for him , in these trying times , that you will never find an Irishman taking up arms for " labor " or making protests with signs and banners , and if you should . you may look to some outside alien instigator , for the Irishman is not the type to throw all his principles to the winds for a mere increase in a-ages . He holds no kindred with congenital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all time . He is a democrat . Because of his belief in democracy , the Irishman in America has always stood up for America . It is true that he backed and fought for both North and South in the Civil War , but that was because he did n't stop , as other nationals did , to argue or split hairs about the constitutional rights involved , and for the sake of argument , he agreed with both sides . The fact remains that where he cast his lot , to that side he was loyal . And his record in the World War is inspiring . In any discussion of the contribution of the Irish to America. , the fact of America 's contribution to the Irish race should not be forgotten . It has really been through the United States that the Irish people have again been brought into the main currents of history . And the Irish themselves , from their long contact with America , will all the more be able to implement democracy in Europe with American democratic ideals as a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each . The long chapter of Irish immigration is ended . And Hibernia in gratitude salutes Columbia with a fond Hail and Farewell .
