With the Olympic Games well-publicized as high-strung , hard-boiled contests of national brawn , the fact that the original Peloponnesian games brought together poets and artificers as well as wrestlers , runners and javelin hurlers is of importance chiefly to classicists . But for years that fact has been bothering a sturdy , swart Philadelphian named Samuel Stuart Fleisher . Since he and his brother Edwin retired from their prosperous family cotton yarn mills , they have collected art and musical manuscripts , busied themselves with philanthropies , gently propagated Brother Samuel 's dream of " Cultural Olympics " which every artist in the U. S. could enter . Last week Samuel Fleisher 's Olympics were simultaneously taken up by two good businessmen : President George Howard Johnson of Philadelphia 's big Lit Brothers department store , and a onetime Morgan partner , President Thomas Sovereign Gates of the University of Pennsylvania . <P> Merchant Johnson , who has helped Samuel Fleisher with a modest project to collect baskets of flowers from sleek Radnor estates to distribute in the Philadelphia slums , became interested in the Cultural Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Mr. Fleisher would get a solid organization behind him . In Philadelphia no organization is more solid than the University of Pennsylvania and the pair called on President Gates . Not averse to making news or friends during his money drive for the University 's 1940 Bicentennial , President Gates last week agreed . <P> Samuel Fleisher 's idea is that every district in the U. S. should hold careful tryouts in such arts as piano playing , trombone tooting , painting , drawing , weaving , embroidery , short story writing , ballet dancing . Winners would compete against winners for national prizes . These , Sponsors Fleisher , Johnson &; Gates decided , will not be medals or trophies but scholarships in recognized institutions . Businesslike President Gates announced that Dean John Harrison Minnick of his School of Education is at work on " details " and already hunting for a capable director . Tryouts for the first contest , in the Philadelphia area , are scheduled for spring . <P> Said Sponsor Gates : " The primary purpose of the Cultural Olympics will be first to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have latent talents in cultural pursuits . ... It is expected that the future development of the program will provide for a far greater number of competitions to be conducted over a much larger area . . . . "
