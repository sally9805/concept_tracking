Many a mewling white tenor has strutted the proscenium at Manhattan 's Metropolitan while more gifted Negro singers , by long-standing custom , were excluded . But in the field of concert singing Negroes like Roland Hayes and Paul Robeson have held their own with the best . Today 's most famous Negro singer is soft-spoken Contralto Marian Anderson , whose big , warm-blooded voice is conceded to be one of the world 's finest . Last summer at the tony Berkshire Festival near Stockbridge , Mass. , another remarkable Negro voice ! this time a soprano , threatened to claim a share of Contralto Anderson 's laurels . The voice was Dorothy Maynor 's ( TIME , Aug. 21 ) , plump , Norfolk-born daughter of a Methodist minister , who had been studying for several years with courtly Manhattan Vocal Coach John Alan Haughton . The picked audience of musicians and critics who heard her run the gamut from Wagnerian hallelujahs to coloratura tinkletones spoke of her as a native Flagstad . <P> Last week the memory of these Stockbridge bravos brought a sold-out house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town Hall . Bronze , cherub-faced Diva Dorothy soon showed that her Stockbridge judges had not been far wrong , but had been a little premature . When she was through , Manhattan 's critics huddled in the lobby , agreed that the Voice had a rough edge here &; there , prophesied a sensational future .
