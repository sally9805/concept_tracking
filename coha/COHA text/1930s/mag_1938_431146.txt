 | Art for Our Sake Condensed from Time There is no fresher news in the world of art than the mushrooming of the Community Art Centers sponsored by the Federal Art Project . Located mainly in Cities where no art museums or schools previously existed , in two years they have had an attendance of about . ti , ooo , ooo people - almost equal to t lie combined two years ' attendance ; it New York 's Metropolitan Mu-seum and Chicago 's Art Institute . The centers are designed to be permanent , for they belong not to the c Government but to the communities they serve . As they flourish and multiply , millions of adults and children who seldom saw an oil painting in their lives are seeing plenty of them , and are being taught to think differently about artists and art . Nobody asked or expected the Federal Art Project to do more than keep unemployed artists at presentable work under capable direction . I t has done more than this because it is directed by an energetic little man named Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intimately than anyone else , and who uses refined horse sense . In 1935 , to his great vexation , Cahill , eminent for arranging memorable exhibitions of American folk art , was summoned to Washington for a conference on WPA aid to artists . At the conference he observed flatly that what the government had been doing for U. S. artists in depression was " unimportant . " He was immediately asked to take the job of making it important . Director Cahill started out with the aim of breaking up the big city monopoly on Art by getting people all over the U. S. interested in art as an everyday part of living and . working . To carry out his aim he and his six Regional Directors have devoted themselves to building up community art centers . They began in the South where Cahill had observed the greatest need . They planned and planted centers from Harlem to Key Vest and then in ten western states . This year they will begin on the Midwest . In all cases the project starts by getting the community itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistants arrives in town , confers with everybody from the mayor down . When , and only when , a local committee has raised a minimum of $250o and has acquired a suitable building , the Project consents to help plan the center and recruit a staff . One important rule is that the location selected be in the business section , preferably on a ground floor . For the 5o-odd U. S. neighborhoods which have adopted the plan in the past two years , the appearance of art in the business district was un-  | precedented . Another rule is that no center may consist of merely a gallery ; it has to have studios and workshops , too . A third is that the center , once opened , shall relate its exhibitions and teaching directly to what everybody knows in the community , not to what everybody ought to know . High-hatting is taboo . The Project , by renting plain , large quarters , and in general by going easy on creature comforts , has not only saved money but has avoided arti-ness so completely that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Cahill is himself surprised at the way small towns and cities have responded . In Sioux City , Iowa , the local Plumbers ' Union , WPA carpenters , the High School manual training classes , a local fur dealer and the Junior League all labored together to give Art a fitting home In Salem , Ore. , a retired professor contributed the first y oo , and 2000 school children chipped in . In Greens boro , N. C. , the community Center was established in a defunct bank and is regarded by adjacent business men as a greater asset in the location than the bank ever was . Director Cahill started his community art centers with the conviction that an art museum or gallery should mean a great deal more to u community than a treasure house to get bored in on Sunday afternoons . And his art centers have meant more , for visitors have not stopped at view-ing the 226 traveling exhibitions which the Project has sent to the centers . More than half of them have themselves become active and eager participants in the workshops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
