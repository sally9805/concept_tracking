THIS morning the air was crisp and keen , the sky a bright hard blue . The walls outside my window glowed with the sharp impact of the winter sun . But on the front page of yesterday 's Times I had read this weather forecast : " Cloudy . To-morrow snow or rain , rising temperature . " All day I have been looking for snow or rain or perceptibly rising temperature . Also , and more tragically , a long line of the unemployed has been waiting down town for a chance to shovel away the predicted snow . But to-night the moon is out , a slightly veiled moon , and perhaps to-morrow the snow will come , and perhaps not . Millions of dollars and hundreds of men contributed the best information modern science has to offer to the composition of those seven misleading words of meteorology . I am very well aware that the weather forecasts of our government are as good as any that can be had . I do not complain at the bad guess . What constantly astonishes me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us of the difficulty of dealing with a future only twenty-four hours away ? and a future concerned with purely physical events ? we so persistently assume that much more distant social , political , and financial events can be even vaguely foreseen . Prophecy rises with every drop in the business cycle . It is a disease of malnutrition and , when we most requirecalmness of spirit , it sweeps over the earth to bedevil our days with unwarranted gloom and our nights with delusive hope . I do not need to propose any remedy for this distemper , except perhaps the operation of mob law , for one of the soundest and most persistent of man 's social instincts is the impulse to stone the prophets . We have , as a matter of fact , been doing a great deal of that in these last six months to our financial prophets , and we may be doing a great deal more of it some day to our scientific and social prophets . But it is unhappily the testimony of history that no amount of stoning ever discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds . For the future is not only a potential reality ; it is also a dream world toward which men may be stampeded for wish fulfilment , and thus misdirected away from whatever happens , at the moment , to be considered the sinful enjoyment of their immediate lives . in 1903 Mr. H. G. Wells , in a noble and excited moment , delivered a Royal Institute lecture on " The Discovery of the Future . " In that paper he proclaimed the principle that foreknowledge is the proper goal of all the sciences and demanded that an organized effort be made to put prophecy on a rational basis , and to direct human knowledge toward an inquiry into the future . In these ensuing twenty-five years this has not been done . Neither , I think , would Mr. Wells and his coadjutors ever really want it to be done ; for though that lecture was so well thought of , at the time , that it was reprinted in the proceedings of the Smithsonian Institution , and though Mr. Wells and many other imaginative or scientific or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted , with excessive liberality and in all directions , what is to be the future of man , of society , of beach clothing , or of women , hardly one of them has dealt with the relation of man to his destiny in a dispassionate way , or without the taint of special pleading for some pet science or social panacea . Clearly , the future is too valuable a property , for propagandists of every sort , not to he defended by all seekers after social effects from all seekers after truth . It is no less clear that as historic Christianity declines among intelligent men and women , they still retain , as an emotional hangover from their childhood days , its attitude toward to-morrow , its use of the next world as lever for the control of conduct in this world ; and that these vestiges are being shaped by much conscious and unconscious effort into a new religion . We are already conditioned by this dawning faith . We regard any philosophy as depressing and destructive of ambition and of a reason for living if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if it questions that human life will exist in the universe forever . Such denials seem to us repugnant and heretical . We react to them exactly as a Christian fundamentalist reacts to the scientific denial of a physical Heaven or Hell . This simple transformation from Christian to pseudoscientific thinking and feeling has behind it the same old conviction of original sin , of the vileness of living man , of the small worth of life , and of the meagerness of its possibilities , and at the far end , the same faith in some " great and notable day " as has the older theology . Turning once more to Mr. Wells as the most persistent and perhaps most representative prophet of our generation , we may see in his published sayings a perfect parallel to Hebrew eschatology . To this tune he began his gospel , about thirty years ago : " Small as our vanity and carnality make us , there has been a day of still smaller things . " " Considered as a final product I do not think much of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , man , great things are , however , some day to come : " Everything seems pointing to the belief that we are entering upon a progress that will go on with an ever widening and ever more confident stride forever . .. . All this world is heavy with the promise of greater things , and a day will come , one day in the endless succession of days , when beings who are now latent in our thoughts and hidden in our loins shall stand upon this earth as one stands upon a footstool , and shall laugh and reach out their hands amidst the stars . " Beside these sayings , so closely paralleling the poetry of Holy Writ , one must place a later dictum of Mr. Wells , delivered only last year as he stepped from an Atlantic steamer : " Civilization is like a tremendously crazy edifice , the fall of which will be far greater and more terrible than the collapse of Greece and Rome . " Now , whether or not it appeals to man 's hopes that either he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the earth as on a footstool and reach out his hands amidst the stars ; whether or not that seems any better than lolling among the houri of the Moslem paradise or playing harps on the gold-paved streets of the New Jerusalem , the fact remains that all efforts toward making the future into a religious goal , including the modern scientific effort , involve grave dangers . They may lead us to evade present-day realities for dream goals and wish fulfilments . They may prevent us from discovering just the one thing that we as reasonable , curious human beings would wish to know : what is the future likely to be ? Is it to be a succession of triumphs for a risen man , is it to be a long drawn-out tragedy of slow exhaustion , or is it to be a doom of sudden disaster ? Is man the end and final flowering of protoplasm on this spinning earth , or is man but a link in the interminable chain of advancing life , leading forward to an unimaginable goal ? Are we justified in shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , what are we justified in shaping our present lives toward ? These are problems of no mean dimension : they are the ultimate problems of human thought . It will not do to forget that the answers so far received have come mainly from Great Britain , where the average man of science is still emotionally a grandson of Queen Victoria . The answers have therefore been in the main rationalizations , as I have intimated , of nineteenth-century religious goals . The scientist , as though making a sacrifice to atone for his intellectual liberty , remains generally adolescent in his emotional life , holding it toward ancestral patterns . This is not quite so true in America as in England ; but as the American scientist sticks closer to his laboratory , while his English brother writes books and directs the current of modern thought , the effort of science to face important human problems is generally spent in an attempt to reconcile its findings with boyhood responses to the teachings of the Church . The recent ? but far from original ? efforts to reconcile the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theological belief in an immortal and interminable destiny for man , by foreseeing the human race as colonizers of this and other solar systems , offer an excellent example of this agony of adjustment which is so at war with the discovery of the truth . Winwood Reade began it in the Martyrdom of Man , that first gospel of the future-seekers , which was published in 1872 . Having dethroned Christianity , he sets up in its place a new vision of the future : " Disease will be extirpated : the causes of decay will be removed : immortality will be invented . And then , the earth being small , mankind will migrate into space , and will cross the airless Saharas which separate planet from planet and sun from sun . The earth will become a Holy Land which will be visited by pilgrims from all the quarters of the universe . Finally men will master the forces of nature ; they will become themselves architects of systems , manufacturers of worlds . Man will then be perfect . " This same sort of beautiful balderdash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out very much about future or even present possibilities until we are content to rule out of our speculations all self-deceiving desires to have tomorrow justify our momentary prejudices , or to have it take up all our slack for us , and turn itself into a heaven or a hell to threaten the opponents of prohibition , socialism , free love , birth control , natural education , or experimental biology . Brilliant as he was , Winwood Reade let the future befog his thinking , as it has done the thinking of almost every man who has allowed himself to dabble in it . In the last chapter of his remarkable book he attacked communism in these words : " If all the property of this country were divided , things would soon return to their actual condition unless some scheme could also be devised for changing human nature . . . As long as men continue unequal in patience , industry , talent , and sobriety , so long will there be rich men and poor men . " Yet five pages later , in a mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and power upon life , he seemed to have forgotten those very inequalities and frailties of human nature ; for he concluded that " Governments will be conducted with the quiet and regularity of club committees . Luxuries will be cheapened and made common to all ; none will be rich , and none poor . " This big rock candy mountain where the bars all have free lunches , is the theme song of our modern soothsayers . II The extent to which dreams of a future satisfactory to ourselves distort our prophecies can best be suggested by a comparison of some of the forecastings of the past fifty years with ensuing facts of history . A general rule appears almost at once : unimportant details , of no value as wish fulfilments , are often foreseen with startling accuracy ; but general conditions and the sort of social changes in which the propagandists are interested rarely occur as anticipated , the future refusing to oblige us by realizing our personal or sociological ambitions . Edward Bellamy 's Looking Backward , a socialistic romance of the middle eighties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermons . Bellamy set the date of this achievement fifty years ahead , thus bringing it into our own decade . But he also expected that by the time it took place , our music and sermons would have become immensely better than those of the eighteeneighties . This particular change has unhappily not occurred . Broadcasting was moreover a mere detail , aperhaps obvious aside in Looking Backward , the main theme of which was the attainment of human perfection through the establishment of a socialistic regime . Even in Soviet Russia , one must sadly admit , that does not appear to be in the offing . Not only would there be no property , there would be no lying , no more individual umbrellas , and no more making of laws . " You will find , Mr. West , as you come to know us , that there is far less interference of any sort with personal liberty nowadays than you were accustomed to , " replied Bellamy 's Doctor Leete to the awakened sleeper of 1887 . The principle that a desired change is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally mere whimsical details invented with no purpose , is perhaps most startlingly illustrated by the very many lucky guesses that no one ever took seriously , least of all the guessers themselves . When Dean Swift wrote the Voyage to Legato and Lagodo , it was rather as a climax of absurdity that he made the Laputan astronomers claim that the planet Mars has two satellites , thus antedating a discovery of modern science by about three hundred years . In that forward-looking year of depression , 1894 , John Jacob Astor wrote his forgotten Journey in Other Worlds and told much casual truth about our own day , about our motor cars , our national highways , and our enormous liners , and in particular about the transneptunian planet whose position does not conform to Bode 's law . Daniel Defoe anticipated the discoveries of Speke and Burton by his casual description of the great interior lake of Africa in his pirate story Captain Singleton ; Morgan Robertson , one of our keenest fictional prophets , named a great steamship the Titan and sent it to its doom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before the wreck of the Titanic took the front page of every newspaper in the world . Jules Verne has a high reputation as an anticipator , perhaps from the very fact that he wrote little about the future . But he is an excellent example of the fact that prophecy without motive is the only sort of prophecy which has any chance of success . His first book was called Five Weeks in a Balloon . It was a romance of adventure , in a dirigible voyaging over Africa . Published in the early seventies , that story preceded the experiments of Herr Zeppelin by at least one generation . But even as late as 1893 M. Verne was saying things like this , " I may say that at the time I wrote that novel , as now , I had no faith in the possibility of ever steering balloons except in an absolutely stagnant atmosphere . How can a balloon be made to face currents running six , seven , or eight meters to the second ? It is a mere dream . " Naturally it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come true ; for the real future is almost always pure fantasy . " Here lies one whose name was writ in water " was the epitaph which John Keats wished graven on his tombstone . It is not necessary to list the innumerable artists and writers , now quite forgotten , for whom a place among the immortals was considered secure , or of the true immortals for whom nobody prophesied any future . Let but the chorus of reviewers agree that any book is destined to a long fame , and it is the testimony of history that we had better make a note of the fact inside the cover to prevent our grandchildren from casting the precious thing into the trash barrel . But the folly of literary and artistic forecasting is a sorry theme that too much chastens human pride . Nor can one refer to the sore wounds sustained by the economic prophets without a shudder at the persistence of a vast illusion . " A depression at this time is impossible , " said the distinguished financial adviser of one of the world 's greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not with the smile of a lost faith , for we are now listening with rapt attention to equally positive predictions that a recovery at this time is impossible . If we could only realize it , those gloomy forebodings are omens of a happier day , the logical future being the very last event that we should ever hope for or fear . We read much today of the collapse of a great European nation in such terms as these : " She is stripped of her armaments , her artillery , her muskets , her swords . That she may not be in an immediate position to supply their place she is loaded with a pecuniary indemnity which must exhaust the energies of another generation . She is not likely to recover her physical strength in our day , and when vigor returns to her shattered frame it will be only to feel she has lost her place in the councils of Europe . " But this prediction , from the British Quarterly Review of 1871 , foretells the destiny of the France of our own day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , however , rather to science than to politics , literature , or finance that one turns with confidence for a true word about the days to come , particularly when science accepts the challenge and speaks out plain . In 1903 Simon Newcomb , who besides being a precise investigator of the speed of light and America 's most distinguished mathematical astronomer , was also a man of vivid and romantic imagination , wrote an article on " The Future of Flying . " This is what he said : " The example of the bird does not prove that man can fly . The hundred and fifty pounds of dead weight which the manager of the machine must add to it may well prove an insurmountable obstacle to success . " When Newcomb wrote this article the recent discovery of radium was pointing with the usual deluding gesture to what were apparently new sources of power , and he added , " Quite likely the twentieth century is destined to see the natural forces which will enable us to fly . . . but when we inquire whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge the outlook may be altogether different . A fundamental difficulty which the writer feels may prove insurmountable is based on a law of nature which we are bound to accept . " ( This law was that the supporting surface of a plane increases only as the square of its dimension , while the weight increases as the cube . ) There is no better example of the impotence of logical deduction when applied to the human events of tomorrow than this scientific dictum . Seven weeks after that paper was published , Orville Wright flew two hundred and sixty yards in an airplane powered by a gasoline motor . Within two years the Wrights made a non-stop flight of twenty-four miles . The upward limit to the gross lift which is now considered profitable for a heavier-than-air machine is estimated as being about sixty tons . Another mere dream come true . But it is not only the mere dreams which persistently come true , but the dead certainties which persistently do not come true , that confuse the spirit of prophecy . When the English military expert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next European war " will be facilitated by the perfection to which concentrated food for men and compressed food for horses has been carried , " and when he said that " nailless horseshoes will remove one cause of delay " in the struggle for mastery of the railroads , doubtless he would have regarded it asa mere whimsy if someone had informed him that in the next European war the spurs of cavalry officers would be resting under the rolltop desk . " No cities , " said an earlier and more imaginative English military writer , " could be defended against a machine showering dynamite shells . Armies might be destroyed in a few minutes and all fortresses must be subterranean structures . " For nearly four years Paris was subjected to such an attack . Yet Paris shows no notable scars . What is this obstinacy in events ? " We live , " wrote J. W. Cross , " with the daily prospect of a great European war constantly before us . " It is true that nine or ten thousand days after his statement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur when it was a daily prospect . Just how far it was from being imminent when it actually did arrive may be suggested by the fact that Mr. Wells , who generally has his ear close to the ground about things shortly to befall , published The World Set Free in 1914 and in that work predicted that the great European war would begin in 1956 , after fifty years of unbroken peace . III Why is the future so stubborn ? To answer that fully would take us rather far . For thousands of years the fact has been recognized by reason and persistently disregarded by emotion . Cassandra personified for the keen Greek intelligence this quirk in the character of reality . " You look mistrustful . I am used to that " is her preface to her last true prediction . In that same Greek world of unexampled sanity it was only the mad pythoness of the Delphic shrine whose word about the future found any acceptance . And even to-day , bad times are the harvest season for crystal gazers and astrologers . What determinists will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all economic , social , and biological forecasters , is the fact that the direction of human events can be analyzed only when facing toward the past , only a posteriori . That this is true is due to the nature of time itself . Actually , human events are only a special case of the fact that growing older involves the transformation of energy into less and less available and less and less concentrated forms . For the universe , as for man , growing older is a diffusion of energies . A ray of light may travel for a million years from a star and at last impinge on my upturned face . We can know a great deal about its past before that meeting , but very little about the future of its scattered energy . Having touched my face , it enters a region of complexity that is beyond human calculation , now or ever . We can predict eclipses , for the movement of planets around the sun is a very simple and slowly changing form of death . Any human event is a very complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of what happens after any human event is not foreknowable . A man named John Jones lives . Knowing even so little as that , we can say more of the past than of the future of John Jones . He had two parents and at least two grandparents , he was born , he has eaten food . Of his future , however , the only thing we can predict is that he will die . The nature of time does not allow of as much certainty about his future as about his past . If instead of a single John Jones , we choose a million or a hundred million of his kind , it is equally significant that the most reliable statement which statistical science can offer about their future is contained in the mortality tables . Doctor Malthus very wisely recognized , long ago , that to-morrow 's birth rates are indeterminable ; but at this moment when so many great business enterprises are on the rocks fromincorrectly predicting future growth , life insurance is still solvent on account of its high relative accuracy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a light on to-day , but in the penumbra of its shadow unpredictable things are bound to happen . If in addition to this difficulty we add any desire to mold the future , we are naturally hopelessly lost . It is not merely that no propagandist possesses what Erasmus called " an adequate idea of the difficulty of transforming , as it were , a man into a god . " It is also the not so obvious fact that prepossession with any particular human occupation almost equally deforms our view of the future , and our notion of the future man . An architect predicts that " the architects of to-morrow will not copy . " But why not ? Will they not also be men , and have men ever ceased to copy ? " The principal characteristics of the architecture of to-morrow will be , first of all , simplicity , originality , and personality , " said Hector Maillot in 1893 . But of what to-morrow ? If men are men there will of course be some to-morrow of simple and original building , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decadent , and rococo architecture . Prophets insist upon looking for the one " great and notable day " which will last forever ; but every sun also sets . The psychologist , who should of all men know better , predicts , as Dr. Herbert Nichols of Harvard did forty years ago , that " The new science of psychology will determine the mental laws exactly , the laws of aesthetics , of ethics , of every human activity . It will compel men to live by those laws , because it will make them plain to all men . We shall have a higher manhood because its type will be clear to us . We shall have a new art and a new literature because we shall know the secrets of beauty . " Such scientific millennialism , like that of Winwood Reade , is definitely religious . The word compel is significant of the fact that it is also dangerously religious , paving the way for such attempts to change human nature by compulsion as the adoption of our prohibition amendment . " The certainty of peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , " will engender , before half a century , a corruption and decadence more destructive to man than the most horrible wars . " Some of us to-day would be glad to take a chance on such a decadence if it would buy us that certainty of peace . " By the twentieth century there will be neither dogmas nor frontiers . " That was said by a man who knew human nature very well in his own time , but not even the great Victor Hugo could foresee any truth about the human nature of his to-morrow , for to-morrow was to him a region where dreams come true . We are his to-morrow and his religion . We live in his paradise . It is a salutary thought . Just as perfectionism corrupts the prophecies of social change , so too progressivism , or the doctrine of straight line advances , creeps generally into the thinking of all forecasters of the future environment . An extreme example of such reasoning can be seen in Alfred Korzybski 's Manhood of Humanity , which calculated that human success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , by the way , predicted an economic and social millennium when we should have attained the communal intelligence to put a great engineer at the head of our government ) . The theory that whatever we do well to-day we shall do better to-morrow is invalidated , of course , by the history of human activity in almost every direction . It does not , to be sure , appear to be invalidated by the history of science , where we happen at the moment to be making great strides which we naturally assume will go on forever ; but even when we consider applied science , we are badly in danger of forgetting the fact that in many important directions the velocity of progress has already so sharply diminished that the achievements we proudly boast of to ourselves as our own contributions are in reality the contributions of our grandfathers . In 1893 a distinguished engineer indulged in a prophecy which illustrates this particular fallacy , that man moves along straight lines toward an increasing mastery over nature . " Progress has been an acceleration , " said Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is no indication that this steadily increasing movement has reached its culminating point . The steamship of to-day 1893 crosses the Atlantic in a little more than five days , one-half the time taken in 1850 . The locomotive hauls fast trains from New York to Chicago in twenty hours . Similar gradual and steady gains , reducing the schedule time to one-half these figures will not surprise the people of the coming generation . " Certainly we are very hard to surprise , but the fact is that this change simply has not occurred to surprise us . It is true that in a Zeppelin , at great expense , a few persons have crossed the Atlantic in less time than five or even four days , and that a few others , at prohibitive risk of life , have done so in airplanes ; but the early days of the twentieth century have come and gone , and many of us still prefer the ten-day boats of 1850 , while the rest are quite satisfied by a passage in what is still the exceptionally fast five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good time to Chicago . Nothing is more certain than that this condition would have been incredible to the forward-looking men of 1893 . " Every improvement in war , " said the London Spectator just fifty years ago , " has diminished actual slaughter , till a modern field of Chalons holds ten thousand bodies instead of three hundred thousand , and the comparative shortness of campaigns is the greatest of the few mitigations of war as yet discovered . " That would have made good reading for England in 1917 . To straight-line thinking , the future is always fantastic for the simple reason that the inevitable never happens . And that the inevitable never happens is due to the fact that inevitability rests on the assumption that in human affairs what is going on will keep " going on forever , " as Mr. Wells phrases the notion ; but except for a few little animal essentials like hunger , love , jealousy , hope , and fear , nothing is more certain than that whatever is now going on in human affairs will not keep going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human to physical action is extremely imperfect , and hope and fear are as poor guides as the logic of continuity . So that if there were no better clues available , one might have at least a fair chance at guessing the next few stages of the future , by selecting from all possible events the ones least likely ever to happen , and from all possible conditions of society the ones least pleasing to contemporary man . If we did this we should have a chance ? perhaps wildly small , but at least finite of hitting the exact truth . If we predict a future to fit our present desires we have no such chance . This is no mere paradox . Wish fulfilments never come true in the future in the desired way , for the reason that man is essentially an animal in revolt against the past . Such a phenomenon as the long continuance of Christian practice and tradition may seem at once to invalidate this assumption , but the difficulty is not real . For though , even at his highest moments , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it his business to cheat the past by reinterpreting in a new and hostile way all of its formulw which he dares not forsake . There have of course been slavish centuries when men were as little alive as possible ; such centuries are always enchained to a static religious future or to an overpowering past , the enchainment being made possible by an unstimulating climate . But even in such times there are the seeds and sprontings of rebellion . Our present stirrings against prohibition are examples of a resentment against the past , just as prohibition was itself a revolt against the past . Its folly was that it attempted to give eternal validity to the majority opinion of one year . Naturally the future revolted in whatever way it could . For two thousand years Christianity has been a frame within which have occurred thousands of revolts against its own past . Any rich modern church or cathedral is ample evidence of how violently Christianity has reacted against the Carpenter of Galilee and his simple rules of conduct and patient humilities , and the lords of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their chariots . The past has lip service , but no man and no nation attains maturity without a reaction from as much of yesterday as can safely be defied , so that the very effort toward molding the future or toward dreaming the future to the form of our fears or desires , is the effective agent that prevents the future from ever becoming what we wish it to be . Future worship is , therefore , the very worst religion ever devised by man , and our present financial and international dilemmas are among the mildest of the consequences that may arise from the world 's mad wish to control tomorrow These dilemmas are caused by our present confused thinking about both money and war , which in turn is due to our reluctance in abandoning future worship for a more rational attitude toward life . Wars are bred by the conflict of rival dreams of to-morrow . Nearly twenty years after the outbreak of our last great war , we find the thought of the world still troubled in its attempt to discover what that war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe were going peacefully enough and apparently happily enough about their business . Certainly they have never been so happy since . But brooding in the minds of men were diverse visions of to-morrow , and it is those visions which realized themselves in the nightmare of battle . The missing factor is in the dimension of time . The goal of war is the control of the enemy 's to-morrow . In cruder days this was accomplished by rape and captivity . In the twentieth century it was accomplished , or attempted , by the imposition of crushing indemnities . We need not deceive ourselves that a victorious Germany would not have made the same attempt , but the attempt fails for the simple reason that the future of a democracy can not be controlled . The future can be controlled only in a nation ruled by a succession of dictators or tzars . Our present world is consequently developing hysterical symptoms from its discovery , not yet completely made , that to-morrow can not be enslaved , that men will , sooner or later , have to face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own pockets , and that the debts of a great business or of a great war can not be shifted onto the shoulders of their grandchildren , who may not approve of them or their doings at all . The chief lesson of modern prophecy is , therefore , that the future is its own concern , and that long-term planning is the greatest indulgence of egotism man ever engaged in and the most dangerous . Its assumption that we are so much wiser than our sans , who will be so much better than we are , is a logical absurdity . The old Wall Street axiom that the unexpected always happens needs a slight modification . That the unexpected has to happen comes much nearer to the truth in human affairs . The chief danger to mankind from the activities of forward-looking people is consequently , not so much that they lead men from their present possibilities into a pursuit of dream goals , but that they may sometimes be right in their ideas of what would be good for tomorrow , and by working for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea , for instance , that there should be no emptied pay envelopes or black eyes and bloody noses on Saturday night . That condition was slowly coming about . But when forward-looking men and women set to work to ensure it they revived drinking and gave it a glamour it had not enjoyed for generations . For , very properly , the future is , to us who live , always a world of disobedient children . So President Wilson , by engaging his years in a war to prevent war , has made war the main consideration of our years . If 1914-18 had ended in a stalemate of exhaustion , as it seemed about to do , there would have been few indemnities and no repartitionings , and I venture to say a general disgust with the results of battle that could have lasted for a very long time . Our weight cast into to-morrow ensured a decisive victory , and by that victory destroyed the very hope that it was designed to ensure .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
