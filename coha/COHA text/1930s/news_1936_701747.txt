txt House and Senate Bills , Both Based on Soil Conservation , Promise Many Benefits to Agriculturists 36-7M-r.T7C alirr WASHINGTON , Feb. 22 . ? Incredible as it may seem in view of the recent Supreme Court decision invalidating the AAA , the next fortnight will witness the beginning of the most ambitious plan of agricultural adjustment ever attempted on the American Continent . Admitted by its bitterest opponents to be immune from constitutional attack because it contains no tax provisions , the new program , based on the government 's right to pay farmers for conserving their soil , will go even further in the direction of crop adjustments than did the old AAA . Both branches of Congress have now approved the enabling legislation and , although some differences in the measures passed by each body remain to be ironed out , the objectives in both measures are the same and the methods of reaching them largely identical . Both houses are agreed that the government should make it financially possible for farmers to cultivate their lands a little less intensively to the end that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one generation to another . Cash Inducements . To do this the framers of the legislation have had to skate pretty close to the constitutional lines laid down in the Hoosac Mills case . Instead of permitting the Secretary of Agriculture , as under the old AAA , to enter binding contracts with farmers not to produce or plant above specified limits in return for cash rewards , the new plan is to I FARM LEGISLATOR Associated Press . Senator Mineola D. Smith . offer cash inducements on a voluntary basis to all farmers inclined to cultivate constructively to build up the soil . Where the invalidated AAA programs required acreage control with a view to reduced production , with soil conservation incidental , the new approach will make the primary goal the conserving of soil and prevention of erosion , with acreage and production adjustment incidental . In its far-reaching . AAA decision , the Supreme Court said in substance that regulation of agricultural production wa , is a matter beyond the province of the Federal Government and one reserved to the States . The new legislation , passed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as soon as practicable the separate States are to have exclusive jurisdiction . An Interim Expedient . But , until that time arrives , not later than January , 1938 , the Federal Government would be empowered to make cash rewards to producers who engage in soil conserving practices by shifting part of their acres from intensive cultivation of cash crops to grasses , legumes and pasturage . The conditions under which payments may be made are liberally defined in the legislation . The following are made the primary objectives of the new pro-gram : Preservation and improvement of soil fertility . Promotion of economic use of land . Diminution of exploitation and unprofitable use of national soil resources . Provision for and maintenance of a - continuous and stable supply of farm commodities adequate to meet domestic and foreign consumer requirements at prices fair to both producers and consumers thereof . Re-establishment and maintenance of farmers ' purchasing power . Much more discretionary than the old AAA provisions are these criteria , upon the basis of which the Secretary of Agriculture may pay farmers cash according to the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary is empowered to make payments of whatever amount he thinks appropriate , so long as the aggregate of expenditures does not exceed the practicalaimit of $500,000,000 a year . Pre-War Parity Is Sought . Although at this writing the question remains to be settled as between the House and Senate versions of the bill , it is- quite likely that , as finally enacted , the measure will contain a direct mandate to the Secretary to restore as rapidly as practicable the pre-war purchasing power parity between agricultural and non-agricultural " net incomes . " A broader mandate than this would be difficult to contrive . In . point of discretionary authority and actual objectives , the new mandate goes far beyond that of the old AAA with respect to farm income . The mandate in AAA was for the restoration of the pre-war parity or exchange value of farm prices , expressed in terms of commodities called basic under the original act . The difference between the old and the new income goals is about 20 per cent , according to official AAA calculations , To illustrate : Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit payments under the 1935 AAA. adjustment programs and $2,416,000,000 of production costs to arrive at net farm income , we get $5,214,000,000 . To increase the net income of 1935 to the pre-war level or that prevailing on the average from 1909 through 1914 , an additional $1,670,000,000 would have to be added . This would indicate that an increase of 32 per cent over the net farm income for 1935 would be in order under the new income objective . Other factors , however , enter into the picture . Changes ' in the costs of things the farmers buy and declines in the net income position of industrial workers together with improvement in net farm incomes as a result of actual or contemplated benefit payments have to be considered . Purchasing Power Ratios , Giving , due weight to all factors entering into the determination of what the dollars and cents objective will be under the new program , it is to be remembered that non-farm purchasing power in 1935 rose to 93 per cent of its pre-war level , while the agricultural equivalent had reached 76 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $480,000,000 included , a total of 83 per cent . The ratio of the latter figure to pre-war farm net income , taken as 100 , would indicate a required increase under the new income goal of about 22 per cent , or about $1 , - 150,000,000 more than farmers received last year . It is difficult to forecast at this juncture what will be the effect of the soil conservation program on the extent of planted acreage , except that in the aggregate it will not be greatly different from actual results under the AAA adjustments . This means that between 30,000,000 and 35,000,000 acres of farm land will be switched to soil-building and erosion-preventing crops . In Northeastern United States the effect of the new conservation program probably will be to stabilize production of various crops at pressent levels . For the Corn Belt it is contemplated to shift from corn to hay and pastures , accompanied by a decrease in the number of hogs maintained and substantial increase in dairy cow totals and milk production . In the South the chief objective is a decrease in cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal , but with substantial net increase of the area of crop lands , pastures and production of all Southern feed crops except corn . Wheat Area Prospects . In the wheat section the program would call for less acreage planted to that staple and more to sorghums , both as a crop rotator and as a livestock feed base . Under both the temporary and permanent State-aid programs it is contemplated that the Federal Government shall provide the directing force . After 1938 , or at as early a date a .. Facticable , the States are required to pram legislation authea izing the acceptance of allotmerte from the annual fund of $500,000,000. 000 , But after enactment of such authorizing legislation and the designation of a State agency , probably its land grant college , the State Government is to have little if anything to do with the carrying out of the program . Thenceforth , the execution of plans is to be divided between the Adjustment Administration in Washington , the State agency designated and local control committees , that latter having been first set up under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
