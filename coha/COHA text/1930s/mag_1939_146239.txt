Since 1920 , with a nudge or two from its bankers , J. P. Morgan &; Co. , and the friendly encouragement of well-wishers like American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. and ex-King Alfonso of Spain , International Telephone &; Telegraph Co. has installed nearly 1,000,000 telephones in ten countries . Assets on its books tot up to $537,000,000 and once in 1929 its common stock sold for $149.25 a share , 49 times earnings . Last week it sold for $6.75 a share , six times 1938 earnings , and in his annual report I. T. &; T. 's amiable President Sosthenes Behn described the hardships of international capitalism . <P> In 1937 I. T. &; T. netted $10,236,000 . Last year , although its gross business rose some $4,000,000 , its net fell to $7,039,000 . Reason : I. T. &; T. took a $3,561,479 loss on foreign exchange , for many good sound I. T. &; T. earnings in foreign currency turned out to be pin money when translated into dollars . <P> I. T. &; T. has $67,000,000 , about one-eighth of its assets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,600,000 . But for the last two years President Behn has had to leave Spain out of his income account . Last week , he laconically reported : " The extent of damage to the properties has not yet been ascertained , but reports received indicate that a high percentage of the 346,000 telephones in service at the beginning of the civil war still remain in service . " <P> Though I. T. &; T. 's Madrid headquarters was a favorite target for two years of bombardment , this is not an unlikely estimate . In any war , army engineers have good reason for taking care of the telephone system , and once hostilities are over , business can quickly revive . Last week , Mr. Behn pointed out that I. T. &; T. has not only recovered its net loss of 10,525 telephones during the fighting at Shanghai in 1937 , but gained 7,335 more .
