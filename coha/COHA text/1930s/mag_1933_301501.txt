No football crowd in the land could have been cheerier than the throng of farmers , bundled in sheepskins and mackinaws , who converged one morning last week in 15,000 automobiles on Farmer Ben Stalp 's place near West Point , Neb. to see the National Cornhusking Championship . They cheered and stomped lustily as , with pheasants whirring up out of the sere corn rows and the yellow ears whacking against the bangboards , Husker Sherman Henriksen of Lancaster County , Nebraska , beat 16 competitors , including the champions of Illinois , Indiana and Minnesota , with a net load of 27.62 bushels in the allotted 30 minutes . <P> A grim , menacing contrast was another , smaller crowd of farmers 25 mi. away at Thurston , Neb . Pickets of the Farm Holiday Association , they burned a railroad bridge on the line into Sioux City . Other picketers burned a bridge over near Portsmouth , Iowa . Elsewhere in Iowa and in Wisconsin and Minnesota there was violence last week . But it was fitful , sporadic violence . Milo Reno 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as he had urged . Checks from the Agriculture Adjustment Administration were descending on the land in a gentle , pervasive rain , damping the prairie fire of farmers ' anger . Hers and there law-abiding , patient farmers organized vigilance corps to deal with agitators. *The Corn Belt was quiet as into it came General Hugh Samuel Johnson to speak for the President . <P> 78 Seats . Not just to praise his NRA but also to explain his colleague George Peek 's collateral AAA and to hold the farm vote for next autumn 's Congressional elections , came General Johnson . Colorado , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Michigan , Minnesota , Missouri , Nebraska and South Dakota control 107 seats in the House of Representatives , 78 of which are now Democratic . Loss of many of these seats to the Republicans might deeply cut the Democratic house majority of 183 , seriously hamper President Roosevelt 's program . <P> Minneapolis . Fifteen thousand people swarmed into the Minneapolis Auditorium to hear General Johnson warm up by denouncing " chiselers " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugged individualists who want to continue to live in the dark ages of human relationships . . . . I 'm not going to let them fool the American people . . . . Racketeering is a harsh word . We do not mind it when applied to Al Capone , but these gentlemen do not like to hear it applied to what a Senate committee has disclosed about certain great New York fiduciaries . Why . the truth is , in the light of these developments , that Al Capone was a poor ignorant Sicilian piker.
