Werner of Los Angeles . <P> Practical politics in Los Angeles have produced no more colorful figure than plump , blonde Mrs. Helen ( ' ' Queen Helen " ) Werner , who was an apple-cheeked Tennessee mountain girl when she went West to make good . She has lived in Los Angeles since 1920 when she married Erwin P. ( " Pete " ) Werner , an indifferently successful lawyer , who she determined would someday be Governor .

On another occasion she courted future votes by inviting members of a victorious University of Southern California football team to Magnolia Farm and treating them to a seven-course dinner that began with nine rounds of cocktails and included all the champagne the happy athletes would drink . Soon Queen Helen seemed to have made herself more important in her unofficial position than many an elected officer . <P> She slipped from her lofty position for the first time in 1934 when Federal prosecutors preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt had been made to bribe other Federal officials in the interest of the defendants . Their investigation resulted in indictments against Queen Helen , Justice Gavin Craig of the District Court of Appeals and a minor politician named Joseph Weinblatt .
