FANTASIA FOR TRUMPETS A STORY BY A. H. Z. CARR A A result of the cook 's excitement and the chauffeur 's , that morning Mr. Miller almost missed his train , and he was slightly out of breath as he entered the club car It occurred to him that he had not seen so many carefully read newspapers in evidence since the stock market crash of 1929 ; and he sensed something of the same tension that had pervaded the car in those unforgettable days . Nodding right and left to acquaintances , he walked down the aisle to his accustomed seat at the end , reserved for him by the obsequious porter . For in the social hierarchy of the suburban express Mr. Miller was one of the elect ; he was the Miller of Miller Publications , and his income was a hundred thousand dollars a year . But his appearance and manner would have done credit to a million , for he looked distinguished and had no obvious pose . He greeted the stout man who sat next to him and the tall man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he accorded to equals in position , and immediately plunged into conversation . " Well , " he said with a mirthless smile , indicating the great black headlines of their newspapers , " the lid 's off with a vengeance . " The tall man across the aisle , a stockbroker named Nelson , said , " I was just telling Armbruster what I heard General McCabe say at the club last night . He said the best military opinion was that it would last at least three years . " " If it does , " remarked the stout Armbruster gloomily  --  he was a corporation lawyer ? " there wo n't be much left . " " So damned sudden , " said Miller , looking at the headlines again . " After they got by all those crises last year I never thought a little thing like this would set them off . Virtually overnight . " There was a short pause , then Armbruster said , " Too bad , the news about Paris . " " This time next month , " Mr. Miller responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same condition . My wife wanted to go over this year too . " Nelson made an irritable gesture . " We had enough troubles on our hands without this . The question I 'm asking myself is ' What now ? ' " " I look at it this way , " said Armbruster with professional sonority . " We did our best to prevent this war . Whatever we may think of the President in other respects , he certainly tried to keep these fellows at peace . Now there 's only one course for us to follow  --  strict neutrality . " " I agree with you in principle , " said Miller . " But it depends what you mean by neutrality . " " I mean , " answered Armbruster , " do nothing that can draw us into it . Let 's not make the same mistakes we made last time . Refuse to lend money or grant credits to any belligerent . " Mr. Miller shook his head . " If we do n't grant credits  --  and that means not selling goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Right , " agreed Nelson warmly . " We owe it to ourselves not to let this war ruin business . We did n't make it . Why should we suffer ? " " We ca n't stand by and let England be smashed , " Mr. Miller took up the argument , " merely because technically she owes us the old war debt . Especially when our own welfare is at stake . Take it from me , if we refuse to sell to belligerems , dividends and stock prices will be cut in half within a year . Neutrality is our policy , but let it be a common-sense neutrality . " " That 's a good phrase , " said Nelson approvingly . " A common-sense neutral-ity . " " That 's the kind of neutrality we tried in the last war , " Armbruster retorted with a skeptical laugh . Mr. Miller replied energetically , " If it comes to that ? " and stopped short . He was going to say that it would be better for the country to go to war than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism might have a harsh sound ; so instead he concluded innocuously , " Neutrality is a flimsy thing at best . " As Mr. Miller seated himself at the large antique desk in his dignified , oak-panelled office his secretary , Miss Macklin , a tall , poised , fair girl , entered the room and said , " Mr. Launay asked to see you as soon as you got in . " " I 'll see him , " said Mr. Miller . He observed that Miss 1VIacklin 's attractive face was white and drawn , but he said nothing . She went away , and after some minutes Charles Launay came in . Mr. Miller liked Launay , who was the editor of News of Tomorrow , one of his less profitable , but yet profitable magazines . Launay was a young , intense man , able , hard-working , esteemed by clients ; a valuable asset and a pleasant person . He took a chair and came to the point at once . " I 'm afraid you 'll have to get yourself a new editor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're joking , " said Mr. Miller , turning sharply to look at him . " What 's wrong ? Got another offer ? " " No , " Launay replied . His dark face became serious . " The fact is , I 'm leaving for France . In ten days . " " But man alivel " cried Mr. Miller , genuinely startled . " Why ? You going to fight ? " Launay nodded . " I 'm sorry to leave on such short notice but I 'm afraid it ca n't be helped . Andrews or Peddle can carry on my work , " he went on , evidently anxious to avoid remonstrances , " until you get somebody else . Personally , I 'd give the preference to Andrews . In fact , I think he could handle the job permanently . He 's ? " Mr. Miller brushed this aspect of the matter aside . " I ca n't understand you , " he said frowning . " If you were a communist or if you were a boy looking for adventure  --  but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in a war that does n't concern you ? I know you 're of French descent , but after all , you 're an American . " " Yes , " said Launay . " Do n't imagine that I 'm carried away by any sentimental notions about la patrie . And I do n't fancy myself as a hero . But I feel that I ca n't watch the things I believe in get smashed up while I sit back and maintain my standard of living . I came to the conclusion a while back that if war broke out I 'd go over . " " Charles , " said Mr. Miller with a touch of disgust , " I thought you had more sense . You sound like every sucker who went over in the Iast war to make the world safe for democracy . " " And were they so very wrong ? " asked Launay with mounting animation . " I know it 's the fashion to be cynical about motives in war . I 'll grant you that colonies , raw materials , trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life . But behind all that , in this war at any rate , there is actually a struggle of political ideals . Well , I intend to fight for the ideal I believe in . " " And what 's that ? " Mr. Miller 's tone was satirical . " For a little freedom of thought at least , against no freedom of thought whatever , " Launay replied vigorously . " For what 's left of the democratic tra-dition . " Mr. Miller prided himself on his understanding of his fellow-men . Now , with some surprise , he realized that he had not hitherto really understood Launay . A slight unconventionality of manner and expression in the young man he had set down to the artistic temperament ; Lau-nay painted for his own amusement . Mr. Miller had not even minded a hint of political radicalism in Launay 's views , for he knew that while a man practiced the precepts of the right , it was unimportant that he gave lip service to the precepts of the left . The past . few minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been harboring an " unsafe " man in his business family  --  that is , a man capable of sacrificing immediate material interests to an abstract philosophic conviction . He was disturbed and disappointed , on Launay 's account and on his own . With a slight shrug he adjusted himself to the facts . Launay 's mind was made up ; it was useless to try to dissuade him . With the reflection " too bad , " his personal interest in Launay dwindled away and his mind turned to the practical problem of replacing him . Launay preferred Andrews . Not a bad idea if Andrews could really handle the job ; as a matter of fact , there would be a saving in salary . Being a tactful and courteous man , however , Mr. Miller talked with Launay for a while longer about the war , with every evidence of attention . When Launay left Mr. Miller he went directly to Miss Macklin 's office . She was sitting at her typewriter , working mechanically . When the door closed behind him , she rose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded . She walked to the window , where she stood looking out , herback to him . She said , " I think I 'd be happier , Charles , if you told me the truth . Do n't be afraid of hurting me . " He reflected , and then said , " You want me to say I 'm tired of you . Is that it ? " She turned and looked at him , her face calmer than her spirit . " I 've thought it out . You could n't go away like this if you still loved me . " " My dear , " he said quietly , " how can I make you see it ? I could n't love you any more than I do . Perhaps it is n't enough ; I do n't know . But it 's all the love I 'm capable of , enough to make me want to live all my life with you if I could . " She put her hand to her breast , as if she were holding his words close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally she said , " Then I do n't understand . How can you sacrifice yourself , and me , like this ? What you said last night seems so flimsy now , Charles . I ca n't accept it . " He nodded and took her hands in his . " I know how you must feel . Suppose I had put it in other terms  --  my relatives in France , my brother , who was killed in ' 17 , Paris in ruins . Would you consider those valid reasons ? " She did not answer . He went on , " Well , they 're not . I would n't sacrifice what we 've got to any other personal tie or attachment in the world . This is a bigger thing with me than a matter of sentiment . You 've got to see it , Anne . This war is going to change people 's lives , everybody 's life , in America and everywhere else , even more than the last one . Whether we fight or not we 're in for it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell myself I was neutral . I 'm not neutral . I 've an obligation to get in this thing , to fight for the kind of world I want . You 've got to see it . " After a moment , " I 'll try to see it , " she said . He caught her to him , and she pressed her face against the rough cloth of his coat . Suddenly she whispered so passionately that he almost felt she had screamed , " Oh , God , I hate wail " Presenting a normal manner to the world , Miss Macklin carried on her work until lunchtime . She was about to go out for a solitary sandwich when she was stopped at her office door by Mr. Peddie . Mr. Peddie was a tall , thin man with graying hair and a lean , furrowed , sardonic face ; he limped slightly . He said , " Hello , Anne , if you have n't a date for lunch , how about having it with me ? " She agreed out of politeness , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant nearby , where he began to talk about the war . " I heard this morning that Charlie 's leaving for France , " he said , taking for granted her proprietary interest in Lau-nay . " I was sorry to hear it . I think he 's making a big mistake . " She put down an impulse to ask him not to call Charles , " Charlie . " Feeling constrained to reply , she said , " He 's made up his mind , I believe . " She felt no pain in talking about Launay now ; she felt nothing . Peddle snorted . " I know from experience the mistake he 's making . You go over thinking you 'll be a hero , but when you get there you find heroes are n't wanted  --  only dumb clucks who do as they 're told . So you live in muck , shooting and getting shot at , and you come out like me  --  if you come out at all . " He tapped his leg and began to talk in an angry voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What good does it do anybody to play the hero while guys back home cop off the best women and the best jobs ? What business is it of ours if the fools over there want to smash things up . Why should anybody want to help the French ? It 's all applesauce . During the last war all they did was gyp us right and left . Before I left France I hated them worse than I ever hated any German . Of course , " he added hurriedly , " not alI the French . Not a great guy like Charlie ; but then , he 's an American . " Peddle was an educated man , but his swaggering colloquialism had become so habitual that his personality had now grown round it , as flesh will grow on a deformed bone . The conclusion , never quite formulated before , that she disliked Mr. Peddle , forced itself on Miss Macklin . " Still , " she said aloud , making an effort , " even if you do n't like the French , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a certain feeling about this war . " " Not me , " Peddie said . " The hell with them all , I say . We 're neutral , and if we 're smart , we 'll stay neutral . Then when it 's all over and they 've bled themselves to death , we can step in and tell them all where to get off . If the United States plays its cards right we 'll be the virtual dictators of the world in another few years . " Miss Macklin heard the words without taking in their sense . She was thinking of a recent visit to the dentist , when he had given her novocaine . The muscles of one side of her face had sagged for an hour afterward . That was how she felt now : anwsthetized all over . With the coffee Mr. Peddie came to his purpose . He wondered if she had heard anything as to who was going to take Charlie 's place . It seemed to him unreasonable to bring anybody in from the outside . Frankly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , like everything else in the world , seemed altogether inconsequential . Mr. Peddle offered his shod feet , one at a time , to stumpy , swarthy Salvatore , the bootblack who had the concession for the office building , while he looked over a batch of short , staff-written articles that had just come to his desk . " What are you going to do about the war , Salvatore ? " he said , banteringly , between pages . " Going back to the old country to fight ? " The usually cheerful Salvatore shook his head , and frowned . " I don ' know , boss , " he said . " You tell ' em to go to hell , " advised Mr. Peddie , and would have amplified this doctrine had not his professional eye been held by a paragraph in the typewritten manuscript before him . " Gripes ! " he said aloud , and then thought , " What a lousy job . We ca n't use that . Does Henkel think he can get away with this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast he 'll ? " He picked up his telephone . After he had asked Henkel to come to his office he said to Salvatore , " You take it from me , say you 're an American and you do n't want any part of their war . " Salvatore nodded without much conviction , and rubbed the finishing gloss on Mr. Peddie 's shoes . As he put his brushes away and stood up , an office boy entered with an envelope . Mr. Peddie reached for it eagerly and opened it ; and when he saw that it contained a memorandum from Mr. Miller his pulses leaped . But the first few sentences ripped away the flimsy fabric of the day-dream he had been entertaining and exposed jagged-edged reality . The memorandum said , in the precision of Mr. Miller 's style , that Mr. Andrews would act , temporarily at least , in Mr. Launay 's place . And it said that Mr. Miller took this opportunity to do something he had been contemplating  --  to increase Mr. Peddie 's salary one thousand dollars a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no fool . He understood clearly that the salary increase , long overdue , was a mere sop to his injured pride . He knew that Miller would save several thousands a year by not replacing Launay by a new man and by forcing Andrews and himself to bear a heavier burden . Resentment seethed in him . He was Andrews ' senior in the business , more experienced  --  abler , he told himself . He was married and had two kids ; Andrews was a bachelor . Here was the kind of injustice that made men commit murder . Well , he would n't take it lying down . He 'd do something . A thousand bucks a year . What the hell was that ? He 'd go out and get another job . He 'd leave Miller so goddam flat . . . Mr. Peddle would never get another job . Mr. Peddle was almost dead , killed in the new war as he had been wounded in the old one ; but he did not know it . He would have had to be clairvoyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start on its world travels from the Eastern European battle zone would claim his life , together with the lives of three hundred thousand other neutral Americans . And Mr. Peddie was not clairvoyant .. It occurred to him that Launay , rather than Miller , was probably responsible for his defeat . Launay had always favored Andrews . And he wondered bitterly whether Miss Macklin had had anything to do with it . She 'd been damned cool at lunch . The hell with Launayi Let the whole chiseling French nation get wiped out . He 'd like to see the Germans really mop ' em up , this time . . . . Salvatore was waiting patiently to be paid . Mr. Peddle flung a dime at him , omitting his usual tip . Salvatore compressed his lips , and went to the door , where he collided with young Mr. Henkel , who was just coming in . A little later , Salvatore entered the general offices and made his round from desk to desk , wherever a shine might be wanted . He saw Mr. Henkel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk . Salvatore went up to him and said , " Shine to-day , boss ? " Mr. Henkel , a very blond , beefy young man , nodded abstractedly . Salvatore liked him . From time to time , in the course of the past two years he had talked about Fascism with Mr. Henkel and found that they held similar views . This was a comfort to Salvatore , who in 1936 , during the Ethiopian crises , had been rebuffed by many of his customers , and had sacrificed many tips through his vocal insistence that " Letta England try something , all right , she'lla see whata Mussolini can do . England 's afraid . You bet . The Italian navy , she 's got ta da best ships , and the Italian army , she'sa in-vin-cible . Absolutely . " To-day Salvatore was in need of advice and a sympathetic ear , and he knelt eagerly , placing Mr. Henkel 's foot care-fully on the metal foot-rest of the little stand . " It looks lika bad business , this a war , hey ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe it all be over in two , three month , " Salvatore said . " Maybe if a revolution in France , England , she maka peace right away , hey ? " " Maybe , " said Mr. Henkel . Salvatore 's face clouded . " If it last a long time , " he said , " I don ' know what to do . What you think , Mr. Henkel ? H I got ta my first citizen papers do I got ta go back home to fight ? " Salvatore 's trouble was this : Some years earlier , while attending a meeting of Italian-Americans at which the creed of Fascismo had been exalted by fiery orators , he had been carried away to the point of signing a pledge to fight for II Duce in the event of war . As war became steadily more imminent , the recollection of his hasty enthusiasm troubled him ; he was a married man with three children and was on the whole well satisfied with his life . He knew , however , the temper of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be put upon him , and the danger of ostracism , or worse , if he failed to make good his pledge , upon demand . His taking out of his preliminary papers of citizenship had been merely an effort to detach himself for the time being from a potentially belligerent Italy ; for in his heart he dreamed of an eventual return to his native Napoli . Now he had heard that first citizenship papers did not cancel his military obligations to If Duce . Must he , almost an American , go back to Europe to fight ? " What you think I ought to do ? " he said . Mr. Henkel said , " What ? I do n't know . Better take it up with your consul . " What a fool 's advice , Salvatore thought . The consul ! He was disappointed in Mr. Henkel , and he finished the operation on the shoes perfunctorily . He was even more annoyed when Mr. Henkel , who had begun to tip him as usual , suddenly hesitated , put the coin back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the loss of the nickel that annoyed Salvatore ; it was that this ally , this man who ought now , more than ever , to be his friend , should show such callousness and ill-will . Mr. Henkel entered his apartment quietly , greeted his wife with a kiss , and went dutifully with her to tickle the ribs of his three months ' old son . Then he said , " Virginia , I want to talk to you . " The gravity of his tone made her look up anxiously . They sat down on a couch , and he said , " I 'm afraid I 'll have to get a new job . " He told her of his talk with Peddie , of Peddie 's violent , unjust outburst , unjust because the article was not so bad , and even if it had to be done over there was no occasion for Peddie to lose his temper . Finally they had both exchanged abuse , and Peddie had threatened to take the matter up with Launay and Miller and have him fired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henke/ said ; the intricacies of business always bewildered her . She was a pale woman , rather pretty , with brown hair and characteristically American features ; her maiden name had been Donaldson . Mr. Henkel passed his hand over his eyes . " It 's the old story beginning again . " " What old story ? " she said . " I can sense it in the air already . You probably ca n't remember , but I do . I was a kid during the last war . They made us miserable , my whole family . My father 's business was almost ruined . I spoke with a little German accent and the other kids used to gang up on me and call me ' Heinle , ' and ' Spy , ' and make me kiss the American flag . Finally it got so had I could n't stand it any more . I had to leave public school and go to a private school . I can see the same thing beginning already . Peddie was wounded in the last war , and Launay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not a German . Why ca n't you just talk to them frankly ? After all , America is neutral . " " Neutral ! America ? " He shook his head . " Sooner or later they 'll get into it , same as last time . " " They ? " his wife repeated , looking at him curiously , He shrugged his shoulders . " No use worrying about it now . I 'll try to straighten things out with Miller tomorrow . Dinner ready ? I 'm going to wash . " Virginia Henkel went thoughtfully into the bedroom , where the baby 's crib was . Her first reaction to Paul 's ominous warning was that of a mother and she thought , " What of little Paul ? " Then she began to think as a wife  --  and to share her husband 's resentment againstthese unfair men , Peddie , Launay , and Miller . She was conscious , however , of some slight misgivings within herself . During the two years of their married life she had found it possible to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions quite sound ; the treaty of Versailles had been unjust ; Hitler had been perfectly right in making Germany strong again . But now she felt an odd sense of irritation with Paul . Her own instinctive response to the excitement of the war news was to hope that England would win ; she did not know why precisely , but she did feel that way . And she could not tell Paul how she felt , not without hurting him and making him furious . The baby began to whimper . She said , " There , there , darling . " And she thought , with a little smile , " Well , he 's neutral anyway .
