Happy Days ( Fox ) . This is one of the new enlarged pictures , samples of which have been issuing from Hollywood from time to time and which , on the Fox lot , are known as Grandeur Pictures . Last year a method was perfected for taking oversized pictures by photographing them on unusually big films , with lenses in proportion , instead of exaggerating an ordinary film in projection . Concocters of Fox publicity announced that Fox experts had found a way to make films " in three dimensions . " <P> Happy Days proves that this resounding phrase was not accurate . Although a " Grandeur Picture " fills a screen about twice as wide as the conventional size , it is only two feet higher . With its new width the camera can take in two characters talking at the same time in the middle foreground , without switching its eye from one to the other but to make the faces clear , the characters must be cut off at the knee . Another advantage of the wide film is that it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight against the same background twice as long as before . Countrysides , large masses of people , street shots , ballet numbers are better in Grandeur , but since the height of the Grandeur projection is practically the same as the old size there is no clarifying of perspective , no three-dimensional relief . Director Benjamin Stoloff has worked hard to show what he could do with choruses , always a baffling problem in conventional-sized films : wavering ribbons of dancing girls issue from two huge shoes ; there is a baby carriage big enough to hold a dozen squallers at a time , and a birthday cake that dwarfs the actors . The story involves short vaudeville acts by such stars as Ann Pennington , Tom Patricola , Warner Baxter , Charles Farrell , Janet Gaynor , George Olsen , J. Harold Murray . They put on a benefit performance-no worse than most of the cinema minstrel shows released recently-this time arranged for the destitute skipper of a showboat . Best shots : a riverboat swinging into a Mississippi wharf ; a train racing along the Hudson River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stories in which sport is used as a background against which a nice fellow and a knave compete for a girl , is that the big horse race , or prize fight , or poker game on which love and honor and the happy ending depend , is hard to photograph . Everything moves wonderfully up to a certain point , but after that one of two things must happen : either the spectator struggles with the technicalities of the selected background , or the director shirks the responsibilities of his climax , brushing through it with a shot of a crowd cheering , or Lord Weatherton putting his bet on Spark Plug , or mechanics pulling the charred body of the villain out of a wrecked plane . In Burning Up , however , the usual situation is reversed . The little triangle , with its hopelessly puerile dialog , has barely enough momentum to suggest a climax until the climax arrives-this time an auto race . The way the race is worked out , to the drone , like the vibration of gigantic , loose ' cello strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this typical program picture . Richard Arlen and Mary Brian have the leads . Best shot : poker game in a small-town commercial club .
