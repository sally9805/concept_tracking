If every year for seven years A hundred thousand men Gave sixty pence and sixty prayers We 'd have our churches then ! <P> From Chichester the Bishop calls To Sussex by the sea For folk to build the Church 's walls , In love and loyalty ! <P> - George Chichester <P> Happy and hopeful was Rt . Rev. George Kennedy Allen Bell , personable Lord Bishop of ancient Chichester , England , four years ago , when he composed the foregoing verses to raise money in his Anglican diocese . Unhappy and hard-pressed was the same noble Lord Spiritual last week when he learned that one of his clergy , a 70-year-old-curate from Camelsdale , near Haslemere , named Rev. William Henry Boyne Bunting , had turned on the gas , died in his barren bedroom along with his wife Hilda , 56 . Curate Bunting left a note declaring that his son James was in possession of most of the family money , between $15,000 and $20,000 . A coroner 's jury , formally pronouncing the Buntings suicides , observed that their son had acted " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents in their difficulties . <P> His Lordship of Chichester had first to decide whether the Buntings were responsible for their suicide , which in turn would decide their right to Christian burial . Next he had to deal with the deplorable scandal of an Anglican curate 's son breaking the Fifth Commandment , Honor thy father and thy mother . Last week he publicly adjured James Bunting to repent of his sins , informed him that until further notice he may not partake of Holy Communion in any church in the diocese of Chichester . <P> The Bishop wisely avoided mentioning excommunication , since the Church of England has not made use of that process in a century . But the Press did not hesitate to use that awful word , and although James Bunting was free to enjoy the sacraments outside Chichester , that young man professed to believe he was just as much excommunicated as if the Church had consigned him to Satan with a Fiat , fiat , fiat ! * From a seaside resort Bunting , who said he had been a scenario writer in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove the Bishop wrong . Admitting he had his parents ' money , he said : " In the past it may be I was a naughty boy , but there are lots of sons who have been naughty boys . " <P> <P> * In the Roman Catholic Church the penalty of excommunication may be inflicted , according to jurisdiction , by nearly every prelate from Pope down to vicar general . A dread excommunication formula-which Anglicans once used - ends : " We deprive him . . . of the Communion of the Body and Blood of Our Lord . We separate him from the society of all Christians . . . . We declare him excommunicated and anathematized . . . . We deliver him to Satan to mortify his body , that his soul may be saved on the Day of Judgment . . . . Fiat , fiat , fiat ! " ( " Let it be done , let it be done , let it be done !
