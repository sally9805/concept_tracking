" The liberty and property of the citizen shall be protected by the rudimentary requirements of fair play . " <P> Last week the foregoing declaration by the Supreme Court of the U. S. , and the judicial action based upon that rudimentary statement of public ethics , seriously disturbed the National Labor Relations Board , potentially affected the Interstate Commerce Commission , the Federal Trade Commission , the Bituminous Coal Commission , many another quasi-judicial Federal agency . <P> The Court 's lesson in sporting simplicities was included in a finding that the Secretary of Agriculture had arbitrarily and improperly fixed maximum rates to be charged by the Fred 0 . Morgan Sheep Commission Co. , of Kansas City . Mo . Attorney for Fred O. Morgan was persuasive Frederick Hill Wood of the potent Manhattan firm of Cravath , de Gersdorff , Swaine &; Wood , who argued down NRA and the first Guffey Coal Control Act . Arguing for Fred 0 . Morgan , Mr. Wood contended that the Secretary had issued his order without a complete knowledge of the facts gathered by subordinates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contest the order before it was finally issued . Last week six Justices ( Justice Black dissenting , two absent ) upheld Mr. Wood , commented caustically upon the Secretary 's attenuated review of the evidence , said : " The right to a hearing embraces not only the opportunity to present evidence but also a reasonable opportunity to know the claims of the Government and to meet them . . . . Those who are brought into contest with the Government ... are entitled to be fairly advised of what the Government proposes . . . before it issues its final command . " <P> Soon developed was the fact that in some of its vital cases NLRB had withheld a right which was now declared to be essential . NLRB Counsel Charles Fahy asked the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for time to correct the Board 's procedure and recent order against Republic Steel Corp . Active Mr. Wood , who also represents Ford Motor Co. , another NLRB defendant , asked the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to require testimony whether the three NLRB members had themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by subordinates ; whether , before the finding was issued , the Board or its officers had consulted Labor Leaders John L. Lewis and Homer Martin , New Dealers Thomas Corcoran and Benjamin Victor Cohen . Unhappy Mr. Fahy quickly asked leave to withdraw the Ford order , whereupon the board would issue a " preliminary " finding , make it available to Mr. Wood for argument , and again request the Circuit Court to enforce the amended order without reopening the entire case . While less than 2% of NLRB cases appeared to be affected by the decision , an important legal principle had been uncovered by astute Mr. Wood , one which could cause the New Deal much irritation .
