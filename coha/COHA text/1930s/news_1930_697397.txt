txt Embittered by the action of the Republican party of New York State taking a stand for repeal , the independent dry forces conferred here torUght after the convention adjourned for the purpose of discussing immediate plans for their campaign to run a prohibition candidate for Governor . At a long meeting of the representatives of the militant dry organization no candidate was named , but it was made known that several prominent prohibitionists were under consideration for the nomination . No choice is expected until Monday , when the same group will meet in New York City . The conference limited itself to the issuance of a statement criticizing the " insincerity " of the Republican organization and urging the voters " who would defend the Constitution as it is to vote for the independent dry candidate for Governor . " " The platform adopted and the candidate nominated by the Republican State Convention make it impossible for the dry forces to support the ticket , " the statement read . " Both the platform and the candidate , by declaring for the ' repeal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national Republican platform of 1928 . This will make more difficult the task of prohibition enforcement so splendidly undertaken by President Hoover . Deplores Victory for Wets . " This action brings victory to the wets and places in the ascendency the worst elements in the party . To assume that such forces are qualified to reform the State Government and to purify politics is ridiculous . " The pretense that the party favors enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment until it is repealed is manifestly insincere inasmuch as the convention refused to commit the party to the enactment of a State enforcement law , the only way by which the State can effectively enforce prohibition . " Those attending the conference , which was held in the Albany headquarters of the Anti-Saloon . League , were Mrs. D. Leigh Colvin , New York State president of the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union ; Fred A. Victor , State superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League ; Canon WilliaM Sheafe Chase , pastor of Christ Episcopal Church , Brooklyn , and president of the New York Civic League , and Dr. M. C. Gause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have promised to support the independent dry candidate , according to Mrs. Colvin , are the Women 's Committee for Law Enforcement , the National Temperance Society and the Prohibition Education League . Mrs. Colvin disclosed that the dry forces would offer only a Gubernatorial , nominee , the prohibition organizations agreeing to study the tickets of both major political parties and endorse all candidates who represented their beliefs . Predicts Good Showing . Pointing out that there was the utmost harmony among the anti-wet group , Mrs. Colvin predicted that their candidate would make a good showing in the campaign . As for the nominee winning , she said : " The third party will make a very active fight and I hope it will become the majority party . " According to Mrs. Colvin , Frank E. Gannett of Rochester , publisher ' ' of seventeen daily newspapers , including The Brooklyn Eagle , was still under consideration as a candidate . Reminded th ; tt Mr. Gannett had issued a statement declining the nomination , she replied : " But did n't Mr. Tuttle also say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refusal . Regarding his candidacy Mr. Gannett said he considered it a compliment to be suggested , pointing out that the compliment was greater in coming " from those Republicans who are fighting for a great moral issue . " " To heed the suggestion would seem to some to be a duty , " he said . " I am not insensible to this , but I feel I am of greater service to this or any other cause as the head of the Gannett group of newspapers than as a candidate for office . " The independent dry candidate will use the nominating petitions now being circulated for Professor Robert Paris Carroll of Syracuse University , according to Mrs. Colvin . The petitions contain 20,000 signatures , and the dry forces have until Oct. 13 to make the substitution , she said . Despite the reported statement that Professor Carroll had withdrawn as the candidate of the drys , Mrs. Colvin said there was still the possibility of his taking the nomination .                 @ @ @ @
