txt A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES DISEASE IN UGANDA A dreadful outbreak of sleeping-sickness had well-nigh spent its force by the time I arrived in Uganda , the Government having had time to take such sweeping measures as the entire removal of the natives from the Sesse Islands situate in the lake and an important centre of infection ; the cutting down , for a certain radius , of the thick grass fringing the lake shores which harboured the tsetse fly carrying the infection ; and an intensive as well as an extensive study of the disease by a small corps of scientists . But the disease was still claiming its victims on a sufficiently large scale , and Kisubi , a few miles from Entebbe , where the White Fathers had a mission and also a hospital , was proving very useful locally in the struggle against the disease . I remember that the Fathers , for the purpose of obtaining funds in this connexion , had published a series of pictorial cards , a set of which I still have , and which illustrates , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fathers told me that whilst they could , of course , do little but tend the poor people , and see that their simple wants were supplied , many of the patients who were not usually carnivorous had a great craving for meat ; this , of course , they ministered to so far as funds permitted . I think that I am correct in saying that in the earlier years no real remedy had been discovered , and the few Europeans whose duties kept them on or near the lake ? marine officers and missionaries ? and who contracted the disease , went home to Europe to die ? if they could travel so far . Here once again modern science has scored a triumph , and saved the African from yet another scourge . 8o A TRANSFER TO UGANDA Blackwater was very rife in Uganda in those days , as also malaria . Spirrilum fever was prevalent ; this dreadful disease is conveyed by the bite of a tick which acts as host for the germ . Ticks abounded in Uganda , and most rest-houses were infested . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Entebbe that there was a sinister background to the beauty of scenery and vegetation which I have mentioned . I refer , of course , to the endemic diseases , the noxious insects , poisonous reptiles and other undesirable concomitants of life in tropical Africa . After Mr. Winston Churchill had visited Uganda in his capacity of Under-Secretary of State , he described his travels in a series of able articles which appeared in one of the popular monthly magazines . As it happened , when the article dealing with Entebbe itself appeared , I was the first person in the station to receive a copy of the relative magazine . Since Mr. Churchill had painted a very gloomy picture of the Protectorate metropolis , and the background of disease to which I allude , the Uganda officials were , I understand , not ill-pleased , and were all agog to read it . The Deputy Governor , whom I had never even seen , went to the length of telephoning to borrow my copy . Strange , I thought , that whilst one does not exist socially , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deputy Governor was always a most courteous gentleman on the telephone , and it was a pleasure always to meet his wishes in any way . But it is odd to have to record that , although we lived our respective lives within a ( house agent 's ) stone 's throw of each other , I never set eyes upon him . A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES PROCEEDING ON LEAVE After four months ' residence information reached me that I had yet another transfer to expect . As this was an intimation that my long overdue leave had been sanctioned , and a colleague who had just returned from England was on his way to relieve me , I was not displeased in any way . I stepped aboard the S.S. Clement Hill one evening en route for Kisumu , Mombasa and England . The steamer , calling at Munyonyo next morning , where mails from Entebbe and Kampala were embarked , gave me , for the first time , an opportunity of seeing Kampala , the commercial capital and an important mission centre , being the seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant . It may seem rather odd at first that there should be two Catholic bishops there , and I have heard it explained that the Vatican had sanctioned this arrangement in the belief that the two hills on which each of the missions were located represented two separate and distinct townships . But then the Vatican , which is known to possess the best intelligence service in the world , does not make mistakes of this kind , and I feel sure that the arrangement was due to the circumstance that Kampala formed an excellent centre for communication , not only with the various mission stations but also the outside world . A friend who knew the place , and who had travelled on the steamer , took me to Kampala in a rickshaw . We passed for about ten miles through cultivated country , banana groves being situate on either side of the road . The country was undulating , and provided a refreshing change to one who had gazed on much the same scenery day after day for four months . Everything seemed so // peaceful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man there had been not a little fighting and bloodshed in this particular part of the Buganda kingdom as well as elsewhere . I had read Lord Lugard 's account of his strenuous days , and I recalled the death of the C.M.S . Missionary Pilkington , who had written the Luganda Grammar I used to study , and who was killed ( luring the Uganda mutiny . I was later to meet in Nigeria , Colonel Moorhouse , R.A. , who had served in Uganda during this mutiny of the Sudanese soldiers , and who told me that , for over a year , whilst chasing the ringleader and his band , he never camped twice in the same spot . I remembered , too , the cruel treatment meted out in 1886 to the native Christian martyrs ? both Catholic and Protestant ? by King Mwanga , who was deported to the refuge for such people ? the Seychelles . It was a trite reflection that once again the Pax Britannica , not forgetting the unwearied efforts of all the missionaries , had brought blessings to yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Rome in that it is built on seven hills . It was then a very scattered settlement , important , however , on commercial grounds : cotton , ground nuts , chillies , rubber and ivory being exported . The cotton then grown had not attained the relatively large volume it did ten or fifteen years later , and the then Governor was encouraging the people to concentrate on rubber . My time for sight-seeing was very limited , as I had to interview a colleague and return by the somewhat slow rickshaw in order to rejoin the steamer which wiled that afternoon . Much to my regret I was able to nee little or nothing of the very interesting township . I should have been more disappointed had I known that I was ( putting Uganda never to return . I had been virtually interned in Uganda for four months , and had begun to // be interested in a country which , for me , offered charms that East Africa lacked ; had not then been very greatly changed by the coming of the white man and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? were more intelligent and attractive than any of the tribes I had encountered in East Africa . I have since learned that the Buganda kingdom , at any rate , has changed almost beyond recognition . When I lived in Entebbe the Baganda always appealed to me as being such a polite people . It was quite interesting to watch two natives meeting on the road and to listen to the lengthy and elaborate forms of greeting which politeness demanded should be exchanged ere the men proceeded on their respective ways . Writing , even in 1919 or 1920 , a missionary who was revisiting Uganda after an interval of some ten years expressed himself as dismayed by the change in the character of the people , from courtesy to rudeness . Since then there have been further radical changes as a result of the increase in wealth of the Chiefs and peasantry consequent on the cotton boom which effected an economic revolution . So difficult did the labour situation become that many missions and Europeans generally had to buy motor-lorries since carriers and other manual labourers were simply unobtainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of transport available in Uganda since the Government had only one or two motors on the Entebbe-Kampala road , and horses could not live on account of disease . These rickshaws were handled by two natives , one of whom pushed whilst the other pulled . They travelled at a good rate of speed , and as they did so sang songs in which they , I understand , dealt at some length with the outstanding characteristics of their fare , and speculated as to whether he was likely to prove a good payer or not . The strain // oi the work affected severely their constitutions and I doubt whether any of these vehicles have been seen for years . The homeward voyage from the point of a man going on leave has been described so often that I do not purpose haying much . I was impressed , however , by the various things to which men were looking forward . One official who had been immured in Uganda for two and a half years was anxious to see a horse once again ; another from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , and seemed to talk of little else ; whilst another was sighing for his favourite restaurant in I , undon . Nothing startling occurred on the voyage which was made in a Messageries Maritimes steamer coming from Madagascar and bound for Marseilles . It was my first experience of a French boat and accordingly all the arrangements were of much interest to me . One thing peculiar to these French boats was to serve only two full meals daily , i.e. dejeuner about 11 a.m. and dinner at 6.3o p.m . Most people are apt to eat too much when travelling on the ocean and probably do so for two reasons ; the cuisine is a great change to one who has had lengthy experience of African cookery , and also one is often tempted to kill time by remaining at table longer than is necessary . Hence I thought the arrangement a sound one . Of course , early and afternoon tea were served , and one could get a cup of tea and a few biscuits about 9 p.m. , so there were really no short commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most of the passengers appeared shortly after this hour , and especially whilst we were still in the tropics . New to the customs on these boats , and the regulation that pyjamas could be worn in public between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. , I was somewhat // taken aback when ladies wearing night attire , and the lightest of wraps , sat down amongst the duly dressed passengers , most of whom were British . I could not altogether accustom myself to seeing a man clad in pyjamas only appear on deck soon after 8 p.m. amongst men who were still wearing evening kit . Another feature on the French steamers was the excellent one , in my humble opinion , of both first and second class passengers using the same deck accommodation . This was obviously the sort of system that might be expected from a democratic nation such as the French . The system of baths left something to be desired . There were , if I recall rightly , only four bathrooms available for the first and second class passengers . One could not book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rank or class one had to join the waiting queue . Two of the baths provided for cold plunges only . Few men who have lived in the tropics can face a cold bath ; and , moreover , the Malagasy bath attendant seemed to take it for granted that a Britisher must be wanting a cold bath , not a warm one . I had two or three French friends on board whom I had met in Uganda , so I asked one man what was expected of a passenger in the way of tips . He replied that in the case of a Britisher it would suffice for all purposes if I handed the chief steward a sovereign at the end of the voyage . On my expressing surprise at the smallness of the sum , my friend informed me that a French Army officer ? there were then a fairly large number stationed in Madagascar and Reunion ? would travel from Marseilles to Madagascar , or vice versa , a matter of over four weeks as compared with my voyage of about seventeen days , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accompanied by his wife , but the pay- // merit would still suffice . This was in the year 1908 when 25.20 francs were equal to a pound sterling . I was able to pay my first visit to Djibouti , French Somaliland , which might in point of climate be compared to Aden . The latter place does give one the impression of being a centre of population and activity , whereas at Djibouti everyone seemed to be overwhelmed by the heat , at any rate in those days . I still remember a repulsive Somali boy who , deformed in some way , walked among the cafe tables on hands and feet like a quadruped . Money was , of course , his object . The chief feature of the port was sand , and the only vegetation I saw consisted of two or three poor-looking palms in the garden attached to Government House . Even the fact that Djibouti was the starting-point of the railway to Abyssinia seemed to give no importance to the place , nor were there any outward signs of its political significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers landing from steamers . One paid something like a franc and this sufficed for one 's return journey to the steamer , thus obviating the extortion of boatmen so often met with in ports . I embarked feeling thankful I had not to do a tour of service in Djibouti . In due course we disembarked at Marseilles , this being my first visit to the port . Here my French shipboard friends proved useful . As I was remaining a night they directed me to a small hotel in a quiet street off the rue Cantebiere ; this I found to be clean and moderately prit ed whilst many of the French first-class passengers from the Djemnah were putting up there . Another of my French friends who had worked in Marseilles ere leaving for Africa volunteered to show me something of the city that morning . His tour seemed fairly exhaustive , and having had the principal places such as the Opera House // pointed out to me , he proceeded to show me the wonderful basilica of Notre Dame de la Garde , which stands on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Our Lady which surmounts the top of the uppermost church ? there are three in this basilica ? looks over the waters of the bay and can be seen for miles . Doubtless the first glimpse of the figure is the first intimation to returning fishermen that , after possibly a stormy time in the Gulf of Lyons , they are within measurable distance of their home port . Indicative of the attitude of many of the local fishermen and sailors is the presence of many ex-voto offerings displayed in the church , e.g. a model of a ship saved from shipwreck . I noted in one instance that an officer who had served in several of France 's numerous colonial campaigns had left his medals in token of thanksgiving ; whilst more than one pair of crutches showed that erstwhile cripples had been cured . The reaching of the basilica is somewhat of a business since the ascent is so steep . However , one who does not wish to emulate an Alpinist for a short distance can travel by means of the winding tramway and , as regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding is superb . In the foreground , set amongst the blue waters of the bay , one saw the Chateau d'If and revived memories of that famous book by Dumas that most boys of my generation read . My friend took me chiefly on the trams along lime-lined thoroughfares on the heights until we came to the Corniche with its wondrously beautiful well-gardened villas on the one side and the sparkling sea on the other . Here resided , I was told , many of Marseilles ' wealthy citizens , and one would well believe in their good taste . Back we came eventually to the Cannebiere , that thoroughfare which is characteristic of Marseilles , and so unlike any other that I have traversed elsewhere in Europe . Here // Africa meets Europe and the gaily coloured uniforms of the Spahis , Arabs in native costume , and the negroes of varying hues and types of physiognomy reminded one that Africa was only twenty-four hours ' steam away . The citizens are inordinately proud of their famous thoroughfare and , if the varied interest it has for the spectator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do . Before leaving , my friend told me where , in his opinion , the best meal for the price could be obtained in Marseilles . It proved to be a small place ? the Restaurant Gardaune , I think ? situate in one of the streets off thei Cannebiere . I was thankful for the advice , and could not have desired a better meal . Yet another instance of the untold value of local experience . Had I acted as a typical Englishman I should doubtless have stayed at a larger and more pretentious hotel , paid a larger bill and more tips , and yet have fared no better . My evening meal would probably have been similarly expensive , and I should have missed the opportunity of seeing the Frenchman dining abroad and living that life of his which seems to allow of the obtaining of the maximum of happiness with the minimum of expense . Marseilles , doubtless , is one of the worst cities in Europe so far as vice and crime are concerned . But then any sensible person has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far from a ship , and the slummy streets , and need not , therefore , be perturbed by that side of Marseilles life . Travelling to Paris by the night express , I was impressed by the fact that although the run lasted nearly twelve hours , the train drew into the Paris terminus on the stroke of the scheduled hour of arrival . Subsequently travelled by this train on several occasions , but always with the same result . // England and home at last after nearly three years ' absence . What a joy to use one 's powers of observation , and to note the manifold changes that had occurred in the interim . I well remember jumping hurriedly on a bus in town , going on top and noticing that there was something peculiar ? to me ? in the motion of the vehicle , and on looking over found that I was riding on a motorbus for the first time . It was odd to see , day after day , hundreds , thousands of white faces , all of them entirely strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official on leave from Nigeria . Arriving in town , he stayed at an hotel in the West End , and sallying forth into Piccadilly after breakfast next morning en route for his club , almost the first person he saw was a negro 1 Angered , he remarked , " I 've come two thousand miles to get away from you . Take that . " And he knocked the poor man down . Police court proceedings resulted , of course . // BACK TO EAST AFRICA LEAVE went all too soon , and I found myself departing from Victoria to travel across France to Marseilles on one bitterly cold March morning . In Paris , through a misunderstanding I was placed in the slow train for Marseilles , for , leaving about to p.m. , I did not reach Marseilles until about 2 p.m. next day . The delay was , however , the cause of much interest , for I saw portions of France in daylight which I should not have seen had I been rushed by in the hours of darkness . At one small wayside station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out to get some fresh air , and found snow lying on the platform . Looking up , I saw grape vines growing , and noted the name of the station ? Tain . Later we stayed at Avignon for about twenty-five minutes , and I had the experience of watching the Palace of the ropes as a wintry sun arose . It was an unforgettable sight , and one that probably made a deeper impression than a first view obtained in brilliant summer sunshine and in broad daylight . I am fond of history and have okays found that once one has visited a particular place , fit wen a particular building of historical interest , the fps to scent to be amplified and what was half fiction becomes truth . Later the train made a very leisurely bait a Tarascon ; this naturally revived literary memoirs 9t . A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES of Tartarin , and the romance associated with the place took on a new meaning for me . Marseilles at last . Tea at a table outside a cafe in the Cannebiere in brilliant sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi to the quay where the same steamer that had brought me from Mombasa was waiting to take me back to Africa . I was greatly cheered to find my two French friends already aboard , both being bound for Zanzibar . Outward voyages are very different from homeward ones . One is probably depressed by the fact of having left relatives , friends and all the amenities of life at home , and after a spell of the fleshpots of Egypt is apt to be very critical of the ship 's food , whilst underlying all this is the thought that at least two and a half years must elapse ere one is able to come on leave again . As we passed through the straits I looked with interest at Messina with no premonition , of course , of the terrible earthquake that was so shortly to cause death and destruction there . Oddly enough , as explained later , I returned through the straits a year later , and about two weeks after the calamity . Even from the steamer , one could see the ruins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific effects of an earthquake . Mombasa at last , and once again I found myself stationed at Nairobi , to which place departmental headquarters had been removed from the Coast . Official quarters being unavailable again , I took up my residence at the Norfolk Hotel . I found that many other bachelors were doing likewise , finding such a procedure , after all , more convenient than attempting to run a domestic establishment and being exposed to the tender mercies of native cooks and house-boys generally . At the hotel one was always certain of decently cooked food available // at stated hours . Also the curse of tipping waiters had still not yet descended on the land . Moreover , the constant ebb and flow of visitors was the occasion of great interest , for many tourists , intent some of them on big-game shooting , other globe-trotters , settlers and business men , came and went , so that one could always be sure of some interesting conversation at the table , in the lounge and bar . As indicated earlier , life could also be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must celebrate , and I remember more than one exciting incident . On one occasion two settlers took charge of the bar , evicted the Goanese steward and proceeded to nerve drinks and to break full bottles as fast as they could work . At another time two men came in to dinner after a spell at the bar feeling somewhat hilarious . One chased the Goanese steward into a corner and tried to administer red pepper , whilst another , after throwing oranges at the chandeliers , took up a position by the hatchway to the kit ( hen , ready to bonnet the first servant whose head appeared . Obviously such pranks were outside the scope of a junior official , since they had eventually to be paid for in hard cash . Lunch was usually better patronized than the dinner , since so many men living in houses and bungalows a little distance from the town found it convenient to lunch at the hotel instead of going home . The lunches were by no means reminiscent of an English restaurant . One might see police or military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Clint khaki-clad settlers in for the day . In the latter category were usually to be seen one or two odd individuals clad in somewhat dirty khaki , the sleeves being called up , with long , straggling beards and hair of similar length . They were usually , although not invariably , peers of the realm , or at all events men of good // family who had come to East Africa to lead the simple life of a settler . On one occasion whilst I stood on the verandah talking to a man of title who had come out to shoot big game , he drew my attention to a man of the type I have described , and remarked that when he last saw him he was in command of the guard at St. James 's Palace , and , " Now look at him . " Shortly after I arrived at the hotel the Roosevelt expedition came to East Africa . It was , it may be remembered , headed by the late Theodore Roosevelt , who had recently been Chief Executive of the U.S.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting some big game . The expedition was followed by several pressmen to keep the intelligent American public fully up to date . But their intention to introduce U.S.A. publicity methods into East Africa was promptly defeated by the action of the local government in announcing that any unauthorized pressman or other person who dogged the footsteps of the expedition would be promptly deported . The story was told in Nairobi that one baffled pressman , determined to send some news to the avid American public , cabled an account of a minor outbreak of smallpox in the local Indian bazaar , only to receive a curt telegram from his paper , reading , " Smallpox unwanted . " The expedition reached Nairobi . The ex-President was entertained at Government House , but several of the accredited pressmen stayed at the Norfolk Hotel , so we did not lack entertaining and informed conversation in the evening . One pressman , known also as an author , told me of an incident of his youth in connexion with Voodoo , that strange and horrible African religion , of which I shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his childhood in a Southern State he fell ill // with a kind of wasting disease which failed to respond to medical treatment . One day his mother was handling the pillows of his bed , and noticing something hard , dissected the pillows , when out dropped a small bundle Of dirty feathers tied together . On seeing this , the negro servants who were present shouted , " Voodoo , " and rused , screaming , away . The odd facts were that the bundle of rubbish disappeared before it could be further examined , and the boy forthwith began to recover his usual health . Sensational stories in the American Press in connexion with the Roosevelt expedition were not lacking . One which was transmitted to East Africa related an advenlute of one of the European hunters attached to the expedition ; how he lost his way , and suffering from belonged hunger and thirst , after a somewhat lengthy march arrived at a certain point virtually dead . Oddly enough , shortly afterwards , the hunter concerned stayed It the hotel for a day or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole story , and the suggestion that he would have been exhausted even by the journey mentioned . It was now four years since I first saw Nairobi , and township was still in process of change . More of Government Departments had removed their headquarters to the capital ; more and more settlers had arrived the Protectorate ; and the general store , kept by a new , in which one could buy anything from a tin sardines to a pair of shoes , and from a deck-chair to a was gradually being supplanted by European shops specializing in men 's outfitting , etc . The ubiquitous motorcar had begun to make its appearance ; the roads improved ; and more and more bungalows were being t In the suburb of Parklands and on the Hill . More // than one teashop had been opened , and in fact Nairobi had begun to look more civilized . One still met the Kikuyu women in the streets clad merely in their primitive clothes , consisting of a skin , their necks bedecked with hoops of iron wire , and carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small baby . The Kikuyu man at that time , at any rate , believed in plenty of hard , physical work for his womenkind , and when at home saw to it that they did their share of labour in connexion with the cultivation of mealies and sweet potatoes . EAST AFRICA POLITICS Local political opinion was then beginning to crystallize as the influx of settlers increased in volume , and more and more business men commenced operations . I fear that being preoccupied by my work , I took little interest in all this , but looking back now , I realize that East Africa was even then developing into the " Ireland of the Crown Colonies . " No Governor there had a bed of roses . Travelling once on the same ship as the Governor of another colony , I was struck by his remarking one day that a man in a high position had once told him that " there were two positions he should never accept : that of Viceroy of India , which would never be offered to him ; and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had occurred whilst I was stationed at the Coast , and doubtless played a great part in the forming of local opinion . It can hardly be described as being of as much importance to the Protectorate as the Boston tea-party was to Massachusetts , // but was probably symptomatic . It may briefly be described as a case in which two European ladies , travelh ng along a Nairobi road in a rickshaw , thought that they had been grossly insulted by one of the boys pulling the vehicle . A male relative took up the matter , and announcing that it was of no use having recourse to the law , took the course of enlisting the aid of some friends and sympathizers , and proceeded one morning to an open space in front of the Nairobi Court House where they publicly flogged the boys concerned . Such a crowd of spectators collected who as to the majority were obviously in favour of the proceedings that the Magistrate who , backed up by the Superintendent of Police , emerged to make his protest , was simply elbowed aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dial , convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment which was duly served , but the proceedings later were entirely quashed by a superior court . Some little time afterwards , and apparently as a result , the Government imported a number of European military police constables from England , who looked somewhat out of place as they patrolled the streets where native constables only had appeared before . Eventually these Europeans were withdrawn from this duty , and , I belicvc , employed on rather more responsible duties . During my stay in Nairobi another important political incident occurred there . An ordinance affecting native labour was on the tapis , and His Excellency the Governor had one morning addressed a meeting of dissident settlers on the subject , and made it clear to them that he was unable to modify his attitude on the matter . The meeting then broke up peacefully , but later , as a result of discussion outside , several of the settlers , amongst them being two members of the Legislative Council , marched A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES to Government House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , came out to ascertain what was required . Their object was explained , but one or two of the more turbulent spirits shouted , " Resign . " The Governor naturally resented this attitude and reported the matter by telegraph to the Secretary of State , with the result that the two members of Council were suspended for a term . The settlers , of course , had many legitimate grievances , but the Protectorate Government at that time was handicapped by lack of funds , and had still to depend on a grant in aid from the British Treasury . Consequently , essential services such as medical , posts and telegraph could not be extended in the way that the Administration would have wished . Since then , of course , the finances have radically improved , and whatever grievances may still exist there is no doubt that services such as education , medical , sanitary and communications have been extended to a degree that leaves the person who knew the Protectorate so many years ago gasping with wonder . The full story of the currency changes some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long for my pages , nor am I qualified to act as historian . How the silver Indian rupee fluctuated in value from 1918 onwards is well known to those people who take an interest in matters financial . And as the Indian rupee was legal tender in East Africa the planters and business people in particular naturally suffered heavy loss . The position locally was one of muddle ? viewed in the light of subsequent events . Early in 1921 the banks suddenly suspended the issue of drafts on London , and as soon as the necessary legislative sanction could be obtained the Post Office Department ceased to sell postal orders and to issue money orders payable oversea . Consterna- // lion naturally reigned amongst those persons who were in the position of having to remit money to Great Britain for the support of dependants , for the payment of insurance premia and the settlement of accounts . No doubt they had many uncomfortable moments until it was again possible to remit . At a much earlier date the Post Office had been encashing money orders expressed in sterling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentialities of such a situation are obvious . Great as were the losses sustained locally as a result of rupee fluctuations , on the other hand more than one person utilized the exchange situation to some profit . Some Indian acquaintances , in the course of conversation with myself , alleged that whilst the banks would not issue rupee drafts on India for Indians , they would do so in avour of Europeans who were customers . They suggested at I should obtain such a draft and take the resultant profit . Needless to say , I declined to involve myself in such a transaction . It is as easy to criticize the actions of both the local government and the Secretary of State concerned as it is well-nigh impossible to suggest what measures could have been taken to obviate loss to all parties . At this juncture one is irresistibly reminded of that fable of . /Esops about the old man who took his ass to market . The root trouble , I suggest , was that when the Protectorate first functioned as a polity it was linked with India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did the West African colonies in their early days . True that the British sovereign was still legal tender , and that fifteen rupees a could always be obtained therefor . But then that desirable coin had already begun to acquire a " scarcity , " illegal though this might be , and consequently was not easily come by . I believe that I am correct in // saying that the U.S.A. at that time had had more experience in regard to " currency change-overs " than any European nation . In fact , Professor Kemmerer , in his textbook on the subject , gives details of several such changes in which he was responsibly concerned . Nevertheless , it would be absurd to suppose that the Secretary of State failed to take , and act upon , the best technical and expert advice available to him . But , as I have already equivalently remarked , the mischief was done some years before . It was , of course , grossly unfair that whilst persons who were coming into East Africa during the period in question , bringing funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being involved in , so far as I can see , unavoidable loss , the Government officials whose salaries were expressed in sterling were being paid locally at the rate of fifteen rupees to the pound . Moreover , they benefited by being able to remit any surplus funds to Great Britain , thereby gaining 331 per cent . As a result those officials who had previously arranged " family remittances , " i.e. for a portion of their salary to be paid monthly in Great Britain to dependants and for life insurance purposes , hastened to cancel such remittances . The scheme for the introduction of an income tax on the lines of the British system , although it passed into law , was eventually defeated by what may be termed the " settler and business man interests . " Whilst some payments were actually collected for a while the Ordinance was at last rescinded , and , as the wife of a prominent settler remarked to me , " Only the Government officials were fools enough to pay . " Coming as I did within the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a humble student of economics of many years ' standing , I agree that a tax on income is as pernicious as any , I00 BACK TO EAST AFRICA since , although when only a few pence in the pound it may be as equitable as any tax can be , the real danger lies in the fact that having once succeeded in getting the principle admitted , and the law on the Statute Book , a Government usually experiences little real difficulty , whatever criticisms may be levelled at it , in increasing the rate as it deems necessary until , as in this unfortunate country , we are paying , or have been paying a nominal rate of five shillings in the pound . Moreover , such a tax involves , as time goes on , more and more inquisitorial methods which c ? or used to be ? contrary to the British ethos . Admittedly , the first of the foregoing considerations supplies to many other kinds of tax , but I venture to think that the danger is greater in the case of an income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain.When I was last in East Africa the Indian question as then becoming acute . Indians had , of course , proved most useful in the early days in connexion with the construction of the Uganda Railway , and during the subsequent years . Also they had continued to supply demand as regards clerical posts in Government and Commercial service , and for artisans . The question as since assumed a very serious character , rising and falling in some degree , and is likely to remain a thorny one for all concerned . The increasing tendency of the East African native to fill these minor posts for which Indians have for years been imported from India will not assist in the solution of the problem , but naturally , provided that he is possessed of the requisite abilities and degree of education or technical training , as the case may be the native must be given the preference , not only on grounds of equity , but on account of the financial consideration involved . Then again the recent demands of the Indian for superior posts in the Government service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , should easily be disposed of by the presence of a number of European youths , educated either in East Africa or in Europe , but residing with their parents in East Africa , versed in one or more local languages and , of course , with a knowledge of the mentality and habits of the native generally that no European not born in the country can possibly hope to attain . Much will , I suggest , depend on the attitude of future Governments in India as the Government of India Act comes into force . If the representatives of the Indian people adopt the present attitude of the Irish Free State then those natives of India who continue to reside in British colonies can not well expect to escape all the consequences that may flow from such attitude . IO2 CHAPTER FOUR A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA AftER I had been back at duty for about eleven months I was as informed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies had cabled offering me a post in Northern Nigeria which , alt hough not carrying a greatly increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better conditions of leave of absence , i.e. a holiday in England after one year 's service in West Africa as compared with two and a half years in East Africa . I accepted with alacrity , and having satisfied the medical examiner of my fitness fm service in West Africa , I found myself , a month later , embarking on the French steamer Adour . I felt no regret at leaving East Africa , although I should have liked a full her and much longer term of service in Uganda , that much more attractive country , for in my particular Depart " lent one 's nose was , as already indicated , very closely acid to the grindstone . I had had an interesting , if wry short , period of service , but the social question still rankled . This being my fourth sea voyage , much of the novelty bawl worn off . I do think , however , that there is always athrill about arriving at a foreign port , going ashore , seeing something at first hand of a foreign country and stretching one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strainers homeward bound were always stopped at // Suez for medical inspection before being allowed to proceed through the Canal . At this time the Port Medical Officer was an English lady . Such steamers as I travelled on usually managed to anchor at Suez about midnight or one o'clock in the morning , and one felt sorry for the lady whose official duties brought her aboard at that unearthly hour . It was unfortunate that the English passengers , who should have known better , never seemed to take this lady doctor seriously . The examination was a careful one , and an essential preliminary was the marshalling of the first and second class passengers in the dining-saloon in order that the Medical Officer might check the list and satisfy herself that all those persons who had been notified as fit and well were capable of putting in an appearance . The stewards ? I usually travelled on a French boat ? experienced some difficulty in making some of the English passengers who had gone to bed understand that they were really required in the saloon at that hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being played . If , of course , they mentioned that a lady wished to see the passenger , then the latter was quite certain that a prank was being played . On one occasion , as the name of each passenger was called out in the saloon , a little group of Englishmen sitting on the companionway made remarks such as , " First prize , well done , " and clapped their hands . On the same occasion an officer of the King 's African Rifles came rather belatedly into the saloon , yawning hugely and saying rather loudly that he considered the affair " a d bad joke . " This remark rather added fuel to the fire . At another time , the English passengers were so unruly that the Port Medical Officer told the Captain she was going ashore and would return when " his passengers I04 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA could behave themselves . " And ashore she went , leaving the ship high and dry . London once again . Even after an absence of a year one is thrilled by the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the atmosphere of gaiety and pleasure which seems inseparable from the West End at night . i secured a room at the Charing Cross Hotel , for those were the days when many of the boat-trains made use of Charing Cross . Then , after a meal , I sallied forth to find out what the theatres had to offer . I found Our Miss Gibbs being played at the Gaiety with such stars in it as Gertie Millar , George Grossmith and Teddy Payne . Oddly enough , when , a few weeks later , I arrived t Liverpool to embark for West Africa , I found the same lay running at the Royal County . Those were the days when we returned from leave with the strains of the timbers from plays such as The Merry Widow and Dollar Princess still ringing in our ears . Nowadays , the men have to return to Africa , I take it , with only the Unmusical rhythm of some " hot number " to remind them of home . I had about three weeks in England during which time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cc for my use during a stay in Northern Nigeria of twelve months . Provisions and drink , I gathered , were ' linable at my destination , but since transport on the n steamer was free up to a certain weight , it paid one take out stores , so having expended the best part of ahundred pounds in this way , I travelled to Liverpool , tn whence sailed the Elder Dempster boats , which had n the virtual monopoly of the passenger traffic to fish West Africa as well as a goodly proportion , I believe , of the cargo . This , although my fifth sea voyage , was my first Io5 A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES experience of a British steamer , and I was rather looking forward to it . It is always a strange experience to set foot on a ship where one knows no one , and one is more or less strange to the routine and customs of the life . For every passenger route , whether to South Africa , New York or Bombay , has its own particular code of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nationality of the boat . The first thing which impressed me on the S.S. Elminah was an elaborately set-out meal in which such items as a glazed boar 's head , glazed tongue , prawns in aspic , boiled and roast game and poultry figured very prominently . I found later that gossip alleged that this elaborate display was merely for show , and was swept away once the ship left the wharf for Africa . I at once noticed a difference in the type of passenger . Ladies were conspicuous by their absence , for in those days the West African Colonial Governments did not encourage officials to bring out their wives : this on account of housing and other considerations . In Northern Nigeria the Government not only required an official to obtain permission beforehand , but also insisted on his paying something like ? 40 per annum on account of rent for that portion of the official quarters occupied by his wife , even if the quarters were a mud hut situate somewhere along the Benue River ! So we had no lady passengers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and missionaries . There were no men travelling for pleasure , for West Africa ? at least the British Colonies of that day ? offered little in the way of big-game shooting . Gold-mining on the Gold Coast and the recently inaugurated tin-mining in Northern Nigeria accounted for two or three individuals . I found that I was sharing a cabin with an official who A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA was returning to Northern Nigeria , so I had several opportunities of putting various questions about my future scene of operations . My cabin mate stuttered rather badly , and I learned later that several stories were Current about him , many of which he gleefully retailed himself . One was to the effect that some years before , when he was acting as Marine Transport Officer at an out-of-the-way place on the Niger , there arrived from the intcrior two young political officers bound for home . Both had the misfortune to stammer badly , and dreading aving to approach a stranger , they arranged that the betterr speaker of the two should make known their requirements . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , stammered badly . The spokesman for the politicals did likewise , and the Marine Officer hastily concluded that he was being imitated and grew angry that the two young men fled . The story goes On to say that after they had waited for twenty-four hours another attempt was made , and then it dawned upon them that they all stammered . Life on board was very quiet , most people apparently Still thinking of home and all that they were leaving . Very little was done in the way of deck games , but bridge had its devotees . The principal amusement during the day secured to be to sit on deck in chairs and to wait for various meal-times to come round , and to imbibe ' drinks at decent intervals . Our first port of call was Las Palmas , and there everyone hastened ashore . On landing , my most vivid impresionswere of sun and dirt . It was my first experience of outhern race in a sub-tropical land . Actually , I suppose , the inhabitants have little Spanish blood in their , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life ashore was proceeding in listless fashion . I noticed // a funeral procession wending its way along the road , and was impressed by the fact that many of the male mourners were smoking cigarettes . Such works as the docks , which existed on a large scale , were financed by British capital or the result of British enterprise . Apart from the foregoing , there was a dolce far niente air about the place . The cathedral was a fine building . I was invited by a priest to come into the sacristy , where he showed me some gorgeous vestments . I was somewhat startled when he produced from a cupboard a large glass bottle containing a human heart preserved in what was presumably spirits . Later , a service was proceeding in the cathedral . A very pretty Spanish girl was sitting near me , and I fear that , despite my surroundings , I must have glanced more than once in her direction , for suddenly , without warning , she was spirited away by her elderly companion who , I suppose , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of in those days , Messrs . Elder Dempster of Liverpool , whose ships plied to West Africa , offered special terms to anyone wishing to visit the Canary Islands for a holiday . One could travel first class from Liverpool to Las Palmas and back , and stay for one week at the Company 's hotel , for the sum of ? 2o . The people who took advantage of this were known on shipboard as " Elder Dempster 's Canary birds " and various stories were told about them . One was to the effect that on a homeward-bound ship a " Canary bird " was put into a cabin already occupied by two " coasters , " one of whom woke one morning to find the " Canary bird " using his tooth-brush . Remonstrated with , the man merely replied : " Oh , I thought it was the ship 's tooth-brush . " As we neared Sierra Leone the temperature increased . Io8 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA 1 noticed the greater degree of humidity as compared wit h the heat I had known in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was characteristic of the " Coast . " Sierra Leone is one of the few places on the West ) ast where landing is an easy matter . Here I made my at acquaintance with the natives of West Africa , and I gan to realize how little real meaning is connoted by c term " African . " Good people at home speak of Africans as they might of the French or Swedish , and m to have little or no conception of the extent to which one African people differ from another in almost every ay , including , possibly , colour , save that , like the nglishman , they are human beings ! Nor do stay-atvine people appreciate that not all Africans are negroes , and would possibly be surprised to learn that even in a untry such as Uganda , so near the Equator , not all the bcs arc negroid . Coming , as I did , from East Africa , where one looked twice " at an African whom one heard using English instead of Swahili or some other East African vernacular , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken , pidgin-English in many cases , it is true , but still intelligible to the newcomer . I was later to learn that Freetown had been partially colonized by freed slaves of African descent from America ; these people had in most cases forgotten their native language used nothing but English of sorts . The educated accent of Sierra Leone naturally speaks grammatical limb in varying degree , but the illiterate obviously do and accordingly employ pidgin-English , which is frequently their one and only language . Pidgin or Coast English as it is termed , may be regarded as a distinct dialect , and , in fact , few Britishers ever learn to speak it properly . A knowledge of this lingua franca will take // one many miles ; and in pre-war days the Germans in the Cameroons had , in view of the diverse languages spoken by their native soldiers , actually to use pidgin-English when giving the words of command and orders generally . Freetown had little to attract one beyond the opportunity provided for stretching one 's legs . The shops , such as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were available were being sold by itinerant pedlars . The Protestant cathedral unexpectedly provided a memory of England , for several of the memorials inside dated from the period when the man of eminence was always possessed of many virtues and abilities , and accordingly required a lengthy , laudatory notice on his tombstone . Our ancestors may have been more straitlaced than we are , but they seem to have lacked modesty in many instances ? they or their heirs . Those were the days before cold storage depots had been established on the coast . Consequently the arrival of the fortnightly mail steamer , fitted with refrigerating apparatus , was a godsend to many Europeans living at the ports , for they could obtain from the chief steward , on payment , such delicacies as beef and mutton , English butter , sausages , potatoes , poultry and game , to say nothing of well-baked ship 's bread . I idly watched the foregoing items being brought up from below and dispatched ashore , not realizing that months were ahead of me during which an ordinary potato would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual complement of Kroo boys who would , until the boat returned to Sierra Leone , work cargo and generally make themselves useful so far as unskilled manual labour was required . These men came from the coast from which they derive their name , and are famed for their strength , good humour and abilities as workers on board ship . Also came aboard the A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA first batch of African deck passengers , who come and go at all ports , and , I suspect , contribute a useful sum to the moneys earned by the ship during each voyage . They live , eat , sleep and maintain their being on deck , and beyond a simple ration of rice or some such foodstuff , give the minimum of trouble to the purser 's department . Other ports followed , Axim , Sekondi and Accra , but going ashore for one who was not due to disembark was virtually out of the question : this since the steamer had ! force to anchor some distance out from the shore and could only embark or disembark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for passengers ) and a crane ( for cargo ) and surf boats . These surf boats carried several men , who wielded paddles of a peculiar shape , and who manoeuvred their rather light , frail-looking craft in a most skilful fashion . Any cargo they brought or carried away was handled fairly easily by means of the ship 's winch , but passengers were a somewhat different proposition , since they were more valuable and more easily damaged than cargo . The modus randi was as follows : the steamer carried a mammy chai , which was essentially like the old-fashioned contrivance in which an infant was placed and kept in position by means of a bar across its chest . A passenger wanting to disembark took his seat therein , the word was given to the man working the winch to hoist , and away went the mammy chair , to be lowered as soon as it was above t he surf boat . Then came the critical moment , for just as the chair neared the seat of the surf boat a rollicking wavc might either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse still , to rise some distance above the mammy chair . So the luckless passenger had a sporting chance of deposited in the surf boat with a terrific bump or getting a ducking . And a large audience on the III A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES steamer patiently waiting for something to happen did not add to the pleasure of the experience . A passenger would also watch the handling of his luggage with a deal of concern , for despite the great skill displayed , both by the ship 's people and the boat-boys , it would occasionally happen that some baggage would find a watery grave . A friend later related to me that once in harbour at one of the worst ports on the Gold Coast he watched a surf boat bringing off a passenger . Suddenly the boat capsized , but was righted , and boys , passenger and luggage placed therein again . At the time , being Sunday , a religious service was proceeding in the saloon , and my friend noticed that the hymn " For those in peril on the sea " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mentioned the curious circumstance . " Oh , " said the other man , " that was nothing , for it was the third time we had capsized . " Certainly the way in which the boat-boys handle their craft is deserving of much admiration . NIGERIA AT LAST In those days the Lagos bar was much in evidence so that passengers from the mail steamer were embarked outside on smaller craft which was able to cross the bar and reach the harbour . As a result anyone proceeding to Northern Nigeria , as I was , saw nothing of Lagos except a few lights at night . All passengers for Northern Nigeria were then landed at Forcados and taken by means of a stern-wheeler to Burutu , a few miles distant , where the Northern Nigeria Protectorate Government had an enclave and maintained a Marine Officer to look after their interests . I12 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA As we approached Forcados I noticed a huge floating buoy which bore a bell ; this rang as the buoy was rocked to and fro by the waves and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now had a view at close quarters of the Nigerian coast . There seemed at first to be no outstanding feature ; no towns and not even a house or hut to be seen ; nothing but a dull flat outline of land which looked as greasy under the sun as the palm oil which had produced so much profit in the past , even if the present-day receipts are so low . The ship cast anchor Forcados harbour and I then perceived that the scenery close quarters was little better than at a distance ; for c saw nothing but a few European bungalows , some cols , huts , depressing-looking mangroves , an odd palm two , and much black , evil-smelling mud . After a short sit the vessel arrived alongside which was to take passengers for Northern Nigeria on their journey of about three undred miles up the Niger to Lokoja . This was a sterncrier , a craft entirely new to me , and , as the name cures , the paddle wheel is placed in the stern . The I had two decks ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the upper deck contained three or four cabins and constituted the accommadation fur the European passengers . By this time all herd Nigeria passengers had , with the aid of the assembled all their kit and cases of provisions on the of the ocean steamer , and , so far as this was possible , lard their transfer to the stern-wheeler , hoping ferthat no box or suit-case would be dropped override c if this did occur the goods could be written a total loss . I had been advised to have one case of provisions specially selected to supply my wants during the journey up-river ; and I suddenly beheld this box , was marked with my name and the words " River I13 H A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES journey , " falling from the hands of the native who was passing it over the side of the ocean steamer ! I had visions of a week 's travel on an unvaried diet of possibly sardines or tinned salmon , but , happily , the box struck the lower deck of the stern-wheeler , burst open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tins floating in the water whence they were virtually all retrieved by the willing hands of those natives on the stern-wheeler who had witnessed the mishap . The European passengers for Northern Nigeria numbered about six only so that , contrary to what happened sometimes , we were not uncomfortably crowded on the river boat . There were not sufficient cabins to allow of every man being allotted one , but in that hot climate it was rather an advantage to have one 's camp-bed placed on deck , near the rail , so getting as much breeze as possible ; and in any case no one wished to spend much time in a cabin . As the good ship G.S.W. Kampala commenced the voyage I felt somewhat excited at the prospect of seeing the " lordly Niger " for the first time , and journeying thereon for about six days . The Niger , by the way , is , like the Congo and the Danube , an international river , not a national one . At first the outlook was very circumscribed , nothing but snaky-looking black mangroves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of a corner of the Niger Delta , that vast expanse of mud , solid land and mangroves which stretches almost from Lagos to Calabar . In the strict geographical sense I am possibly wrong , but as the natives who know the channels are reputed to be able to take a canoe all the way from Opobo at any rate to Lagos without touching the sea proper , I am not very wide of the mark . Gradually the channel of the river up which we were " 4 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA travelling widened , and one got a more extensive view . The ubiquitous oil palms appeared here and there , and a few huts supported on piles in which lived natives who doubtless made a living by fishing . So far mud and not dry land , and certainly not sand-banks , was the outstanding feature of the Niger . The steamer had aboard a travelling African Postmaster whose duty it was to dispose of mail matter intended for the small trading stations at which no Post Office existed . He also carried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these small stations , one would catch a glimpse of two or three wood and iron buildings , the inevitable collection outside of the puncheons in which palm oil is shipped , and then a white-faced , lonely looking young European Walking down to collect his mail . I could not help Visualizing the lonely nature of the life of such a man , tiering only the weekly steamer , which did not wait long enough for him to get in touch with any of the European avengers . Probably his only opportunity of talking to a fellow white man was when his superior came on an infrequent tour of inspection , and even when talking to c Litter , the poor exile would be made to feel that he was very much a junior . The thought occurred to me that an itinerant missionary , for example , could do a deal of good by paying occasional visits to these exiles . But possibily conditions have changed materially since I first veiled on the Niger . At night the steamer stopped and cast anchor , for Ration after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to pass a quiet night once the z of chatter from the natives on the lower deck had down . As soon as the sun began to rise the voyage resumed . After the first day the mud-banks and manwere less in evidence , and more dry land and small // collections of huts thereon were to be seen . The vegetation became rather monotonous in character . Occasionally we stopped at a place of some importance such as Onitsha , where mails were embarked and disembarked , passengers taken on or put off , and a certain amount of cargo dealt with . Native passengers seemed to bulk largely in the ship 's business , and since very limited accommodation was required in their regard , doubtless they proved a not unprofitable source of business to the Northern Nigeria Government . These native passengers take up every available square foot of space on the lower deck , which also carried wood fuel for the engines , all kinds of cargo and baggage belonging to the European passengers . Nevertheless somewhere in this mass of human beings and boxes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook meals for their masters , boil water for tea , and even sufficient for a warm bath . Occasionally it would occur , I believe , that when there were many European passengers and more than one mess was being run , a dish intended for one mess would be inadvertently placed before the men sitting at another table and disposed of ere any investigation could be made . Much is said and written as to the failings of the West Coast cook , but again and again I have marvelled at the wonderful results which he produced under most adverse conditions . Travelling in the " bush " where no sort of stove was available , but only a few stones or an old kerosene tin , I have had a somewhat elaborate meal . On one occasion in later years my wife and I were travelling by train . We had spent the night in a brake van , the train was due to leave at 7 a.m. , and the cook had therefore been instructed to prepare breakfast before that hour . This involved the lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // boiling of a kettle and the cooking of an omelette . The latter was completed a few seconds before the train left and could not have been of better quality . Nothing exciting occurred during our voyage save that a tornado came on one day . I was amused to notice that the senior European official took charge and told the native skipper what measures to take ! Anyhow it was not much of a blow and was soon over . Shortly afterwards I was interested to see my first crocodile disporting himself on a small sand-bank . The countryside had changed by this time . The mudbanks had been left well behind , and besides the inevitable palms one saw other trees , bush and such evidence of more open country . Occasionally a small hill would appear in sight . The country did not seem to be very thickly populated , but then life in tropical Africa has taught one that in many districts considerations of defence lead to villages being sited so that a marauding band may not find their work too easy . Here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either engaged in trans  - -  porting produce such as palm oil or palm kernels to the nearest factory , or fishing . The Niger has some good Coarse fishing . One fish known to the natives in Northern Nigeria as " giwan rua " ( water elephant ) runs to a great weight and I have heard of specimens exceeding one build red pounds . Onitsha was reached ; this was the largest settlement we passed between Burutu and our destination . The Nothern Nigeria Marine maintained a European Superintendent here in those days to look after their passenger ad crgo interests . The Northern Nigeria Marine had then , I believe , almost a monopoly of both classes of traffic on the main stream , and maintained a weekly service . But the days have passed when the Niger was the one and I17 A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES only road to Northern Nigeria , and the railways , motor roads and airways have revolutionized travel even in that part of the world . Navigation on the Niger for a vessel of such shallow draught as the stern-wheelers was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navigable channels were not very deep , and despite her shallow draught there was normally a risk of vessels such as the Kampala running aground . This mishap is not as a rule serious , for a few simple manoeuvres usually had the effect of restarting the boat . One odd expedient I have witnessed during the low-water season was for some of the crew to jump overboard on to an adjoining sand-bank , armed with spades , and to dig out the vessel . During the high-water season , which occurs once a year , ocean-going steamers , not , of course , of large tonnage , laden with railway material would at the time of which I write come all the way from Liverpool , and under the guidance of a native pilot penetrate as far as Baro , which was three hundred and ninety miles from the coast . Care had to be taken to guard against the steamer remaining too long away from the coast , for on at least one occasion one unfortunate steamer was marooned in the upper reaches of the Niger until next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great regularity . The natives have a theory that an abnormal flood occurs regularly every seven years ; and I believe that European observation , so far as it had then gone , confirmed this theory . In those days the Niger transport reigned supreme , and had not been virtually displaced by the railway which has , in truth , revolutionized the transport conditions of Nigeria ? only in its turn to be materially affected by air transport . At the time of which I write all officials and all other passengers proceeding to Northern Nigeria did I18 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA so by way of Burutu , the three hundred miles up the Niger and Lokoja . Even then , in the case of men who were destined for the Hausa States , the capital , Zungeru , and the Benue provinces , their travels were by no means finished . Men going to the Benue provinces re-embarked at Lokoja . If it were the high-water season they were lucky and travelled on a small stern-wheeler in what was comparative luxury to the alternative awaiting them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poling barge . As will be appreciated , when travelling upstream in a craft propelled only by poles , progress was Blow and tedious . True , one could usually camp for the night on an adjoining sand-bank , there partake of the evening meal , and with luck get a shot at a bird , or some small animal . But the monotonous succession of days , acre like its predecessor , exposed to heat , biting insects and general tedium were very different from the days previously spent on the ocean steamer . However , it was all in the year 's work . And one 's tour of service had ready commenced at the coast , so by the time that an 001 ial had arrived at Ibi or Yola , for example , some weeks had elapsed and all counted for leave of absence ! Men allocated to Sokoto or Kano had a different route to travel . From Lokoja they continued their journey up the Niger as far as water conditions would allow in the low-water season , possibly finishing the journey in a native canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more tedious than the poling barge on the Benuc owing to the quarters being much more cramped , and the passenger exposed to the weather save so far as umbrella gave a measure of protection . Meals , of course , had to be prepared ashore , and the were spent in similar position . At one rather period a further spice of adventure was furnished I I9 A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES by the tendency of some of the natives through whose territory the canoe was passing to indulge in a little archery , with the canoe and its human freight as their target . At a place named Barijuko a steam tramway took passengers and cargo as far as Zungeru , the capital of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate . From Zungeru officials proceeded usually on horseback , but as they could not well lose sight of their essential kit and stores , the journey to Kano or Sokoto occupied many days . In fact , so lengthy were most journeys then that the regulations required officials to serve for one year at their station ; otherwise the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months spent at actual work and three months travelling , whether on river or land . A change came over the scene with the extension of the old Lagos Government Railway to Zungeru and the construction of the Northern Nigeria Railway from Baro on the Niger to Kano . Then , of course , officials destined for Zungeru and the north of the Protectorate were instructed to disembark at Lagos and reached Zungeru within two days . There remained , however , the lengthy foot or horseback journey to places such as Kano and Sokoto . Passengers for Lokoja and the Benue provinces continued for some time to travel in the old-fashioned mode by way of Burutu and the five or six days ' journey up the Niger . This latter arrangement pleased most of the old hands , who had no fancy for the hurried journey by rail from Lagos to Zungeru through what was for them foreign territory , i.e. , that of another colony in which different regulations and conditions prevailed , different natives lived and things were done differently , not so well , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO WEST AFRICA was a deal of rivalry between " Northern " and " Southern . " Each knew little of the other , for few officials from the South ever entered Northern territory , whilst the Northern saw little or nothing of Southern Nigeria as he journeyed to and fro by water , touching only some of the smaller stations . But even West Africa did not stand still in those days . When I reached Northern Nigeria in May , 1910 , the railway line from Baro had just arrived at Zungeru . In fact , I was in time to share the doubtful privilege of travelling over the recently completed " link " from Minna on the " main " to Zungeru . I found that the possession of a first-class ticket entitled me to place a deckchair in an open truck journeying between the two points mentioned in the heat of the day . It was my first experience of " construction , " and it took several hours to do the thirty miles . The train stopped on many occasions for fuel , water and presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorching sun , but was intensely interested in all that I saw , although the Nigerian bush soon tends to become monotonous . Amongst my fellow passengcrs were two European missionaries who , I the reel from the conversation , had met by accident at Minna . I overheard this remark as the train once again stopped : " Well , I am delighted to meet you like this . all we make some more tea ? " Zungeru , the capital , at last . Surely it was the smallest capital in the British Empire , for , in addition to the fifty or so European residents , there was a very small native settlement . In fact , I should say it had entirely grown up as a result of the advent of the European . Why this site was selected I am not clear , for it was not then easily accessible from any point in the Protectorate . I should have thought that Lokoja , although by no means // central , would have been a better choice . But perhaps Zungeru was regarded as being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a station . Something of a change from the social conditions I had been accustomed to in East Africa was the circumstance that immediately on my arrival in Zungeru , I , together with my chief , was invited to lunch by the Secretary to the Administration , whose rank was roughly equivalent to third in command of the Protectorate . I spent a few days at Zungeru in order that I might meet my new chief , whose departmental headquarters were here . He was an able Irishman who , in addition to knowing his job , had qualified as a barrister-at-law . A story told about him was that he had expressed a very candid opinion , in a minute paper , about a draft ordinance , and provoked a high legal officer to inquire " by what right the Postmaster-General expressed an opinion on a point of law . " The prompt reply was that " because he , the Postmaster-General , was , like His Honour , a briefless barrister . " Official bungalows at Zungeru were limited in number and even many senior officials shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , were placed in quarters situate over the Government offices , which stood in a square near the local river , and known as Aiki ( i.e. Hausa for work ) Square . These quarters , being raised , had the advantage of getting whatever breeze was going , were near one 's work , and one 's pocket was not encroached upon by having to maintain a garden . In Aiki Square accordingly we lived and worked . My stay , however , lasted a few days only , for I had been instructed to return to Lokoja to assume duty at that station , and it was merely a matter of waiting for the mail steamer which left Baro for Lokoja once a week . I was not sorry , for I22 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA Zungeru seemed to offer little attraction to a new-comer . The country around was rather bare save for a few trees and some coarse scrub . Polo , golf and tennis were played , but although it was the capital , there was nothing in the way of a social club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BaroKano Railway , I once again reached the Niger . The stern-wheeler was waiting , and I decided that it would be more comfortable to spend the night aboard than to camp in the local rest-house . Officials did sometimes during the dry season have their camp-bed put up in the railway station yard . Sleeping thus under the stars ensured one getting any breeze that might be going , but had its disadvantages . I had encamped in this fashion on one occasion , and was aroused next morning by a shunting engine passing , and that not six feet from my head . My boy had placed the camp-bed near a siding . A friend had a narrower escape at this station . He was aN awakened about 5.30 a.m. by a locomotive whistling , and , arousing himself sleepily to find out the cause of the commotion , found that his camp-bed had been placed in the middle of the permanent way , and that the enginedriver was asking for permission to pass . My friend sprang up very quickly and soon dragged his bed out of harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , I soon discovered my my new home , which I was to occupy for a year . It consisted of one half of a bungalow , which I shared with the officer in charge of the local Treasury . With the exception of those occupied by the Northern Nigerian Regi- // ment , a battalion of which had its headquarters locally , the official bungalows were rather pleasantly situated around two sides of a field used for playing tennis and golf . At the back of my bungalow arose Patti , a steepish hill which dominated the Cantonment of Lokoja and provided scope for men who felt energetic enough to climb to the top , a matter of about three-quarters of an hour . From the front verandah of the bungalow I was able to secure a wonderful view of the Niger , and branching away to the east the River Benue , the two uniting a very short distance above the native quarter of the town . Beyond the water arose a series of small hills , and when the sun began to set , throwing a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , there was something to be said for the poet who spoke of the " lordly Niger . " I remained in Lokoja for a year . It was a busy little station for that part of the world . Several European trading firms had factories and did a deal of trade with the natives in palm oil , palm kernels and other local products . A certain volume of trade came down the Benue . One double-storied house belonging to a commercial firm was pointed out to me by a French missionary , who remarked that it had been built by " one of my Cabinet ministers . " I found that he was referring to the Right Honourable John Burns , who was at one time in the employ of the Niger Company . The factories lined the right-hand bank of the Niger and the " water-front " presented a busy scene during the day , for , lower down the river , the waterside was used by the Government Marine Department for loading and unloading its little fleet , and here also was situate the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a since it was the headquarters of the Marine Department , and a battalion of the Northern Nigerian Regiment and I24 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA other departments were represented . As a result we frequently numbered fifty or sixty white men all told , about half being non-officials . One did not meet all these Europeans for only the more senior members of the business community came to the Recreation Club to play golf or tennis , the junior commercial men in most cases being left to their resources . I was never able to ascertain why such a state of affairs existed . The Recreation Club was intended primarily for Government officials , and other Europeans were allowed to join as honorary members . Occasionally one found a commercial assistant playing at c Club and was thus able to invite him to have a drink at one 's bungalow . But it is credible , I think , that the agents ( i.e. the local heads of the commercial firms ) were the main responsible , and that some of them deemed undesirable to meet an assistant save in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of affairs was at one saw many of the European residents only on occasions as a race meeting , or a European funeral . There was nothing in the shape of a social club . Once advent of darkness put an end to polo , tennis and golf , hing remained but to seek one 's bungalow or to accept y pi offered invitation . It was the fashion for a man to Certain his friends by having a table and chairs placed the gravel patch which seemed to stand in front of ry bungalow . This arrangement allowed of drinks g nerved and consumed in cooler surroundings than obtainable in the average wood and iron bungalow . was on one of these occasions that the conversation turned to dental experiences . When it came to the turn OneScotsman he said , very seriously : " I paid thirty owl for this set just before I left Scotland ; and that 's of money to spend on yer mooth . " True that mosquitoes and sand-flies were almost as persistent as they I25 A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wise enough to don mosquito boots and to protect his arms , and nothing further could be done to keep these concomitants of the tropics at a distance . Another local fashion was to serve " small chop " with the drinks ; this took the form of small pieces of bread or toast covered with some sort of meat or fish paste or bearing small pieces of sardine . Much conservatism was shown in the matter of drinking , as one commenced with a whisky and soda , followed by perhaps a second , and then one or more gins and bitters . I must say that I saw no excessive drinking before dinner , and I am inclined to think that this system of public drinking , the facts that parties were often large and a great deal of conversation was indulged in were responsible for the moderation . True that a guest night at the N.N. Regimental Mess , of which all civil officials were made honorary members ? once they had left cards on the Mess ? was not invariably a teetotal affair as the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild scenes one was accustomed to in the early days in Nairobi . Lokoja was certainly a jolly little station . And it was as well that men were so sociable , for otherwise life would have been very dull , since the routine did not vary greatly year in year out . Work , games and a periodical race meeting , and one 's leave constituted the cycle of existence . Much as I liked West Africa , I must admit the truth of a remark made to me by an old coaster , that were it not for the good fellows one met and the frequent leave , life would have been insupportable . Leave was undoubtedly ever present in most people 's thoughts . A well-known writer who came out to Northern Nigeria whilst I was serving there recorded in a book which he wrote later that the officials " ticked off " the weeks of their tour of service . I26 A TRANSFER TO WEST AFRICA Ile was not altogether correct , for the men counted the clays , not the weeks . One friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of his quinine tabloids . I should explain that regulations required every official to take five grains of quinine daily , and my friend knew , of course , of how many tabloids his total stock consisted . I found that my official work in Northern Nigeria was very different from that in East Africa or Uganda . In Nigeria there were , for example , no Indians working at various callings , and remitting many hundreds of thousands of rupees to India every year . And in lieu of the few illiterate or semi-literate natives in East Africa and Uganda , one found in Nigeria many educated local natives , including the so-called non-native African clerks who came mainly from Southern Nigeria , the Gold Coast and Sierra Leone , who made relatively good use of the post Office and its various services . For one thing they were mostly keen on European clothing , and little in that ay being obtainable at the local stores , they had perforce have recourse to the illustrated catalogues sent out by ail-order houses in England , and dispatch money orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in great quest , but generally speaking , apart from the business ' acted by Europeans , little use was made of the Post e and its various services . However , it was necessary administrative purposes to maintain a fairly widereaching mail and telegraph system so that it did not invoIve a great deal of further organization to maintain auxiliary services as money order , postal order and parcel post . The telegraph service , in particular , was absolutely essential in a country where away from the limited railway service , communication could only be effected by means of mail-runners . To exemplify this , I // may mention that in the case of a place named Maiduguri it took over two months from Lokoj a to obtain a reply to a letter by post . The result was , of course , that a great volume of official business had to be transacted by telegraph that in a European country could quite efficiently be dealt with through the medium of the post . Recently , I read that Maiduguri is one of the ports on the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had to wait nearly three months for letters posted in England will shortly be receiving such letters in about a fortnight at the most . LIFE IN LOKOJA ? continued Living in Lokoja was fairly cheap , although , as already mentioned , one had to take out a large stock of provisions from home . Certainly the local market had not much to offer the European in the way of variety . Fowls were eightpence each , this being the price named by the Cantonment Magistrate , who was authorized by law to fix prices for foodstuffs ; eggs were similarly low priced , as was also fish . Vegetables were not of wide range of variety , yams , pumpkins , tomatoes , spinach , and occasionally onions , brought from the north , being the customary supply . Potatoes one never saw unless some plutocrat brought a crate from the ocean steamer . Fruit consisted usually of bananas and papaw , and only occasionally could one obtain oranges and pineapples from a distance . Certainly there was nothing of the quality and great variety one was accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , very much on tinned food , and especially when travelling . Office hours for Government officials were rather // unusual . 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. , when one returned to the bungalow for breakfast , and resuming at to a.m. remained until 2 p.m . Personally , I disliked these hours , for whilst it is no hardship in the tropics to commence work at 7 a.m. , one could not get one 's midday meal until 2. t o p.m. or even later . After that most people , I think , indulged in a siesta , and after afternoon tea proceeded to the tennis-court , golf-links or polo-ground about 4.45 p.m. in order to make the best possible use of the few remaining hours of daylight , for by 6.3o p.m. it was too late to play any games . The commercial community did not observe the foregoing hours , commencing soon after 6 a.m. and devoting 12 noon to 2 p.m. to their lunch and siesta , resuming work thereafter until 5 p.m. or even later . My work being connected with the mail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2 p.m. , and I had frequently to visit the office during the evening . In any case telegraph messengers pursued me as they did all other officials until a late hour ; and often when sitting on my verandah in a deck-chair , during the interval between lunch and tea , my brief excursions into the land of nod were checked by the arrival of a messenger who was probably bearing teleants that required immediate attention . On the other hand , however , it might well be the case that after looking through the batch tendered for inspection I discovered that there was no telegram for me , and that , accordingly , had been aroused from slumber to no purpose . Often , too , one was disturbed by a messenger bearing particular addressed to representatives of Government Departments and requiring to be initialed by them , which possibly slid not concern in any way the department with *hit It I was connected , or a takarda , i.e. letter , for the in the adjoining bungalow . Since neither the mes-I29 I A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no use attributing any blame to them for unnecessarily disturbing one : it was merely a case of " grinning and bearing it . " All these disturbances , I should add , were effected in what was almost a gentlemanly fashion ; the messenger or the house-boy usually stood at a respectful distance and coughed gently until the sufferer was sufficiently aroused to be approached . Some messengers when approaching the sleeper accompanied by a houseboy found that a somewhat loud conversation as to whether the Bature ( i.e. European ) was ya kwana ( i.e. sleeping ) or no usually did the trick . Another frequent visitor to the bungalow who knew that the afternoons were the time to find the Bature in , even if he were not disposed to do business , was the itinerant Hausa trader . Ile brought various kinds of curios , many of them being excellent and well suited to serve as presents when one went on leave . These men were generally smiling , plausible rogues with whom it was fairly easy to do business , although doubtless they invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade also consisted of roughly made daggers and other weapons of the kind which everyone takes home at the conclusion of his first tour and presents to relatives and friends , these articles almost invariably finding their way by easy stages to the lumber room or attic . Other articles were made of the leather which is prepared in Kano , dyed red and worked up in various patterns , most of them geometrical . From this leather is made handbags of various sizes , cushion covers and similar articles . One merit they certainly had and that was strength . Various-sized cloths made from locally grown cotton and dyed with crude colours were always useful , both in the bungalow and at home . Sometimes the Hausa brought crude brass figures depicting // various activities of native life such as women preparing food , dancing , and men rowing boats . The marabout ( osprey ) feathers , then largely worn by ladies at home , could often be obtained from this source for a few pence per bunch . I recall one occasion when , not wanting to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should accept a very dilapidated sun umbrella I had in exchange for a specified number of bunches of these feathers . To my utter surprise he closed the deal hurriedly , thinking , presumably , that I might relent of my offer and increase my terms , thus leaving me in possession of an unlooked-for number of feathers . On one occasion a t rader came into my office , and ignoring my protest that it " was my busy day " proceeded to unload his stock-intrade . At the bottom of the basket was a small , somnolent crocodile , the jaws of which were secured by a piece of twine . The Hausa wanted " five shillings only . " I urgently requested that the reptile be removed forthwith . When a few days later I saw the same man I inquired after the poor crocodile , and learned that its young life had terminated . Another not unwelcome occasional caller at the bungalow was the greengrocer . This individual carried a small tray on his head which bore a limited selection of produce , mainly tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was a prison warder , and the greengrocer sometimes wore manacles , the stock-in-trade being the surplus produce from the prison garden . Always sad events in Africa are the funerals of Europeans . Death usually ensues with great suddenness . One may be advised early one morning that a man whom one knew was in hospital died an hour or so before , and that the funeral will take place either that morning or moon . Most senior Europeans , whether officials or 13t A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES traders , made a point of attending at the cemetery , where the service was a short one . It is trite to remark that death always evokes feelings of sadness , but even when one is not a relative and possibly hardly knew the deceased , one could not avoid reflecting on his death so suddenly , and so far from his kith and kin . In Northern Nigeria at this time , the practice was that in the event of a Government official dying , the Public Works Department supplied a coffin in respect of which his estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This always impressed me as being extremely mean , for surely a man dying on service could be buried free of charge . And the sum was , obviously , so nominal that it seemed unkind to his relatives that the item should so forcibly he brought to their notice . The law of the Protectorate did not permit alcoholic drink to be sold to natives . Non-natives , i.e. Africans who were not natives of Northern Nigeria , and who formed the bulk of the clerical staff in Government offices , could obtain one or two bottles of liquor if furnished with a permit signed by the head of their department or a senior official . On Saturdays , therefore , one was kept busy signing permits for " one bottle of gin , " " two bottles of gin , " or " one of Florida water , " according to the tastes and pockets of the men . Life in Lokoja has already been indicated as being somewhat slow . The arrival of the weekly mail steamer from the Coast provided a little welcome diversion . Dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rarely more than four ladies in the station , the European hospital usually having a matron and two sisters , whilst there was generally one married lady in the official section . A race-meeting was occasionally organized by the few men who owned ponies . Every European turned out on these // occasions and the amateur worked totalizator was well patronized . But obviously the meeting differed vastly from one at home , such excrescences as tipsters , bookmakers and pedlars being absent . Even a bar was not available since the formality of complying with the liquor laws would have been too troublesome . But the W.A.F.F. Mess usually brought their own drinks . The climate of Lokoja was , for the tropics , not too unpleasant . The rainfall was not so heavy as at stations in the Niger Delta , and the " rains " afforded a welcome relief from the hot sunny weather . But most welcome was the harmattan season , during which the fine dust came from the Sudan and remained suspended in the air so as to resemble a slight fog or haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun and so ensuring a spell of cool weather . In fact the early mornings were really cold and one appreciated one 's blankets during the early hours . This season had its drawbacks , for the ever-present fine dust sometimes affected one 's throat and nose ; whilst wooden articles such as the backs of hair-brushes and golfdubs frequently showed signs of material shrinking . I even found it advisable to keep my wooden golf-clubs in water during the prevalence of the harmattan . The rainy season was usually ushered in by a series of tornadoes which seemed to find their way down the Benue River to Lokoja . These frequently arrived at night and disturbed one 's sleep . I must explain that , for the greater part of the year , one could be sure of more or less uninterrupted rest . On each verandah was erected a mosquitoproof structure which was large enough to contain a single red and a table . Coolness was thus secured . But the advent of a tornado meant that one had hurriedly to rise , roll up one 's mattress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush from the mosquito-proof house // to the interior of the bungalow . Haste was necessary , for almost immediately the rain , propelled by the high wind , fell at such an angle that anyone remaining in the mosquito-proof house would have been soaked . The remainder of the night had to be spent on the camp-bed which had been made up in the bedroom in readiness for such happenings . INSECTS AND REPTILES The " rains " brought about an increase in the insect population with inconvenient results to the Europeans . As soon as night fell and the oil lamps were lit , a procession consisting of scores , occasionally hundreds , of various winged creatures began to wend its way into the bungalow . To mention a few specimens ? flying ants of more than one species , large moths , grasshoppers , some three or four inches long , uncanny-looking praying mantises , beetles of various shapes , and fearsome black-winged insects which seemed to be a kind of cricket since they make a similar noise and jump surprisingly long distances . The huge grasshoppers leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ china resound , and , when banished from the table to the floor , such was their energy that they promptly proceeded to hurl themselves against the nearest wall . This performance was perhaps a game of sorts , but to the human onlooker it had the appearance of being an attempt at self-destruction . The crickets , and a particularly loathsome , evil-smelling insect , triangular in shape and green in colour , commence , with the tablecloth as their arena , to test their powers of jumping long distances and , since they are not as a rule particularly attracted by the lamp , seldom meet // with any accident , unless they fall into the soup or into the hands , or rather under the fingers , of an infuriated diner . Many of the flying ants dashed themselves blindly against the nearest lamp and , falling perchance on to the metalwork , which was smeared with kerosene , struggled wildly . If they succeeded , it was only at the cost of losing their wings and becoming metamorphosed creatures . Eventually they fell to the table where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legs . In no wise daunted , they carried on as though seeking their missing wings or some explanation from their fellow creatures as to " What happened . " Some insects contrived to fall into any dish of food that happened to be handy , preference , however , being given to soup or liquid in glasses . Another insect ? an ant probably ? which was furnished with an arrangement of pincers , similar to that carried by the earwig , usually contrived to land on the neck of one of the diners and to cause not a little irritation both physical and mental . Specimens of the praying mantis strolled about wearing a look both inquisitive and puzzled , and so far from annoying almost induced one to inquire whether anything had been lost and , if so , what . At last , worn out by the unequal struggle , one usually retreated to the mosquito-proof structure which , as already explained , stood on every verandah , and contained a bed . But the insects followed the lamp one used for reading in bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of life in one way or another , the sight of the dead bodies being swept up reminding one of those lines Tennyson : So careful of the type she seems , So careless of the single life . ' 35 A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES Another frequent visitor to the bungalow was a sort of wasp or , more probably , a hornet . Hearing a peculiar noise one day , I investigated and found that some of these creatures had already built a small nest under my dining table . It was one of those delicately constructed affairs that are not affixed to a wall but suspended , in some wonderful way , by means of what is not much thicker than a piece of twine . This particular nest was in dangerous proximity to the side of the table on which I usually sat , and hence I was not slow in removing it . Another source of annoyance was a kind of cockroach which was especially fond of gnawing the outer cover of books , preferably one 's favourite authors . It had also a habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mind the lizards which " roosted " on the sides and the top of the mosquito-proof shelter , and occasionally created a mild commotion by changing their sleeping place , or falling to the ground . Whilst reading in bed one night my attention was attracted by the noise made by a larger animal and , looking up , I saw a rat running up and down the netting and chasing the poor lizards . Two species of lizards haunted my bungalow . One kind , a dirty yellow in colour and almost translucent , were active only after nightfall when they crawled about the walls and ceiling in pursuit of moths , flies and , I imagined , mosquitoes . They were doing useful work and I never interfered with them , although , in view of their translucency , they did not look very prepossessing . The native servants always gave them a wide berth , asserting that their bite was poisonous . Another kind were in evidence during the day , dividing their time between the verandah of the bungalow and the compound . This lizard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world as though the colouring were artificial , and had been applied by some mischievous boy who , catching a lizard , and being armed with several pots of paint of various colours , had painted the poor reptile in sections , had contrived to apply a different colour to no less than three sections of the tail alone , and had treated the body and head in a similar manner . The result was , as may be imagined , decidedly weird , and looked almost unnatural . These lizards were greatly addicted to fighting , for which purpose they used their tails . These were really formidable weapons as they were capable of doing a deal of damage , that is to a lizard , although the tail frequently dropped off as a result of being so used . These fights always impressed me as being very savage in character , and whilst I used to admire the skilful ways in which a lizard would manoeuvre for position in order to get in an effective blow , I was frequently sickened by the force of the blows and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cantonment . I do not think that I saw more than two or three during the time I lived in Lokoja . Leaving the bungalow one morning , I noticed what seemed to be a snake lying near the gate . I stooped to pick up a stone to use as a weapon of offence , but by the time I had recommenced my way to the gate the reptile had taken alarm and was gone by the time I neared the place . Larger animals one never saw , although there must have been some small buck in the grasslands and bush outside the township . Hyenas were always to be heard at night , but these creatures are notoriously addicted to keeping out of the way of man . Although I must have heard their unmistakable cry night after night during the many years I lived in East and West Africa , I never once caught // a glimpse of one of these horrible-looking animals ? save in the London Zoo . MATTERS FINANCIAL The money then current in Northern Nigeria was rather troublesome . The British coinage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a florin . Consequently the paying out or receipt of fairly large sums of money involved a deal of counting , even when paying wages to natives . I remember complaining in this regard in the presence of an elderly man who promptly told me that a few years before the average coin available was not of higher value than a threepenny piece ! Together with the Cantonment Magistrate I held a key to the local strong-room , so that whenever the local Treasurer wished to withdraw or place specie in the vault the three of us had to be present . I still have painful memories of the morning when a consignment of farthings , some in broken bags , arrived from an outstation . On one occasion I was proceeding up the Niger when at the eleventh hour the local Treasury officer informed me that he had specie to the value of JJ i o , 000 consigned to the Chief Accountant of the railway at Baro , some ninety miles away . The regulations required that this should be taken charge of by a European official , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suffering from malaria at the time and scarcely able to crawl . I , of course , duly checked the number of boxes and the seals before giving the Treasury a discharge for the specie , and saw the boxes placed on the steamer . I then retreated to my cabin and camp-bed , leaving a corporal and a file // of armed police to act as an armed guard . Half-way to our destination the stern-wheeler ran aground on a sandbank . Fortunately another Government steamer came along about an hour later , and after consultation with the Marine Superintendent , who happened to be aboard , it was decided that the four or five Europeans aboard the stranded steamer should tranship to the new arrival . I was hardly able to stand , but leaving the transfer of my personal kit to my native servants , I supervised to the best of my ability the removal of the ? io , 000 , hoping and praying that no box would drop into the river . As a result of my extra task I then found that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should have to finish the voyage on deck ! We reached our destination about 4 p.m. and I promptly sent a note to the representative of the railway , begging him to come and take delivery of his specie as early as possible as I was due to leave by train at to p.m . Later came a reply that the official was playing golf and would be down at the ship in good time next morning . By this time I was feeling even worse , and the poor corporal was begging permission to go and obtain some food . Off went another note and eventually I disposed of my wretched specie as the darkness closed in . LEAVE AGAIN As I have indicated before , life in Lokoja , although not unpleasant , was certainly on the monotonous side . Hence it was indeed a great day when , one 's leave being sanctioned , one was able to embark in the weekly sternwheeler at Lokoja , and after about three days ' journey down the Niger ? assuming that one was lucky and did // not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? one was able on arrival at the Coast to embark on the homeward-bound ocean steamer . The river voyage was usually enjoyable since one had got away from the daily routine followed for at least twelve months without intermission , and the prospect was in every respect pleasurable . Moreover , one had the consciousness of having completed a tour ; had accumulated ? usually ? a bank balance ; and there was the attraction in the very near future of meeting one 's relatives and friends again , and enjoying the manifold pleasures of England . As to the bank balance , a friend used to define the situation as follows : " One goes home all money and no clothes and returns all clothes and no money . " Certainly after one 's wardrobe had been exposed for at least twelve months to the ravages of native servants , insects , climate generally , and the local laundryman , it was limited in numbers , but numerous as regards holes and tears . Hence there was usually a hurried descent to the shop of the ship 's barber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , no one really cared about shabby clothes provided that they were clean , although those were the days when we did observe some conventionalities , even in the Red Sea and off the coast of West Africa . Unless playing deck games such as cricket , we never dreamed of appearing without a collar and tie . I remember one case though in which a " soldier man " had nothing left for day wear after a lengthy tour but one or two elderly khaki suits ; these aroused the scorn of one or two commercial magnates who , apparently , had not had so strenuous a tour , and who were heard to make some scathing comments . Hence the word was passed on to the other soldier men on board and the civil officials , and for the next few days all duly appeared in the day-time wearing their oldest khaki . // In these days of cruising when the constant wearing of bathing-suits and the dispensing with coats seem to be de rigueur , the mention of collars and ties will probably cause a hoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other manners , I suppose . I remember one incident on a German steamer which became almost of international importance . Some British civilians returning to East Africa one morning on deck during the heat of the Red Sea doffed their coats and loosened their collars . Later , as the lunch hour drew near , one bold spirit suggested going into the saloon in this deshabille . No sooner said than done . An agitated steward begged them to resume their coats but without success . Then came the Captain in person who simply said , " Put on your coats or- you will get no lunch . " The order was obeyed , and the Captain threatened to report the matter through the proper channels . I may add that the consensus of opinion of the British passengers was with the Captain . One 's homeward voyage was characterized by much innocent enjoyment . For one thing , the attitude of the homeward-bound passenger , accustomed , for example , to Northern Nigeria fare for twelve months or longer , toward the cuisine was different from that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Going home these men will eat anything , but coming out they are not satisfied with beef or mutton but want game and caviare . " Needless to say the bar was an attraction , for it was some days before real ice ceased to be a novelty after months of lukewarm drinks . We had no ice in Lokoja . One 's home leave commenced as soon as the boat reached Plymouth . In this connexion a story is told that many years ago the leave regulations were to the effect that leave commenced on the date on which an officer // reached the first port of call in England . A homewardbound steamer went ashore off the coast of Cornwall , and the passengers were drawn up the cliff by the coastguard . One hopeful failed to report his arrival to the Colonial Office . At last he was communicated with and asked to explain . He stated that he was unable to comply with the regulations as he had not yet reached any port of call ! He had to be granted an extension of leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave quickly passed by and , " all clothes and no money , " as my friend has put it , one rather sadly embarked on the West African liner at Liverpool , where the wonderful lunch already described was duly displayed . CRIME AND BUSH LIFE Another tour at Lokoja proved much the same as before , save that instead of spending a complete year entirely within the limits of the cantonment I was so fortunate as to be able to leave Lokoja on some special duty on two occasions . One mission proved very interesting , and even amusing in some respects . I received information that the African Postmaster at Egori , a small station lower down the river , had , contrary to regulations , quitted his office without leave and paid a visit to a village situate within the borders of Southern Nigeria . This constituted an offence under the Post Office Ordinance , and I was instructed to investigate and , if necessary , institute criminal proceedings . My inquiry took me into Southern Nigeria , where I had to get into touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , it was alleged , the accused had gone . I questioned , through the medium of // an interpreter , many witnesses , and in one or two instances obtained sworn statements in writing . The Political Officer , in his capacity as a magistrate , administered the oath , and the men , being pagans , they were sworn not on a New Testament but on a gun . This method aroused my curiosity and I tried to get further information on the point , but without success . In due course the Postmaster was arrested and charged before the Political Officer for the particular district of Northern Nigeria which was concerned . The " Political " was away from his headquarters , and so the trial took place on the verandah of the rest-house where he and I were staying . He had some official business to attend to at Lokoja , and was awaiting the weekly steamer which was due to pass the station in which we were at any hour . The proceedings were in full swing when suddenly the messenger who was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here comes the boat " ) . Both the Political and I rushed away to attend to the loading of our kit on the steamer , which left as soon as this was completed . Fortunately , we discovered later that the police orderly had brought the prisoner . The Political and I duly dined and , after some conversation , retired for the night . Next morning we arose and as soon as breakfast was disposed of , the Political suggested that as we were not due at Lokoja for three or four hours we might save time by getting on with the trial as all the witnesses were on board . So the interpreter was sent to summon the accused from the lower deck , but returned with a message to the effect that " Mr. could not come as he was drinking tea . " The dignity of the law asserted itself , of course , and the tea drinking had to be postponed . The trial had not been concluded when we arrived at Lokuja . It was resumed next morning in my office , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different place , one being the deck of the river steamer . The accused was found guilty and fined L6o . Some weeks later I learned that the verdict had been quashed on a technical point . I must say that I rather sympathized with the accused throughout , but had to do my duty . It transpired in court that he had walked about four miles over the border to get a drink . Not many persons can say they have had such an expensive one . Egori was a very small station but pleasantly situated on the Niger , and I was always glad when any official duty took me there . One day whilst sitting in the rest-house talking to the Political Officer in whose district it was situate . I made some remark about the beauty of the view over the Niger . He then told me of a chief living only about ten miles away who had not seen the river for nearly twenty years . It seems that on the occasion of his last visit there was some little trouble in the locality and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the chief watched a shell suddenly burst near him , and when he looked around two of his wives were missing , having been blown to pieces . He added that he could not risk losing any more wives in this way so had since avoided the river as being unhealthy . A NIGERIAN COUNTRYSIDE In the course of the investigation described in the preceding section , I had to cover many miles . One day I had to walk about four miles to the place where the offence had been committed . My route ran roughly parallel with the Niger . The elephant grass was in many places twelve or more feet high , and completely hemmed // one in so that progress at times was difficult . The tall grass dashed itself against one 's face , and the grass seeds irritated and inflamed one 's skin ; to add to the discomfort the path was extremely rough . I was not sorry when , after covering about three miles , the country became more or less open owing to cultivation . The native agriculturists were , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Americanese , peanuts ) , cassava , yams and the tall graceful guinea corn , the latter occasionally attaining a height of eleven or twelve feet . Here and there one noticed a portion of gourd placed by the side of the path , in which was perhaps a head or t wo of maize , a snail shell or two and a few cowries . These , I was informed , were intended as an offering to the spirits of persons who had died on that spot as a result of drink ing an infusion of preparation of sasswood . It should be explained that amongst the Kukuruku ? a tribe inhabiting t hat district ? the drinking of sasswood constitutes a trial by ordeal in the case of persons suspected of witchcraft . The underlying idea , of course , is that the wizards and witches die . The offerings referred to are made in the belief that , even after death , the witch or wizard has power to work evil and so should be propitiated . Another feature of the landscape consisted of ant-hills made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and reminded me of the pinnacles on some old cathedral in Europe . These hills are the nest of the socalled white ant which is actually a termite ; this dreads the light of the day , and if the nest is broken so as to expose the interior a breakdown gang is rushed up to the spot . If one passes that way again within the next hour he will probably find that the gap has already been repaired , or almost so . Later I emerged on to a good wide road made of red // A COLONIAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL 'S REMINISCENCES earth . Along this road came , on market days , natives from the interior bringing various goods , chiefly palm kernels , for sale or exchange . Some of these loads weighed not less than eighty or ninety pounds ; and had , I learned , been carried on men 's ( or women 's ) heads for perhaps three or four days . On account of the weight it was difficult for the carrier to lift his burden , unaided , from the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait on those occasions , he carried a short pole and when he wished to rest selected a suitable forked tree , and placing therein one end of his load ? which is carried on a bamboo framework ? supported the other end by means of his pole . Being by this time hot , tired and thirsty after my long tramp , I went to a small mission which was situated close by knowing that I should be able to rest and obtain something to drink . I found the Father in charge living in a room just sufficiently large to accommodate a narrow wooden bed , a small table and one or two boxes . The roof was composed of one or two sheets of corrugated iron , and on one side the mud wall did not meet the roof , thus leaving a gap through which the sun and at times the rain came in . Indeed the Father laughingly drew my attention to his scanty stock of coffee , which was kept in a plate and had been spoiled by the rain . He added that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke . He offered me some vin ordinaire and biscuits and cheese , adding later that the boy was cooking some yam . He said he was sorry that , having no filter , he could not offer me filtered water , and that he invariably drank Niger water au naturel. // MISCELLANEOUS HAPPENINGS In June of 1911 the Governor of Northern Nigeria held a durbar at Zaria in connexion with the Coronation of His Majesty King George . It was apparently desired that many European officials should attend the ceremony , so I applied for and obtained leave to go . This was my first opportunity of seeing something of one of the Hausa States , so I looked forward with interest to going so far north . I had to travel once more by way of the Niger to Baro from whence the railway ran to Zaria and then to Kano . It was an unusual experience in Northern Nigeria to be travelling by train during the hours of darkness , as we were on this occasion , and , of course , all kinds of incidents might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retired for the night . I should explain that the passenger coaches were then of a type which allowed of each first-class passenger having a small compartment to himself . No seats were provided , but it was more convenient to use one 's campchair during the day and as indicated a camp-bed when required . At the end of the coach was a small kitchen ao that one 's cook could boil water or even cook a modest meal as the train proceeded . The country through which we passed next day was not very inviting and very sparsely populated , for the only signs of human beings were to be seen at the stations which we passed . Kaduna Junction was reached In the evening , and here we remained until next morning . Kaduna has since become the headquarters of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Northern Province whose here includes the whole of what used to be Northern Nigeria . At this time it was quite an unimportant place . // Zaria was reached about i p.m. next day . Numbers of civil and military officials had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europeans had not previously been gathered together in local history . Government House was not large , so the house-party was not a large one . One wondered how the Resident and his staff contrived to accommodate all the visitors , and that , so far as I could judge , with no overcrowding ; for there seemed to be quite a number of mud huts capable of sheltering one or more Europeans . Arrangements had been made for the messing of all officials other than those staying at Government House or the local W.A.F. Mess . As a result between thirty and forty men were fed in a large thatched mud building . The service was on the whole satisfactory . Every man brought his personal servant with him to assist with the waiting at table . One inconvenience arising from this arrangement was that these boys naturally concentrated on their masters , so that one 's meal depended largely upon what dishes one 's own servant could grasp . However , everyone appreciated the difficulties , and since time was no object no one minded waiting , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various ceremonies lasted for a week . One day took place a reception by the Governor . This was a successful affair , save that such demands were made on the champagne that the supply was exhausted long ere the last guest left . In the evening there was a display of fireworks which delighted the spectators , both Europeans and natives . The reception of the Emirs was rather impressive , as each Emir was accompanied by a staff which varied according to his rank . In view of the varying importance of the emirates , some difficult questions must have arisen // as to accommodation . Here again the political staff must have put in a great deal of good staff work . I was particularly impressed by the coats of chain armour worn by some of the native horsemen from the north . This armour had no doubt originally been worn by Crusaders , possibly stripped from their dead or live bodies , and had found its way across Central Africa to Northern Nigeria . I was given to understand that these coats were greatly prized and treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mounted Infantry who galloped past at a speed and in such close formation that one anticipated as inevitable that some horse would stumble and bring down several others . However , nothing of the kind happened . On another day we all proceeded on a tour of inspection of the native town . The walls of such buildings as the mosque and native treasury which were constructed of mud were of extraordinary thickness , and seemed to be calculated in that dry climate to stand up for another century at least . The Governor was met by the local Emir and duly conducted on a tour of inspection . Amongst the entourage of the latter was the Court Jester who from time to time made jokes in Hausa which were received with shrieks of laughter by the natives standing near . I suspect that not many would have been suitable for reproduction in Punch unless considerably bowdlerized . I was impressed by the jester 's huge mouth and stentorian voice and wondered whether this was produced by the exercise of his profession . // MISSIONARIES IN NORTHERN NIGERIA The missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Nigeria , save that none of the Christian missionaries were then allowed to work at Kano or Sokoto . Mohammedanism is very strong in those centres , and the British Government feared that trouble would occur if either the Catholic or the Protestant Mission Societies were allowed to commence operations . I believe though that this prohibition has been withdrawn . Doubtless the advent of the railway , the influx of natives from Lagos and other parts of the country , and the increase in trade consequent on the activities of more and more European traders have . materially changed conditions in the north . At Lokoja the small Catholic community was looked after by the Fathers of the Society of African Missions whose local headquarters were at Asaba , at which place resided their Vicar-Apostolic . As the European headquarters of the Society were at Lyons , a large proportion of the priests were Frenchmen , whilst the balance was made up of Alsatians and Italians . The Vicar-Apostolic at that time was an Italian . Being an attendant at their church , I was a frequent visitor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Fathers who came from Alsace and Lorraine . Those territories were then under the sway of Germany , and I listened to many accounts of petty persecution by the Germans . But when I returned to Nigeria in 1924 , at the time the Alsatians were complaining that the French Government were interfering with their churches and schools , I spoke to an elderly priest who came from Alsace and inquired what he thought of the new regime . " Ah , " he Is0
