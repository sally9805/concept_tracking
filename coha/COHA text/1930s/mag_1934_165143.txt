In little Bardstown , Ky. ( pop. : 1,767 ) last week a local legend was proudly celebrated as a national fact . Kentucky 's rotund Senator Logan made a speech and ladies dressed in crinolines tittered and played hostess in " Federal Hill , " the old home of Judge John Rowan . Bardstown believers were commemorating the birthday of a Rowan relation , Songwriter Stephen Collins Foster . <P> Bardstown believes that Stephen Foster drew inspiration for famed " My Old Kentucky Home " from " Federal Hill . " Some Kentuckians further claim he actually composed it on the spot , during a visit in 1852 . John Tasker Howard , Foster 's latest , most authoritative biographer ( Stephen Foster , America 's Troubadour : TIME , Jan. 22 , 1933 ) doubts the story . He thinks it unlikely that Stephen Foster visited Bardstown later than the 1840 's , points out that the original title of the song was " Poor Uncle Tom , Good Night , " that " Uncle Tom " was the song 's hero , not ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no wise dampened Bardstown 's celebration of Stephen Foster as a local hero . <P> Bardstown loves its legends and of these the Foster story is by no means the dearest . That story concerns Louis Philippe , King of France and his gifts to St. Joseph 's Roman Catholic Proto-Cathedral in Bardstown . Rich indeed were Louis Philippe 's gifts , if indeed he gave Bardstown a Murillo Virgin , three van Dycks , two van Eycks , a Rubens . If the collection is authentic , it would easily fetch $1,000,000 . <P> Louis Philippe was born 16 years before the Revolution in which his godparents , Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette , lost their heads . The guillotining of his father made Louis Philippe the Orleanist pretender to the throne . When the Government promised to release his imprisoned mother and two brothers if he would go to the U. S. he sailed for Philadelphia in 1796 . <P> He may once have visited Bardstown where it is reported he spent one colic-racked day in bed . But his first meeting with Father Joseph Flaget probably took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to return to France . Havana 's French colony got together 14,000 francs and Father Flaget made the presentation ; Louis Philippe thanked him and sailed away in 1800 . <P> A few years later Bardstown became the seat of a Catholic diocese which included Kentucky and Tennessee . Father Flaget , as Bishop , consecrated there the first Catholic Cathedral west of the Alleghenies . Corinthian columns were hewn from nearby forests and the interior was done in rich walnut . <P> Shortly after the Cathedral was dedicated ( 1819 ) , Bishop Flaget sent three young priests to Europe to buy " church furniture . " Father Nerinck bought 100 pictures . Father Badin bought 40 . There are no records to show whether their purchases reached Kentucky . <P> In 1830 Louis Philippe became " citizen king " of France . Some time between his marriage in 1807 and his flight in 1848. so Bardstown believes , Louis Philippe sent to St. Joseph 's Cathedral a Murillo , three van Dycks , two van Eycks , a Rubens .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
