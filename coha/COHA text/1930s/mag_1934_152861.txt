Famed is New York Central 's advertising slogan : The Water Level Route-You Can Sleep . The implication is that passengers on the Pennsylvania , New York Central 's great rival , are kept awake as their trains chuff up and over the Alleghenies to Pittsburgh and Chicago . The same implication , to a lesser degree , works against Baltimore &; Ohio whose line roughly follows that of the Pennsylvania through the mountains . Last week B. &; O. made a move to take itself out of the shadow of the New York Central 's advertising . <P> Through a deal with New York Central 's Pittsburgh &; Lake Erie Railroad , 22 B. &; O. trains between Washington and Chicago began using P. &; L. E. trackage between West Pittsburgh and McKeesport as a short cut through the Pittsburgh gateway . Besides reducing running time from 20 to 45 minutes , the change will result in large savings in the operation of heavy freight trains , since the P. &; L. E. tracks in the Pittsburgh area do not have the heavy grades met on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trackage deal were B. &; O. and New York Central linked last week . In Trenton , N. J. a Federal Grand Jury indicted both companies , along with Lehigh Valley , for granting illegal concessions to shippers by reducing storage and insurance charges to less than cost .
