Most people in West Palm Beach , Fla. , thought George W. Moore was a bootlegger . They had seen a truck backing up to his home , unloading bottles . Four U. S. Prohibition agents , with a search warrant from a U. S. commissioner , went to Moore 's house one evening last week . Two approached the front door , two the rear . The search warrant was exhibited . From behind closed doors buckshot poured into the warm darkness . <P> When Chief of Police Frank Matthews arrived , he had to argue with Moore for 20 minutes to put down his shotgun and accept arrest . On the front porch lay the dead body of Agent Robert Knox Moncure . Beneath it was the blood-stained warrant . In the kitchen lay the shot-riddled dying body of Agent F. R. Patterson . <P> Moore 's defense : The search warrant was invalid after dark . <P> Declared Prohibition Commissioner Doran who had sponsored Moncure into the Dry service : " It is a case of an irresponsible person , inflamed by derogatory remarks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all this criticism , blazing away . . . . Attacks on our personnel are , in part , responsible . . . . Agents Moncure and Patterson were shot down while performing their duty in a proper manner . " <P> Remarked Agent Moncure 's widow : " If Dry-voting , Wet-living Congressmen could be made to realize conditions as they are in the greatest war of all times . . . I 'd face my joyless future with calm resignation . "
