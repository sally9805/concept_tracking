txt Defective Burglar Alarms I would like to call attention to a particularly annoying form of sleep disturber  --  the defective burglar alarm . I live on Washington Heights , both sides of Broadway being lined with ; - stores . Every two or three weeks these . burglar alarms go off about 2 o'clock in the morning and ring all night , boring into sleep like a Chinese torture . I have made many complaints to the Police Department but without avail . These outside alarms seem to be particularly useless because the stores could be robbed many times over as nobody pays the slightest attention to them . Garbage trucks , auto horns , shooting affrays and fire trucks at least allow one to go to sleep after they pass , but this noise continues hour after hour , making further sleep impossible .
