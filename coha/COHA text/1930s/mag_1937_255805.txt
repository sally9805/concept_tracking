Of China 's 4,480,992 square miles , Japanese forces held : <P> This week : 613,000 Week ago : 600,000 Month ago : 540,000 Year ago : 500,000 <P> By last week an atmosphere of almost World War tenseness , anguish and sacrifice was spreading through China and Japan . The " Liberty Loan ' of $150,000,000 asked by the Nanking Government was well on its way over the top last week as the first official Chinese announcement said , $71.250,000 had already been subscribed . Tokyo was warming up for " Nationalspirit Mobilization Week " during which radio appeals and mass meetings all over Japan must soon sell $57,660,000 worth of 3% " China Incident Bonds " redeemable in eleven years . <P> Japanese editors last week taunted that wealthy Chinese have been slack in buying Liberty Bonds , caused tortoise-spectacled Chinese Loan Chairman T. V. Soong to retort : " The sale of our bonds is in pleasing contrast to the situation in Japan where ' China Incident ' Bonds are being forced down the throats of bankers whose portfolios are already overladen with Government bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accelerating the collapse of Japan 's economic currency structure .

Drawn window blinds concealed the most appalling cases , shattered men carried off as inert as logs wrapped in bandages . Other Japanese wounded , able to hobble about , returned home in white kimonos . All week in Tokyo wounded came in on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next platform , entered it through a triumphal arch inscribed " CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR SOLDIERS LEAVING FOR THE FRONT ! " <P> Chinese women meanwhile sacrificed for Liberty their wedding rings and gold trinkets at the behest of their Premier 's able wife , Radiorating Mme Chiang Kaishek . To the many earmarks , minute or mighty , of this Great War last week Shanghai actuaries added finally a careful estimate that property damage there already exceeds $750,000,000 . This is three times greater than the total of losses at Shanghai caused by Japan 's attack there in 1932 . <P> " 50,000 Japanese Trapped , " Japan 's first great objective is to seize all Chinese territory north of the Yellow River , and the crumpling of Chinese resistance there last fortnight was followed last week by drastic changes in the Chinese command , dictated by Generalissimo Chiang from Nanking . <P> The famed " Model Governor " of Shansi Province , General Yen Hsi-shan officially abdicated his command to General Huang                   @ @
