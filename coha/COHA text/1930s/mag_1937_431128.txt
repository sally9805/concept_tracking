I SHALL never forget the little journey I took , in company with a few others , around the grapefruit and orange groves in Florida . There was a man in the party who laid his complaints against everything and everybody all along the way . The driver of the bus , especially , was the butt of his sarcastic remarks . Just before the trip was concluded the driver stopped , climbed the fence , picked some oranges from the ground , and distributed them to the passengers . I was seated beside the driver , and when he climbed back to his place , he asked , " Did you see that fine big orange I gave to that man ? " " It was a beauty , " I remarked . " Well , " he continued , " it 's the sourest orange in Florida . That fellow has been crabbing at me , and I thought I 'd give him a bit of his own medicine . He 'll find it out when he attempts to eat it . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruit of hate . An old Egyptian sage by the name of Ptah Hotep said one time , " Live in a house of friendliness , and men will bring gifts to your door of themselves . " By the same token , if you live in a house of selfishness , men will pay you in your own coin . The parent who fails to teach the child the difference between having things and being a person who counts is laying the foundation for a life that will be a liability to its day and generation . You want your boy to make the most of himself . He has talent , and more than once you have let your eyes rest on him and said , " Yes , sir , Johnny is going to be a great man some day ! " The mother looks upon her young daughter and visualizes the day when she will meet her Prince Charming , make a home , bear children , and take her place among the world 's best women . But what are you putting into that boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have known for the past ten years . Every time I go to his home his mother tells me how he is getting on . She tells me about the high marks he gets in school , the medals he has won , the scholarship granted him , and how the 12 professors dote on him . She informs me that all the fraternities rushed him and that he has done exceptionally well in college society . I look for that young lad to be successful from the standpoint of money . He will likely get a good position , marry well , and when his parents die , he will come into a large inheritance . But Steve is selfish . His father and mother are selfish . They live for themselves , and the sun , moon , and stars must do obeisance to their son . Some day he is going to get what he thinks belongs to him even if he has to push others out of the way to get it . He is going to feel justified in pushing his stark individuality ruthlessly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in his way . He will accept no responsibility that will not further his own interest . He will put on a false front whenever he needs it to get by , and will be scrupulously watchful so that no false move will interfere with his personal comfort and pleasure . He will be a failure at life because he is keeping a lookout for himself . The other day a mother said to me : " I do n't think it was right for that company to distribute such a large bonus to the employees . I have stock in that concern , and it should have given a small share to the workers , and we stockholders should have come in for the larger dividends . " That is the thing which seems to be wrong with the world in this twentieth century . What disasters we have are largely the result of this every-man-for-himself policy . Daniel Webster said one time , " The best argument I know for religion is an old aunt up in the New Hampshire hills . " And the best argument I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count for something is the father and mother who are known by their children for their lives of unselfish devotion to some creative work . A selfish life never feels the sufferings of others ; never enlists the hearts of men against injustice ; never abandons itself in the service of love ; never knows the meaning of heroism ; and never makes itself indispensable to the ongoing creation . Parents have done a good job only when the lives of their children are seen by others as a reason for believing in and practicing the virtue of unselfishness.  |
