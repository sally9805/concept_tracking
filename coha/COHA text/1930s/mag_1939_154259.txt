One day last week British Broadcasting Corp . staged a unique and peculiarly British program , a broadcast strictly for dogs . This was the sort of thing decorous Director-General Sir John Reith might have forbidden in his time , but strait-laced Sir John was replaced last October by heartier Frederick Wolff Ogilvie . " Calling All Dogs " was announced as an experiment to find out just what broadcasting means to dogs . So British radio owners were asked to have their dogs listen in , and to report their dogs ' reactions to the broadcast . <P> What came over was a broadcast by trained dogs from a kennel at Worplesdon , run by a Mr. and Mrs. Robert Montgomery . The program called for the Montgomerys to put their dogs through a set of paces and commands considered generally familiar to most well-behaved British dogs . As an audience participating stunt , " Calling All Dogs " proved a yelping success . <P> " Rats ! " snapped Mr. Montgomery to his studio ratters , and ear-cocked terriers dashed excitedly to the chase in countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find it , " " Jump over the poker , " went more commands . Rattling food pans and garbage cans , the Montgomerys for a memorable 15 minutes had every listening dog in England in a dither . When a Montgomery Dalmatian greedily chewed up a dog biscuit before the microphone , dog-owners reported widespread mouth watering . When Montgomery fox terriers , Peter and Jock , got to growling , hackles rose the length and breadth of Britain . When Tippler , a tough Corgi , refused to " speak , " every obedient canine listener in Albion spoke up for him . <P> Britons who stayed tuned in after " Calling All Dogs " heard the Archbishop of Canterbury deliver a gloomy sermon , saying : " In the present condition of the disordered world , we are beholding judgment day . . . . In spite of all the hopes of progress , are these not signs of a return to the dark ages ? "
