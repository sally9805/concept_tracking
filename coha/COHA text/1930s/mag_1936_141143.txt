With 41 crates reportedly containing gold bars and Ethiopia 's well-worn old green Imperial treasure chest among his luggage , His Majesty Haile Selassie reached London last week bravely smiling and heavily perfumed . En route from Palestine he had been transferred from a British warship to a British liner , and the British Government insisted that his status was " strictly incognito . " <P> In London screaming red placards reading " WELCOME EMPEROR ! " had been pasted on delivery vans by Labor and Liberal newsorgans but , taking their cue from their Government , Conservative London papers did their best to ignore Haile Selassie , tucked news that he was coming into obscure squibs . Nevertheless , 5,000 unofficial welcomers rushed to Waterloo Station . Among them were Chinese , Hindus , Arabs and Negroes , cheek by jowl with English of every class , including pink-cheeked gentlemen in high silk hats and ladies , some of whom waved simultaneously the British and Ethiopian flags as the private Pullman car of Haile Selassie drew in . <P> Seated at a flower-decked table was His Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his children in well-tailored , tweedy sports clothes and flannels . Roared hearty British voices : " Welcome to the land of the free ! Hurrah for the one and only Emperor of Ethiopia ! Down with Mussolini ! " <P> Great efforts by the British League of Nations Union to coax down to the station the British Foreign Secretary , well-dressed Captain Anthony Eden , were rewarded to the extent that he sent his tactful private secretary , Mr. Oliver C. Harvey , who is always careful to dress somewhat badly . Rumpled Mr. Harvey slipped into the Pullman , spoke for a few minutes to Haile Selassie , then presented His Majesty to many an eminent , top-hatted friend of the League of Nations and of Ethiopia , including Economist Sir Walter Thomas Layton and Lord Allen of Hurtwood . They pressed upon His Majesty an engraved , though quite unofficial , scroll declaring : <P> " We lament that Ethiopia has suffered invasion . We , with thousands of people of Great Britain , express the hope that the day will soon dawn when Ethiopia will regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trusting in God , will continue to lead his people toward light and peace . " <P> Taking this scroll His Majesty cried : " God grant that it may be so ! ... I come to England confident that I will obtain justice here . . . . May the British Crown and the British people live forever ! " <P> After that , cheering never stopped as Haile Selassie , his children and his crates were whisked by limousine under guard of Scotland Yard detectives to a sumptuous , cream-yellow house facing Hyde Park at No. 5 Princes Gate , the home of the U. S. Ambassador being nearby at No. 14 . Alighting , His Majesty was met with shouts of " Say any old thing , Haile Selassie ! Hurrah for the Emperor ! Good Old Haile Selassie ! "
