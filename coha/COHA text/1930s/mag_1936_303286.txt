One misty morning in 1900 on a Cleveland golf course , a stoop-shouldered man of 60 , his bald head shining like a knob of burnished marble , smacked drive after drive off a tee . Seven caddies returned the balls , patted down little sand tees , scurried down the course as the man kept poling out drives like an automaton . Suddenly from another part of the fairway came a shrill cry of warning . Without hesitation the man dropped his club , scampered into a clump of nearby bushes . Few minutes later there came another cry . The man returned , resumed his work . <P> This description of John Davison Rockefeller Sr. at play 36 years ago was divulged last week by his onetime golf teacher , Joe Mitchell , now professional at the Lake Shore Country Club in Chicago . Oilman Rockefeller had taken up the game when his horseshoe-pitching arm went dead , wished to keep his preparations secret from Mrs. Rockefeller , who already played a respectable duffer 's game . Accordingly Instructor Mitchell was brought to the course every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange cries which occasionally sounded over the course came from guards posted to warn Mr. Rockefeller of his wife 's approach . That this elaborate deception worked was illustrated a few weeks later when Golfer Rockefeller strolled up to the tee where his wife was preparing to swing , casually remarking : " I think I 'll play with you this morning . It looks as if it might be a nice game . " Mrs. Rockefeller , amazed at the 160-yd. drive which her husband thereupon shot down the fairway , cooed : " John , I might have known it . You do things better and more easily than anyone else . " <P> From then on Mr. Rockefeller took the game seriously . Whenever he missed a putt he would practice until one ball plunked the bottom of the cup . He never walked around the course . As soon as he hit a shot , a caddy would bring him a bicycle . Tucking his feet on the handlebars he would have the caddy trundle him up the fairway . Unlike his friend Andrew Carnegie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely bowed his head at adversity clucked : " Shame , shame , shame . " <P> Joe Mitchell last week recalled that Golfer Rockefeller , a stickler for rules was slightly perturbed one day when his physician teed his ball a full foot in front of the markers . With painstaking care . Rockefeller teed his own ball exactly on a line with the red marker , dryly observed : " I always play the full course , Doctor . " Equally hateful of waste , he once drove a brand new ball into the rough , hunted it for ten minutes , finally asked his caddy what his cronies would do in a similar situation . The caddy retorted that they would look for a minute , then drop a new ball . " Huh ! " snorted Golfer Rockefeller . " They must have barrels of money . " <P> Now 96 , Golfer Rockefeller can indulge in his sport only when feeling particularly spry . ( He has not played this year . ) Donning earmuffs , he may pat a half dozen balls off the tee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His only regular exercise consists in puttering around his estate for 30 minutes each day , going for an occasional automobile ride . Yet he still remembers with glee the day he fooled Mrs. Rockefeller , sends Professional Mitchell a wire every year on his birthday . The last one read : " The old friends are best .
