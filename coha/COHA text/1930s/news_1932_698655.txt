txt Strict rationing of gasoline throughout Chile will commence immediately , under a special law passed by Congress and signed by President Montcro . The rations will be distributed under governmental supervision , gasoline having been decreed as an " article of emergency , " obtainable only by tickets issued by a special commission , already established , which will be directly responsible to the executive . The President stated today that Chileans admit this lax is of a sweeping character but it is dictated to prevent the egress of gold except when it is absolutely necessary . Chile is unable to sell her commodities abroad and therefore there is only a limited amount of foreign exchange available for imports . To abide by the gold standard the only policy is to live according to income . The " sweeping character " of the law is demonstrated by the fact that tickets are to be issued to consumers , according to the importance of their occupations Rations will be doled out according to the color of their tickets . Use of gasoline is granted preferentially to ambulances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport trucks , cars used exclusively for commerce , industry and agriculture , and government , diplomatic and other special cars . The operation of the law will cut the sales of gasoline at least in half and will permit them only for business or necessity , practically eliminating from the streets of Chilean cities all classes of passenger cars which are privately owned . The effect of the law will also be felt in automobile circles as it will further stifle the sale of cars and injure the already depressed tire industry .
