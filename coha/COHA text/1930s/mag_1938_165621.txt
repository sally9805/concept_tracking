In colonial days the typical U. S. teacher was a man . As late as 60 years ago two of every five U. S. public-school teachers were men . Then the proportion of masters to ma'ams dropped rapidly , until by 1930 more than five-sixths of the teachers were women , and many a critic cried that the nation 's children were apron-tethered . Last week New York City 's school system published some figures that pleased these critics . Driven into teaching from law , medicine and business by Depression , men now constitute nearly 18% of the city 's teaching staff , against 14% ten years ago . In the high schools , one of every two new teachers appointed is a man .
