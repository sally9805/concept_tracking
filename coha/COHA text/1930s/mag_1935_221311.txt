Precisely as extralegal and august as national cinema censorship in the U. S. is Britain 's Board of Film Censors , a body whose president is paid $10,000 a year by the British film industry . Last month the Board 's president , red-faced , intolerant Rt . Hon. Edward Shortt died . Last week the British cinema industry picked as president of the Board of Film Censors one of the most distinguished and worldly men in the realm , William George Tyrrell , Baron Tyrrell of Avon , holder of Britain 's No. 1 diplomatic job , the Ambassadorship to France , from 1928 to 1934 . Lord Tyrrell accepted the job because he needed the money . Lord Tyrrell knows the Continent like the palm of his hand , loves France and is distrusted by Germans . When he quit his Ambassadorship last year because of poor health , the Nazi newspaper Vlkischer Beobachter chortled , " His departure is a gain for the pacification of Europe and exorcises the baneful Versailles spirit he fostered . Lord Tyrrell was a man of yesterday who simply could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week , on being informed of his new job , Watchdog Tyrrell said : " I go to the pictures perhaps once , perhaps twice a week . . . . Why , I saw one last night-very good , too . I have no particular taste ; in fact I like most of them . There is a very good film at the Empire . Claudette Colbert in She Married Her Boss . " She Married Her Boss is a Columbia product , set off by a spoiled child and a drinking party in a store window . To Britons the important thing about it is that it projects " a kissless marriage , " i. e. , the hero and heroine do not sleep together . It is a fair index to British taste and British censorship . <P> The clue to British censorship is that it tries to keep people from thinking about what might upset them . About things normally censorable it is far more tolerant than Will H. Hays . The British Board of Film Censors objects to scenes showing mental disorders , the preliminaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscegenation , police brutality , lovable criminals , the Royal Family and the U.

Thus , it prevents British citizens from seeing anything that might make them dislike nations officially friendly to Britain . <P> From the March of Time newsreel about Palestine , the Board last month cut all scenes showing German Nazi persecution of Jews . The official explanation was that it had all happened some time before and it was unnecessary to remind people of it . From the March of Time newsreel about Ethiopia , the Board cut all evidences of British armed force , including naval guns , marching men and officers toasting the King . From the newsreel about France 's Fascist organization , the Croix de Feu , it cut all indications that the late Alexandre Stavisky was protected by grafting high officials and that the Paris riots of February 1934 , resulted in some killings .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
