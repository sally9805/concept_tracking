Squarejawed , square-shouldered Premier Edouard Daladier is always chiefly interested in defense and so are many other Frenchmen . Last week the Premier was under pressures amounting to attack on the French internal and also on the French external front . He resolutely prepared his defenses , and in doing so was assisted by the British Prime Minister in person , the first working trip to Paris by an incumbent of No. 10 Downing Street since the days of James Ramsay MacDonald , the Laborite apostle of the League who generally only sped through Paris on his way out to Geneva or home . It was two kinds of war : first , strife fomented in France by outraged labor leaders ; second , the next World War . Both wars Edouard Daladier discussed for as much as five hours without a break with Neville Chamberlain . <P> The two democratic chiefs , both of whom have been called " Fascists " by Communists , decided to defend their countries last week by : <P> 1 ) Increase of French military forces in Indo-China and building of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Far East strongholds of Democracy ; <P> 2 ) Approval of the Hitler-Daladier Peace Pact which complements the Hitler-Chamberlain Peace Pact ( TIME , Oct. 10 ) ; <P> 3 ) Purchase by France of 6,000 war planes , mostly in Canada on credits extended from London ; <P> 4 ) Unofficial expression by Neville Chamberlain of his resolve to persuade the House of Commons to vote national military conscription in the United Kingdom . <P> Any Frenchman would rather have a big British Army in existence than any other army , except the big French Army . The way in which things are looked at in France , even by the proletariat , made the defense moves taken in Paris last week important ( not necessarily decisive ) in the labor war which anti-Daladier zealots tried meanwhile to kindle , with some success . <P> General Strike . Apart from aliens , of whom there are in France on temporary permits or illegally over 3,000,000 persons ( i. e. , about 7% of all persons in France ) , French workers ran true to form last week . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws introduced by Premier Daladier ( with parliamentary authority previously voted and to be confirmed or withdrawn by Parliament ) mainly for one reason : they claimed , justly in the main , that on their face these laws impose sacrifices which bear more heavily upon Labor than upon Capital . The businessman 's side of the argument is , of course , that these laws are intended to redress some of the undue wealth-destroying laws which Labor won under the " New Deal " Cabinets of M. Lon Blum ( TIME , June 15 , 1936 , et seq . ) . <P> M. Blum is No. 1 politically in the French Left . No. 1 in a trade-unionist sense is M. Lon Jouhaux , General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor , with 5,000,000 enrolled trade unionists-many not French-whom he has to try to keep behind him . This William Green or John L. Lewis of France ( and neither cap quite fits Jouhaux ) is nearer to " Moscow " than is M. Blum . Earthy , cigar-chewing , big-eating Lon Jouhaux is out for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lon Blum is akin in spirit to the Roosevelt New Deal and is always advocating in his newspaper that Mr. Roosevelt do something or say something epochal .
