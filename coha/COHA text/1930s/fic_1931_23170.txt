MR . ARCULARIS A STORY BY CONRAD AIKEN M MR . ARCULARIS stood at the window of his room in the hos-pital and looked down at the street . There had been a light shower , which had patterned the sidewalks with large drops , but now again the sun was out , blue sky was showing here and there between the swift white clouds , a cold wind was blowing the poplar trees . An itinerant band had stopped before the building and was playing , with violin , harp , and flute , the finale of " Cavalleria Rusticana . " Leaning against the window-sill  --  for he felt extraordinarily weak after his operation  --  Mr. Arcularis suddenly , listening to the wretched music , felt like crying . He rested the palm of one hand against a cold window-pane and stared down at the old man who was blowing the flute , and blinked his eyes . It seemed absurd that he should be so weak , so emotional , so like a child  --  and especially now that everything was over at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , of his own dreadful certainty that he was going to die , here he was , as fit as a fiddle  --  but what a fiddle it was , so out of tune ! ? with a long life before him . And to begin with , a voyage to England ordered by the doctor . What could be more delightful ? Why should he feel sad about it and want to cry like a baby ? In a few minutes Harry would arrive with his car to take him to the wharf ; in an hour he would be on the sea , in two hours he would see the sunset behind him , where Boston had been , and his new life would be opening before him . It was many years since he had been abroad . June , the best of the year to come  --  England , France , the Rhine  --  how ridiculous that he should already be homesick ! There was a light footstep outside the door , a knock , the door opened , and Harry came in . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old bus actually got here . Are you ready ? Here , let me take your arm . You 're tottering like an octogenarian ! " Mr. Arcularis submitted gratefully , laughing , and they made the journey slowly along the bleak corridor and down the stairs to the entrance hall . Miss Hoyle , his nurse , was there , and the Matron , and the charming little assistant with freckles who had helped to prepare him for the operation . Miss Hoyle put out her hand . " Good-by , Mr. Arcularis , " she said , " and bon voyage . " " Good-by , Miss Hoyle , and thank you for everything . You were very kind to me . And I fear I was a nuisance . " The girl with the freckles , too , gave him her hand , smiling . She was very pretty , and it would have been easy to fall in love with her . She reminded him of someone . Who was it ? He tried in vain to remember while he said good-by to her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitudes with the young ladies , Mr. Arcularis ! " she was saying . Mr. Arcularis was pleased , flattered , by all this attention to a middle-aged invalid , and felt a joke taking shape in his mind , and no sooner in his mind than on his tongue . " Oh , no latitudes , " he said , laughing . " I 'll leave the latitudes to the ship ! " " Oh , come now , " said the Matron , " we do n't seem to have hurt him much , do we ? " " I think we 'll have to operate on him again and really cure him , " said Miss Hoyle . He was going down the front steps , between the potted palmettos , and they all laughed and waved . The wind was cold , very cold for June , and he was glad he had put on his coat . He shivered . " Damned cold for June ! " he said . " Why should it be so cold ? " " East wind , " Harry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's an open car , but I believe in fresh air and all that sort of thing . I 'll drive slowly . We 've got plenty of time . " They coasted gently down the long hill towards Beacon Street , but the road was badly surfaced , and despite Harry 's care Mr. Areularis felt his pain again . He found that he could alleviate it a little by leaning to the right , against the arm-rest , and not breathing too deeply . But how glorious to be out again ! How strange and vivid the world looked ! The trees had innumerable green fresh leaves  --  they were all blowing and shifting and turning and flashing in the wind ; drops of rainwater fell downward sparkling ; the robins were singing their absurd , delicious little four-noted songs ; even the street cars looked unusually bright and beautiful , just as they used to look when he was a child and had wanted above all things to be a motorman . He found himself smiling foolishly at everything , foolishly and weakly , and wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , though  --  he had no strength , and the mere finding of words would be almost more than he could manage . And even if he should succeed in saying it , he would then most likely burst into tears . He shook his head slowly from side to side . " Ai n't it grand ? " he said . " I 'll bet it looks good , " said Harry . " Words fail me . " " You wait till you get out to sea . You 'll have a swell time . " " Oh , swell ! . . . I hope not . I hope it 'll be calm . " " Tut tut . " When they passed the Harvard Club Mr. Arcularis made a slow and somewhat painful effort to turn in his seat and look at it . It might be the last chance to see it for a long time . Why this sentimental longing to stare at it , though ? There it was , with the great flag blowing in the wind , the Harvard seal now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were the windows in the library , where he had spent so many delightful hours reading  --  Plato , and Kipling , and the Lord knows what  --  and the balconies from which for so many years he had watched the finish of the Marathon . Old Talbot might be in there now , sleeping with a book on his knee , hoping forlornly to be interrupted by anyone , for anything . " Good-by to the old club , " he said . " The bar will miss you , " said Harry , smiling with friendly irony and looking straight ahead . " But let there be no moaning , " said Mr. Arcularis . " What 's that a quotation from ? " " ' The Odyssey . " ' In spite of the cold , he was glad of the wind on his face , for it helped to dissipate the feeling of vagueness and dizziness that came over him in a sickening wave from time to time . All of a sudden everything would begin to swim and dissolve , the houses would lean their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there would be a curious and dreadful humming noise , which at regular intervals rose to a crescendo and then drawlingly subsided again . It was disconcerting . Perhaps he still had a trace of fever . When he got on the ship he would have a glass of whisky . .. . From one of these spells he opened his eyes and found that they were on the ferry , crossing to East Boston . It must have been the ferry 's engines that he had heard . From another spell he woke to find himself on the wharf , the ear at a standstill beside a pile of yellow packing-cases . " We 're here because we 're here because we 're here , " said Harry . " Because we 're here , " added Mr. Areularis . He dozed in the car while Harry  --  and what a good friend Harry was ! ? attended to all the details . He went and came with tickets and passports and baggage checks and porters . And at last he unwrapped Mr. Areularis from the rugs and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence by devious windings to a small cold stateroom with a solitary porthole like the eye of a cyclops . " Here you are , " he said , " and now I 've got to go . Did you hear the whistle ? " " No . " " Well , you 're half asleep . It 's sounded the all-ashore . Good-by , old fellow , and take care of yourself . Bring me back a spray of edelweiss . And send me a picture post card from the Absolute . " " Will you have it finite or infi-nite ? " " Oh , infinite . But with your signs-ture on it . Now you 'd better turn in for a while and have a nap . Cheerio ! " Mr. Areularis took his hand and pressed it hard , and once more felt like crying . Absurd ! Had he become a child again ? " Good-by , " he said . He sat down in the little wicker chair , with his overcoat still on , closed his eyes , and listened to the humming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the corridor . The chair was not too comfortable , and his pain began to bother him again , so he moved , with his coat still on , to the narrow berth and fell asleep . When he woke up , it was dark , and the porthole had been partly opened . He groped for the switch and turned on the light . Then he rang for the steward . " It 's cold in here , " he said . " Would you mind closing the port ? " The girl who sat opposite him at dinner was charming . Who was it she reminded him of ? Why , of course , the girl at the hospital , the girl with the freckles . Her hair was beautiful , not quite red , not quite gold , nor had it been bobbed ; arranged with a sort of graceful untidiness , it made him think of a Melozzo da Forli angel . Her face was freckled , she had a mouth which was both humorous and voluptuous . And she seemed to be alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick soup . " No hors d'oeuvres ? " asked the steward . " I think not , " said Mr. Arcularis . " They might kill me . " The steward permitted himself to be amused and deposited the menu card on the table against the water-bottle . His eyebrows were lifted . As he moved away , the girl followed him with her eyes and smiled . " I 'm afraid you shocked him , " she said . " Impossible , " said Mr. Areularis . " These stewards , they 're dead souls . How could they be stewards otherwise ? And they think they 've seen and known everything . They suffer terribly from the ereja vu . Personally , I do n't blame them . " " It must be a dreadful sort of life . " " It 's because they 're dead that they accept it . " " Do you think so ? " " I 'm sure of it . I 'm enough of a dead soul myself to know the signs ! " " Well , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious ! I 'm just out of hospital , after an operation . I was given up for dead . For six months I had given myself up for dead . If you 've ever been seriously ill you know the feeling . You have a posthumous feeling  --  a mild , cynical tolerance for everything and everyone . What is there you have n't seen or done or understood ? Nothing . " Mr. Arcularis waved his hands and smiled . " I wish I could understand you , " said the girl , " but I 've never been ill in my life . " " Never ? " " Never . " " Good God ! " The torrent of the unexpressed and inexpressible paralyzed him and rendered him speechless . He stared at the girl , wondering who she was and then , realizing that he had perhaps stared too fixedly , averted his gaze , gave a little laugh , rolled a pill of bread between his fingers . After a second or two he allowed himself to look at her again and found her smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " or they 'll drag you to the hospital . " She examined him critically , with her head tilted a little to one side , but with friendliness . " You do n't look like an invalid , " she said . Mr. Arcularis thought her charming . His pain ceased to bother him , the disagreeable humming disappeared , or rather , it was dissociated from himself and became merely , as it should be , the sound of the ship 's engines , and he began to think the voyage was going to be really delightful . The parson on his right passed him the salt . " I fear you will need this in your soup , " he said . " Thank you . Is it as bad as that ? " The steward , overhearing , was immediately apologetic and solicitous . He explained that on the first day everything was at sixes and sevens . The girl looked up at him and asked him a question . " Do you think we 'll have a good voyage ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , removing the napkins from them with a deprecatory finger . " Well , madam , I do n't like to be a Jeremiah , but ? " " Oh , come , " said the parson , " I I hope we have no Jeremiahs . " " What do you mean ? " said the girl . Mr. Arcularis ate his soup with gusto  --  it was nice and hot . " Well , maybe I should n't say it , but there 's a corpse on hoard , going to Ireland ; and I never yet knew a voyage with a corpse on board that we did n't have bad weather . " " Why , steward , you 're just superstitious ! What nonsense . " " That 's a very ancient superstition , " said Mr. Arcularis . " I 've heard it many times . Maybe it 's true . Maybe we 'll be wrecked . And what does it matter , after all ? " He was very bland . " Then let 's be wrecked , " said the parson coldly . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the steward 's remark . A corpse in the hold  --  a coffin ? Perhaps it was true . Perhaps some disaster would befall them . There might be fogs . There might be icebergs . He thought of all the wrecks of which he had read . There was the Titanic , which he had read about in the warm newspaper room at the Harvard Club  --  it had seemed dreadfully real , even there . That band , playing " Nearer My God to Thee " on the after-deck while the ship sank ! It was one of the darkest of his memories . And the Empress of Ireland  --  all those poor people trapped in the smoking-room , with only one door between them and life , and that door locked for the night by the deck-steward , and the deck-steward nowhere to be found ! He shivered , feeling a draft , and turned to the parson . " How do these strange delusions arise ? " he said . The parson looked at him searchingly , appraisingly  --  from chin to forehead , from forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened his tie . " From nothing but fear , " said the parson . " Nothing on earth but fear . " " How strange ! " said the girl . Mr. Arcularis again looked at her  --  she had lowered her face  --  and again tried to think of whom she reminded him . It was n't only the little freckle-faced girl at the hospital  --  both of them had reminded him of someone else . Someone far hack in his life : remote , beautiful , lovely . But he could n't think . The meal came to an end , they all rose , the ship 's orchestra played a feeble fox-trot , and Mr. Arcularis , once more alone , went to the bar to have his whisky . The room was stuffy , and the ship 's engines were both audible and palpable . The humming and throbbing oppressed him , the rhythm seemed to be the rhythm of his own pain , and after a short time he found his way , with slow steps , holding on to the walls in his moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little room . The port had been  --  thank God ! ? closed for the night : it was cold enough anyway . The white and blue ribbons fluttered from the ventilator , the bottle and glasses clicked and clucked as the ship swayed gently to the long , slow motion of the sea . It was all very peculiar  --  it was all like something he had experienced somewhere before . What was it ? Where was it ? ... He untied his tie , looking at his face in the glass , and wondered , and from time to time put his hand to his side to hold in the pain . It was n't at Portsmouth , in his childhood , nor at Salem , nor in the rose-garden at his Aunt Julia 's , nor in the schoolroom at Cambridge . It was something very queer , very intimate , very precious . The jackstones , the Sunday-School cards which he had loved when he was a child . . . He fell asleep . The sense of time was already hopelessly confused . One hour was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indistinguishable from afternoon  --  and was it Tuesday or Wednesday ? Mr. Arcularis was sitting in the smoking-room , in his favorite corner , watching the parson teach Miss Dean to play chess . On the deck outside he could see the people passing and repassing in their restless round of the ship . The red jacket went by , then the black hat with the white feather , then the purple scarf , the brown tweed coat , the Bulgarian mustache , the monocle , the Scotch cap with fluttering ribbons , and in no time at all the red jacket again , dipping past the windows with its own peculiar rhythm , followed once more by the black hat and the purple scarf . How odd to reflect on the fixed little orbits of these things  --  as definite and profound , perhaps , as the orbits of the stars , and as important to God or the Absolute . There was a kind of tyranny in this fixedness , too to think of it too much made one uncomfortable . He closed his eyes for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache and the pursuing monocle . The parson was explaining the movements of knights . Two forward and one to the side . Eight possible moves , always to the opposite color from that on which the piece stands . Two forward and one to the side : Miss Dean repeated the words several times with reflective emphasis . Here , too , was the terrifying fixed curve of the infinite , the creeping curve of logic which at last must become the final signpost at the edge of nothing . After that  --  the deluge . The great white light of annihilation . The bright flash of death . . . Was it merely the sea which made these abstractions so insistent , so intrusive ? The mere notion of orbit had somehow become extraordinarily naked ; and to rid himself of the discomfort and also to forget a little the pain which bothered his side whenever he sat down , he walked slowly and carefully into the writing-room , and examined a pile of superannuated magazines and catalogues of travel . The bright colors amused him , the photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarongs or both  --  it was all very far off and delightful , like something in a dream or a fever . But he found that he was too tired to read and was incapable of concentration . Dreams ! Yes , that reminded him . That rather alarming business  --  sleep-walking ! Later in the evening  --  at what hour he did n't know  --  he was telling Miss Dean about it , as he had intended to do . They were sitting in deck-chairs on the sheltered side . The sea was black , and there was a cold wind . He wished they had chosen to sit in the lounge . Miss Dean was extremely pretty  --  no , beautiful . She looked at him , too , in a very strange and lovely way , with something of inquiry , something ofsympathy , something of affection . It seemed as if , between the question and the answer , they had sat thus for a very long time , exchanging an unspoken secret , simply looking at each other quietly and kindly . Had an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak ? " No , " she said , " I never have . " She breathed into the low words a note of interrogation and gave him a slow smile . " That 's the funny part of it . I never had either until last night . Never in my life . I hardly ever even dream . And it really rather frightens me . " " Tell me about it , Mr. Arcularis . " " I dreamed at first that I was walking , alone , in a wide plain covered with snow . It was growing dark , I was very cold , my feet were frozen and numb , and I was lost . I came then to a signpost  --  at first it seemed to me there was nothing on it . Nothing but ice . Just before it grew finally dark , however , I made out on it the one word ' Polaris . ' " " The Pole Star . " " Yes  --  and you see , I did n't myself know that . I looked it up only this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And of course it rhymes with my name . " " Why , so it does ! " " Anyway , it gave me  --  in the dream ? an awful feeling of despair , and the dream changed . This time , I dreamed I was standing outside my stateroom in the little dark corridor , or cul-de-sac , and trying to find the door-handle to let myself in . I was in my pajamas , and again I was very cold . And at this point I woke up . . . The extraordinary thing is that 's exactly where I was ! " " Good heavens . How strange ! " " Yes . And now the question is , where had I been ? I was frightened , when I came to  --  not unnaturally . For among other things I did have , quite definitely , the feeling that I had been somewhere . Somewhere where it was very cold . It does n't sound very proper . Suppose I had been seen ! " " That might have been awkward , " said Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very singular . I 've never done such a thing before . It 's this sort of thing that reminds one  --  rather wholesomely , perhaps , do n't you think ? " ? and Mr. Arcularis gave a nervous little laugh ? " how extraordinarily little we know about the workings of our own minds or souls . After all , what do we know ? " " Nothing  --  nothing  --  nothing  --  nothi ng , " said Miss Dean slowly . " Absolutely nothing . " Their voices had dropped , and again they were silent ; and again they looked at each other gently and sympathetically , as if for the exchange of something unspoken and perhaps unspeakable . Time ceased . The orbit  --  so it seemed to Mr. Arcularis  --  once more became pure , became absolute . And once more he found himself wondering who it was that Miss Dean  --  Clarice Dean  --  reminded him of . Long ago and far away . Like those pictures of the islands and mountains . The little freckle-faced girl at the hospital was merely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , as in algebra , the " equals " sign . But what was it they both " equalled " ? The jack-stones came again into his mind and his Aunt Julia 's rose-garden  --  at sunset ; but this was ridiculous . It could n't be simply that they reminded him of his childhood ! And yet why not ? They went into the lounge . The ship 's orchestra , in the oval-shaped balcony among faded palms , was playing the finale of " Cavalleria Rusticana , " playing it badly . " Good God ! " said Mr. Arcularis , " ca n't I ever escape from that damned sentimental tune ? It 's the last thing Iheard in America , and the last thing I want to hear . " " But do n't you like it ? " " As music ? No ! It moves me too much , but in the wrong way . " " What , exactly , do you mean ? " " Exactly ? Nothing . When I heard it at the hospital  --  when was it ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tootling it in the rain . I suppose , like most people , I 'm afraid of my feelings . " " Are they so dangerous ? " " Now then , young woman ! Are you pulling my leg ? " The stewards had rolled away the carpets , and the passengers were beginning to dance . Miss Dean accepted the invitation of a young officer , and Mr. Arcularis watched them with envy . Odd , that last exchange of remarks  --  very odd ; in fact , everything was odd . Was it possible that they were falling in love ? Was that what it was all about  --  all these concealed references and recollections ? He had read of such things . But at his age ! And with a girl of twenty-two ! After an amused look at his old friend Polaris from the open door on the sheltered side , he went to bed . The rhythm of the ship 's engines was positively a persecution . It gave one no rest , it followed one like the Hound of Heaven , it drove one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home by way of Betelgeuse . It was cold there , too . Mr. Arcularis , making the round trip by way of Betelgeuse and Polaris , sparkled with frost . He felt like a Christmas tree . Icicles on his fingers and icicles on his toes . He tinkled and spangled in the void , hallooed to the waste echoes , rounded the buoy on the verge of the Unknown , and tacked glitteringly homeward . The wind whistled . He was barefooted . Snowflakes and tinsel blew past him . Next time , by George , he would go farther still  --  for altogether it was rather a lark . Forward into the untrodden ! as somebody said . Some intrepid explorer of his own backyard , probably , some middle-aged professor with an umbrella : those were the fellows for courage ! But give us time , thought Mr. Arcularis , give us time , and we will bring back with us the night-rime of the Obsolute . Or was it Absolete ? If only there were n't this perpetual throbbing , this iteration of sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the feeling as of everything coiling inward to a center of misery . Suddenly it was dark , and he was lost . He was groping , he touched the cold , white , slippery woodwork with his fingernails , looking for an electric switch . The throbbing , of course , was the throbbing of the ship . But he was almost home  --  almost home . Another corner to round , a door to be opened , and there he would be . Safe and sound . Safe in his father 's home . It was at this point that he woke up : in the corridor that led to the dining saloon . Such pure terror , such horror , seized him as he had never known . His heart felt as if it would stop beating . His back was towards the dining saloon ; apparently he had just come from it . He was in his pajamas . The corridor was dim , all but two lights having been turned out for the night , and  --  thank God ! ? deserted . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards from his room . With luck he could get to it unseen . Holding tremulously to the rail that ran along the wall , a brown , greasy rail , he began to creep his way forward . He felt very weak , very dizzy , and his thoughts refused to concentrate . Vaguely be remembered Miss DeanClarice  --  and the freckled girl , as if they were one and the same person . But be was n't in the hospital , he was on the ship . Of course . How absurd . The Great Circle . Here we are , old fellow . . . steady round the corner . . . hold hard to your umbrella .. . In his room , with the door safely shut behind him , Mr. Arcularis broke into a cold sweat . He had no sooner got into his bunk , shivering , than he heard the night watchman pass . " But where ? " he thought , closing 1 his eyes in agony ? " have I been . . A dreadful idea had occurred to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious ? Of course it 's nothing serious , " said Mr. Arcularis . " No , it 's nothing serious , " said the ship 's doctor urbanely . " I knew you 'd think so . But just the same ? " " Such a condition is the result of worry , " said the doctor . " Are you worried  --  do you mind telling me  --  about something ? Just try to think . " " Worried ? " Mr. Arcularis knitted his brows . Was there something ? Some little mosquito of a cloud disappearing into the southwest , the northeast ? Some little gnat-song of despair ? But no , that was all over . All over . " Nothing , " he said , " nothing what-ever . " " It 's very strange , " said the doctor . " Strange ! I should say so . I 've come to sea for a rest , not for a nightmare ! What about a bromide ? " " Well , I can give you a bromide , Mr. Arcularis ? " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a. bromide . " He carried the little phial hopefully to his stateroom , and took a dose at once . He could see the sun through his porthole . It looked northern and pale and small , like a little peppermint , which was only natural enough , for the latitude was changing with every hour . But why was it that doctors were all alike ? and all , for that matter , like his father , or that other fellow at the hospital ? Smythe , his name was . Doc-for Smythe . A nice , dry little fellow , and they said he was a writer . Wrote poetry , or something like that . Poor fellow  --  disappointed . Like everybody else . Crouched in there , in his cabin , night after night , writing blank verse or something  --  all about the stars and flowers and love and death ; ice and the sea and the infinite ; time and tide  --  well , every man to his own taste . " But it 's nothing serious , " said Mr. Arcularis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " " Why of course not , my dear fellow , " said the parson , patting his back . " How could it be ? " " I know it is n't and yet I worry about it . " " It would be ridiculous to think it serious , " said the parson . Mr. Arcularis shivered : it was colder than ever . It was said that they were near icebergs . For a few hours in the morning there had been a fog , and the siren had blown  --  devastatingly ? at three-minute intervals . Icebergs caused fog  --  he knew that . " These things always come , " said the parson , " from a sense of guilt . You feel guilty about something . I wo n't be so rude as to inquire what it is . But if you could rid yourself of the sense of guilt ? " And later still , when the sky was pink : " But is it anything to worry about ? " said Miss Dean . " Really ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are n't children any longer ! " " Are n't we ? I wonder ! " They leaned , shoulders touching , on the deck-rail , and looked at the sea , which was multitudinously incarnadined . Mr. Areularis scanned the horizon in vain for an iceberg . " Anyway , " he said , " the colder we are the less we feel ! " " I hope that 's no reflection on you , " said Miss Dean . " Here . . . feel my hand , " said Mr. " Heaven knows it 's cold ! " " It 's been to Polaris and back ! No wonder . " " Poor thing , poor thing ! " " Warm it . " " May I ? " " You can . " " I 'll try . " Laughing , she took his hand between both of hers , one palm under and one palm over , and began rubbing it briskly . The decks were deserted , no one was near them , everyone was dressing for dinner . The sea grew darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could remember who you are , " be said . " And you  --  who are you ? " " Myself . " " Then perhaps / am yourself . " " Do n't be metaphysical ! " " But I am metaphysical ! " She laughed , withdrew , pulled the light coat about her shoulders . The bugle blew the summons for dinner ? " The Roast Beef of Old England " ? and they walked together along the darkening deck toward the door , from which a shaft of soft light fell across the deck-rail . As they stepped over the brass door-sill Air . Areularis felt the throb of the engines again ; he put his hand quickly to his side . " Auf wiedersehen , " he said . " Tomorrow and to-morrow and to-morrow . " Mr. Areularis was finding it impossible , absolutely impossible , to keep warm . A cold fog surrounded the ship , had done so , it seemed , for days . The sun had all but disappeared , the transition from day to night was almost unnoticeable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was as if anchored among walls of ice and rime . Monstrous , that merely because it was June , and supposed , therefore , to be warm , the ship 's authorities should consider it unnecessary to turn on the heat ! By day , he wore his heavy coat and sat shivering in the corner of the smoking-room . His teeth chattered , his hands were blue . By night , he heaped blankets on his bed , closed the porthole 's black eye against the sea , and drew the yellow curtains across it , but in vain . Somehow , despite everything , the fog crept in , and the icy fingers touched his throat . The steward , questioned about it , merely said , " Icebergs . " Of course  --  any fool knew that . But how long , in God 's name , was it going to last ? They surely ought to be past the Grand Banks by this time ! And surely it was n't necessary to sail to England by way of Greenland and Iceland ! Miss Dean  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , your vitality has been lowered by your illness . You ca n't expect to be your normal self so soon after an operation ! When was your operation , by the way ? " Mr. Arcularis considered . Strange ? he could n't be quite sure . It was all a little vague  --  his sense of time had disappeared . " Heaven knows ! " he said . " Centuries ago . When I was a tadpole and you were a fish . I should think it must have been at about the time of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest . Or perhaps when I was a Neanderthal man with a club ! " " Are you sure it was n't farther back still ? " What did she mean by that ? " Not at all . Obviously , we 've been on this damned ship for ages  --  for eras  --  for aeons . And even on this ship , you must remember , I 've had plenty of time , in my nocturnal wanderings , to go several times to Orion and back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther still . There 's a nice littlestar off to the left , as you round Betelgeuse , which looks as if it might be right at the edge . The last outpost of the finite . I think I 'll have a look at it and bring you back a frozen rime-feather . " " It would melt when you got it back . " " Oh , no , it would n't  --  not on this ship ! " Clarice laughed . " I wish I could go with you , " she said . " If only you would ! H only ? " He broke off his sentence and looked hard at her  --  how lovely she was , and how desirable ! No such woman had ever before come into his life ; there had been no one with whom he had at once felt so profound a sympathy and understanding . It was a miracle , simply  --  a miracle . No need to put his arm around her or to kiss her  --  delightful as such small vulgarities would be . He had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into those extraordinary eyes , that she knew him , had always known him . It was as if , indeed , she might be his own soul . But as he looked thus at her , reflecting , he noticed that she was frowning . " What is it ? " he said . She shook her head , slowly . " I do n't know . " " Tell me . " " Nothing . It just occurred to me that perhaps you were n't looking quite so well . " Mr. Arcularis was startled . He straightened himself up . " What nonsense ! Of course this pain bothers me  --  and I feel astonishme , Her did eyes were " suddenly asking him H ingly weak ? " " It 's more than that  --  much more than that . Something is worrying you horribly . " She paused , and then with an air of challenging him , added , " Tell you ? blazingly the question he had been afraid of . He flinched , caught his breath , looked away . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her . He had known all along that he would have to tell her . " Clarice , " he said  --  and his voice broke in spite of his effort to control it ? " It 's killing me , it 's ghastly ! Yes , I did . " His eyes filled with tears , he saw that her own had done so also . She put her hand on his arm . " I knew , " she said . " I knew . But tell me . " " It 's happened twice again  --  twiceand each time I was farther away . The same dream of going round a star , the same terrible coldness and helplessness . That awful whistling curve . . . " He shuddered . " And when you woke up ? " she spoke quietly ? " where were you when you woke up ? Do n't be afraid ! " " The first time I was at the farther end of the dining saloon . I had my hand on the door that leads into the pantry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? " Mr. Arcularis wanted to close his eyes in terror  --  he felt as if he were going mad . His lips moved before he could speak , and when at last he did speak it was in a voice so low as to be almost a whisper . " I was at the bottom of the stairway that leads down from the pantry to the hold , past the refrigerating-plant . It was dark , and I was crawling on my hands and knees . . . Crawling on my hands and knees ! . . . " " Oh ! " she said , and again , " Oh ! " He began to tremble violently ; he felt the hand on his arm trembling also . And then he watched a look of unmistakable horror come slowly into Clarice 's eyes , and a look of understanding , as if she saw . . . She tightened her hold on his arm . " Do you think . . . " she whispered . They stared at each other . " I know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twice more  --  three times  --  and I 'll be looking down into an empty . . . " It was then that they first embraced ? then , at the edge of the infinite , at the last signpost of the finite . They clung together desperately , forlornly , weeping as they kissed each other , staring hard one moment and closing their eyes the next . Passionately , passionately , she kissed him , as if she were indeed trying to give him her warmth , her life . " But what nonsense ! " she cried , leaning back , and holding his face between her hands , her hands which were wet with his tears . " What nonsense ! It ca n't be ! " " It is , " said Mr. Arcularis slowly . " But how do you know ? . . . How do you know where the ? " For the first time Mr. Arcularis smiled . " Do n't be afraid , darling  --  you mean the coffin ? " " How could you know where it is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arcu-laris . . . " I 'm already almost there . " Before they separated for the night , in the smoking-room , they had several whisky cocktails . " We must make it gay ! " Mr. Arcularis said . " Above all , we must make it gay . Perhaps even now it will turn out to be nothing but a nightmare from which both of us will wake ! And even at the worst , at my present rate of travel , I ought to need two more nights ! It 's a long way , still , to that little star . " The parson passed them at the door . " What ! turning in so soon ? " he said . " I was hoping for a game of chess . " " Yes , both turning in . But to-morrow ? " To-morrow , then , Miss Dean ! And good-night ! " " Good-night . " They walked once round the deck , then leaned on the railing and stared into the fog . It was thicker and whiter than ever . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines was slower , more subdued and remote , and at regular intervals , mournfully , came the long reverberating cry of the foghorn . The sea was calm , and lapped only very tenderly against the side of the ship , the sound coming up to them clearly , however , because of the profound stillness . " ' On such a night as this ? " ' quoted Mr. Arcularis grimly . " On such a night as this ? ' " Their voices hung suspended in the night , time ceased for them , for an eternal instant they were happy . When at last they parted it was by tacit agreement on a note of the ridiculous . " Be a good boy and take your bromide ! " she said . " Yes , mother , I 'll take my medicine ! " In his stateroom , he mixed himself a strong potion of bromide , a very strong one , and got into bed . He would have no trouble in falling asleep : he felt more tired , more supremely exhausted , than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seemed so delicious . And that long , magnificent , delirious swoop of dizziness . . . the Great Circle ... the swift pathway to Acturus .. . It was all as before , but infinitely more rapid . Never had Mr. Arcularis achieved such phenomenal , such supernatural , speed . In no time at all he was beyond the moon , shot past the North Star as if it were standing still ( which perhaps it was ? ) , swooped in a long , bright curve round the Pleiades , shouted his frosty greetings to Betelgeuse , and was off to the little blue star which pointed the way to the unknown . Forward into the untrodden ! Courage , old man , and hold on to your umbrella ! Have you got your garters on ? Mind your hat ! In no time at all we 'll be back to Clarice with the frozen time-feather , the rime-feather , the snowflake of the Absolute , the Obsolete . If only we do n't wake . . . if only we need n't wake . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  time and space . . somewhere or nowhere . . . cold and dark . . " Cavalleria Rusticana " sobbing among the palms ; if a lonely . . . if only . . the coffers of the poor  --  not coffers , not coffers , not coffers , Oh , God , not coffers , but light , delight , supreme white and brightness , and above all whirling lightness , whirling lightness above all --  -- and freezingfreezing  --  freezing . . At this point in the void the surgeon 's last effort to save Mr. Arcularis 's life had failed . He stood hack from the operating table and made a tired gesture with a rubber-gloved hand . " It 's all over , " he said . " As I expected . " He looked at Miss Hoyle , whose gaze was downward , at the basin she held . There was a moment 's stillness , a pause , a brief flight of unexchanged comment , and then the ordered life of the hospital was resumed .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
