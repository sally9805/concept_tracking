In getting control of the Cleveland Railroad Company , they rented the stock at $10 a share for the privilege of holding and voting the stock , guaranteeing dividends at 6 per cent a year , putting the rental agreement into the control of another holding company , The Metropolitan Securities Inc . In 1932 the latter company owed the banks $4,335,000 . The Guardian Trust Company organized a corporation to own its own new building ? The New England Company . This company bought the Hollenden Hotel . In one year the hotel company had a deficit of 2 million dollars . The subsidiaries of this bank had caused it losses of nearly fifteen million dollars . Officers and directors of the bank borrowed from their own and other banks , either with inadequate or no security . Millions were borrowed by the affiliates .

The Van Sweringens had a loan of nearly five million dollars , in the name of the Van Ness Company , in one Cleveland bank . It was secured by $6,500,000 collateral . Needing this collateral for a new loan in New York , they had the bank transfer the $5,000,000 loan to their own name , thus releasing the collateral . In its place they put about $600,000 worth of collateral . The Reconstruction Finance Corporation loaned the Guardian Trust Company 12 million ( it had 6 million worth of Van Sweringen paper ) and the Union Trust Company , 14 million ( it had 10 million worth of Van Sweringen paper ) . These loans failed to save the day . The banks were closed . The Van Sweringen concerns were in default over $3,500,000 in taxes , millions in savings in the banks had been lost by the public , more millions in worthless securities and real estate loans , more millions through the purchase of lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-estate subdivisions. ? Footnote  | The Sequel . The Van Sweringen empire valued at 3 billion dollars , embraced 14 railroads operating 23,000 miles of track and 240 companies interested in coal-mines , department stores , hotels , trucking companies , steamship lines , grain elevators , rail and motor equipment , street-car companies , and one peach orchard . The major holding company of this empire is the Alleghany Corporation . In 1935 the Van Sweringens owed some 42 million dollars to New York bankers . At a little auction room in New York on September 30 , 1935 , the Mid-America Corporation ( George A. Ball and George A. Tomlinson ) bought control of the 3-billion dollar Alleghany Corporation for $274,682 ; in short , every 10 cents in this investment controlled $1,000 in securities . The Van Sweringen brothers were given a ten-year option to purchase 8,250 shares of stock at one dollar a share , voting control to go with the option . The Van Sweringens never paid in the $8,250 .

During the Senate investigation in December 1936 , Joseph B. Eastman of the Interstate Commerce Commission , charged that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company , a Van Sweringen subsidiary , had falsified its reports of assets to the Commission , the stockholders , and the public . He said it had , as of December 31 , 1931 , credited itself with a deposit of $1,600,000 in the Guaranty Trust Company , and as of December 31 , 1932 , with a similar deposit of $3,200,000 . Mr. Eastman asserted that " the Missouri Pacific did not have a five cent piece in the Guaranty when these reports were made . " 8 The records of the Federal Trade Commission and various Senate investigating committees are crammed with evidence of tremendous " kills " in stock manipulation , such as : Electric Bond and Share , United Aircraft Company , Insull Mid-West Holding Corporation , and so on and so on . In connection with the millions made from an original investment by Mr. Deeds of 300 dollars in Pratt &; Whitney stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter as taking millions out of an empty hat in Wall Street . Such is our inherited economic psychology . Use , service are wholly incidental to profit , to vendability . Private initiative is to have free rein primarily to make profits and , incidentally , to render service . Thus we progress in the midst of the most magnificent opportunity civilized man has ever had , towards monopolistic control ? towards a condition in which free opportunity for the multitude means opportunity to have less work and less means of subsistence , less and less economic freedom . Natural resources and inventions are made the instruments for the satisfaction of economic greed and the lust for power by a few . It does not mitigate this situation to point out , for instance , that Daniel Drew gave a million to a Methodist theological seminary ; that Jim Hill , a Protestant , gave a million to a Roman Catholic seminary because he thought the church a most valuable police force to keep the common people in order ; that John D. Rockefeller gave great sums to education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnegie dotted the country with libraries that perpetuate his name , and gave a pension fund for professors ( which has now petered out ) ; or that some of them , such as Morgan , Henry Huntington , and W. H. Vanderbilt spent millions on pictures ( by dead masters while American artists starved ) and rare first editions and manuscripts ( while Walt Whitman was kept alive chiefly by the efforts of English literary men ) . The question is not with respect to the piety or private lives or benefactions of some of our rulers ; nor is the fact that they led in the exploitation of virgin resources in dispute . It is a system that has outlived whatever usefulness it once had ; and that usefulness was qualified by fraud , corruption , and waste . The models set up for admiration and imitation have been meretricious and harmful . The high finance , the crazy pyramided " security " structures , the corruption of the New Era , are the prolongation of the earlier heritage , in an era in which they are even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for production . The corning of " overproduction " was postponed by the expansion into virgin  | fields at home and abroad and by the industrial backwardness of other peoples . It has now arrived . No energetic civilized people has now any monopoly of mass production . It is said that the Bata Works in Czechoslovakia have us beaten in the mass production of cheap shoes , Japan in electric light bulbs , cotton , and many other things . We have occupied and exploited a virgin continent . In the meantime the civilized world is being mass industrialized . Africa and the Near East are being exploited by other nations . We must develop a new economic psychology ? a new socialmental habit , or " conditioning " and a new attitude . There are just two principles in this new social attitude ? one factual and one ethical : ( 1 ) We are all members one of another and we sink or swim together . Human interdependence has increased rapidly in variety , complexity , and range . ( 2 ) Production should be primarily for human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for man , not man for goods . It will be a slow and painful process , one attended by much conflict , to get these principles to prevail . But if we fail in this our civilization will be ruined . The sketches of the morally dubious and socially disastrous methods of high finance in this volume are not to be taken to imply any reflection on the greater part , perhaps by far the greater part , of business enterprise . The illustrations given are cited as evidence of what can go on , legally , under economic individualism.  | THE BANKRUPTCY OF ECONOMIC INDIVIDUALISM 1 . THE TERMS INDIVIDUALISM , CAPITALISM , AND SOCIALISM THE TERMS individualism , capitalism , and socialism are all equivocal in meaning . By " capitalism " is usually meant an economy in which the equipment ( land , plant , and organization ) for the production and distribution of economic goods is privately owned and privately operated . But , strictly speaking ; private capitalism should mean only that the plants and equipment are privately owned . If one owns bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways , light and power , one is a public capitalist . We have , to a limited and increasing extent , publicly operated activities in which private individuals own the plant by reason of their purchases of bonds . If , for example , the railroads of the United States were to be taken over for operation by the Federal Government with compensation , that would mean that the present owners of railroad stocks and bonds would receive in exchange United States bonds . This is State capitalism . Any investment , the result of saving for productive purposes , is capitalistic , wheth3r the plants to which it applies be privately or publicly operated . " Wealth " is the instrument of social weal . It may be privately owned and used ( for example , clothes and other personal belongings ) ; or privately owned and publicly used ( for example , grounds , or an art collection open to the public ) ; or publicly owned and privately used ( for example , government property leased for private use and profit ) ; or publicly owned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strictly speaking , any system of cooperative economy directed primarily for the service of its members and not for profit is socialistic . It might yield  | profits , but the profits would be used for public purposes . Again , by " individualism " may be meant : 1 . A social order in which there is little or no governmental control over the individual 's efforts to make money in any way he can . This is laissez-faire , " let-alone , " or " rugged " individualism , or " free competition . " Such a condition of things has never existed in its extreme form in any orderly society . It would be anarchy , " the war of all against all " of Hobbes ' Man in a state of nature . But , relatively speaking , rugged individualism means that system which came into being in the eighteenth century , and continued well through the nineteenth century with modification , by which the inherited restrictions of the feudal society and custom were removed and free play was given to man 's acquisition and selfish instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1830 and in the United States after the Civil War , before its abuses had led to social regulation . It is still rampant in some of our states . 2 . On the other hand , by democratic cooperative individualism is meant a social system which aims to secure to all members of society a fair opportunity to achieve economic security and well-being , education , the normal satisfaction of family life and recreation . That this end can be attained only by a cooperative system in which the materials and instruments of production and distribution are socially controlled is the central contention of this book . In this sense cooperative individualism is only another name for " social humanism " : the doctrine that the ruling principle in the social order should be the cooperation of all its members for the fulfilment and enjoyment of all their normal capacities . Our inherited economic philosophy is laissez-faire . This means that the supreme governing motive of all work is private gain . The individual is to work for the highest possible profit if he is a capitalist , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee ; and he may be both ? he may invest his savings in business enterprises . The acquisitive motive is enthroned above all others . Greed is made the paramount motive for work . This does not mean that the individual worker labors only for his isolated self . He has  | been in most cases a family man with dependents . But the individualistic philosophy holds that , when full rein is given to individual and family selfishness , the entire social body will grow rich , the most goods will be produced for the lowest prices and they will be distributed most equitably . The chief function of government , according to rugged individualism , is to protect property and contracts , not to further the good life among citizens . In general , from the very beginning of attempts to impose safety , sanitary conditions , shorter hours , higher wages , whether by the action of organized labor or by the action of government , the owners of factories and mines and business concerns have opposed all interference as a violation of the freedom that business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining with employees . A few expressions of this philosophy are : " It is curious to observe how , through the wise and beneficent arrangements of Providence , men thus do the greatest service to the public when they are thinking of nothing but their own gain . " The basic assumption is this : there are iron laws of economics which no society can seek to evade with impunity . " The natural price of labor is that price which is necessary to enable the laborers one with another to subsist and to perpetuate their race without either increase or diminution . " 2 As wages rise the number of wage earners increases , as wages fall below the bare subsistence level the number decreases : " There is no means of improving the lot of the worker except by limiting the number of his children . His destiny is in his own hands . Every suggestion which does not tend to the reduction in number of the working people is useless , to say the least of it . All legislative interference must be pernicious . " 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided among the workers . If one gets more than his share the rest must suffer . Raising the standard of living lowers profits and this in turn throws wage earners out of work : Footnote  | " The poverty of the incapable , the distresses that come upon the imprudent , the starvation of the idle , and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong , which leave so many in shallows and in miseries , ' are the decrees of a large , far-seeing benevolence . . . . It seems hard that a laborer incapacitated by sickness from competing with his strong fellows , should have to bear the resulting privations . It seems hard that widows and orphans should be left to struggle for life or death . Nevertheless , when regarded not separately , but in connection with the interests of universal humanity , these harsh fatalities seem to be full of the highest beneficence ? the same beneficence which brings to early graves the children of diseased parents , and singles out the low spirited , the intemperate , and the debilitated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken benevolence try to prevent the sufferings that surround us , these sigh-wise and groan-foolish people bequeath to posterity a continually increasing curse . " ' Under the very favorable conditions of a country expanding rapidly through exploiting enormous virgin resources , the individualistic ideal took on a new and more roseate coloring in the United States . As recently as 1924 , and indeed even after the great depression , one finds such utterances as these . The first is on " the spirit of American Business " by Julius H. Barnes , President of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States . " A social ideal that would close no gate because of accident of birth or station , but would maintain the open road for character , ability , and energy , to attain recognized leadership . A political ideal that national progress and accomplishment are the aggregate of individual effort , and the prime function of government is to maintain fair play and equal opportunity for each individual to work out his own place and accomplishment in a fair field . " 5 Elbert H. Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1924 : " I look for great future business prosperity . If it does not soon appear , it will not be for lack of conditions and opportunity .... " " Gentlemen , are any of you pessimists ? Are Footnote  | you discouraged or downhearted ? Look ahead . Our lands , our climate , our wealth , our productive and transportation facilities , our increasing consuming desire and capacity , our educational advantages , our churches , our protective national constitution , our floating flag , our spirit of loyalty , all remain .... " " Where else on earth can be found another such a nation ? Let us be thankful , hopeful , confident , and determined . Let us be loyal to our country , to all others who are interested in what we do or say , and to each other . " 8 The aim of achievement in production is more production for profit . The goal is the ever increasing production of material goods bringing more prosperity to the competent worker ( at least one bathroom in every house and two cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gadgets ) . For the business man a country house and travel , fashionable schools and diamonds and ermine for the daughters . Individualism was written into the United States Constitution and affirmed and reaffirmed in countless Court decisions ? leading to the nullification of laws passed to protect women and child workers . Its praises have been hymned , as the " rugged individualism " under which the United States has grown prosperous and great , by many persons , including Herbert Hoover . Its laudators appear to have overlooked two things : 1 . The United States was bound to prosper anyway , since it was a vast , rich undeveloped land , entered into and exploited at the very time and by the very peoples who had in Europe achieved successful capitalism , machine industry , and had begun the era of mass production . The beginning of the industrial revolution coincides with the beginning of the United States as an independent nation . The development of technology at an accelerated pace has been coincident with the growth of this country and has largely taken place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the new era of mass production on a grand scale the United States has led the way . 2 . The rugged individualism has been largely a myth , and has Footnote  | in recent decades become more and more so . The Constitution and laws have in the main been interpreted and administered for the benefit of the vested interests ; in other words , for the protection of private property and contracts . In the development of the country special privileges , in the way of grants of land rights in grazing , coal , timber , oil , minerals , have been given , either for a song , or at least without adequate compensation to large corporations . The establishment and increase of protective tariffs have not in the past been directed simply to build up and maintain a high standard of living for the American workmen , but rather to promote the development of profitable enterprises for special groups able to carry off legislation . Wages were , until the revision of the Immigration Act in 1924 , kept down by the wholesale importation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to favor the native workmen , they are not instances of individualism but of governmental protection and fostering . The stoppage of immigration has been accompanied by the increase of technological unemployment , thus maintaining an oversupply of labor . The Federal postal system , the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture , and Federal aid in road-building are all departures from free individualism . The Federal regulation of railways and interstate commerce , and other forms of large-scale commercial enterprise are also departures from free competition , as is the Federal Reserve banking system . One might go on and enumerate many other instances of governmental control and promotion in the interests of special groups . At the time of writing , the Federal Government is putting into effect a number of large undertakings to give financial aid to banks , insurance companies , farmers , business and industry , and unemployment . The present social order is a compromise between sheer individualism and a capitalistic collectivism partly private and partly public in control . Industry , business , and financial institutions are constantly being organized into larger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without reverting to hand labor . The small industry , directed by its owner , is being squeezed out . Not only wholesale but retail trading is coming  | more and more into the hands of large corporations . Small banks are being pushed to the wall and absorbed by great banking trusts and investment corporations . There has been no really effective public control over these ever expanding enterprises . Huge banking concerns sold millions of foreign securities to the trusting public , and these securities have greatly depreciated , some of them becoming worthless . The government did nothing to protect the investing public against exploitation . Nor did it do anything to put a drag on the expansion of productive capacities beyond all reasonable limits through the reinvestment of profits in the heyday of prosperity . Our society has been individualistic , in the sense that no effective national or state control has been exercised over the abuses attendant on the development of ever larger capitalistic enterprises . It is collectivistic , in the sense that , within and between these great units of corporate business enterprises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe investment has dwindled . Government is called in to aid the development of capitalistic enterprise . When it attempts to put a check thereon , or to regulate it , in the interests of the common weal , the faces of big business are set in operation to nullify the effort by either judicial process or by influencing legislation . " Giving as little as possible for as much as it is possible to get , might be taken as the whole motto of our business system . " ' There is an opposition between making goods in the kind , quality , and quantity that will best serve the mass of consumers and making money by making as large profits as possible . 2 . THE " NEW ERA " AND WHAT HAPPENED TO Fr For some years before the twenty-ninth of October 1929 , indeed ever since the United States began to become riotously rich through selling supplies and munitions to war-torn Europe , the great majority of the leaders of big business and the economists who echoed their views proclaimed that we had entered upon a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New Era was one of continuous and ever increasing prosperity , Footnote  | brought about through the cheapening process of machine production , which brought both higher wages and greater profits . The factors in large-scale production are land , labor , capital , management or organization , and ownership . Land , labor , capital , and organization are essential in any system of production . Ownership may be private or public . The land supplies the raw materials and the place ; the labor , under the direction of the management , produces the finished article . The real capital consists of the plant : buildings , machinery , and so forth . The management or organization is the directing staff of the factory . Originally , under the factory system , ownership and direction were in the same hands . The owner managed the factory . More and more , with the development of vast enterprises , mergers , trusts , and holding corporations , ownership has become divorced from management . The ownership of a huge concern may be vested in thousands of stock- and bondholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Banks and finance corporations more and more control ownership , and manipulate stock and bond issues . As profits of ownership increased by leaps and bounds and the owners could not spend their mounting incomes in more forms of conspicuous waste and did not care to give them to philanthropy , the profits went back into investments in new enterprises or into the expansion of old enterprises . Capital goods increased very rapidly . By 1930 , we had reached the situation wherein , for example , the shoe factories of the United States could produce eight and one-half pairs of shoes a year for every living human being resident in the country ( I usually wear out only one pair per annum ) . The automobile factories are equipped to produce several times as many automobiles as can be effectively consumed in the country . It is not necessary to go on with the story of mass production . Machine production has in part displaced human labor . This displacement is technological unemployment . Part of the displaced labor found other occupations getting out materials and the machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one instance that is very familiar to one . In a factory engaged in mak. ing automobile accessories , the old coke-operated foundry with the old-type molds was replaced by an automatically operated  | electric foundry ; thereby the number of men required to run the foundry was reduced from fifty to two . In this factory fifteen thousand spring shackle bolts are turned out and packed every twenty-four hours with less than seventy workers , most of whom are not required to have much skill . All the work , except picking up and packing the products , is done by automatic machines , which do not tire and are fed only oil . How was the ever increasing product of machine production , on farm as well as in factory , to be sold ? By increase of wages which , together with high-pressure salesmanship and instalment selling , brought a great increase in consumers ' demands . But real wages did not increase nearly as much as did owners ' profits . The surplus product was sold abroad , especially to Europe , South America , and Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of four and a quarter years ' war , and had largely lost its South American markets . Europe worked hard and borrowed credits from the United States to rebuild her industrial life , in addition to the paying of war debts . Germany must pay heavy reparations to France , England , and Italy who , with the German reparations , were paying their war debts to the United States and borrowing still more from Americans with which to pay for the goods they were buying from Americans . In brief , our post-war export trade with Europe was largely financed by loans to our customers . It seems to have been assumed that this process could go on indefinitely . But Europeans saw that it could not . Germany , France , England , and Italy were working hard to make up their own deficits and also to recapture their foreign trade . The United States was living in a fool 's paradise . We assumed that there would be no end to the get-rich-quick process . The first sign of the coming catastrophe was the collapse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On that one day shares declined in value eleven billion dollars . Of course values were artificial and absurdly high , due to the mania of stock gambling . There had been no decline in real capital . The factories and machines were intact , though to a large extent idle . But back of this cataclysmic development was the falling off in consumer 's demands , due to increase of technological  | unemployment and inability of those who were employed to buy any more articles , even on the instalment plan . At the same time began the sharp decline in exports to Europe and other foreign markets . This decline in foreign trade was increased by the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill , intended to exclude foreign goods . European and other nations , including Canada and the other British dominions , retaliated . The situation became more and more aggravated . It seems to have been the belief that the United States could go on indefinitely increasing its output of goods , collecting war debts from Europe , lending them credits to rehabilitate themselves economically , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the United States could collect on debts and loans and sell goods without buying goods from Europe . The simple principle was forgotten that business involves exchange of goods and services , that one can not do business with others if one does not buy from them . No nation can live as a creditor nation , or a debtor nation , alone . The next spectacular event after the panic of November 1929 was the moratorium on German reparations due to Germany 's utter inability to pay . If Germany can not pay France , England , and Italy , these countries can not pay us . The New Era has come to an end . There are several lessons to be drawn from it . First : War is tremendously wasteful of resources in men and goods . This waste must be made good by hard work . Sir Arthur Salter has said that one-eighth of the borrowings since the war has been productive ; seven-eighths has gone into the hole made by the destruction wrought by the war . The second and even more important lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two and only two ways in which terrible and frequently recurring depressions can be avoided and a reasonable , moderate , and continuous prosperity can be maintained . These are ( 1 ) The regulation of production by a planned economy ; whether by a system of State Socialism or voluntary cooperation . ( 2 ) The general distribution of a greater consuming power , by a more equitable spread of incomes . Both of these steps involve a reduction in profits , and an elimination of extravagant salaries paid to management . The salaries that  | have been paid in recent years to managers and officers of financial and even industrial corporations have been absurdly high . The report of the Federal Trade Commission on salaries to executives in leading corporations shows that from 1928 to 1932 over five hundred executives received yearly incomes in salaries and bonuses running from $1,650,000 to $50,000 , the latter being the minimum figure reported . This statement is based only on the lists published up to March 5 , 1933 , in the New York Times . A regiment of executives received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , including officers of insurance companies , received from $100,000 to $200,000 and not a few over $200,000 . This number does not include all such salaries . A number of concerns refused to report to the Federal Trade Commission.8 Below is a summary of the amounts paid in salaries and extra compensations to the executives of twelve large corporations : Table In 1935 , 350 officers , directors and managers of General Motors received an aggregate income , in salaries , bonuses and commissions , of $10,000,000 . The salaries of 13 head executives ran from $374,000 to $190,000 each . In some of their plants the average yearly wage of the workers was $1,500 , but of their total shop employees 55 per cent received an average yearly wage of $900.9 Other shining examples of very large incomes are found in the purveyors of cheap popular entertainment ; such as directors and Footnote  | film stars . As a general proposition it holds good that the more common the article of consumption the larger the incomes of those who manipulate its production and consumption . This holds good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full possession of his senses maintain that the contribution of the chief executives of the Bethlehem Steel Company and the American Tobacco Company to the common good are worth respectively 163 and 110 times as much a year as the services of a leading research scientist , in a university ? There are precious few research scientists who received $10,000 yearly salary , even in 1929 . Now many of their salaries have been cut as much as 20 to 33 per cent .  | BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT 1 . GOVERNMENT AIDS TO BUSINESS MANY of the most powerful business and financial interests in the United States are insisting that government should keep out of business , that we should return to the system of economic individualism by which the United States has become so great , and prosperity and a high standard of living so much more widely diffused and more rapidly increasing than anywhere else on earth . They say that private enterprise for profit , under free competition in the open market , has been the one great instrument of this progress . In the year 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber of Commerce , and the American Liberty League loudly reaffirmed these principles . They have not told us how free competition is to be restored , in the face of gigantic holding companies , trusts , monopolies , trade agreements , price-fixing by gentlemen 's agreements among competitors , without governmental interference ; nor how that helpless person , the small or moderate-sized investor , is to be protected in the securities market without governmental control . Let us look first at a few facts , selected almost at random , which show that big business is not consistent in its preaching and its practice on these points . a . The tariff was imposed , and has been stepped up , not for revenue but to keep prices up or to enable producers to raise prices . The argument that this has been done to protect , or raise , the American standard of living is specious . For , if prices to consumers rise as fast or faster than do wages , and do not fall as fast in depressions , then the average standard of living is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of manufactured goods fell very little from 1929-1933 , whereas farm produce declined about 60 per cent .  | b . Direct governmental aids to business . The Federal Department of Commerce is a great agency for the promotion and regulation of business . The Patent Office gives to inventors a seventeen-year monopoly on their inventions . Most of the profits are reaped by the exploiters . The Bureau of Standards carries on researches for the benefit of industry . The Federal Trade Commission , the Food and Drug Administration , the Bureau of Agricultural Economics , the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce , the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils , the Federal Farm Board , and the Interstate Commerce Commission are Federal agencies that have been in operation for some time . Their powers were enlarged and their activities much increased under the individualistic regime of Herbert Hoover . Their aims are to further efficiency , honesty , fair trading in business industry and agriculture . The Interstate Commerce Commission and many of the other bureaus were urged by business men to prevent unfair discriminations , secret rebates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid . The development of inland waterways , dams for flood control and irrigation projects , of which Boulder Dam is the greatest , the subsidizing of our merchant marine ? all are Federal aids to business , agriculture , and industry . In December 1931 , when the repeated prophecies of our business leaders that prosperity would return in a short time had been nullified and business was sinking deeper into the red , Herbert Hoover asked the establishment of the eight billion dollar Federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation to aid the sick railroads , banks , and the like . It was done . The government loaned six billions to keep afloat heavily capitalized enterprises ? many thousands of banks , building and loan companies , insurance companies , railroads , and so forth . A good deal of this the government will probably never get back . Now these same interests demand that the government get out of business . The devil was sick The devil a monk would be ; The devil got well The devil a monk was he . Examination of banks and regulations of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations  | to maintain prices , stock-exchange organizations to regulate trading in securities . The business corporation is itself a device authorized and protected by the government . Business has led , in most cases , in demanding that the government regulate business or authorize private organizations for regulation . Whether one wants government regulation evidently depends on whose ox is gored . Organized business is just like any other organized group seeking economic advantage . It wants whatever regulation is necessary to insure good profits and no regulation to interfere with the maximum profits . The only interest that business , as business , under economic individualism , has in the consumer is solely as a possible means of profit . d . Use of the Army and Navy to protect investments abroad . The Navy and the Marines have been used in Central American countries ? in Haiti , Santo Domingo , Cuba , Nicaragua ? to protect American investments there . The United States went into the World War largely , perhaps chiefly , because the German unrestricted submarine campaign was an interference with its trade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially Great Britain , which would be lost if the Allies lost the war . Business can not go on without governmental aid and control . The vaster and more complex business becomes , the more need there is of control . The crucial question is this : In whose interest shall business be controlled ; in the interests of the few who sit in the seats of the mighty , or in the interests of all the people ? 2 . PROFITS , POLITICS , AND THE LAW Attempts to regulate public utilities in the common interest have been largely futile , because our political system is an anachronism in the presence of large-scale industries , finance , and banking . We have forty-nine sets of laws in regard to banking and securities , forty-eight sets of laws regulating public utilities and transportation . Large concerns all do business throughout the nation . They should be subject to uniform regulation . The laws of the different states are often in conflict . The corporations have used their power , through lobbies , to  | prevent the passage of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in this way . Some legislators may have introduced laws for the purpose of getting rake-offs ; but , in the main , they have done so in what they honestly regarded as the public interest . The initiative in influencing legislation has generally come from the corporations . When they have failed to prevent the passage of certain laws inimical to profitmaking , they have often taken the other alternative of evading or beating the law . Striking examples of the relations between big business and politics are afforded by the struggle over the Wheeler-Rayburn Bill to regulate holding companies in the congressional session of 1935.1 The members of the Senate and the House were deluged with telegrams purporting to have been sent by their constituents . An investigation of the origin of nearly fifteen thousand telegrams from towns in Pennsylvania showed that only 3 had been paid for by the persons whose names were signed . Names of deceased persons and absentees were used . Individuals were paid for getting signatures , and names were taken from telephone directories . Of thirty-one thousand five hundred telegrams sent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons whose names were signed . The expenses were borne by subsidiaries of the Associated Gas and Electric Company . It was brought out , in the subsequent Senatorial investigation , that the holding company had spent between $800,000 and $900,000 to get the bill defeated . It had also threatened leading newspapers with withdrawal of advertising patronage if they did not refrain from criticism of holding companies and cease taking a favorable attitude towards the bill in question . The Cities ' Service Holding Company is said to have spent about $200,000 . Our law-making , in the main , is the result of an incessant battle of interests . This is true even in so apparently simple and clear a matter as regulation of automobile traffic . Danger to life is largely due to incompetent or mentally and financially irresponsible drivers , often with badly conditioned cars . In the state of Ohio , as in most other states , it has not been possible to get through laws requiring a driver 's license and proof of Footnote  | financial responsibility as a condition of issuance of tags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( 1 ) the large number of persons who object to submitting to responsible control , who do not want to carry liability insurance , and ( 2 ) perhaps the influence of automobile dealers . In the matter of public taxation , the conflict goes on in every legislature . Americans in general would much rather pay taxes in the form of high prices to private business than pay direct taxes for the common good . So we have incessant conflict and lobbying in legislative halls , with business and industry , finance , public utilities , highway interests , farmers , and so on , all trying to saddle the burden of taxation on the other groups . The same principle holds true in national affairs . Group interests , regional interests , are in incessant conflict in regard to taxation . The influence of big business on legislation and administration is further shown by the fact that large corporations contribute heavily to the funds of both the major parties . Whichever one wins , they expect favorable consideration . Seven corporations have a grand total of revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal states have revenues of 669 millions a year . There are over five hundred lobbies in Washington , most of which have plenty of money for entertainment and propaganda . In 1921 there were 170 legislative lobbies in Ohio , in California 127 . In the framing of the 1929 tariff the expert clerk employed by the chairman of the Senate Tariff Committee was assistant to the President of the Connecticut Manufacturer 's Association . It was estimated that the tariff increases added 70 million dollars a year to the receipts of Connecticut industries . Judge Seabury states that the evils which the two utility monopolies , the Consolidated Gas Company and the New York Edison Company , now the Consolidated Edison Company , have fastened on New York City can be remedied only by municipal ownership.2 Lincoln Steffens , in his Autobiography , gives a unique record in this line . He found , by extensive experience , that business Footnote  | interests were on the alert to influence state legislatures , and especially municipal governments . He concludes that the professional politicians were on the whole more loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words , " politicians , " and " politics , " have a bad name . I find they always raise a cynical smile or even a laugh among students . But what the people who smile or laugh at politicians , and call politics a dirty trade , fail to realize , is that the joke is really on them . Politicians are the creatures of the people who elect them . This bad odor of politics reflects the greed and shortsightedness , or at least the selfish indifference and lack of concern for the common good and culpable ignorance , on the part of the voters . Our widespread corruption and inefficiency in politics and government , the lawlessness of strong corporations and individuals , only reflect the combination of economic greed and disregard of the common weal of great numbers of our population . The ramifications of financial interests are very wide and increasingly powerful in our social and political life . There is all the greater need that we should be alert and think clearly in regard to the conditions of the public or common weal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good people pay for indifference to public affairs , is to be ruled by evil men . Much of our recent history is an illustration on a tremendous scale of the truth of this saying . The difference between little Athens and America is one of size and complexity . It is undoubtedly the case that the larger the unit of legislation and administration , the less corruption and the less inefficiency . There is more in the cities than in the larger state governments and administrations , and much more in state affairs than in Federal affairs . It is well known that the great Postal Service is efficiently administered . The present writer has had frequent and extensive contact with the administration of the National Park and the Forestry Service , having toured through forty-six states . The service is efficient , honest , and courteous . In the practice of law , a chief scandal is the large fees collected for small services . I am not writing here of the large  | retainers given by millionaire clients to great lawyers , but of the absurd fees charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , are illustrations of the cost of foreclosure of a home with a mortgage of $3,500 on it , a very modest home : $30 was the fee for searching the title , $25 for computing the costs ( which would take about fifteen minutes of a clerk 's time ) , $190 for legal advertisement of the foreclosure and sale in two designated newspapers ; $50 for the auctioneer and his room ; $100 for a court referee at the sale , and $500 for the lawyer to bring the foreclosure proceeding ? a total of $900 , which comes out of the remains of the savings of the man who is losing his home.3 Comment on this system of legal fleecing seems superfluous . It is of a piece with the whole gigantic system of skinning the helpless and innocent victims of economic disaster . The abuses and inefficiency of the judicial system are great . Judges and other officers of the law are elected and have to keep their ears to the ground if they seek reelection . They are therefore apt to be susceptible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses . The legal tricks , evasions , and technicalities in the trials of persons with political , financial , or journalistic influence are a scandal that bring the law into disrepute . Another scandal is the increasing number of incompetent and shyster lawyers that are practicing : ambulance-chasers , counselors for tax-evaders , gangsters , racketeers , political hucksters . One chief source of the failure of our legislatures is that there are too many cheap lawyers in them . Lawyers make their living chiefly in dealing with business contracts and disputes and therefore are tempted to be on the side of the stronger financial powers . It is a noteworthy fact that successful lawyers , successful in the sense of getting large incomes , are not always on the side of economic , social , and political reform . The late President and Chief Justice of the United States , William H. Taft , said that the administration of the country 's criminal laws was a " disgrace to civilization . " In no other highly civilized country is the proportion of crime to the population , especially of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Footnote  | In no other country is so small a proportion of criminals brought to justice . At the present time crime " exacts a yearly toll of some $12,000,000 and vastly more than can be measured in mere money , in misery , death , and weakened morale . " 4 What are the causes of this appalling situation ? It has been quite usual to blame it on the large proportion of criminally minded foreigners in the country . Many of the criminals bear Italian and Slavonic names . No doubt this is a factor . But too many notorious criminals bear old British and Irish names to make foreign origin a plausible explanation for our high criminal record . No , together with the recent gigantic operations of malefactors of great wealth , it marks the breakdown of public morality in the United States . It can not be ' laid to flaws in criminal procedure . As Earl W. Evans said , in the address previously quoted , it is a question of the personnel of courts , juries , and police . The corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the gross inefficiency where corruption can not be charged , must be laid to the door of the general public . How ? The major part of the general public , by its inertia , gives tacit consent to the general operation of the rule that officers of the law are to be elected or appointed through political influence . In no other civilized country are judges , sheriffs , and so on elected for short terms as candidates of a political party . In no other country are their subordinates appointed as rewards for political activity . The public further shows its indifference to this question by the inertia of its legislative representatives . There are fortyeight sets of state criminal laws . They are not uniform ( nor consistent with one another , nor with the Federal laws ) . Several years ago the American Law Institute proposed a model set of uniform laws ? on such matters as the sale of narcotics and drugs , firearms and machine-guns , and so on . No one of these laws has been adopted by more than ten states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This apathy on the part of the public , as we make mighty efforts to pull out of the economic depression , means the decline of public morality . It means that as a Footnote  | people we have become selfish materialists , interested primarily in our private economic well-being and ease . It is an unintelligent , shortsighted selfishness . We have to pay dearly for crime through taxation . Any one of us may have at any moment to pay a far heavier price in misery and death . Another expression of unintelligence is the sloppy sentimentalism of the sob sisters in regard to criminals . In the meantime , during the great depression , the legislative representatives of the people in general passed greatly prolonged sessions in quarreling over taxes and appropriations , while the public school system was breaking down for lack of adequate provision . The state legislatures are representatives of the people . They are driven hither and yon by special groups , each of which wants to unload the chief burden of taxation on the other groups ? farmers , merchants , manufacturers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rank and file of the people sit by , apathetic and inert except when they suffer actual want or their pockets are touched . But the sales of automobiles have jumped by leaps and bounds . There has been no great decline in the sale of movie tickets or gasoline . Roads and streets are being improved . 3 . PROFITS AND CRIME Apart from crimes of passion ( motivated by sex love and jealousy ) the causes of crime are very complex . Individuals differ much in the relative strength of their various impulses and desires . Some can stand strains and thwartings that break others . There is no uncaused human action . Man is not free in the sense of being able to act in opposition to his strongest impulses , as these are incited or blocked by his social environment . Those respectable persons , perhaps without intense impulses , who have always lived in decent surroundings and in relative comfort , who talk glibly about the freedom and the responsibility of the whole tribe of criminals , talk in ignorance and blindness . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being taken to the hangman 's scaffold , " there but for the grace of God goes John Bunyan . "  | There are doubtless born criminals just as there are born idiots ? unfortunately born individuals in whom the elements are not kindly mixed , unbalanced natures that become antisocial . But the term antisocial is too wide and vague . What is antisocial in an American urban community to-day was not antisocial among Geronimo 's Apaches or the head-hunting Dyaks . There are features of our individualist capitalism that tend to produce many more criminals than those that are born to be criminals . I have space only to touch briefly on these features . 1 . Individualistic capitalism has produced terrible urban slum conditions . The old Whitechapel in London , the old Lower Bowery , Five Points , and large portions of the New York East Side were ( and still are ) prolific breeding grounds of vice and crime . Overcrowding , dirt , squalor , lack of air and playground spaces , together with dire poverty , breed vice and crime . The writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker in a settlement . There are also slum conditions in the rural districts . Boys and girls must have outlets for their ripening impulses . Boys naturally form gangs . These gangs , under slum conditions , easily take the direction of law-breaking. 2 . Capitalism , by its very emphasis on self-seeking greed , breeds an egotistic materialism of attitude that fosters crime . It sacrifices the common good to the material advantages of the individual or the group . The only discernible difference between some business actions and crimes is that the former manage either to keep within the letter of the law or to evade and circumvent the law , whereas the criminal gets caught in its toils . 3 . The spectacle of the great hauls made in business by deceit and fraud in the manipulation of securities , by fraudulent goods , by collusion , chicanery , and corruption , stimulates the criminally inclined . We have now the spectacle of racketeering conspiracies in many lines ? in foods , building , alcoholic drinks , narcotics , traffic in women , and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing the passage of laws and in evading their operation , is , I hold , one of the main causes of the growth of lawlessness and crime in this country . With so many examples  | of big business above the law , the small racketeer and other professional criminals do not see why they should not " get theirs " by fixing the police , the juries , and even judges . Bootlegging was , of course , the most fruitful source of racketeering . Al Capone , Murray Lewellyn Humphries , Mooney Gordon , Bugs Moran , and Owen V. Madden are noted racketeers . Their philosophy is summed up in Mr. Madden 's remarks , after he had invested his savings in a Brooklyn wet-wash laundry and received nominal dividends : " Legit rackets ? there ai n't no sense to ' em ? you 've got to wait for your dough . " The big-shots in these rackets live well and aspire to high society . If only one-half of what is reported by those who claim to know be true , there are great organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most noted universities . ' 4 . A cause of crime is permanent or long-time unemployment . During the depression of the 1930 's many persons became criminals from desperation . They were hungry and homeless or their children were cold and starving . It is a terrible situation for a father or mother to see their children shivering and wasting away in a land in which there is so much foodstuff that it is being destroyed to force prices up , so much cotton that it is being plowed under , abundance of materials , machinery , and men to build better dwellings , while millions live in vile shacks or are crowded together in dirty , dark tenements . After all , as I have repeatedly said ( and it can not be said too often to those " at ease in Zion " ) this is the most damning indictment of our so-called civilization . It is making a great success of wresting from her the secrets for the control of nature and a ghastly failure in applying its discoveries to the common weal . 5 . Crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our jails and penitentiaries are utter disgraces to a country claiming to be civilized . The buildings are old and greatly overcrowded . There is lack of opportunity for healthful exercise and healing work . The personnel is poorly paid and inferior . There is lack of classification and separation of criminals . The psy-Footnote  | chiatric work is very defective . There are not adequate facilities for rehabilitation in socially normal ways of living . The convicts are herded together like a lot of wild animals and treated as a herd , whereas criminals are individuals .  | MAN 'S THREEFOLD NATURE M AN is a threefold being ! He is an animal organism , a biochemical machine , a system of energy transformers , whose functions are , to a preponderating extent , carried out without vividly conscious awareness . Under the control of the autonomic nervous system , the involuntary muscles , the heart and the circulatory system , the ductless glands ? and to some extent the other glands ? and the digestive system carry on their work . Only under subnormal or supernormal functioning does there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentient psychical being . He has sense perceptions of the outer world and of his own organic processes in eye , ear , nose , skin , muscle , mucous membrane , and deeper tissues . He feels impulses to act . These impulses are accompanied by psychic cravings ? hunger , thirst , craving for bodily comfort , restlessness , the cravings to play and to make things , gregarious impulse , sex impulse , rivalry . The satisfaction of these impulses yield pleasure and their defeat pain . Man is also motivated by fear , which arises from a threatened or actual defeat of his impulsive activities . Man has the power of vivid reproduction , in memory images , of his past successes and defeats with their accompanying pleasures and pains ; and his memory images become interwoven in various sorts of connections , by association in time , in space and in similarity of affective quality or emotional coloring . Through the psychical complications of his experiences , arising out of success and failure of his rudimentary impulses and cravings , man becomes a creature of conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes for the attainment of the desired objects , of fears of their non-attainment . As a psychical being , the basic determinants of man 's actions are his loves and hates .  | These are the roots of his valuations . They are not only the springs of his overt actions . They actually determine to a great extent what the individual shall perceive and not perceive , by attention and inattention , both in the surrounding world and in his own organic processes . Of course , the perceptions of the world or self depend on the normality of the capacities of the sense organs and are limited by the nature of these organs . But , within this general human circle of possible experience , what specifically the individual actually experiences , consciously and clearly , depends on attention , which is determined by his interests ? his desires and aversions , loves and hates . There are many features and relationships in nature that I see because I like them ; others that I ignore because they do not interest me . The same is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my fellow men and myself . I do not wish to see certain of my failings ; I do not desire to see certain qualities in other persons and I do not see them if I can help it . Sometimes these things are forced on one willy-nilly . The individual of wide and keen perceptive experience and sympathies is the individual of wide and keen interests . This , I take it , is Plato 's meaning in making love ( Eros ) the mainspring of human actions and knowledge . My world is primarily what I love ; secondly , it includes what I hate or have an aversion to ; thirdly , it includes things that intrude on my awareness , but in which I have to recognize certain qualities and processes in nature , in other men , and even in myself , that hinder the satisfaction of my loves and hates . But hate is secondary . Even a fierce hatred which blazes up like a consuming fire of destruction , or a cold deadly hatred that has become the controlling passion of an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwarting of some strong love . We hate the things or persons that kill or maim the things or persons that we love , that prevent or injure our union with the loved objects . No one primarily hates anything . He hates that which injures or threatens some object of love ? whether other person , or own self , or thing . Tell me what you love and what you dislike and I know what you are . Man is a spiritual being . Above his psychophysical impulses  | and dispositions is his nature as a spiritual person . This spiritual endowment or being ? what is it ? In the first place man has the power of creative imagining . He does not merely reproduce his past experience . He can break up the images which arise from the traces of past experiences , and form them into new combinations . Like the musician , man , as an inventor and genius in the useful and fine arts and in the art of living itself , can form out of three sounds , not a fourth sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mere play of associative fancy , is the primary source of man 's power to progress ; not only in the arts by which he refashions sensuous materials by cunning inventions , but in the re-creation of human relations and ideals ? in the creation and re-creation of social folk-ways and customs ; of systems of morals , laws , and polities ; of religions , mythologies , sciences , and philosophies . As an intellectual being , man can carry analysis and synthesis of the elements of experience far beyond the imaginal data of experience . He invents symbols to carry his loves and desires , his positive interests and his aversions , beyond the data of the senses ; conventional language , all the way from pictorial symbols and words freighted with emotional , intelligible , and mystical meaning , to the most abstruse symbols of logic , mathematics , and music . These symbols become the carriers of new emotional meanings and aspirations as such ; and of the logical , ethical , and mystical relations between the meanings as spiritual systems embodying fervent aspiration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a metaphysical Absolute . Man as a spiritual being forms symbols of ethical spiritual values ? of honor , justice , mercy , love , holiness . He frames visions of a perfected humanity , of a kingdom of God , of human beings realizing their natures as sons of God in communion and fellowship with one another . Or , if he thinks the name God superfluous , he may tie up to the vision of an ideal commonwealth of humanity ( religious humanism of to-day ) . Man as a spiritual being is inspired by visions of beauty , of esthetic harmony and meaning in sensuous forms of stone and wood and clay , pigments and sound ; as well as healed by corn-  | mullion with nature . Man as a spiritual being can sacrifice his individuality , his very life , for the ideals engendered in his spirit . He will not only live and work but die , if need be , for his loved ones , his country , or for truth , or justice , or honor , or for his religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat and whine about their condition , " and he is impatient with men for doing so . But that men sweat and whine about their condition is , on the very face of the matter , evidence that they are more than animals . The entire course of human civilization , of the changes in social culture and the incessant striving of man for a better life ? for a finer culture ? is the expression of his spiritual nature . As Max Scheler puts it , " Man is the sick animal " ; and his sickness as an animal is the condition of his health as a human being . It is as a spiritual being that man is responsible and free . Man 's freedom is not unlimited . He is limited by his natural environment and his own inherited dispositions . Within these limitations , man has the freedom of the spirit to choose whether he shall live as a spiritual being or , making no effort , slip down into the life of animality . Since the latter life is one of complete dependence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bondage . The life of the spirit is the free life , since it is the life of dependence mainly on what constitutes the higher nature ? the cultural climate in which man becomes most independent of physical circumstances and most rational , social , and selfsufficing . To be free is to live as a rational spirit : To be in utter bondage is , for a being with a spark of spirit , to live as an animal . In all probability the human species is the result of a long process of evolution from the lower species , perhaps going back to some rudimentary unicellular organism . During this evolution there has been an incessant struggle for adaptation to the environmental conditions of existence . The environment includes the climate and the food conditions supplied by the inorganic factors and other organisms , on which the organism under consideration feeds . In this struggle for survival , striking variations or mutations have taken place which have fitted the members  | of the species to adapt themselves more successfully to the environmental conditions . We need not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whether they arose partly as the result of inner effort and are transmitted to the offspring ( the inheritance of acquired characteristics ) , or arose wholly as the result of chance combinations of the genes or unit characters . Indeed , these questions are as yet unsettled ; but even if inheritance of acquired characteristics useful to members of the species be ruled out , it would not necessarily follow that the origination of new organs with better powers of adaptation has been the result solely of blindly arising physicochemical changes . There may have been a creative organizing factor . Indeed , I hold that there has been , but this is not the place to discuss such questions . We are concerned here solely with the animal nature of man in its bearing on ethics and social philosophy ; in short with his dominant impulses , regardless of how he came to be what he is . While evolution sheds much light on what man is , it is what he is and can become that concerns us here ; not by what natural factors he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive on the earthly scene . From our standpoint the differences between man and other animals , including his own supposed distant cousins , the higher apes , are more important than the resemblances . It is the possession of higher intelligence and of the feelings that go with it that most differentiates man from the higher animals . Intelligence means the capacity to analyze , or break up , the complex flow of sense experience into its elements ; and to synthesize , or recombine , these analyzed elements . This analytic-synthetic activity is the source of all inventiveness and genuine discovery . In so far as an animal is tied down to the actual flow of sense experience , it does not invent , does not discover anything important . It may accidentally hit upon an important discovery , but it will not know how to make use of it . It can not communicate or transmit with certainty without language and means of record . The higher anthropoids do form permanent sexual unions , but they do not have any other permanent social groups .  | There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) Man , in his intelligent activity , has a much longer time-range ; he lives much further backward by retaining and reproducing past experiences ; consequently he lives much further forward . He can utilize past experience to provide for a far distant future . ( 2 ) Man , alone , has the power of articulate speech . It is a tremendous advantage to be able to store up and communicate , in intelligible form , the distillates of past experience and thus to make plans for the future . The accumulation and transmission of the social heritage of culture depends primarily upon this power of communication . Of course , neuromuscular skills are also transmitted ; but their transmission and perpetuation are greatly enhanced by articulate speech . And when written symbols are devised and literacy arises , the scope for accumulation and transmission of the social heritage is greatly increased . ( 3 ) Society , the most distinctive feature of human life , is the development of social cultural groups large and more enduring than the family ? from the gens , the phratry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the territorial state , and the empire . The development of these larger groups depends upon articulate speech . They are the media of culture ; in them culture is preserved and enhanced . By cultural conservation and increase they flourish . The customs or folk-ways ? especially the tribal ceremonies of initiation at puberty , marriage , the preparations for the chase and for war , the religious and magical authority given to tribal ways , the laws and other institutions , the sacred myths ? all these things are means for preserving , and insuring the prevalence of , the social culture of the group . Conformity to the traditional patterns of group behavior is insured through the persistent influence of social approval . The individual self is the echo of the tribal self . " A man is more like his time than he is like his father and mother " ( Chinese proverb ) . When literacy is achieved , then formal educational institutions serve more effectively to select , preserve , and transmit the cultural heritage of the group . New departures or inventions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture ? customs , morals , myths , religions ,  | and science , as well as material culture ? have great difficulty in making headway against the traditional forms . The conservatives regard the old ways as best . The innovators or radicals always have a hard time . They may pay for their pioneering with unpopularity , death , or exile . Material culture usually changes faster than mental and spiritual culture . For the latter is rooted in fundamental sentiments and attitudes , which are deeply implanted in the mental habitudes that begin to be formed right after birth . The plasticity of the human infant and child and the difficulty of changing mental attitudinal habits , early formed , is expressed in the saying attributed to the Jesuits : " Let us have the child up to its seventh year and we do not care who has him thereafter . " William James extended the time considerably when he said in effect : most of us get no new ideas or habits after the age of from twenty-five to thirty . In general , the accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount , of change in the social cultures . There seem to be in the history of cultures long periods of relative quiescence ; followed by the intermingling of different cultures , with rapid change and the multiplication of inventions . Fruitful contacts in the Eastern Mediterranean accelerated change from about 3000 B.C. on . There was a great speeding up in the Hellenic world from the eighth century to the Greco-Roman or Hellenistic era . Then came wide diffusion , to the downfall of the Roman Empire ; then disintegration . There followed the maturing of medieval culture and its partial break up with the Renaissance and Reformation ; and the development , in the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries of our present culture . At present the oriental cultures are disintegrating and being re-formed on occidental behavior patterns ? both with respect to material and spiritual culture . The rate of social change , in industry , family , law , property , morality , has been speeded up by the accumulation of inventions . I hold also that the innate feelings of man differ from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of comparative intelligence , we must infer the psychical processes from their products ? the records of them . Man , as Spirit , is the being who creates , and lives by , cultures . He creates languages , records  | ( technical or applied ) , and fine arts ; legal , political , and moral systems ; sciences , religions , and philosophies . In and by these he lives and moves , and has his being . The paintings and sculptures found in the caves of Dordogne and Spain , and , too , the forms of burial and material evidences ( in pottery and sculpture ) of religious ceremonials extending from Paleolithic and Neolithic times ? all these things show that early man had the same feelings and powers of imagination that civilized man has to-day ; that he not only loved his family and felt loyalty and duty to his group , but that he loved beauty , had a strong constructive impulse , and pondered on the mysteries of birth and death . A painting or figurine from the Pyrenees , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? such things reveal the sameness of human feeling , imagination , and thought throughout the ages . Tribes and states may come and go , but culture goes on forever . It suffers arrest and partial decay ? from war , pestilence , and economic distress ; but it never wholly dies out unless the region in which it lives becomes a desert . Mechanistic philosophers show a singular blindness to the multiform , ever enduring , and ever varying forms of culture in which man expresses his creative spirit , and by which the spirit in him lives . 1blan is a very peculiar animal ; nay , he is more than an animal , he is a spirit . Anything is what it does and the human spirit , from Paleolithic times , has been taking three sounds and forming from them " not a fourth sound , but a star . " The creative imagination , as S. T. Coleridge truly said , is the supreme power in man . His spirit ; the creative intellect which creates and moves in the symbols of logic , mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination weaving gossamer webs of meaning through operation with symbols denuded of senuous imagery . Man is a stranger and pilgrim in the animal world . His continuing city is not here . He seeketh another whose builder and maker is the spirit . In sketching the spiritual nature of man , I am describing a general fact . I am not discussing the metaphysical question as Footnote  | to the ultimate relations of interdependence between the physical , biopsychical and spiritual levels . This book keeps to the descriptive analysis of human nature . The metaphysical questions involved are among the most complex and difficult problems that the mind can wrestle with . Perhaps they are insoluble . Nevertheless , since thinking man must raise these questions , it is possible to weigh the respective degrees of plausibility of different world-views . My own standpoint is : that world-view is most adequate which does not dogmatically obliterate any essential qualitative differences in the realm of experience in the fanatical striving to get a completely unified or monistic picture . Therefore , I regard mechanistic materialism , vitalism , and pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-views . I can not see how the spiritual activities of man can be explained as mere by-products of the blind motions of electron protons or mass particles of any sort . Nor can I attach any real meaning to the doctrine that matter is illusory or transitory , and that the eternal reality is disembodied spirit . Nor can I see that spirit can be reduced to mere animal life . To me , personality , the richest form of finite being , is physical , vital and spiritual . I go on to the view that nature is the body of Infinite Personality . I have , in other works , discussed these questions . It would take us too far afield to discuss the various meanings which are attached to the term " personality . " For the sake of clearness I state briefly what I do not and do- mean by personality.z When it is said , " " The philosophical concept treats personality as an invariant point of experience " ; that is pretty nearly completely wrong , not only with respect to my own view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by personality the psychophysical , therefore , conscious and reflective , unity of a self that has developed from a biopsychical organism through the continuous stimulation of the social **30;1298;TOOLONG effective in the culture in which this individual lives , Footnote  | moves and has his being . A personality is a socialized individual . I would be a different personality had I been born and reared among the head hunting Dyaks of Borneo , or the Trobriand Islanders , or in a Chinese , Russian , or Indian village . My personality has changed and perhaps will continue to change a little . On the other hand , the behaviorist notion that personality is nothing but the end-product of the habit systems produced by the conditioning of the original unconditioned reflexes , which are assumed to be similar and equal in all babies in the world , by the physico-social environmental patterns , is wrong . The behaviorist assumes , not only that man at birth is merely an assembled organic machine , but also that all the young machines are alike . J. B. Watson once said that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make anything he liked out of it by the right conditioning . If this were true , the only problem of social order would be to agree as to what kind of robots we wanted to produce . Then we could fit our educational , economic , political , and legal conditioning to produce the desired robots , and the social problem would be straightway solved ; we should enter upon the millennial harmony of a world of robots . This theory is false and unworkable for two reasons , the second of which follows from the first . The first is that we can not agree as to just what sort of human robot we want to produce in quantity . The second is that , if we tried to enforce an agreement , the enterprise would not work because of the inborn differences in individuality . In Soviet Russia they have tried it and have had to retreat from it . They will have to retreat farther or go to smash . The Nazis and Fascists are doing the same thing . In the long run no social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native differences in individuality and the social values of these differences ; from which come the values of personality . Not only is each and every individual a private center of values , but individuals are born different in their combination of the potentialities common to humanity . The best social system will be one which begins by respecting the original individuality of man . Even in the case of identical twins each twin has his own inner tang and flavor of personal experience .  | THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE GROUP SPIRIT 1 . SOCIETY MADE UP OF GROUPS T HE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS of social ethics can be best approached through the consideration of the psychology of group participation . There are , of course , all sorts of groups , from the casual group such as a crowd at a football game or at an accident or a street fight , to the State and the Church . The important groups are chiefly of two sorts . First , the smaller and more intimate groups of individuals united by shared interests such as : a family , the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a college , or a religious congregation . Second , the large institutional groups which , while they exist to satisfy shared interests , to realize common ends , are ? by reason of their extent , the number of individuals they include and their temporal duration ? not face-to-face groups . Such are : the large university , the whole church , the political institutions , the nation . The unity and continuity of these groups is expressed through symbols : through the linguistic and other expressions of their forms of organization and purposes ? uniforms , rituals , flags , fetichistic devices such as fasci and swastikas , creeds and sacred objects . The great difference between simple or more primitive societies and a modern complex society can be put in this way : In primitive society there are but few groups , and individuality is less varied , because the human animal is developed by opportunities and incitements to participation in the various group spirits . These are age and sex groups ; childhood , puberty groups with initiation into manhood and womanhood ; hunting , fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs , old men 's groups ? and no more . The groups , being fewer in variety , probably have  | more influence in shaping the individual but they shape him in a simpler mold . I suspect that individuality is less marked in simpler societies , not because it is actually repressed , but because of the relative paucity of incitements and patterns for its realization . By contrast , consider the groups that an American to-day may join ! Americans are great " joiners . " The writer belongs to a family , a neighborhood , several university groups , a club or two , a few learned societies , a church , a civic association , a cooperative society , several public-interest associations . For years six months have never gone by in which he has not been urged to join some other groups of which the purposes are worthy , but which cost time and money . Conflicts arise between different group interests . There may arise an acute conflict between the vocational group interest and some other group interest ; for example between labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and groups whose function it is to defend vested interests . Conflicts arise between liberalism in regard to religion on the part of teachers , and the dogmas and emotional prejudices of religious groups . Conflicts arise between teachers ' interests in the furtherance of social justice , through enlightenment upon the questions of vested finance , utilities , industry , politics and law ; and these vested interests . It is difficult to get any agreement among these complex and varied group interests as to the recognition of a fundamental common interest or common good , which all special group interests should be made to serve . Each group sees and fights for the interests and purposes to further which it exists ? from the family to the labor union , the holding companies , the investment bankers , and the Stock Exchange . One group does not see the interests of the other groups . The central function of the State is to make effective the common interest and to keep each group interest in its place as subservient to the common good . If the State fails in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fails to be a true state . It becomes the dictatorship of some  | special power group ? here Fascists , there Nazis , elsewhere the powerful financial interest . It has been remarked that the State belongs in fact to the powerful group that knows exactly what it wants . Unfortunately , there is much truth in this cynical statement . The State power should belong to no special group . It should be above all particular groups . It should aim only at the greatest good of the greatest number . The fundamental problem of social ethics is to define a set of interests that must be basic ? a Common Good . In the following section further illustrations will be given of group morality . 2 . THE MEANING OF SOCIAL CULTURE Social culture consists , first , of the institutions or forms of organization through which the individual members are associated in various ways : ( 1 ) Sex and family institutions ; ( 2 ) economic 1 and property institutions ; ( 3 ) political institutions ? the government of the larger group ( clan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes ; ( 5 ) other customs and laws ; ( 6 ) religious institutions ; ( 7 ) educational institutions and " cultural " systems in the narrow sense , such as movements and schools of art , literature , science , and philosophy . Social culture consists , secondly , of the sociopsychical attitudes engendered in individuals by living within the institutional framework of the various social groups . The " natural " individual is socialized through the impact upon him of the group patterns of action and thought on his original nature . The individual is amenable to socialization through his dependence , especially in his long period of childhood and adolescence , upon the older members of the group ; through his innate susceptibility to suggestion , his imitativeness , his fear of disapproval , his desire for the approval of his fellows , his fear of punishment , his desire for recognition and esteem , reward , success . The group system of culture operates upon the individual through education and Footnote  | example . The formal processes of education , in the family , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational process . It goes on wherever , and so long as , the individual is plastic and therefore positively responsive . The true teacher is always being taught . The mentally alive individual is always learning from his fellows . The question which comes first , the individual or the group , is thus a senseless question ? as senseless as the question which comes first , the hen , or the egg . The human animal becomes a truly human person only as a participating member of a social culture . His personality is molded out of his natural individuality , by his reactions to social stimuli and patterns . There can be no normal and human development except in a social culture . On the other hand , the group is made up of individuals living in intercommunication , interaction and interpassion , functioning within a traditional culture . We can not find any absolute origins for human society . We have to begin with man the individual in the group . For man is man only in a social culture . The origin of culture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man from the higher anthropoids is that , as a socially conditioned being , he both creates and is created by , the system of social culture . Because of his capacity for articulate speech and for many inventions , from fire and music to the photo-electric eye , he is able to associate with his fellows in ever widening communications ; and able to transmit from generation to generation an ever increasing social heritage of culture . The time-span that he can command grows ever larger and richer in content ; thus his purposive activity is projected ever further into the future . As Hegel said : Man is suckled at the breast of the communal ethos , the spirit of the community 's culture . As Kant said : Man is an unsocially social being . He does not always get along well with his fellows , but he can not get along at all without them . No man , be he day laborer , scholar , or Napoleon of finance , can escape the influence of the prevailing ethos , the spirit of his community or people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exists to further human values ; to enable men to lead better lives . This applies all along the line , from the family to the nation  | and the international agreements . The primary question that the philosopher asks in regard to any society or community is this : what human values rule in this community ? This is a question of factual analysis . The second question is this : do these values really further human welfare ? Is the order of values that effectively operates in this community the best possible ? To answer these questions one must take a long look at the various orders of social values that have emerged in human history , and make a penetrating comparison of them . The critical question becomes ? is this community , this nation , really civilized , is it really a humane culture ? Barbarism and civilization are , of course , comparative terms . I can not go into details about them here . I desire to emphasize this principle : a civilization is a genuinely humane culture in the degree in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their distinctively human capacities as far as possible . These capacities are : growth in fellowship , in love , in knowledge of nature and man , in self-control and selfrespect , in the enjoyment of beauty and truth , in communion with one another . 3 . THE . GROUP SPIRIT OR ETHOS There are three factors in determining the beliefs , attitudes and conduct of men . These are : ( 1 ) the natural or biological inheritance ; ( 2 ) the social heritage ; ( 3 ) the religio-metaphysical factor . The Natural or Biological Inheritance . The inborn biological urges or impulses have remained constant through man 's recorded history . The impulse to self-preservation , sexual gratification , desire for offspring , the gregarious impulse , the play impulse , selffeeling and the impulse of workmanship are much the same in all races and climes . The inborn impulses vary in strength from individual to individual , and perhaps there are temperamental differences between the great divisions of the human race ? the Whites , Yellows , and Blacks . Perhaps there are racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy-goluckier type than the white man . The Mongol and the North American Indian seem more stolid than either ; and yet , the  | Southern yellow man in Malaya and China is given to outbursts of running amuck . There are marked differences in temperament in different American Indian tribes ; perhaps due to climatic influences and living habits . The higher powers of imagination and reasoning are also pretty constant in the race , and variable in individuals . There is no evidence of any increase in man 's native intellectual capacity during recorded time . There are fortunate conjunctions of racial circumstance with higher percentages of exceptionally gifted individuals which give rise to creative epochs . The greatest of these creative epochs in the West was , perhaps , Periclean Athens . Some writers hold that , in Western civilization to-day , the average intellectual capacity is declining , owing to the preservation and reproduction of the inferior stock . This may or may not be so . There are two considerations that make it doubtful . First , the much better records we keep now of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our complex and dynamic civilization may be temporarily proving too much for many individuals . We have not yet adjusted ourselves to so many novel and dangerous playthings . Whether there are marked differences in the higher mentality is a debatable point . Certainly the comparative histories of the white and yellow races on the whole do not clearly establish the intellectual superiority of the former . The Social Heritage . This is the social factor in determining the individual 's attitude . I shall call this factor the ethos or spirit of a group . By the ethos I mean the entire complex of ways of behavior , belief , and thought that makes up a social culture ? everything from the useful arts , social structures such as the family , moral customs and legal codes , up to the prevailing attitudes in regard to the fine arts and " useless " knowledge and speculation . The ethos is the total social-mental climate of the groups in which the individual mind lives , moves and has its being . In its influence in molding the individual the ethos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is first . It produces human sacrifice , cruel persecution , war , and beastliness . It also produces works of justice , mercy , and love . It fosters or kills science and the fine arts . It stones its prophets and then builds  | stately sepulchers and statues to them . The ethos 2 is more than a set of institutions , rules and laws . It is a subtle intangible spirit that is in the air of a community , that permeates and affects in some degree the feeling , thought , and action of every member of the community . Every stable and well organized group is a cultural whole . It has its material culture , its set of implements or artifacts and ways of providing the means of existence and defense for its members . It has its system of human relations embodied in institutions , customs or folk-ways , laws and religious attitudes . Its instrumental imperatives grow out of the means for the satisfaction of biological needs ; self-preservation , comfort , propagation . So there grow up whole systems of cooperative acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting , preparing , and consuming food ; as to the proper ways of courting , marrying , and giving in marriage ; as to the proper ways of bringing up the young and initiating them into society , into the life of the family clan , tribe or nation ; as to the proper ways of defending the group against its animal and human enemies ; as to the proper ways of controlling the mysterious and super-ordinary forces which environ it ( Nana and Magic ) ; as to the proper ways of standing-in right with the unseen Superior Personal Beings who control the superordinary forces or are themselves possessors of superior powers ? Ghosts , Spirits , the High Gods ; as to the best ways of refreshment , and recreation , and enhance-Footnote  | ment of the powers of the group and the individual through communal and individual play and art ? in song , and dance , and forms of mimicry . The prosperity and continuity of the life of the community is the primary and paramount social need , to which individual impulses and desires must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social ethos . Even the most rational critical and individualistic ethics must start from this primary need , unless the individual is ready and able to find a desert retreat and live wholly by himself . Ethics is meaningless apart from the primary interests of social cooperation . This does not imply a real social mind and will , over and above the minds of individuals in relation of interdependence and cooperation . The collective will and mind simply means a fundamental sameness of reaction , feeling and ideation on the part of members of the same group ; due to their sameness of nature and of physical and social situation . The superindividual reality is the entire system of social-cultural instrumentalities and imperatives held to be necessary for the well-being and continuity of the group ? not a mysterious entity called " GroupSoul " or " Soul of the People . " There is a prevailing climate of opinion and belief , a mental or spiritual atmosphere , in every social cultural group and epoch . All who live in the group and are fairly sensitive or plastic ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inborn differences they will react differently , but all will be subject to the influence ? whether leaders or followers , geniuses or ordinary folk , hunters , warriors , magicians , priests , singers , plastic artists , thinkers or what not . The above statements are true both of primitive clans and tribes , ancient city states , modern great states , pioneer communities or smaller and more intimate groups , such as families , or members of the same vocation . The ethos , unlike the biological urges , changes in time . It varies from age to age , and even undergoes rapid changes in a single period . When this occurs we have a transitional or critical era , of social culture . Whenever two or three are gathered together in pursuit of a basic common interest , there is the ethos in the  | midst of them . It may be a fishing club , a philatelic club or just a group of cronies . It may be the Fascist or Communist ethos . Indeed any group that is permanent for some time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vocational organization . The most enduring groups have the most pronounced ethos , such as large vocational organizations , colleges and universities , political parties , political states , and churches . The term " spirit " designates the intangible and pervasive group attitude ? the spirit of a college or university , the spirit of a community , the spirit of a congregation . Larger and more inclusive are the national spirit or spirit of a people , the spirit of a church , such as the Roman Catholic . Still larger and vaguer is the Spirit of the Time , the Spirit of Western Civilization . Nevertheless , all group spirits or ethoses undergo marked changes , from the influence of new leaders plus the effects of changing conditions . Organized labor just now is changing . There is a conflict between two groups ? the Craft Union and the One or Vertical Union idea . Even the Roman Catholic Church , although it claims to be universal , is different in the United States , France , Italy , Great Britain , Spain , and Latin America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the national spirit ? in Italy , Germany , and Russia ; in the British Empire , France , and the United States less spectacular changes . Returning to the United States from even only six months ' sojourn in Europe , one is sensible of marked differences between the spirits of France , England , and the United States . If one returns from Italy , Germany , or Russia the differences are more marked . Running through local , ethnic and national ethoses is the prevailing ethos of an age . The Feudal Age and the Universal Church had their own cthoses . The Medieval Christian ethos reached its apogee in the thirteenth century . The Renaissance , Protestantism and modern Capitalism brought in new ethosesinteracting but different . Old forms of social prestige weaken when new ones arise to influence . Old virtues die out ; new virtues come to the fore . A nation at peace and a nation at war show marked differences in ethos . And these differences affect every mother 's son of us . The ethos then is the potent and enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  | maturity or wilts and dies . If the individual does not respond conformatively to the ethos he becomes a pariah . He may be simply cast off . Or , he may be persecuted , starved physically or mentally , or imprisoned , or executed . The ethos of old China , with its center in the family system and the semifilial relation to the rulers , was in striking contrast with the ' Western ethos with its emphasis on individual initiative , fluidity and politico-legal control . The ethos of Indian village life is in contrast with ' Western European life . Eighty-nine per cent of Hindoos live in villages and their lives are regulated by immemorial usages . The ethos of feudalism , with its knightly code of mutual obligation between the lord of the manor , his retainers , freehold villeins and serfs , and the guilds in the towns differed markedly from the ethos of business civilization to-day . Even within my own life I have experienced markedly contrasting ethoses ? namely the ethos of the Scotch-Irish , Scotch and English pioneer settlement in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a political and industrial midwestern city . In the former , intellectual ability and honesty carried the highest social prestige . The greatest distinction to be achieved was that of a scholar , minister , lawyer , physician , or teacher . There was but little hypocrisy . Financial power counted for little . Many of the merchants were personalities . There were no chain stores . Among the most thoughtful and best read persons were a proprietor of a general store , a Scotch druggist and an English shoemaker . The village smithy and the drug-store were intellectual centers . We had a literary society where we read essays and debated on weighty themes . The Mechanics Institute had a good library ; the High School another . The principal of the latter was the best read man in the community and probably the ablest one . His salary equaled that of the county judge . These two were the highest-paid public servants . No one connected with the administration of justice was elected by popular vote . All judicial and administrative appointees held office for life , subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sober and intelligent way . Revivalism did not flourish . Drinking intoxicating liquors was not frowned down upon unless done to excess .  | There were marked individualities in members of the community , all tolerated with good humor . The local press was independent and decent . Every editor was his own boss . Public servants were independent of political vicissitudes . Of course , there were a few scalawags . We had a policeman , and a jail , and court of law . Now , by contrast , in the ethos of the city in which I have worked for nearly thirty years the chief prestige comes from financial and political power . Teachers are not looked up to . If not colorless , they are suspected of being radical . Scholarship is not highly regarded ; football prowess is . It brings great crowds , lots of money , and an emotional orgy . The side-shows receive more public attention than the genuine business of the university . In the city and the state public services are , to a great degree , the football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong the spoils . " Pressure politics flourish . One newspaper is part of a large chain . The others are owned by a financially powerful family . The ethos of modern Capitalism in Western civilization became more and more pervasive , because of the expansion of commerce and industry and the speeding up of machine production , transportation and communication . Now the ethoses of the immemorial East are being transformed by it in Japan , China , and that vast country which is the land bridge between East and West ? Russia . Nevertheless , in Japan the Emperor is still the Son of Heaven and the people his children , his obedient slaves , although superior to all other people , as being children of heaven . The Islamic ethos of Turkey is undergoing rapid transformation . In Africa the primitive ethoses of the blacks wane before the advancing tide of white civilization . The natives are lost souls , since their own ethoses are dying and they have not been reborn into the ethos of white Capitalism . In the United States Puritanism developed one distinctive ethos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zenith in South Carolina , a different one ; 3 and the isolated Footnote  | mountain whites in the Appalachians , a third which persisted even into the twentieth century . Hospitality , sentimental balladry , clan sentiment , feuds and emotional revivalism were characteristics of the latter , which stretched from the hill-billies of Vest Virginia to the Ozarks . On the Western frontiers the mountain men and cattlemen developed their own ethoses . Moreover , each of the distinctive ethnic cultural groups ? Italians , Slays , Germans ( Catholic and Protestant ) , Irish and so forth , brought their own distinctive ethos . The Jews brought a combination of the Judaic ethos with internationalism . Our traditional democratic American ethos has had a hard time to keep its flavor dominant in the melting pot . Now , as the same economic and industrial life , and the same rapid communication flood the entire country , all these local and varied ethnic ethoses are being submerged in a more general commercial and machine ethos . Earlier , of course , in the predominantly commercial and industrial East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial and commercial expansionism . A nostalgia may arise for the old lost ethos . Then a Calvin Coolidge is looked up - Co for a brief interlude as its living embodiment . The United States and England are both democracies , they have the same tongue , earlier history , literary background , and religious traditions . The most important ethnic constituents in the United States are still those from the two islands . Nevertheless , important differences have developed in their respective ethoses. ( a ) In formal social intercourse , class lines are much more sharply defined in England than in the United States . England is not as democratic socially as the United States . ( b ) There is much more regard in England to long-established conventions . Certain things are " not done " in England ; they are not " cricket . " The King could have a mistress , but he could not have a twicedivorced woman for wife . ( c ) There is , thus , much more fluidity and mobility in American life . The spirit of America is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of England that of a vigorous people established for millennia in a tight little island and going out to exploit the world .  | ( d ) There is a much more widely spread and stronger sense of public service in England than in the United States . Politics plays a large role in England , but the administration of the law , and the civil service are above politics . Civil service is far more deeply entrenched in England . No doubt this difference is due , in great part , to the long dwelling cultural homogeneity of the English . It is also due in part to differences in the political structure . Our frequent elections of nearly every officer of State , with similar frequencies in the appointment of non-elected public servants , together with the influence of money in politics , makes it easy and profitable for the spoils system to operate here . ( e ) Another powerful difference is that we entered upon the Industrial Revolution later than England , and then developed it with much greater rapidity and power , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public ethos is intermediate between the English and the American . The marked differences in the social attitude towards constituted authority , the rapid growth of representative government , the registration of land , the absence of entail and primogeniture , in America , as compared with England , were due to several factors . The Puritan influence was much stronger in America than in England . It received no setback here until it began to be absorbed in the new commercial and industrial ethos . The original spirit of Puritanism with its democratic features ( town meetings , the leadership of educated men ) , of New England was much reinforced by the large Scotch-Irish immigration after 1689 , when their textile manufactures in Ireland were ruined by the English import tax , and later because of the religious persecution which they underwent . The Scotch-Irish could have no love , rather had they hatred , for England . The original Puritans had also been influenced by the political and legal institutions of Holland . New York was largely Dutch . This Calvinist spirit of freedom was shared by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America for freehold farming and the growth thereby of local trading and manufactures . The spirit of lawlessness manifested later was an exaggeration of this attitude . The United States exhibits at the present mo-  | ment a confusion of ethoses : puritan-religious , humanistic-liberal , ruggedly individualistic , capitalistic , agrarian democratic individualistic , mildly socialistic , the group ethos of organized labor , and that of the political partisan groups . We have laws against gambling and other vices ( the winking at these vices ) ; prohibition of liquor ; purity movements ; enormous laxity and confusion in regard to marriage and divorce ; absence of a sense of financial honor . Our present No Man 's Land of Futility in regard to the regulation of the economic life for the greatest good of the greatest number reflects the confusion of our ethoses.4 This confusion of ethoses is more or less characteristic of ' Western civilization as a whole ; with the exception of the Fascist and Russian types . On the other hand , the very consciousness of the confusion , the widespread awakening to a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of a more coherent and prevalent ethos . There never has been a time , during my lifetime , when great public issues were debated so keenly . The radio is proving a unique instrument for public education . The crucial question is : how will the public respond to these efforts to educate it ? The Religio-metaphysical Factor . Religion is often used by exploiting groups as an opiate for the people . But religion , in its genuine nature , is something quite different . It is the integral reaction of man 's whole personality to the Universe in which he is a conscious member , able to feel and reflect upon himself as a microcosm in which are concentrated the vital currents of the Macrocosm . Religion is natural in the sense that it is an integral expression of human nature . The conflict of religions is a conflict within human cultural nature . Since man is an acutely conscious part of nature , what is natural to him is , in the larger sense , an expression of the Nature of Things . Therefore , paradoxical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supernatural is in itself an expression of the Nature of Things . Man can not be cut off from Nature , nor Nature from man . Religious and philosophical humanism are truncated attitudes when they assume that , because what we know , or believe , or hope is an Footnote  | expression of human capacity or human need and weakness , therefore we are shut up in our own human prison house and can not see out into the world . We see with our own eyes , but our eyes are fashioned by Nature , adjusted to it , and what we see depends on the intercourse of our eyes with an objective reality . 4 . IDEOLOGIES An ideology is a system of ideas and beliefs which formulates and interprets a social ethos . Karl Marx made the term current in his view that ideologies grow out of the system of economic or productive relations in force in any social order ( the economic interpretation of history ) . But through human inventiveness these systems of production change and conflict arises . A new set of productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology persists through the cultural lag in moral customs , publicly enforced laws and beliefs founded on the inertia of tradition . Thus a conflict arises between the old system of social order and the system demanded by the new set of productive activities . Feudalism had its own system of customary morality , its usages and laws of property and mutual personal and class duties and rights . Out of the very bosom of capitalistic Feudalism came modern commercialism and mechanized industrialism demanding a new ideological system . The ultimate sources of social systems of ideologies and , therefore , of conflict between them are economic . This is the meaning of dialectical materialism . ' The economic class war is the chief key to historical change . At present it is in conflict with the liberalistic laissez-faire economic system and the politico-legal system which is the protecting shell of the traditional economic system . The conflict can only be brought to an end by the abolition of economic class conflict through the establishment of a classless society . Marx 's theory is the exaggeration of a partial truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die with its extinction . Moreover , art , science , religion and philosophy are Footnote  | not simply by-products of the prevailing economic system . There is in man a third potency ; the impulse to be a spiritual personality , to find himself as an integrated spirit in communion with a spiritual order . This is the religious and metaphysical impulse . It may take the form of communion with an idealized historical figure ? Christ or Buddha , or it may be an esthetic or intellectual mysticism such as one finds in mystical devotees and speculative thinkers in all mature civilizations . The " nature mysticism " of the romantic poets is one type of this spiritual integration . Conclusions . This is a large and complex subject to which I hope to return in a later volume . Here I have space to state only these conclusions : 1 . The social ethos is a powerful determinant of conduct , oftentimes a more potent factor than the biological urges . The religio-metaphysical factor is weaker , but important . Socially viewed , personal conduct might be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urges , Y for the social ethos , Z for the spiritual impulse . X X Y X Z= personal conduct . 2 . Since social ethoses vary with the whole set of conditions ( economic , geographic , political and educational ) the prevailing ethos is always relative to the total situation and constitution of a society . There may be a rank of hierarchy in social ethoses ; which would thus be placed on a ladder of ascent towards the ideal human type . Since every principal ethos claims universality , this rank in the scale of ethoses would imply a reference to a spiritual factor which transcends the given economic , social and political factor . 3 . If we make an objective comparative historical study of ethoses we can only be saved from a boundless relativism by the ideal of a Utopia which is derived from the acceptance of an ideal or pattern of life for human persons . This Utopia is the reflection of belief in a transcendent principle of ethical personality . If we do not accept Holy Germany , or Italy , or England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can only be saved from a paralysis of social effort by faith in an ethical spiritual realm . 4 . Therefore , I regard the assumption of a religio-metaphysical spiritual basis for ethical personality as the postulate of an in-  | telligent and concerted effort to realize an all-around finer social ethos ? as the climate for the development of personality . I shall next develop the principles of a democratic social ethics , since I regard such an ethics as the embodiment in man of the ideal human type . Footnote  | THE SOURCES OF MORAL JUDGMENT THERE ARE THREE possible alternative sources of the validity of judgments of moral values . These are : ( 1 ) the group mind or group soul ; ( 2 ) belief in divine revelation ; and ( 3 ) reflective or rational intuition . Let us consider these in order . The Group Mind or Group Soul . The group mind or group soul is , psychologically and historically , the primary source of moral judgments , as well as the force which makes them effective . Social psychology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual regards as right and wrong , and his very feeling of obligation , are developed or evoked by social conditioning . The very idea of mores or morals comes from the folk-ways that are considered necessary for the well-being of the group ; whether the group be a patriarchal or matriarchal family , a tribe , a clan , a city-state , or a modern territorial state . The individual , with his long period of infantile and juvenile dependency , is incessantly exposed to the pressure of the group pattern . He is punished and rewarded for his violations and fulfilments of the group code . There is no escaping the impact of the social pressures except by becoming a lone wolf . To be expelled from the group is a punishment worse than death . It is almost impossible to live physically as a lone wolf , and it is painful and mentally harmful . This does not mean that new moral rules or principles of judgment , new insights into moral values , are distilled from a mysterious entity , the group soul . New moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values , require the concert of two conditions . First , the group must be ready for them ; and second , some individual ? sage or moral genius ? must discover them , become intensely aware of them , and proclaim them to his fellows .  | But , primary and powerful though they be , the traditional mores are discovered , on reflection , often to impose heavy burdens on individuals without thereby furthering the group welfare . The development of a critical attitude results from the growth of the economic life in variety and complexity , from changes in methods of the technic of production ? for example , changes from pastoral and agricultural to industrial and commercial activities . Social habits are loosened . Critical reflection is further stimulated by contact , through travel and traffic , with other groups having different mores . The fusion of clans and tribes into larger social units requires the revision and fusion of different mores . Thoughtful individuals become skeptical as to the absolute validity of the traditional group standards . The distinction is made , as in Greece in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom or convention , and what is right by reason or nature . The traditional mores are brought to judgment at the bar of the higher , the unwritten , law of reason . Or , as by the Hebrew prophets , external conformity to ritual laws and the primitive code of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , and of a group morality which ignores the responsibility and value of the individual , are condemned in the name of justice and mercy for the poor and helpless ; in short , in the name of human happiness . The breakdown of a traditional group code is exemplified in Western capitalistic society to-day . An outstanding feature of this code is emphasis on the social duty of hard work , economy , and thrift ; self-denial , not merely in order that the individual may pay his way , support his family , and lay by enough for a rainy day and old age , but in order that his savings may be invested to promote the expansion of business , and that there may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , want not , " " Take care of the pennies and pounds will take care of themselves , " " A penny saved is a penny earned , " express the morals of an economic order . The spirit of the code is expressed in the economic principles , such as : " Capital is the result of saving , " and the supposed inexorable laws of supply and demand , rent , and wages . All these maxims arose in an economic society run on a profit basis , and in which , with the utmost  | diligence , not enough goods were produced to afford a comfortable living for every one who worked , even if the goods had been more equitably distributed . In short , our inherited social code is based on an economy of scarcity . Through the rapid advance of the industrial arts we are living in an economy of potential abundance . It would be quite possible , by a socially planned economic system , to produce the means of decent and comfortable living for all . Continued economy and thrift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overproduction in the sense that buyers can not be found able to purchase all the products . Economy and thrift , in the traditional sense , become economic vices . ( This is not to say that there is not an important function for economy and thrift in order to yield . the richest return in human values . ) For , when foreign markets for the surplus products ( " surplus " in the sense that consumers at home are unable to buy ) are closed , production is sabotaged ; and , by unemployment and reduction of wages without a corresponding reduction of prices , the home market shrinks lower and lower . The sabotage is first employed by the manufacturers . This results in decline of the purchasing power of the laborers for food and clothing and other necessities and conveniences . The market for agricultural produce shrinks more and more , prices of farm products collapse ; and , while millions are insufficiently fed , clothed , and housed , the farmers are asked to reduce production ? to limit their acreage and kill their little pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsisting on relief , or even picking at garbage heaps . So we have a moral code that produces immoral results , if we assume , as I do , that the final moral test of any line of conduct is what it contributes to , or detracts from , the fullness of life for persons . These illustrations abundantly support the thesis that a formal ethics , based on certain moral laws assumed to be universal , becomes inhumane by making absolute what are purely relative rules of conduct ; that is , relative to some particular social system . The only humane basis for ethics is an idealistic utilitarianism ? an ethics of consequences in which the results or effects include , as paramount , the interests of the higher aspects of personality ; and in which " relativity " does not mean that all  | interests are on the same plane , but that , in effecting a harmonization of interests , those on each plane are to be considered in relation to those interests on the other planes , and all are to be considered in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stoic rationalist par excellence of modern ethics theory , makes the universality of duty , the moral law , the supreme principle of moral judgment . Only motives , not consequences , count . Only an act done out of pure reverence for the moral law is truly good . Morality is a jewel that shines by its own light . The moral law is universal . " Act so that thou canst at the same time will that the principle of thy action should become a universal maxim . " Of course , to look at one 's aims and motives in an objective and impartial manner , one must universalize the principles of one 's actions . But this rule does not tell us whether ? when viewed as a universal rule of action , one that I am willing that all persons under the similar circumstances should follow ? my present motive is for the best interests of men or not . I might will that all should , like Abraham , be ready to sacrifice Isaac , or that all should kill or mutilate themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in himself , " Act so as to treat humanity , whether in thine own person or that of another , as an end and never as means only . " This principle expresses the worth or dignity of personality as the ultimate touchstone of values . But it does not guide us to what specifically , in specific social groupings and situations , makes for or against the worth of personality . Is it the greatest possible harmonious fulfilment of interests ? Or is it action that rigorously subjects the feelings always to reverence for a supposititious command of duty ? And what specifically does duty command for me ? At one time , it is to work hard at a sedentary occupation . At another time , it is to go out and climb mountains , walk in the woods , or play golf , or fish . Both sets of alternatives are necessary to my efficiency as well as my happiness . Both are parts of the fulfilment of interests . But I do not find in either , within reasonable limits , any conflict between duty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict . But it is then , at the same time , a conflict between wider and narrower , deeper and more superficial , higher and lower interests . Moral rules and principles are simply guideposts to the conditions of the greatest possible fulfilment of interests , under the actual conditions of the individual 's situation in a particular type of society . Hence they are relative . The only principle that is not relative is that the most comprehensive and coherent moral standard is the harmonious fulfilment of human interests , relative to the existing situation in which the person finds himself . Harmonious fulfilment of interests is the condition of happiness , in so far as happiness is attainable . It must be admitted that there are factors beyond the control of the individual and the group which affect the measure of happiness attainable , by affecting the fulfilment of interests . Belief in Divine Revelation . The second source of the authority of moral judgments is the will of the gods or supernatural beings . From the Alcheringa mysteries of the Central Australians , to the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Koran , one finds the group codes reinforced by supernatural sanction . The supernatural sanctions of the ancient ones , the high gods , the creators of the world and the fathers of men are , in all well-organized societies , believed to back up the mores of the group ? the social code that is necessary for the continual prosperity of the group . The gods are the enduring and powerful guardians of the group life . Primarily , religion is the conservator of the socially recognized values . In this sense religion is not an agency of social and ethical progress . It is an essentially conservative agency . But when the ethical prophet , the moral genius , feels intuitively the urgency of a more humane and spiritual pattern of conduct he , of course , believes that the divine powers or power ( if he is a monotheist ) are on the side of the prophetic morality . One main line of advance in moral insight is the substitution of a deeper , finer , more embracing insight of a prophet , speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Familiar examples are the Hebrew prophets , Jesus , Mohammed , Socrates , Plato , St. Francis of Assisi . Then , when the prophetic revelation has come to an end , the resulting code has its established custodians in a church . The teachers , the  | priests and bishops , the doctors of the law , the scribes and pharisees , become the authoritative interpreters of the revealed code . But the doctors and the priests and other ecclesiastical leaders disagree . And the applications of their codes , even when they are not in scandalous disagreement , fail through the pressure of changing economic , political , and cultural conditions . The codes prove unworkable . Compromise becomes so rife that the codes lose the aura of divine authority . Other moral codes more adequate to cope with the changed social conditions must take their places . These in turn are clothed with the cosmic sanctions of a divine source . It is inevitable that the prophetic souls , to whom are vouchsafed visions of a nobler , richer , human life , should believe that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cosmic sanction . And so , in a relative sense , they have . For it is natural and inevitable that the creative spirits should believe that the ascent of man in the realm of spiritual values should be an ascent to the spirit of the whole , to the cosmic spirit , the ground and the goal of the human spirit . This assumption carries in it the danger of dogmatic arrest and fixation . After the prophets and seers come the doctors of the law , the scribes and pharisees , who regard themselves as the appointed guardians of the final and absolute good . There is no other or better ground for regarding human moral insights and ethical values as having a cosmic source and support than there is for regarding the esthetic visions of the creative artist , or the intellectual insights of the creative thinker in science and philosophy as having a like cosmic source and support . Indeed , were this a treatise on cosmology or metaphysics I should maintain that the supreme cosmic spirit , the creative genius of the whole , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical values , our intellectual insights , and our visions of the beauty , tragedy , and comedy of things . We must bear in mind , however , that all our valuations ? of truth , beauty , and goodness ? are our changing and relative , but , we may hope and believe , growing , human approximations to the supreme ideal reality . And , therefore , we must beware of assuming absoluteness and finality in these , our human valuations . We  | are embodied spirits , the offspring of the universe . We may believe that we are , as seekers and achievers of spiritual values , children of the Most High ; but we must remember that we can not escape the limitations of humanity , that our mental pictures of the spiritual order are conditioned by our finite human nature , just as truly as our sense perceptions . Our little systems have their day ; They have their day and cease to be : They are but broken lights of thee , And thou , 0 Lord , art more than they . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems are equally good or equally illusory , any more than it means that all intellectual insights and all visions of beauty are equal in fullness and adequacy . It means that in the spiritual order ? alike in ethical , intellectual , and esthetic values ? there is relativity with progress . The thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns . Humanity can and does grow in knowledge , wisdom , beauty , and spiritual stature . In periods of confusion , of social break-up and reconstruction , like the present , when one age is dying and the other not yet born , men are apt to despair and to feel that there is no progress , but only an endless cyclical threshing about of slaves and madmen enthralled by their own chains . We must take longer views . A few centuries ago Western Europeans were stupid and cruel in their treatment of minor criminals and the insane , and they were especially cruel in war . Even the Greeks of glorious Attica put to death whole populations of Greek isles who refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war has become a byword . The cruelty still persists among the desert Arabs . Cnossus , in Crete , had a wonderful civilization from 2500 to 1500 B.C. but they worshiped a snake goddess and their bull sports were cruel to the bull-vaulters . Dhe light of reason , illumining and guiding the more generous and nobler feelings , must be our guide . It is very difficult to get human beings to follow the light of reason . Most human beings seem to be impelled to act chiefly by impulse , passionate desire , habit , and prejudice ; and restrained from action chiefly by in-Footnote  | ertia , fear , or indifference . They act without reflection , or even follow a leader blindly , rather than think for themselves . Perhaps , amidst better social conditions , with opportunity to inform themselves , to practise reflective thinking without being starved , or intimidated , or cajoled in their tender and susceptible years , a much greater number would learn to think and choose reflectively . Such is my hope . It is the only permanent hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ultimate satisfactions in feeling , but reflective thinking , reason , is the only trustworthy guide . The spirit of reason in practical affairs is the spirit of love . The opposition so often drawn between feeling and imagination on the one hand , and reason on the other hand is false . Feeling is the active desiderative aspect of perception , imagination , and reason . Sympathetic constructive imagination or love ( in the widest sense ) is the basis of normal social life . We recognize other persons as equally significant to themselves , as equally centers who feel the tang and sting of life , its pleasures and pains , its joys and sorrows , and therefore have equal worth , through the exercise of sympathetic constructive imagination . Reason is simply the wider generalization and elaboration , through more readily manipulated symbolic expressions , of this same power of sympathetic creative imagination . This is " reason in its most exalted mood . " 2 The notion that pure deductive logic and mathematics are the supreme achievements of reason is erroneous . They are merely exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ever gets , by means of deduction , more out of logical and mathematical propositions than he first puts into them . Reflective or Rational Intuition . There is left only recourse to the third source , reflective intuition . There can be no proof of the validity of moral values , nor of the specific acts that follow from the values judged to be moral , other than the reflective judgment of the individual . Considerations of worldly prudence or the desire to escape friction , the disapproval of others or actual punishment , may lead the individual to waive or suspend his own judgment and give way to the pressure of others ; but Footnote  | such attitudes are not moral judgments . The individual may even bow to the authority of a revealer , speaking through a church , because he feels morally at sea and an incompetent mariner . But such an attitude is merely the abdication by the individual of his autonomous moral personality , and the placing of the guidance of his acts solely in the hands of others . There is no half-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined intuitions and the surrender of moral personality . By reflective or rational " intuitions " I mean : ( 1 ) That the final basis of moral judgment is the feeling of the individual that this motive or act is right because it increases human good and that motive or act is wrong because it diminishes human good . ( 2 ) That the particular feeling of value must be reflectively examined with respect to two questions : ( a ) will the expression of it , in act , conflict with and diminish some other actual value , and if so , which value shall have right of way ? ( b ) assuming that the value at present in mind has right of way , what are the conditions for its effective realization ? The specific human values of motives and deeds can not be deduced from any general concept of the good life ; such as selfrealization , perfection , or the greatest possible sum of pleasure . Suppose we say that self-realization is the criterion . This statement gives us no information as to what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to answer these questions one must make intuitive judgments as to the respective ranks or places of values in a scale . Values must be somehow commensurable if there is to be any coherence and continuity in self-realization or the perfecting of personality . At this point we are faced by the great variety of individual differences . The majority of the people one meets care nothing for some of the things that others value most highly ? poetry , speculative thought , the history of human culture . Many of them care much for things that others care nothing about ? witnessing professional baseball , playing bridge . Some things most of us agree on ? food , clothing , physical comforts , motoring , sex and family companionship , social order , and a decent livelihood for every one .  | Our scheme of judgment of moral values should be elastic and inclusive . It should include the values of the basic needs and interests which most sensible persons either agree upon or agree that it is sensible to agree to differ upon . I should call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , THE ORDER OF VALUES 1 . DESIRE AND VALUE INDIVIDUAL PERSONS alone are the subjects of the good life . For individuals alone feel pleasures and pains , satisfactions and dissatisfactions , happiness and misery . A group does not feel happiness nor misery , although the individual 's feelings may be much enhanced by the consciousness that others feel the same way . " Social good , " " common good , " " national good , " are simply abstract names for those conditions of satisfactions that groups of persons have in common . Good for me is whatever satisfies me , bad whatever dissatisfies me . I am happy in so far as my strongest and most permanent interests are being satisfied in a harmonious manner . I am unhappy in so far as these interests are being thwarted . For individuals then , the final touchstone of good is how they feel . The individual 's welfare or illf are consists in how he feels on the whole , or continuously and permanently . There is nothing bad or good for the individual but feeling makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings and momentary evanescent feelings . I may be irritated or feel fleeting pains a dozen times a day and yet be happy , because on the whole the day 's experiences satisfy me . I may feel no particular pain during an entire day and yet end it in dissatisfaction , because it has been a dull day . Nothing achieved and no deeply or intensely satisfying experience . I have not accomplished nor enjoyed much , if anything , in particular . We distinguish things and acts that are good for something else , from experiences and acts that are good in themselves . Money is not good in itself , we can not eat it or wear it . It is good to procure for us the necessary implements for personal satisfaction . To go to the dentist is disagreeable , sometimes pain-  | ful and always costly , but it is good for my teeth and general health . On the one hand to be in good health , to feel energetic and zestful , to hear a symphony well played , to read a beautiful poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appreciated , praised , and loved ; to love my friends and the members of my family , to have a successful day 's fishing or golf , to master a fresh bit of knowledge in science , history , or philosophy , to make a good speech or write a fairly satisfactory chapter ? all these things are good in themselves ; not just good for the sake of something else , although they may also serve other good ends . The out-of-door enjoyment promotes my health ; the mastery of knowledge , the speaking or writing , may turn to my professional and financial advantage . Many enjoyed activities are thus both good for the promotion of other interests and good in themselves . For example , if one can earn a decent livelihood in activities that he enjoys , he has , to a large extent , the conditions of happiness and thus far is fortunate . If , on the other hand , he suffers a tragic personal loss which he was unable to prevent , he is unfortunate and thus far unhappy . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual , but beyond the control of organized cooperative social effort . The latter can do much in insuring economic hygienic and educational and recreational conditions of happiness . So far as I know , Plato was the first thinker to distinguish clearly between the three chief classes of goods . He says , in the beginning of Book II of The Republic , that there is a class of goods we value for their own sake , such as the feelings of enjoyment and harmless pleasures ; a class which we value both for their own sakes and for their results , such as intelligence , and sight and health ; a third class , such as gymnastic training and submission to medical treatment , and making money , which we do not enjoy at all for themselves , but which we accept for the sake of their consequences . The satisfactions that are desirable on their own account , as end-states or consummations of individual desires and interests , we call immediate or intrinsic . The goods that are always merely means to further these satisfactions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call instrumental or mediate goods . Of course , it must be remembered that , since human nature is always a living complex unity or system , in which all experiences interpenetrate , instrumental goods and immediate or consummatory goods intermingle . Food served and eaten under esthetic conditions is more healthful , because more enjoyable . A mechanical tool , such as a motor-car , may be beautiful as well as useful , and hence more enjoyable to look at , and ride in . Activities and experiences are good in themselves because they satisfy ultimate interests . They have intrinsic values . Values have their roots in feelings . A machine can not experience values because it can not feel . Even a thinking machine , if such were possible , would not value thinking . One often hears people talk about " a cold scientific mind . " There is no such mind . A scientist or a true scholar in any line carries on impersonal disinterested investigations , because he values truth . He feels satisfaction in knowing or discovering something in the order of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking order or harmony in his picture of nature or of any bit thereof . The humanist scholar is seeking to understand the order and harmony in the tangled facts of human life . Their interests are esthetic , just as truly as are the motives of the artist or the poet . Human nature has a considerable variety of interests . This means that man responds to a considerable variety of possible activities and experiences with feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction . What determines our feelings , the emotional ways in which we react to the various acts and sufferings that are possible to us ? It is our inborn native impulses , as modified , developed , furthered or thwarted , twisted or defeated , by the opportunities and hindrances presented by our physical and social environments . ( And it is the social environment that has the most powerful and persistent influence . ) Human valuations are the expressions of human feelings ; and feelings are expressions in consciousness of the satisfactions and thwartings of our native dynamic impulses or urges . Man is essentially , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of impulses , urges ,  | drives . There is no such thing as a purely passive individual except a dead one ; that is to say , one no longer an individual . From the fertilized ovum through the entire gamut of his history , the career of the most obscure person , no less than the career of the most famous man of his time and people , is the unfolding , the self-development , of a dynamic system of impulses . While all valuations have their roots in feelings , they are not the expression of mere feelings . Man is a thinking being . As soon as he begins to compare , to choose between possible satisfactions , to consider the personal , physical , and social consequences of his acts and the effort and risk involved in satisfying his desires , man must reflect . He forms comparative judgments of value . He forms , through memory and reflection , images of possible satisfactions . He pictures and conceives the relation of means to ends , the effects of achieving some values or the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are judgments as to the characters , the inter-relationships and conditions of possible end-states , of consummations in satisfactory feeling . The principles of morality , the concepts of right and wrong , good and bad , of value and disvalue , all have to do with the images and concepts of the good life and its opposite . When we judge an act or motive as right or wrong , we are thinking of its conformity or non-conformity to some rule of action as governing these relations between persons that must be observed in order that they may realize the good life . When we think of good or bad we have in mind something which either is valuable or disvaluable , either furthers or hinders the achievement of value . A good is an enjoyed value ; a value is that which makes a situation , an act or state of mind , good . Good for the individual is whatever he feels satisfaction in , and therefore whatever has immediate value for him . Whatever he feels value in , is whatever fulfils some dynamic capacity , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a going , living , feeling , thinking concern . There are two principles that require especial emphasis : ( 1 ) Human welfare or happiness is attainable only in so far as the active capacities of individuals  | find satisfaction in ways and degrees that do not thwart or injure other capacities of the same individual to feel and act . ( 2 ) The individual is an organic self in all stages of his career . He is never really a mere bundle of capacities , bundled by no one . He is never a mere robot , a collection of mechanical patterns of response . He is a dynamic , organic system . In other words , every single impulse is a living member of the intimate and indivisible unity of the self . Consequently , the excessive satisfaction of one impulse ( whether it be sensuous , as in the case of lust or desire for drink , or ambition , or intellectual activity ) , at the expense of other capacities , reacts so as to affect the whole of the self , to impoverish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or poorly integrated , rich or one-sided , harmonious or in conflict with itself , it is oneself . Even alienated personalities have a tragic kind of unity . Defeated in the attempt at a synthesis in social relations , they extrude whole areas of their selfhood . Harmonious self-realization or integration , and happiness , are two ways of naming the same organizing principle . 2 . THE SYSTEM OF HUMAN VALUES The Psychological Basis of Values . We are concerned here only with intrinsic values ; in other words , with those consummations or end-states which yield immediate satisfactions to individuals . To me it is self-evident that " value " and " good " mean the same thing , and the meaning is , whatsoever satisfies an interest . Disvalue or bad is whatsoever thwarts the satisfaction of an interest . What is the relation between value and desire ? Spinoza said : " Good ' is whatever one desires , and bad ' is whatever one has an aversion to . " Others , such as the advocates of duty for duty 's sake and those realists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , reject this view . I confess that I can not understand their position . I can not conceive any one valuing anything that he has no interest in . St. Paul says : " Though I give my body to be burned and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing . " Now , apart from any other consideration , no one desires his body to be burned ; but for St. Paul the supreme  | interest or desire was life eternal , which for him consisted in knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He had sent . This knowledge involved the pervasion of one 's life by Christian love . So , in the case of a conflict of interests , St. Paul was choosing what to him was the vastly richer , because eternal , value of immortal life . One may enjoy a landscape or a picture without strongly desiring to possess them in the legal sense ; but to enjoy them is to possess them in the sense of satisfying one 's interest in contemplation of them . In short , value is whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then have their roots in feelings , in cravings , the satisfaction of which is desired . Of course , intrinsic values are also in part instrumental . One enjoys exercise in play , and in moderation it is physically profitable . One enjoys nature or art , and these enjoyments are both physically and mentally refreshing . One enjoys the acquisition of knowledge just for its own sake , but one may also earn a modest livelihood trying to communicate it to others . It is well known to all students of the history of science that most of the inventions which have proven enormously profitable for their exploiters and many of which have proven socially beneficial , are based on discoveries made by individuals who had a passionate or persistent interest in finding out the hidden " hang and go " of things . If every person could always satisfy all his interests without let or hindrance , there would be no occasion for moral and legal codes , for courts and police , for the State . There would be no occasion for moral philosophies . Moral customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for regulating the conditions for the satisfaction of human interests in society ; but they are often more or less haphazard ? based on overhasty inferences , mutually inconsistent interests and motivations , or are imposed by superior brute force in the conflicts between groups . They persist , in part because of mental inertia , social habit , or the inability of those groups whom they injure to get into effect a better scheme . Social codes never work satisfactorily for all the members of the community , and in times of rapid change in economic and cultural conditions they break down . Hence the  | need for social and moral philosophy ; which is simply the attempt to formulate a comprehensive , consistent , and workable scheme or plan of human values . Moral philosophy is identical with social philosophy , since individuals can realize their human capacities , that is , satisfy their interests , only in a community , and morality has to do with the social relations of individuals . It is possible that a human being , living like Alexander Selkirk , might require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudimentary . In normal human life there is no value , however private or peculiar , which has not a possible social bearing . Human beings differ in their original make-ups , and in these native differences consist the primary differences in individuality . Organized society should function so as to afford to every individual the opportunity to satisfy his basic impulses , in so far as satisfaction does not thwart or prevent the like satisfaction on the part of other individuals . Beyond these basic common conditions of individual satisfaction or happiness , the greatest possible latitude of free play to individuality should obtain . Only in this way can the greatest possible happiness be realized . Human values are expressions of human feelings . Feelings are the appearance in consciousness , the meanings , of man 's original dynamic impulses . These feeling-impulses can be arranged in a series of levels , but the higher levels may control the lower levels . The individual may love his family , his honor , his country , his moral integrity , or his religion , more than he does his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may love himself so narrowly that he loses his fuller selfhood ; lames and arrests his personal development by refusing to sacrifice the present narrow bodily or social self to larger and more permanent interests , to family , country , knowledge , beauty , social justice , or humanity . These levels of feeling-impulses are as follows : Each one has its own values , and the value of life as a whole depends on how far they can be organized into a harmonious or coherent dynamic system of acts . The following table gives in parallel columns the chief capacities or interests and the corresponding values which ensue from their satisfaction .  | Table The impulse for self-expression is not one single impulse . It has a variety of forms . The play impulse , the instinct of workmanship , the impulse of leadership and , of course , the specified direction taken by the play impulse and the instinct of work= manship , depend on a compromise or balance of two factors ? the individual 's native impulse and the social environment . A strong impulse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek disinterested knowledge may be favored or thwarted by the environment . An exaggerated perversion of the self-expressive impulse , found in dominating personalities , is the impulse to exercise ruthless power over one 's fellows which leads to their exploitation . World conquerors ? Alexander , Timurlenk , Genghis Khan , Napoleon ? had this impulse in superlative degree . In our present order it is shown by financial promoters and political dictators . Table Participation in common activities of food-getting and the exploitation of nature develop community of group interest . Those of the same occupation have much in common . So we have the communal feelings of hunters , warriors , herdsmen , agriculturists , priests , scholars , teachers , physicians , lawyers , politicians .  | Patriotic devotion to the nation may be merely a blind passion of herd feeling , or it may , at its higher levels , be a devotion based on a genuine appraisal of common goods which the nation serves . A nation is a community existing to further common economic , cultural , and ethical interests . Friendship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good life is , as Aristotle said , one of the richest and most satisfying values . The sex impulse is both individual and social . It is individual since it is a powerful kind of self-expression . It is social , since the individual is brought into the most intimate bodily and biopsychical relation of dependence on another individual . From the fusion of the sex impulse , the desire for companionship , and the parental instinct comes the lasting love of mates . In each specific form of social life some one facet of man 's social feeling is expressed along with others . The family is based on the sexual and parental impulse . Its primary biological root is the need of care for the young . In the permanent family these develop deep lasting sentiments of sympathy , friendship , devoted love . They are the richest social values . Through the power of spirit , sex lust becomes tender passionate love . Desire for companionship becomes comradeship ; friendship , love for one 's fellows . The primitive herd feeling becomes elevated patriotism ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the similarities in human nature are deeper and more fundamental than the differences of usage , language , or even color , he develops the feeling for humanity . The very existence of human communities , from a primitive family to the great modern state , and from the fellowship of the hunters and warriors of a clan , to the international companies of scholars in science and philosophy , the international companies of artists , philanthropists , and humanitarians , is the result of the original human capacity to think ; of the possession of that capacity which , while it actually operates only in individual minds , is in principle universal . Reflective thinking , creative or constructive imagining and thinking , are thus both individual in origin , and universal in aim . The possibility of communication is the primary condition of the existence of any  | group ; and communication , whether through gestures , signs , pictures , pictographic or syllabic or alphabetically structured language , is the result of the power of thought to make particular pictures and conventionalized symbols the carriers of universals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same principle holds good ; whether it be language itself , artisanship and art , industry , commerce , law , politics , religion , or political science and philosophy . Progress in generality , in the scope of its applicability to guide and satisfy human interests , results from the transformation , the illumination of particular bits of experience , particular images , so that these become freighted with richer , more far-reaching and high-soaring meanings and values . Table  | Table The physical and the psychophysical values do not require comment , but the social and supersocial values give rise to misunderstanding and disputes . I will therefore make some further comment on these : Social or Interpersonal Values . We are not here concerned with the social customs and rules regulating the intercourse of persons , but with the living values enjoyed by persons in communion with other persons . These are for most persons the deepest and most pervasive of all values . There are a few rare individuals who seem to find their greatest satisfactions alone with nature , or in art , or in scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the case . The widest and the shallowest social values are those that  | arise merely from companionship with one 's kind or , if this fails , with pet animals . This value is the satisfaction of the gregarious instinct . As the proverb has it , birds of a feather flock together . This interest is not selective . Any one will do . But when individuality is at all developed , selection must come into play . One can respect and feel a vague sympathy for many persons , but it remains true that one can not have many deep friendships . Friendship requires a union of deep community of interests with diversity of individualities . If one has a great variety of interests one , of course , can have a variety of friends . There can not , as Aristotle said , be deep friendship between individuals that are very different in their interests and at the same time very unequal in their powers . The strongest friendship is the friendship of equal minds , united in the common striving for the good life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different stages of development of similar interests can not be friends ; for example , parents and children , teachers and pupils . Companionship or fellowship is a social value intermediate between mere casual associations with one 's fellows , and friendship . One can enjoy , for the time being , the companionship of all members of one 's own vocation or avocation . One can enjoy golfing or fishing with persons with whom one does not share cultural interests . The most intense and powerful forms of interpersonal feeling are those involved in family life . The love between the sexes is many-sided because it is a fusion of physical and esthetic emotions with sympathetic regard for the spiritual personality of the beloved . Without this sympathetic appreciation of the personality of another , sex feeling is merely lust . The loves of parents for children , of children for parents , and of brothers and sisters are strong and enduring . The devotion of parents to children is probably the strongest of all loves ? the most selfless , the most patient , the most loyal . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the highest form of religion , the essential attitude of God is conceived after the analogy of parental love . " Like as a father pitieth his children , so pitieth He them . " Supersocial Values . In the esthetic values are included the en-  | joyment and appreciation of nature and of the esthetic treatment of external nature and human nature in the fine arts . One defect of our increasingly citified life is that it shuts us out much of the time from communion with nature . One of the great values of the motor-car is that it enables us to escape to nature . Flowers , grass and birds , running streams , hills and valleys , sunset , moonlight and starlight on plains , hills , waters , shifting clouds , storms and sunshine , trees , and ferns , the salt estranging sea ? in the enjoyment of these there is healing and refreshment for the spirit of man . No people can be permanently healthy in soul which does not commune with nature . Communion with nature is enriched by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . One who knows something of biology , geology , physics and astronomy has a keener appreciation of earth and sky than the ignorant . Scientific education should be directed largely to this end , and not be regarded merely as an instrument for exploiting nature for commercial purposes . The power to appreciate beauty in the fine arts can also be much increased by an esthetic education . Our education has been seriously defective in these fields . Commercialism in buildings , publishing , the unprincipled exploitation of the radio and the movie have cheapened and degraded the human taste , whereas they might be instruments of enriching esthetic values . I have already pointed out how scientific knowledge enriches our enjoyment of nature , and historical and cultural knowledge our appreciation of the fine arts . Knowledge of the march of human cultures , of the rich and varied spectacle of human history with all its ups and downs , through history and biography written with warm and intimate human insight , contributes greatly to the enrichment of the mental life . Esthetic experiences have three characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The statue , the picture , the play , or the poem are sufficient unto themselves as objects of enjoyment . ( 2 ) They are unified wholes , concrete individuals , in which are blended a variety of elements . For example , a Greek temple , a Gothic church , a play of Shakespeare , Keats 's  | " Ode to a Grecian Urn , " are individual wholes. ( 3 ) They yield to the appreciator emotional meanings . The concrete intuition carries something of universal emotional significance . The Gothic cathedral , the Sophoclean or Shakespearian play , express universal aspects of action and suffering , sorrow and joy , tragedy and comedy , sin and forgiveness , aspiration and worship . 3 . THE ORDER OF VALUES Enlightened moral common sense intuitively recognizes qualitative differences in human capacities , and hence in the values which come from their satisfaction . John Stuart Mill expressed this when he said , " Better a Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied . " This intuitive judgment of the qualitative differences in the interests and values is the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In this sense moral judgments are both intuitive and relative . If a devotee of exclusively sensuous pleasure says that intellectual and esthetic pleasures , or the satisfactions of beneficent social activity , are not qualitatively higher than sensuous pleasures , one can not convince him that they are . One can only say that he is a low character , that he is treating himself as an animal , that he is leaving out of his reckoning just those interests that constitute the peculiar nature of the truly human type , that he is insensible to the real worth and dignity of human personality . The intuitive judgments of enlightened moral common sense recognize that the social values of comradeship , friendship and love have a higher rank than the values of physical well-being ; and that intellectual and esthetic values rank higher than the values of sensuous well-living or even of social prestige . I think one may even say that reflective common sense recognizes that the esthetic and philosophical appreciation of the meaning and mystery of the whole , or reverent communion with the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there be a conflict between the satisfaction of physical and sensuous interests on the one hand , and social or spiritual interests on the other hand , moral intuition does not hesitate usually which choice to make . But the case is not so simple when conflicts  | arise between different social interests ; as , for example , between the interests of a vocational group , or the public interest , and one 's family interest ; or between friendship on the one hand , and truth on the other hand ; or between one 's interests in art , science , or scholarship and the worldly interests of one 's family ; or between one 's ethical and religious convictions and one 's social associations . No moral philosophy can furnish ready formulas to solve these conflicts . The circumstances in which they occur vary infinitely and their solution must be left to the practical good judgment of the individual , with reference to the actual circumstances . Still , I think there are four general principles for guidance , in the comparative estimate and choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign principle for deciding between the conflicting values of different levels when one or more must be sacrificed . Those principles are : ( 1 ) durability , ( 2 ) depth , ( 3 ) fruitfulness , ( 4 ) shareability , and ( 5 ) the sovereign principle of coherence or harmony . I will explain each briefly . Durability . Other things being equal , that value is to be chosen which comes from the satisfaction of the more durable interests . For example , choose permanent physical well-being in preference to the more intense enjoyments which injure health or dissipate strength ; choose permanent social ties rather than fleeting associations ; choose forms of mental culture that will be lasting rather than passing mental excitements . The youth should choose spiritual development in preference to immediate sensuous gratification . The wise man will choose not to sacrifice intellectual or esthetic interests to money-getting . The former are more durable . In human relationships a friendship based on community of interest in higher things is more durable than a mere fairweather friendship . A sex union which includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be far more durable than one based merely on passion . Depth . Mere duration is not sufficient ground for preferences . Depth and intensity are preferable to tepid permanence . " Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay . " There are deep  | and intense values in which one lives richly and which remain as fragrant memories , though in actual experience they , have been brief . " ' T is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all . " A deep love , a heroic deed , a glorious adventure , may pass ; because the objects and the situations have gone ; but they leave with us satisfying memories . In our lives it is not so much the even flow of life on the plains as it is the sudden and passing glories on the mountain tops , that count most . There are flashes struck from midnights , There are fire flames noondays kindle , Whereby piled-up honors perish , Whereby swollen ambitions dwindle , While just this or that poor impulse , Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a life-time , That away the rest have trifled.l Fruitfulness . Other things being equal , choose the more fruitful values . Lasting friendships and loves , intellectual and esthetic cultivation , work for social beneficence , are all far more fruitful in further values than acquiring wealth or social power , or getting one 's name in the news . This principle of fruitfulness is what Bentham called " fecundity . " Shareability . Other things being equal , choose the more shareable values . In fact , the more durable and fruitful satisfactions are more shareable . There is no limit to the shareability of interest in public good , in education , in justice , intellectual comprehensions , and esthetic appreciations . In interpersonal relations , the most intelligent person is the most sympathetic . The cultivation of knowledge and esthetic appreciation of man and nature are the most widely shareable values . One can share one 's intellectual interests , one 's esthetic and humanitarian interests with countless others , and one is enriched by the sharing . One can not share one 's food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position or money with others without losing them . On the other hand , the preferability of the more shareable values does not mean that , within the more shareable values or goods , one should always choose Footnote  | the particular goods that can be shared by the largest number . There is a conflict here between depth and range of appreciation . One should prefer higher social intellectual and esthetic values to merely sensuous goods and to the gratification of the desire for power and possession . But , within the intellectual and esthetic spheres , one is not called upon to give his attention chiefly to the more superficial and generally shareable goods . There is a conflict here between quantity and quality . The more elementary and superficial a work be in history , science or philosophy , the wider its appeal . One is not called upon , therefore , to devote his energies either to the production or spread only of things that cater to the most superficial and banal tastes and interests , intellectual and esthetic . Indeed , if one has any capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of esthetic significance that do not make the widest appeal , one is called upon to choose these ideas and forms against the tide of approval and profit , which sets so strongly to-day in the direction of the trivial , superficial , commonplace , the cheap , and crude . The esthetic feelings , in their finer and more abstract forms , are perhaps nearly as rare as intellectual interest . But , in the more concrete forms of architecture , sculpture , painting , and simple music , as well as natural scenery , they are quite widespread . Opportunity for their stimulation and nurture should be much more facilitated than at present . Esthetic interests give satisfying vehicles for agreeable , refreshing , and elevating emotions . All persons who are not either imbeciles or moral monsters have strong interpersonal or social interests . Practically every one desires human companionship , recognition , esteem , comradeship , intimate friendship , and love . These interpersonal interests are the primary bases of morality , in the ordinary sense of the term . The principles of common morality ? truth-telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one 's family and neighbors , regard for humanity ? are general rules to guide to satisfying and durable relationships between persons . There is also a self-morality , the core of which is self-respect , reverence for one 's own personality . Inasmuch as the moral life has to do with the relations between persons , self-respect is as necessary to right social relations as right social relations are to self-respect .  | An ethical regard for others , and respect for self , are two aspects of the same principle . I can not treat others with respect and reverence and sympathy if I do not have , in regard to myself , reverence for integrity of personality . I can not really sympathize with the good and ill fortune , the joys and sorrows of other persons , unless I recognize them as being centers of personal values . Sympathy has often been made the original source of morality , notably by Hume and Adam Smith . It is an essential aspect thereof , but it is not the whole thing . I can not sympathize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as equally with myself , a worthful center of feeling , a being whose feelings and attitudes are to be respected . I can not do this unless for me personality is the ultimate center of reference for all values , all goods . I can not really feel the joys and sorrows of another . I can feel for and with him , only in so far as I think of him as a being whose feelings and attitudes are worth as much to him as mine to me . The Sovereign Principle . For the organization of interests this is just the principle of organization , harmony , or coherence . As already pointed out , there are all sorts of conflicts within each level of interests and conflicts of one level with another ; the conflicts vary with the nature of the individuals and with their social circumstances . No formula can be laid down for the resolution of these conflicts in any easy fashion . That depends , in the last analysis , on the wise judgment of the individual . But there is always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking its relation to other enduring interests . The principle of harmony , or organization of the relationships of interests , takes account of the bearing of one value on other values . It can scarcely be doubted that , in the business of normal living , the happiest individuals are those whose interests are most fully integrated , most harmoniously organized . Again we must note that the individual is dependent to a large extent , for the possible organization of his interests , on a well-organized society . And , on the other hand , a well-organized society is one that contains the largest number of most harmonious personalities . In general , the higher ranks of values are most easily harmonized one with another . Of course , conflicts may arise between  | one 's interest in knowledge or beauty or in one 's friends and family , and concern for public good , for social honesty and justice . But these conflicts do not arise so frequently as conflicts between the higher ranks and the lower . The sharpest conflicts arise between the more comprehensive social or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for money , power , or ease on the other hand . The supreme principle for organization of human values , then , is that of dynamic harmony . By calling this harmony " dynamic " I mean that it is the active integration or organization of active capacities of the human self . There is no formal and absolute principle for the organization and unification of values . Values are a plurality . How shall one choose between the claims of a friend , or a sweetheart , or a family , and the claims of wider groups such as one 's vocational groups ? Or between the latter and the claims of distant human beings ? How shall a teacher strike a balance between superficial teaching to a large number , and thoroughnuess and depth ? How shall a writer make the like choice ? How shall one choose between satisfying one 's esthetic interests , and science or scholarship ? Or between scholarship and travel ? The principles enunciated can only be applied other things being equal . It comes down in the last analysis , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the mean between two extremes as the prudent man of moral tact would discern it . And yet , rightly , we pay high regard to those who in a great crisis for a cause for a friend , or for a love throw prudence to the wind . The prudent man is below the level of moral heroism , of generosity , of spending one 's life for persons or causes . The principle of coherence or harmony means that , if personality is to be fulfilled , there must be integrity ? wholeness . A split personality does not realize values . The mental disease called schizophrenia is due ( psychologically at least ) to the failure of the individual to integrate his emotional life . Harmony and Tragedy . I do not mean , by saying that dynamic or moving harmony is the supreme principle for the organization of values , that harmony is the absolute value . I mean that  | the degree of happiness is the degree of harmony . For in the first place , harmony or satisfaction is only imperfectly achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a striving and keenly conscious being . And , in the second place , there may be tragic and unhealable conflicts between interests and values . Blind fate , or a tragic error , may introduce a schism into a person 's satisfaction that can never be closed up . He may , and indeed must , if he is to go on , try to muffle the discord and stoically endure it in so far as it can not be muffled . I regard love and reverence for personality , which are two aspects of the same principle , as the highest values . But the brutalities of life are often such that the destruction or wreck of the loved one brings unending sorrow . It may be that the spiritual life of the lover is thereby purified and ennobled , although I can not see that it is . ( In this connection , by " love " I do not mean sex love , but all forms of personal devotion . ) Tragic defeat and sorrow are unsilenceable notes of human experience . 4 . VALUES AND DUTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good life consists in the harmonious fulfilment of the normal human capacities or interests ? that the values of life are the felt satisfactions that arise from this active fulfilment of interests . But many moralists have emphasized the conflict between desires or inclinations , and duty . They have asserted that the good life consists in conduct in harmony with a moral law or moral laws . The good life consists in doing one 's duty , obeying the moral laws , whether this obedience be in conflict with one 's interests or in harmony with them . Theologians have held that good is conformity to the revealed law of God ? the ten commandments or the laws of conduct revealed by Christ or Mohammed . Now , of course , for those who believe that they can find in the revealed will of God a complete code for moral guidance this is final . It may be pointed out , however , ( 1 ) that there is no agreement as to what are the items of this revealed code , and ( 2 ) that , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have considerable instruction , debate , and reflection , as to  | how the accepted code is to be applied in all the complex variety of changing moral situations . The field of casuistry in cases of conscience is wide and not very clearly mapped out . Independent moralists assert that conscience , the inner light , is an unerring guide and that conscience dictates unqualified obedience to the moral law which it lays down . The most famous modern exponent of this doctrine is Immanuel Kant . The ancient Stoics occupy a somewhat similar position . Kant says that only that kind of act is good without qualification that is done from reverence for the moral law . To do right because one enjoys doing it is not to be moral . Morality is a jewel that shines by its own light . The commands of duty given by conscience , or practical reason , are absolute , categorical . One must do right regardless of consequences . Let justice be done though the heavens should fall . Tell the truth no matter how painful or disastrous it may prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man say that his conscience was in error , he is either lying or he is a moral imbecile . The commands of duty are universal . Act so that thou canst at the same time will that the principle of thy action should become a universal maxim . Is a man in dire distress and seeking a loan from a friend which he can not otherwise get , when he feels no certainty that he can pay on the date specified , tempted to lie ? Let him remember that , if he could will that all men under similar circumstances would be justified in so lying it would become useless , since no one would believe his fellows . Similarly , is a doctor prohibited from concealing from a patient almost at the point of death what he believes to be his condition , if the truth told will hasten his death ? If a man standing at a crossroads sees first one man fleeing in terror take one fork , and then another man with a gun in his hand and murder in his eyes arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fork the intended victim took ? May one tell a lie to save a life ? No , says Kant . It seems to me the answer is , yes ! Duty " is not something independent of consequences . If to do justice is to bring down the heavens , then either the act is not just , or the heavens are not worth holding up . But there are duties which conflict with our desires and in-  | clinations . Yes , of course . What then is the origin and what is the meaning of the sense of duty ? Duty is what we owe to others and to our own better natures . Duty must be specified in duties , in concrete obligations here and now , to have meaning . Every one has duties as a member of a family , a citizen , as having a vocation and simply as being a human being . But to know what these duties are one must consider one 's social station , one 's actual human relations . These obligations may even come into mutual conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into conflict with some law or edict prohibiting the promulgation of certain teachings ? for example on evolution , the nature of man , or social reconstruction . I may injure my family financially by obeying my intellectual conscience . The choice to be made between conflicting duties can be made only in terms of the relative values we assign to different goods or interests . There is no doubt , in my mind , that the sense of obligation is first developed in us by the duties laid on us by social groups ? by the family , the State , the Church . We are always involved in social relations . We get goods from our fellows ? nurture and protection , education and opportunity to share in the advantages of culture and thereby satisfy our interests , and enrich our lives . We owe returns . We must do our parts , attend to our own business in society . The notion of a universal moral law or duty , as Kant conceives it , brings out a very important aspect of moral conduct . Since every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as an actual or potential subject of happiness or personal selffulfilment ( put it either way you like ) ; since every one should count as one and no one as more than one , or , as Kant said , since every human being is an end in himself , we must be universal in our moral outlook . We are always faced by the insidious temptation to be partial to ourselves , to make exceptions and reservations in our own cases . When we do so we , in effect , deny that others have equal value as moral subjects . To universalize our motives and aims is to look at them impartially and objectively . Moral conduct is concerned with two things : means and ends , instruments and ultimate goods or values . Most moral principles  | or rules have to do with means , instruments . They are useful ? their criterion is utility . To be industrious , cooperative , faithful in keeping contracts and paying debts ; to do good work and produce honest goods ; to avoid slander and ill will ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these principles are in good effect will cohere and flourish . But why need society cohere and flourish ? Because in this way human personality grows . Every member of society , every individual , is a center of value because he is a unique center of feeling . The good of society is just the good of the persons who compose it . The ultimate values are in the feelings and activities of the individual persons . Respect for the individual persons as being centers of value is the supreme social-moral criterion . If I want my intuitions , my feelings of value , recognized and place given to them and , in effect , by my actions and attitudes would deny to some other persons the same privilege , I am inconsistent . I am contradicting my own attitude . I am immoral . The ultimate immorality , the sin against the Holy ' Spirit in man , is the refusal to other persons of the opportunity to realize worthy values . The final principle is this : Every individual has his or her unique flavor of individuality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sentient subject , has equal right to consideration , respect , regard , and reverence . Every individual has inherent worth and dignity . That worth and dignity is to be respected and not interfered with , in so far as the individual does not attempt to ride roughshod over the individualities of other persons . The only justification for restraint by force or social pressure is that the individual refuses to recognize the worth and sacredness of other persons . The other side of the shield is that true individuality , rational and ethical personality , is the very antithesis of queerness , oddity , and exclusive selfishness . The ideal self is realized in proportion to the extent and depth of the individual 's active interests in that which is beyond his actual achieved selfhood ? through interest in other persons , in humanity and nature ; through social contacts ; through thoughtful , imaginative comprehensions of the lives of his fellows in the present and past ; and through the contemplation of nature .  | 5 . METAPHYSICS OF VALUES It is beyond the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already done so in Man and the Cosmos and in " The Principle of Individuality and Value " in Contemporary Idealism in America . I plan to publish a further work ? History , Personality , and Values . Briefly , my standpoint is a personalistic realism . Values are objectively valid as the conditions without which personality can not be realized . Personality has a valid objective structure . But values have no ghostly " subsistent , " being as " essences " or " forms " apart from persons . If values have a cosmic ground , that ground must be personal , but without the defects of actual human personality.2 Footnote  | SOCIAL MORALITY MORALITY , fundamentally , means a system of behavior binding on the individual as a member of the group , because the items of the code are necessary to the well-being , the survival , the good order , peace , prosperity of the group . The group may vary all the way from a patriarchal or matriarchal family to a great modern state ; and in a universally humane ethics , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Confucian Ethics , to man as such . And yet we say ( rightly , I hold ) that the highest type of moral culture , the most civilized type , is one in which the individual is free to judge and act as a reflective moral agent . This is the standpoint of " personal " or " reflective " morality , an advance beyond customary morality . We say that the significance of the prophetic and ethical literature in Judaism , of the Gospel of Jesus , and Paul , as of the great Greek ethics from Socrates on , or Buddhist ethics , is that they all recognize the personal and inward reflective basis of morality . The Lord looketh upon the heart . Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh . Blessed are the pure in heart . Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees . Ye cleanse the outside of the cup but within ye are full of uncleanness . Only the good will is good . Morality is a jewel that shines by its own light ( Kant ) . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to himself not to waste his powers , or demean himself by making a beast of himself ? Is it the individual 's duty to cultivate his powers beyond what is necessary for him to discharge his social functions ? For example , it is clearly my duty , as a teacher of philosophy , to make myself as competent as possible in that field ; but is it my duty to cultivate , as an avocation , any special artistic gifts that I may have ? It might be  | said that , if I do so , I will be a more agreeable member of society . Well , that depends upon the persons with whom I am associated . Moreover , must I always be considering how to make myself more agreeable , as well as more useful ? I answer these questions thus : If the individual has value in himself , and is not a mere social cog , then it is the individual 's duty to make the most of his capacities , within the limits set by his actual social obligations . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the actual social morality . For ethical values include all the values that appertain to the dignity of personality . There is a self-sufficing value in the full development of any intellectual or esthetic capacity , since all these powers enrich the personality ; and personality , deep , many-sided , harmonious , and vigorous , is the one actuality that has inherent worth and dignity in our world . The ideal of personality is that of self-determining intelligent individuality , able to judge between the values of the various interests of life with respect to their worth in terms of depth , purity , strength , duration , and extent , and able to follow the better judgment . Personality is a social concept . A good society is a society whose members are all progressing in the realization of personality . From this point of view it is clear that the sense of duty , the feeling of obligation , to choose and cleave to the right or good , is just another way of putting the supremacy of the ideal of personality . The possession of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal of personality . The universality of duty is the universality of personality , as being that alone which has inherent value in our human striving , since it is the achiever and enjoyer of all values . Duty is not obedience to a law imposed upon us from without , whether by man or God . Duty is dedication of the will to the realization of the values of personality in all men . Man , as an ethical being , is autonomous . There is , for an individual capable of moral reflection , no merely formal law of duty , standing over against an ethics of goods or valued consequences . The distinction between an ethics of duty and an ethics of goods or values is a distinction of aspects within the one ethical totality ? personality . Moral obligations or duties express the social conditions of the achievement of the paramount value  | of personality . The ultimate good is personality , and the moral laws or duties are the obligations incumbent on persons to further personality in all . Duty means that , since all persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realization of values in all persons ; that we must be objective and impartial in our moral acts and attitudes . There are two extreme positions , both of which are wrong . These are : 1 . A collectivism , which denies to the individual any value whatsoever , except as a social instrument . The individual 's feelings and intellectual and executive powers are wholly submerged in his functions as a social tool . Plato in The Laws seems to take this attitude . It is the attitude embodied in the philosophical theory of the Totalitarian State of Fascism and Nazism . In extreme Communism the individual 's interests and ends are wholly subordinated to the interests and good of the whole group , but the Communists claim this to be a subordination of a narrow and unsocial individualism to a universal all-inclusive opportunity for the fulfilment of individuality . Certainly , the complete subordination of the individual 's judgment to the supposed good of the whole can not result in the realization , even in a moderate degree , of individual personality by all the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of actual social policies , freedom to agitate to change the policies or the personnel in charge of their execution ; when the individual has little or no choice as to his occupation ; when those who do not agree with the prevailing policies or personnel are driven out or starved or executed , then the good of the whole is identified with whatever the particular oligarchy or dictatorship in control thinks is for the good of the whole . There are no men wise enough , even if disinterested enough , to decide what every one should be taught to think , say , and do , and should actually think , say , and do . Lincoln 's saying : " No man is fitted to have absolute power over any other man " is profoundly true . " Power is poison and absolute power is absolute poison " ( Lord Acton ) . The measure of civilized morality in a society is the respect it pays to rational individuality , the freedom it allows for the development and play of personality .  | 2 . The opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ethical individualism does not mean " rugged individualism . " The roots of individuality reside in the fact that each and every human being is a distinct private and unique center of feeling , thought , and dynamic impulse . Even if all individuals had , in the same degree , the same impulses , capacities , and tendencies in feeling and thought , each would still be unique by virtue of being this private center of feeling , thought , and volition . For the root fact is that only individuals feel and think . The more action is the result of mass or mob feeling , the more stupid , brutal , and dangerous it is . Every worthwhile contribution to social welfare springs originally from one or a few individuals . It is , of course , true that what specifically the individual can do or become depends on the social heritage of culture . We are all , as Hegel put it , suckled at the breast of the common ethos , the cultural system of our time and country . Or , as T. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's conscience . There is precious little originality in the most original among us , almost none among most of us . Nevertheless , the ways in which we do our jobs , stick to our posts , do honest work , depend on our individualities . Each one of us has his own private flavor of existence , feels separately the sting and sweetness , pangs and joys of living . The heart knoweth its own bitterness and its own rejoicing as doth no other heart . On the other hand , personality is social , inasmuch as the newborn babe , the potential person , only becomes an actual person through the stimuli and patterns applied by the whole heritage of social culture transmitted to him through rearing , education , example , companionship , from his cradle to his dotage . The severest criticism to be made on our present social order is that it is not individualistic enough ; in the sense that , by the maldistribution of economic and cultural opportunity , it shuts out many individuals from the opportunities to realize personality . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , is that every human individual is a center of value ; has a dignity of his own ; therefore , society should be so ordered that no individual will be shut out from the opportunity to become a person . To become a person means to develop  | and exercise , as freely and harmoniously as possible , all the normal capacities of humanity . Specifically this means : ( 1 ) That every individual shall have at his disposal the means of as healthy a physical life as his inherited physique admits of ; furthermore , that all the knowledge and means for the production of healthy offspring shall be at the disposal of every prospective parent . ( 2 ) That every individual shall have at his disposal the instruments for the education of his emotions and his intellect . A human character is the organization , into an integral dynamic harmony , of the emotional dispositions and mental powers . By " mental powers " is meant herein the capacities to observe , imagine , reflect , and generalize , that the individual is born with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely to observe and think correctly ; it implies , even more , that his emotions and dynamic impulses be stimulated and directed by worthy objects presented not only to his senses but to his imagination . Among the chief causes of moral disorder and crime to-day are the unworthy , crudely sensuous , and positively vicious objects presented to the imaginations of children and adolescents by slum conditions with their education in vice , the daily news headlines of crime , the sexy and crime-glorifying movies , magazines , and books . And all this is done because the proprietors of newspapers , magazines , and films think that they can make more money by pandering to the lowest appetites and the lowest grades of intelligence . ( 3 ) That every individual shall have the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood , by fulfilling some worthwhile function in the social economy . ( 4 ) That there shall be available to every individual opportunity for physically , mentally , and morally healthful recreation , through play , art and literature . Actually our social order does not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilation of the social heritage of work and culture . I do not separate work and culture . Actually they are divorced in our society , which has made pecuniary profit and power the chief mainsprings of human activity . We have divorced work from culture , and done it solely for profit . Notwithstanding our universal common school system , the leisure time and the surplus earnings , both of capitalists  | and wage earners , are spent largely in crude forms of recreation ? attending ball games , listening to jazz , the crudest humor , and talking films ? when they are not spent in worse ways . It may be said that there are many individuals without the native capacity to become persons ; that they are deficient in native intelligence and capacity for refined feelings ; that all they are fit for is to be drudges doing the heavy and monotonous manual and simple mechanical tasks that should fall to human animals ; and that , for so doing , they deserve only sufficient food and shelter to enable them to continue at such tasks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " liberty for the individual , " this is the underlying philosophy of economic individualism . It is assumed that the actual distribution of economic and social wealth and power , under a regime of free competitive struggle for profits results in the rewards going to those worthy of them , because able to profit by them ; and the failures to the unfit , the stupid , and the lazy . Just as in a certain type of religious orthodoxy , it is assumed that worldly prosperity is a sign of God 's favor , and adversity a sign that the sufferer has done wrong ( the book of Job deals magnificently with this theme ) ; so it is assumed , in the philosophy of laissez-faire , that successful selfishness and greed produce the happiest social results ; the vigorous , intelligent , and diligent , who should , and do , become top dogs ; and the under dogs , who were fated from birth to be under dogs , stay where they belong . If the ruling standard of judgment for social morality be that virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laissez-faire philosophy is right . If what is common to all individuals , namely , that each and every one is a center of feeling and thought , whose interests and thoughts are of value since they constitute that individual ? in short , if the possession of a common human nature is the true basis of moral value , then laissez-faire is wrong ; then it is only another one of the egregious methods of exploitation that have been foisted on human nature by a combination of historic circumstances with the energy and cunning of a small minority of men , such as are always lying in wait to take their fellows at a disadvantage .  | The philosophy of ruthless competitive individualism can not be refuted by arguing with those in possession of the economic power . It can only be refuted by successfully persuading the majority that they are being exploited . If the majority can not be persuaded to take measures to release opportunity so that all may realize personality , then the rugged individualists are right . The proof of the pudding is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of social morality is in doing . I remind the reader that the higher religions and the noblest sages have taught that the basis of social morality is active recognition that every human individual is a center of inherent value and that everything else should be tributary to this recognition . The great Hebrew prophets from Amos and the first Isaiah to Micah insist that the service of God , who is merciful and loving , requires justice , mercy , and loving kindness towards the widow , the fatherless , the sick and the stranger . " What doth the Lord require of thee , 0 Man , but to deal justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God . " ( Micah . ) The gospel of Jesus makes active love of one 's neighbor , fellowship , ministration to other 's needs , the basic principles of life in the realm of God . He that seeketh his life shall lose it and he that loveth his life shall find it . Let him that will be greatest among you be servant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ministered unto but to minister . Paul 's great hymn to love reads : " If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal .... And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , and have not love , it profiteth me nothing . Love never faileth. " 1 " Beloved , let us love one another , for love is of God , and every one that loveth is begotten of God , and knoweth God .... If any man say I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar , for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he bath not seen . " ( I John IV , 7 , 20 . ) Plato says that the purpose of the true state or organized Footnote  | society should be not to make any individual happy by himself but to make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , philanthropia , as the supreme virtue . We are made for cooperation , like hands , like feet and the ruling part ( reason ) within us . The city of reason is the city of God and this is the empire of humanity . Buddhism embodies the same principle . One finds it in the Confucian conception of reciprocity . My recognition of another self , as an individual person , a private and unique center of feeling , thought , and action , is a constructive act of sympathetic imagination . I feel my own impulses , interests , desires and aversions , pleasures and pains , joys and sorrows , thoughts and aims , immediately . I do not infer them . I do not feel those of any other person immediately . I perceive movements , bodily gestures of the limbs , countenances , vocal organs , and entire bodies of other living beings . These expressions I take to be the utterances of other centers of feeling analogous to my inner or psychical self . Only in so far as I , in sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other self , that alter-ego , as feeling , thinking , suffering , enjoying , purposing ; just so far is there to me a real self there . In so far as I fail to make this imaginative construction there is no other self there for me . In making the sympathetic construction , I am assuming a basic sameness of sentient , intellective , and purposive nature there . Recognition of the reality of other selves , then , presupposes a sameness of quality of persons and takes place only through acts of sympathetic imagination , by which one puts one 's self in the other one 's place ; that is , imaginatively within his body . And wherever we fail to do this , we fail to treat others as being really persons . The primary source of indifference , neglect , injustice , cruelty , violence , is just this failure of sympathetic imagination ; the failure to recognize other persons as being really and truly as much centers of feeling , thought , and purpose as we are . We thus , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter , and that he has the same organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions , as ourselves . p 300 This is the meaning of love of one 's neighbor as the great social bond . There can be no love without sympathetic imagination ? they are in essence the same thing . The poet Shelley has said this in finer words than mine . He says : " The great secret of morals is love ; or a going-out of our nature , and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought , action , or person not our own . A man , to be greatly good , must imagine intensely and comprehensively ; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others ; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own . The great instrument of moral good is the imagination . " 2 We must distinguish between mere emotional response and sympathetic insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . A mother may so respond , without thought , to her child 's demands as to coddle and spoil the child . Family love may indiscriminatingly further selfish instinct . A philanthropic individual may so respond to every appeal for aid , as to promote dishonest begging and to pauperize others , helping them to lose whatever little self-respect they may have had . One may be so thoughtlessly sympathetic as to unduly coddle criminals . One may forget one 's self-control , and let a mob or partisan or crowd emotion run away with one 's better judgment . Genuine ethical sympathy requires that the native feeling be guided by reflective insight . It is based on respect for the ideal self in the other . It is sympathy directed by the aim of assisting the other self to build up or recover his moral personality , as a center of self-control based on self-respect and respect for others ? the ideal of himself as a cooperating member in a community of persons alike in being free , self-respecting , and othersregarding persons . The final principle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuality , is his own personality . Each one , as a sentient subject , has equal right to consideration , respect , regard , and reverence . Every individual has inherent worth and dignity . That worth and dignity is to be respected and not interfered with , in so far as the individual does not attempt to ride roughshod over the individualities of other persons . Footnote  | The only moral justification for restraint by force or pressure is that the individual refuses to recognize the worth and sacredness of other persons . The other side of the shield is that true individuality , rational and ethical personality , is the very antithesis of queerness , oddity and exclusive selfishness . The ideal self is realized in proportion to the extent and depth of the individual 's active interests in that which is beyond his actual achieved selfhood , through interest in other persons , in humanity and nature ; through social contacts , through thoughtful imaginative comprehensions of the lives of his fellows in the present and past , and through the contemplation of nature . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of the marked differences in emotional , as well as in physical and intellectual capacity among human beings , every one should count for one and no one for more than one , why every one should be treated as an end in himself ? my answer is that every one is a distinct and private center of feeling and thought and that his feelings and entire personality are as valuable to him as yours are to you , Sir Aristocrat ! A man 's a man for a ' that and for a ' that . He whose own life is without intrinsic value can not recognize intrinsic value in another . He can not really sacrifice himself because he does not value himself . He can only prostrate himself . Persons are the only instances of self-dependent existences.3 Love is a spontaneous act of a genuine character . Love for persons is a specific kind of love . We can love beauty , truth , and art . Love for a person is quite different . Love for a person means the recognition , in feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must recognize the worth of the other self . Love is the condition of ethical sympathy . Sympathy for others and recognition of their worth are two facets of the same principle . Sympathy is not possible without respect for personality . If one does not recognize that others are truly human one will not make the effort . The relation between sympathy and respect for others , then , is reciprocal . The recog-Footnote  | nition of the value of other personalities as equally human centers of feeling leads to sympathetic attitudes . The sympathetic attitude practiced leads to an appreciation of personality . FEELING AND REASON Moral philosophers , notably the Stoics and Kant , have attempted to found morality on reason . The Stoics held that it is the common possession of reason that makes men alike and society possible . The differences of color , social status , and even education do not count in comparison with the common possession of reason . So they taught equality and cosmopolitanism . But they had to admit that men vary greatly in their powers of reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most men are fools . While Stoicism did promote the recognition of universal human rights and the brotherhood of man , it was rather hard and cold . Kant and Fichte are noted modern exponents of ethical rationalism . Another is Spinoza ; Cudworth , More , Clarke , Wollaston , and Price were English exponents of rationalism . Kant bases his principle of moral action solely on maxims or motives that one could will to be universally followed , on reason . All men are rational moral agents ? all have the consciousness of duty ? and one must therefore treat every one as an end in himself , as a center of intrinsic worth . The latter is a noble and sound principle . But it does not follow from the nature of reason . For , just as some men have very little rationality , so some seem to be almost or even wholly lacking in the sense of duty . Why should my moral reason tell me to treat an irrational individual , or one who prostitutes his reason to dishonest , libertine , or oppressive practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only justified in so treating him because my sympathetic imagination leads me to feel that perhaps , after all , there is a hidden spark of goodness in him , which evil circumstances have almost but not quite extinguished . Unless I can feel , through sympathetic imagination , the basic common humanity , however hidden , choked down , or wrenched awry , it may be , in another person , I can not really regard him as a subject of moral consideration .  | Reason has a very great role to play in clarifying and organizing our humane feelings and impulses and in directing them in effective channels . But reason does not supply either the original attitude or the motive power . The only basis of social morality ( and of all morality , for that matter ) is feeling enkindled and illuminated by sympathetic imagination . I recognize another individual to be an object of my respect and cooperation and aid because I feel that he is a human being no less than myself . Love is the fulfilling of the law . Without love the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no alternative basis for social morality to the feeling of the worth of our common humanity in the midst of all its tragic errors , its blind fury and foolishness . The only alternative is a non-moral calculating egotism . The greatest ethical influences , after all , have been such men as Jesus , Buddha , their followers , and others ? whose deepest passion was a profound compassion . The growth of humanitarian feeling is the deepest and most significant feature of human progress . This is illustrated , too , in the treatment of animals . We regard the infliction of unnecessary pain on animals as immoral because we recognize that they too are centers of feeling . A Descartes who regarded all animals as machines would not be troubled with these scruples . But we feel that the behavior of animals belies that thesis . I know mechanistic biologists and psychologists who are dog-lovers . To any dog-lover the proposition that his companion has no feelings that should be considered is both absurd and monstrous .  | DEMOCRATIC PERSONALISM THE ETHICAL STANDARD by which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How far does it minister to the harmonious realization of the basic human capacities and interests of all its members ? How far does it remove hindrances in the way of the fulfilment of individual personality ? How far does it afford positive opportunity for all individuals to realize their possibilities as persons ? This is the democratic ethical standard . All normal human individuals are constituted of the same dynamic capacities , the same psychophysical and spiritual impulses or interests . Every one seeks to preserve and develop his being . Every one seeks health and self-expression . Every one desires recognition , comradeship , friendship . Every one desires a mate and offspring . Every one has some impulse to know . Every one has , in some direction , a sense of beauty . Every one has play impulses . And every one has some feeling of man 's dependence on the mysterious cosmos , some sense of awe in the presence of the mysteries of birth and death , some feeling of reverence for the universe in which he is a conscious mote dancing in the cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in the harmonious fulfilment of his physical , sensuous , interpersonal , emotional , and intellectual and spiritual powers , that the fullest good and happiness for man lies . The differences between the inborn individualities of human beings consist in the relative degrees of strength of these inherited dynamic impulses , which are the raw materials of personality . The ways in which they are fulfilled or thwarted depend , in varying measure , on the nature , strength , and persistent courage of the individual , in interplay with his special environment . The democratic ethical standard requires that society shall , in its legal , political , eco-  | nomic , educational , and cultural activities be so planned and directed that no human being shall be shut out from a fair opportunity for the realization of his individuality . We do not know just when personality began to emerge into conscious recognition in the history of human culture . Professor Breasted thinks it was recognized in ancient Egypt . ' However , the beginning of its clear recognition was in ancient Greece . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , Plato and Aristotle . Socrates ' teaching on the necessity of reflective insight as the condition of the health and harmony of the soul was carried further by Plato . The good life , for Plato , consists in the harmonious fulfilment of the powers of the Soul . The Soul Plato held to be the principle of life and movement , not only in man but in the universe . Aristotle carried out the same idea . They both conceived the political State to be an organized instrument to further the good life in its members . The Stoics made a cosmopolitan extension of this idea . They conceived the Great City , the Empire of Reason , to be the entire world of humanity . Then came Jesus and his disciples , with their emphasis on the absolute value of the human personality , as being the offspring of the Divine Personality . Through the happy fusion of Greek thought and Christian faith was born the principle that every soul has inherent value . The human individual was discovered . The Church was organized to uplift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be immortal . By the Renaissance the nature of personality was secularized . Through all the devious ups and downs of Western culture runs this central thread ? the deepening of the meaning of human personality and the extension of the application of personality as realizer and carrier of all human values in all individuals . History moves by irregular zigzag steps . Humanity does not go straight towards its goal . Medieval society , under the aegis of the Church , was organized to realize personality ; but the principle of social authority became too strong and corrupt . It was necessary for the growth of personality that the authority should be broken down . Since the Renaissance and the Reformation , Footnote  | Western culture has moved in the direction of a socially unbridled individualism which , by reason of overemphasis of the economic motive , has given rein to all its powers of selfish greed and the lust for power , and so defeated the purpose of individual freedom . Western civilization , having learned to control nature for the satisfaction of human interests , must learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers which it has gained , in order that opportunity for the fulfilment of the basic interests which make up personality may be accessible to all . In trying to do this one must keep in mind always that the goal is the harmonious fulfilment , in all individuals , of the psychophysical and spiritual powers ? the realization of personality . This is the higher individualism , or , as I would rather say , personalism . The standard is the realization of personality in a community , in which each individual contributes his bit for the advancement of the life of the entire community . It is not the sacrifice of the individual to the idea of the community . For the real community consists of cooperating individuals . Only through cooperation can personality be realized . There is a social solidarity , a mutuality of action and life , a give-and-take in which alone personality can be realized . There is great danger that the individual spirit shall be submerged , through the vastness and complexity of the machinery of present-day life . For example , the workman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work ; oftentimes practically nothing of it . The machinery does it all . In his hours of recreation he can be passively entertained by machines ? the movie and the radio . The organs of opinion and propaganda ? newspaper and radio ? become more and more machinelike . What a man wears is made by machinery . He even buys his food at chain stores , much of it ready to eat . The cities have grown apace . We have mass movements , crowds , mobs . Education has become largely mass education . This is cheaper than individual education . It is because women can be had cheaper than men that most boys are taught by women . Most women who teach have no intention of remaining teachers all their lives . For the time being they will work for less than men .  | The majority of Americans are not dishonest , nor consumed by an overmastering greed . They are hard-working , honest , devoted to their families , and interested in their friends . They are simply inert , dumb , and powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who manipulate inventions , scientific discoveries , finance , law , politics , and government to satisfy their own greed for wealth and power . The majority appear to be concerned , when they are getting on fairly well , only with more material prosperity for their families and themselves , more comforts and means of enjoyment and social and cultural advancement for their wives and families . 1 . MASS PRODUCTION AND INDIVIDUALITY What , then , more specifically are the bearings of mass production and standardization , which seem more and more to pervade our economic and cultural life , on the development of spiritual individuality or personality ? Individuality . True individuality is not freakishness or oddity . It is not just being different from one 's fellows , though differences are often quite as important as samenesses in the members of the community . The habitual criminal , the misanthrope , the hermit , the insane individual , are not true persons . Even the misanthrope is social . The bottom would fall out of his selfhood , if he were absolutely alone , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be gone . The misogynist 's occupation would be gone if there were no women left in the world . Even the hermit , who turns his back on his fellow men , because of his unfortunate experiences , carries some social relations with him into the solitudes . Sociality of Man . The fact is that all human beings are inevitably and inextricably social . Although they may not get on very well with their fellows , they can not get on without them . The individual develops his personality only in the give and take of social relations . His very consciousness of self , his selfrespect , his self-forgetfulness , his pride , his humility , are all socially conditioned . Individual and Social Ends . Since , in every case , the indi-  | vidual , as a social being , is one who realizes and enjoys his individuality only with reference to his fellows ; and since an actual community always consists of individuals living in certain relations , it is nonsense to attempt to conceive a society in which the interests and activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does one mean by social ends or purposes ? Simply those ends or purposes which individuals can will together and , by cooperative effort , realize together . And those common purposes are always actually enjoyed by individuals ; since only individuals think , will , and feel . Good and Bad Individualism . The true distinction , with reference to social ends , is between a good and a bad individualism . A bad individualism is one in which many or some individuals are not respected and treated as having any inherent worth ; but are used merely as tools to serve the special interests of other individuals . The good individualism is one in which all the members of society are given equal opportunities to realize and enjoy their various capacities and aptitudes . This is the difference between oligarchic and democratic individualism . Democracy , as a social ideal , simply means that every one shall have a fair chance . And the prime condition of a fair chance is equalization of educational opportunities . Distinctions and Inequality . On the other hand , equalization of opportunity does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of differences between individuals . Individuals are born , not only different in the sense of having various combinations of capacities and aptitudes ; they are born unequal , with respect to the same capacities and aptitudes . Until we have learned to standardize the production of babies , as we now do automobile parts , this will continue to be so . That is , in all probability , so long as the human race endures . It is just as well that it is so . Human life would lose most of its interest if all human beings were alike . Nature seems to have been aiming , if she has been aiming at all , throughout the evolutionary process , at the production of the greatest possible development of various individualities . Certainly the scale on which we measure evolution is individuality . What we mean by " lower " is an organism possessing less initiative , less varied power of inventive adapta-  | tion to , and control of , the environment . What we mean by " higher " is an organism possessing greater wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to control its environment and to build up a life of its own . 2 . MASS PRODUCTION AND PERSONALITY Individuality and Personality . The words " individuality " and " personality " are used in several senses . Let us take " individuality " as an ethical ideal , to express the full and harmonious exercise of the normal powers or the satisfaction of the normal interests of each individual . Any interest is normal if its satisfaction does not destroy the harmony of the individual 's deepest interests , nor injure the like interests of other individuals . The individual is a dynamic system , a growing organization of interests . Let us take " personality " to express the principle that true individuality can be achieved and lived only in a community of individuals who are like-minded , in that all share in the common purpose of realizing their full individualism , as cooperating members of the community . Then we may say that personality means individuality that is loyal to its social obligations . Then we may describe the ideal as socialized individuality or personality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of individual development . But , just as truly , the social progress of man is the work of creative and cooperative individual minds . The entire life of civilization is the expression and self-realization of personality in the making . It is not something handed ready-made to man by nature or God . It is man 's creation . In the continuous making and remaking of cultures ( technics , arts , morals , laws , political systems , sciences , religions , and philosophies ) , the human spirit is ever creating itself , through creating and recreating the conditions and modes of its own selfrealization . Nurture of Creative Spirit . The true leaders of the race in the march of culture are those in whom this creative spiritual urge , is strongest . But , in order that social creativeness may continue and increase , the mass , the average men and women , must become intelligently sensitive and creatively responsive to the work  | of the leaders . A civilization which should be organized to give free scope to leaders , while keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get anywhere . It would be headed for disaster . A civilization which , in raising the average , would repress the creative spirit of the exceptionally well-endowed would never advance . It would retrograde and fall to pieces of its own inertia . In fact , the average can be raised only when there is full scope for the adventurous and originative pioneers in culture . The more we liberate creative capacity to lead , and to respond to leadership , the more we advance . The promise of democracy lies just here . It follows that the indispensable condition of communal progress , and of individual well-being through communal progress , is the effective offering to all the children of all the opportunity in nurture and incitement to creative selfdevelopment , that the most widely diffused and highest powered education can give . Without creative leadership ? no progress . Equally , without creative responsiveness ? no progress . Human beings are born various and unequal in their capacities . Let full scope be given , that the variety and inequality of powers shall all find realization ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which education can not be carried forward at all ; and society will progress in the increase of rich , full-bodied , harmonious , and dynamic personalities . Social Service and Personality . There is a good deal of cant connected with the emphasis on social service as an ethical ideal . It is true that the good individual is always one who serves society , but the ways in which individuals serve their fellows are multifarious . The individual who develops , to the highest degree possible , his specific capacities is the type of individual who is able to render the rarest and most valuable service to his fellows . If we take individuality in the true sense , as involving the subordination of man 's lower or sensuous nature to his mental capacities , the instrumentation of the biological urges to the spiritual , there is no opposition between distinctive individuality and high service of society . Indeed , only those who develop their individualities to a high degree can render signal services to society . There is a lower individualism and a higher individualism  | or personalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives as a self-regarding animal , which is a shortsighted selfishness . The higher individualism , the higher selfishness , if you like , is that of the person who controls his lower nature , who denies himself , who renounces some of the goods that satisfy the appetites of the human animal , in order that he may develop his mental and spiritual powers to their fullest . The cultural life of human society can only be carried on and enriched through the development and activity in it of many well-trained , highpowered individuals . The flourishing of the higher individualism is the indispensable condition of social progress . Mass Production . To-day we are living in the midst of one of the most momentous transformations that has ever occurred in human society . Mass production and distribution , through machinery and organization , is the most striking characteristic , of our civilization . It began with the steam-engine and was applied first to production and distribution of material goods . It has gone forward to embrace the distribution of news , amusements , propaganda , art , knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass production has coincided with the movement towards democracy in government and education . The development of mass production and distribution facilitates , and is facilitated by , the increase of economic and cultural opportunity for the masses . The democratization of the fruits of the machine , from bathtubs and autos to the dramatic arts and education , means increasing standardization , not only in the physical things we use , but in our mentality . " The individual withers and the world is more and more . " The herd mind seems ever more pervasive and dominant . The process of transformation to mass production and distribution has taken place more rapidly in the United States than anywhere else for several reasons : 1 . The presence of a large and energetic population , but little hampered by long-established customs , a people in the pioneering stage , and with but thin cakes of inherited customs to break through . 2 . The open field and the enormous natural resources at our disposal . We have had plenty of elbow room . We have been free  | from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heritage of European culture was ours to use and develop . 3 . Our political and social democracy . Foreigners and Americans often comment on our lack of individuality , spiritual freedom , and our poverty in spiritual creativeness . Andre Siegfried , a penetrating French critic , says American civilization is being " fordized . " The fundamental principle of " fordization " is the entire subordination of the individual to standardized mass production . He writes of us thus : America has exchanged liberty for prosperity . In America , the dominant force that is threatening to carry everything before it ? Protestant , Catholic , and Jew ? is the obsession for tangible and material accomplishment ... .2 In its pursuit of wealth and power , America has abandoned the idea of liberty to follow that of prosperity ... .3 The mysticism of success is perhaps their genuine religion and with it is combined a somewhat guileless optimism ... 4 It is a strictly utilitarian outlook , but it satisfies the naive idealism of the nation . It has been personified in the immortal Babbitt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saving humanity by lining his pockets with comfortable dollars.5 Siegfried then proceeds to the conclusion that American civilization is not a further development of European civilization , but a new civilization , marked by standardization of the means of material comfort . Mass Production and Personality . Does mass production , or mechanism in social life , necessarily imply the suppression of personality ? I question it . I do not wholly agree with Siegfried . I think the trouble is not standardization in itself , but too low standards . Spiritual arrest and fixation is not the inevitable result of machine technic . It seems to have existed in the farther Orient for many centuries . It obtained in the Inca civilization of Peru a remarkable form of Socialism based on autocracy . It obtained in Europe before the advent of mass production . Indeed , the very Footnote  | fluidity of machine production seems to generate an uncritical and undirected hospitality to ceaseless change , an attitude which , so far from resulting in mental fixation , makes against it and for an anarchic flux emanating from mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gregariousness , suggestibility , imitativeness of man and in the social needs of man 's customs and cooperation . As civilization becomes more complex , the need for the emphasis on individual responsibility to master the machine becomes more urgent . It is possible that our civilization may collapse , because of its increasing complexity and our inability to develop a sufficient proportion of individuals with initiative , insight , and farsightedness able to control our social machinery . Spengler thinks this is actually happening . Tendencies Towards the Mass Mind . There are strong tendencies working for the submergence of the individual in the machinelike mass . On the other hand , the machine , kept in its place as an instrument for human ends , means a tremendous liberation of human power and opportunity for the realization of spiritual values . As machine civilization becomes more complex , the more urgent becomes the need for an education or culture which will aim at the development of independent personality . How can education accomplish these ends ? It must be directed so that the individual shall become the active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on educational organization , machinery , routine ; too much on textbooks , recitations , records , credit hours . Emerson summed up the whole matter : The one thing in the world of value is the active soul . This every man is entitled to ; this every man contains within him , although , in almost all men , obstructed , and as yet unborn .. . . One must be an inventor to read well . As the proverb says , " , IIe that would bring home the wealth of the Indies , must carry out the wealth of the Indies . " There is then creative reading , as well as creative writing . When the mind is braced by labor and invention , the page of whatever book read becomes luminous with manifold allusions . ... In selftrust all the virtues are comprehended . Thinking is the function . Living is the functionary . The stream retreats to its source . A great soul will be strong to live , as well as to think .... The preamble of thought ,  | the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is action . Only so much do I know , as I have lived .... So much only of life as I know by experience , so much of the wilderness have I vanquished and planted , or so far have I extended my being , my dominion . The main enterprise of the world for splendor , for extent , is the up-building of a man.6 Culture , for Emerson , is the means by which a man is liberated from his narrow self-centered egotism . Individuality is the basis of culture : Every valuable nature is there in its right , and the student we speak to must have a mother wit invincible by his culture , which uses all books , arts , facilities , and elegancies of intercourse , but is never subdued and lost in them . He only is a well-made man who has a good determination . And the end of culture is not to destroy this , God forbid ! but to train away all impediment and mixture , and leave nothing but pure power .... Culture is the suggestion from certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affinities , through which he can modulate the violence of any master tones that have a droning preponderance in his scale , and succor him against himself . Culture redresses his balance , puts him among his equals and superiors , revives the delicious sense of sympathy , and warns him of the dangers of solitude and repulsion . ' Machinery Will Not Produce Individual Personalities . We need , as a people , to learn that there is no substitute in organization , machinery , and mass methods , for the individuality of the soul and the placing of high value on distinction ; that by no magic of machinery can mere quantity of a low order be transmuted into qualitative perfection . No mass methods will develop rational , ethical personality . No social machinery will run itself . The more complex it becomes the more urgent the need for spiritual individuality . William James says : The notion that a people can run itself and its affairs anonymously is now well known to be silliest of absurdities . Mankind does nothing save through initiatives on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us ? these are the sole factors active in human progress . Individuals of genius show the way , and set the patterns , which common people then adopt and follow . The rivalry of the pat-Footnote  | terns is the history of the world . Our democratic problem thus is statable in ultra-simple terms : Who are the kind of men from whom our majorities shall take their cue ? Whom shall they treat as rightful leaders ? We and our leaders are the x and y of the equation here ; all other historic circumstances , be they economical , political , or intellectual , are only the background of occasion on which the living drama works itself out between us . In this very simple way does the value of our educated class define itself : we more than others should be able to divine the worthier and better leaders . The terms here are monstrously simplified , of course , but such a bird's-eye view lets us immediately take our bearings . In our democracy , where everything else is so shifting , we alumni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that corresponds to the aristocracy in older countries . We have continuous traditions , as they have ; our motto , too , is noblesse oblige ; and unlike them , we stand for ideal interests solely , for we have no corporate selfishness and wield no powers of corruption .. . s All our arts and sciences and institutions are but so many quests of perfection on the part of men ; and when we see how diverse the types of excellence may be , how various the tests , how flexible the adaptations , we gain a richer sense of what the terms " better " and " worse " may signify in general . Our critical sensibilities grow both more acute and less fanatical . We sympathize with men 's mistakes even in the act of penetrating them ; we feel the pathos of lost causes and misguided epochs even while we applaud what overcame them . Such words are vague and such ideas are inadequate , but their meaning is unmistakable . What the colleges ? teaching humanities by examples which may be special , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give us , is a general sense of what , under various disguises , superiority has always signified and may still signify . The feeling for a good human job anywhere , the admiration of the really admirable , the disesteem of what is cheap and trashy and impermanent ? this is what we call the critical sense , the sense for ideal values . It is the better part of what men know as wisdom . ? Summary . Human nature in the raw is a hierarchy of impulsions , dynamic tendencies , or motivations having greatly differing values for the well-being of the individual and of the community . These impulsions must be organized , under the direction of reflective thought , by reference to a scale and system Footnote  | of values . Personality is achieved harmony , the integration into a total dynamic system , of these impulsions . Self-control , selfdirection , under the guidance of reason , is the indispensable condition of self-integration . Society consists of individuals living in interaction . Since , under the most favorable economic and cultural conditions , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less self-directed integration , a society which makes the mass , King Demos , the arbiter of all standards in conduct , art , and culture , will disintegrate and become a mob , approximating to the Hobbesian bellum omnium contra omnes . Without recognition of the aristocratic principle , in its governance and culture , a democracy is a moronocracy headed straight for a dictatorship , Bolshevist or Mussolinist . Democracy can be saved only by an aristocracy of high intelligence and noble character , not an aristocracy living in ivory towers and cultivating behind high walls its own beautiful gardens , insensible to the milling and bemused mob without the gates ; no , an aristocracy the keynotes of whose life are selfdirection and labor for the most excellent things that are as difficult as they are rare , in the spirit of devotion to the well-being of the whole community . For the end of social life , as Plato put it , is not to make the individual happy by himself ( if this were possible ) but to make all as happy as possible . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to virtue and throughout a life .  | LIFE , LIBERTY , AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS 1 . RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THE SECOND PARAGRAPH of The Declaration of Independence begins as follows : " We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . That , to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . " This fine statement of the charter of democracy may be compared with the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , made in 1789 . The Declaration of Independence assumes as self-evident , three propositions : ( 1 ) that there are natural rights ; ( 2 ) that with respect to the enjoyment of these rights all men are equal ; and ( 3 ) that the three basic rights are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . It asserts further that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of these rights and that all government derives its authority from the consent of the governed . In these two revolutionary documents were summed up the principles of the modern movement towards universal individual liberty and the equal rights of all individuals to enjoy the opportunity for the development of personality . These principles have been very imperfectly realized in the social life of Western civilization since then . They do express the very heart of the moral principles of democracy , and yet every one of them is challenged . I shall agree that there is truth in them , rightly understood ; but that they are not in themselves self-evident . They are deductions from , and consequences of one principle which , if not self-evident , is the fundamental ethical postulate of democracy . This is : There is an inalienable worth and dignity in every normal human indi-  | vidual which implies that every one is entitled to an opportunity to realize , as fully and harmoniously as possible , his nature as a person . If we mean by " nature " a condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an organized society or community ? that is , the " state of nature " as conceived by Hobbes , Locke , and Rousseau ? then there are no natural rights . In such a state , as Hobbes forcibly said , there could be no right but brute power . But man could not exist in such a condition and be truly human . He would be in a worse plight than the brute beasts . If one means by " nature " the condition of affairs in which man can realize and enjoy his capacities for becoming a rational self-determining individual and so becoming a person , the state of nature is the social state . Then the natural rights are those rights of man as a member of a community which are indispensable for the realization , by all the members thereof , of their individualities . There is no community apart from the individual persons ; and there is no person apart from , or antecedent to , the community . There is no activity or interest of an individual which has not some possible social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food affects other persons . Since this is so , there are no rights without duties or obligations . The basic duties and rights are correlative . I may have a duty to myself as mind or spirit , over and above my obvious social obligations , but this duty to self will nevertheless have some social effects . Here we are concerned only with the individual person 's social relations . His duties are definitions of his social functions . It is my duty to earn a living for myself and family by doing some work that is of value to society ; that is , of value to other persons , present and to come . These are my social functions , and my rights are correlative therewith . I have a right to a living and to such conditions of livelihood as will enable me to discharge my social functions . But I can not do this efficiently if my personality is thwarted in some important interest or capacity . The specification of the rights of personality and the modes of their appreciation depend upon the existing social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duties of an Athenian , a European townsman of the twelfth century , and an individual  | to-day , are not the same . The rights and duties of a European , Turkish , or Chinese peasant , and an American farmer , are somewhat different . In this sense , rights are not fixed and absolute . They are relative to a social situation . Rights in general are the social principles necessary for the realization of personality . My right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness can exist as a right only in so far as , in its exercise , I do not infringe upon the equal rights of the other members of the community . There are no absolute rights . The nearest approach to absolute rights are the rights to the life and the freedom of one 's own body-mind or self . But even these rights are limited . Not only must I not exercise this freedom in such ways as to injure the like exercise of freedom by other selves ; but , moreover , the State may demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals , put down sedition , or defend the community against a violent attack upon its very existence . Why may the State rightfully demand these services of me ? Because my own security and freedom I owe to the maintenance of a social order by the State . 2 . LIBERTIES AND OPPORTUNITIES The positive meanings of " liberty " or " freedom " reside in the opportunities that their exercise gives to individuals to do , or to abstain from doing , something specific that has either value or disvalue . In the general sense , individualism and freedom mean the same thing . A specific freedom means a specific opportunity for individuals to do or abstain from doing something specific ; but we must ask what specific kinds of things the individual values and wants to be free to do , and what proportion of individuals are free to do these sorts of things in our existing social order . I am physically free so long as I am not in jail ; and not under other restraint , not pinioned to the ground by an immovable weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very highly . I would fight to the last drop of blood to keep it . I am socially and morally free so long as , being in the normal possession of my senses and intelligence and not the slave of some vice , I have the power to direct my own conduct in the society  | in which I live ; subject , of course , to the condition that I do not interfere with the voluntary acts of other persons . I am religiously free in so far as I have the power to join , or to refrain from joining , any religious body , to believe in any God I see fit or in no God ; provided , of course , that my religious beliefs and practices do not interfere with others , do not violate their persons or the social decencies . I am not free to belong to a religious sect which holds that the assassination of unbelievers , or the practice of prostitution , polygamy , or pederasty is holy . I am intellectually free in so far as no one hinders me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided again that my opinions do not include vicious attacks on the persons or characters of my fellow citizens , nor include the advocacy of social violence as a means of forcing my opinions on others . I am politically free in so far as I have the power to discuss and criticize policies of state and politicians and have the power to vote for , as well as to advocate , the men and measures in which I believe . I am economically free in so far as I have the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood by some work that is of social value , or at least socially harmless . In the United States to-day we have , in general , physical , social , moral , religious , and intellectual freedom , and we have political freedom ; except when passions run high during strikes and other forms of group conflict . Then political freedom may be curtailed ; and with it social , moral , and intellectual freedom . Those suspected of being Communists , or more indefinitely , " radicals , " may be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beaten , jailed ; and even the courts are sometimes loaded against them . Why ? Because of their suspected advocacy of social views which , in the interests of a wider economic freedom , threaten the vested interests of those who , through the possession of wealth and control of the organs of public opinion and the courts , are able to obtain exercise of the police power of the State against agitators and radicals . It is obvious , to any disinterested and well-informed person that , on the other hand , the other forms of freedom are mere mockeries to a starving and homeless man , if economic opportu-  | nity be wholly denied him . If I am suffering from hunger , cold , physical exhaustion , or diseases brought only by these causes , I can not exercise much intellectual or spiritual freedom . Even political freedom then seems a mockery . And on the other hand , the exercise of social and political propaganda to take away control from those who , by the use of great wealth , exercise power over the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that they are ready to circumscribe the political , intellectual , and personal physical freedom of those who propose so to do . Sweet above all things is power . Plato said power is poison and insidiously corrupts those who wield it ; so that the more nearly absolute a man 's power is , the worse he is likely to become . In the history of Western civilization hitherto no class possessing special privileges ( which , in the last analysis , come down to economic and military powers ) has ever relinquished these powers or suffered a part of them to be acquired by the underdogs subject to them without a bitter struggle . From the Roman conflicts between the patricians and the plebeians ( in the social wars ) , through the time of the medieval feudal lords and the peasant wars to the French and Russian revolutions , every great struggle has been a conflict between a minority possessed of power and a majority seeking greater economic freedom and security . That there is a historical explanation and justification for economic individualism and that this justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and the following chapters . Feudal society was essentially an organization of groups having mutual obligations and rights . There was a regular gradation on the land . There were manors of all sorts and sizes , from those with land for seventy teams to those with land for one team of oxen . There were free and unfree tenants . A man legally free might accept land from a manorial lord on condition of doing villein services ; a man legally unfree might be excused from his villein services . There were three classes of serfs , boors , cottars , and villeins ? the latter the best off . As a money economy came in , villeins commutated their services . by money payments . The lords of the manors held their tenures in a variety of ways ? directly from the king or from some intermediate lord .  | There were two kinds of tenure ? knight service , in which the lord of the manor rendered military service to his overlord at his own expense forty days in the year ( as service which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of money or the free rendering of services . In the towns the gradations were not elaborate . In the guilds there were the apprentices and the masters . In the Church were the orders of the secular clergy and the monastic orders . The end of feudalism is the birth of modern industrialism . The military power of the knights was destroyed by the use of firearms . The day of the robber barons came to an end . Their castellated crags fell before the power of artillery . In the meantime the wealth and power of the townsmen increased . The increase of production and commerce brought modern banking , in the development of which the Lombards led . Foresighted princes who , like the English Tudors , made common cause with the rising middle class against the barons , came into power . Protestantism was partly a rebellion against the moral and spiritual supremacy of the Papacy , and partly against the payment of taxes to a foreign potentate for his great fane at Rome . Protestantism became the religion of the middle class in Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and R. H. Tawney , that Protestantism furnished the most favorable ethical and religious soil for the growth of capitalistic individualism . In this respect Protestantism was partly an effect , partly a cause , and partly independent , of the economic revolution . But liberty to trade went hand in hand with liberty to choose one 's religious affiliations , especially with congregationalism , which means lay rule in the Church . The great abbeys were destroyed and their lands enclosed . The commons were enclosed , and the peasants , who had had right to the use of the land , became landless serfs . The time was ripe for the formation of a proletariat formed of those who had no other powers than those of using their muscles and breeding their kind to do likewise . The tremendous influence of the great bankers is illustrated most strikingly in the career of the Medici at Florence . The basis  | of their power was financial ? they were money-lenders . The despots of the Italian Renaissance , with their hired soldiers and captains ( condottieri ) , were among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robber barons , and their ambition was for wealth and the power it brings . Hard , cruel , and without principle , they intrigued , poisoned , assassinated , made war , corrupted literary men and artists as well as priests and political agents . The struggle in England for the supremacy of Parliament was a three-cornered fight between commoners , nobles , and kings . The triumph of Parliamentarianism in the Protestant succession was another mile-post in the march of the monied middle class towards social power through political representation . John Locke , the philosopher of representative government , was not a democrat in either the political or the economic sense . He based the right to participation , through representation , in ruling , on the possession of property . For him the right to private property was an inalienable and inherent natural right , antecedent and superior to the institution of any political state and its legal enactments . Locke held that a man 's right to property is won by his labor , and that there is no constituted power that has any right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own day Locke was rather naive about this . His patron , the Earl of Shaftesbury , did not labor much for his property , nor was the wealth of the bankers and money-lenders of his day proportioned to their labors . The French Revolution began as a movement of the monied middle class against the high taxes and waste of the court . The revolution took on democratic features through the influence of the Paris mob and of Rousseau . But the liberty it sought was social and political ; equality before the law and an equal right to a voice through their representatives in making the laws . The French Revolution did not aim at economic equality ; it sought only enlargement of economic opportunity through political equality , and increased opportunity to make money through the removal of burdensome restrictions and the control of taxation . Nor was the American Revolution inspired by a desire for economic equality . Its basic principle was " no taxation without representation . " The leaders of the American Revolution  | evidently thought that there was a sufficient equality of economic opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . They carefully guarded the rights of property in the Constitution . Jefferson and his followers looked for a continuance of relative economic equality of opportunity . Hamilton , James Madison , John Adams , and the colonial merchants generally did not believe at all in economic or social democracy . They firmly held to a natural inequality in human powers which would justly result in considerable economic inequality . In the meantime , actually coincident with the French Revolution , another revolution more portentous in its consequences was getting under way ? the industrial revolution through the application of steam power to industrial production and distribution . This power age was to merge into the age of the gas-engine and the electric-dynamo . Lewis Mumford , in his notable work , Technics and Civilization , points out that the ideas of power production long antedated the middle of the eighteenth century and that the industrial revolution began long before . The age of steam and coal power he calls the age of paleotechnics , the new age of electric power neotechnics . This is no doubt a correct distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century , there was a conjunction of capitalistic commercial development and invention which involved for the first time the rapid transformation of industry from domestic production to factory or mass production ; and that this is an essentially revolutionary step in human society . What was meant by freedom in the age of power production was the freedom from all hampering restraints in the development of this factory system . This brought to pass the physical and mental degradation of the workers . Work hours prolonged to the limit of human endurance for little children and women as well as adult males , low wages , miserable housing conditions , unsanitary and dangerous factory and mine conditions , together with the powerlessness of the individual worker in this tremendously unequal bargaining between the factory owner and the starving , would-be employee , led to the philanthropic attempts to regulate industry ? the Factory Acts and various measures of social reform .  | Modern Socialism is the offspring of mass production . The rise of mass production also led to the effort on the part of the workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the rulers meant by freedom was shown by the exile to Van Dieman 's Land of the first English laborer who organized a labor union and by the making of unions , as well as strikes , illegal . 3 . LIBERTY AND LIBERTIES In most of the current discussion about liberty ? especially on the part of those who proclaim that we are being robbed of our precious American heritage of liberty , proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence to be as inalienable a human right as life itself and guaranteed by the Constitution , there is usually a failure to specify just what liberties are being destroyed . There is a magic aura of majesty and mystery about the words " liberty " or " freedom " that seems to create a highly emotional state of alarm . They are words to conjure with , hobgoblins with which to frighten people ? like " Radical , " " Red , " " Communism . " To say that a proposal or a legislative act is socialistic is to damn it as an insidious menace ; whereas it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good by the chosen agents of the people as a whole . No doubt , to the private enterprisers who sold water at high prices , municipal waterworks were socialistic in this bad sense . So was the United States Postal Service to those who made big profits carrying letters . To the American Express Company the parcel post was dangerous Socialism . They could carry parcels cheaper and more efficiently . So would city health service be to many physicians . To physicians concerned with making large incomes , even health insurance is socialistic and socialized medicine is Communism of the worst stripe . Freedom , or liberty , then , is a very ambiguous word . Politically , it means the right to vote , to elect one 's representatives and choose one 's agents in making and administering the laws . Spiritually , it means the right to express one 's own opinions in matters intellectual and religious . Socially , it means the absence
