Three solo shows in Manhattan this week invited critics to speculate on the artistic possibilities of the terrible , the humane and the naive . <P> Haunted Grosz . Since he arrived in the U. S. in 1932 , Artist George Grosz has made small capital of his fame as No. 1 War satirist and scourge of post-War vice in Germany . Settled in Douglaston , L. I. with his wife and two small sons , Artist Grosz instead apprenticed himself to the art of oil painting in 1934 , has worked hard at it ever since . Last year his explosive Street Fight stirred visitors at a Whitney Museum annual ( TIME , Jan. 3 , 1938 ) ; single " Studies in Textures " have appeared elsewhere . Last autumn George Grosz became a U. S. citizen . This week he was finally ready for his first one-man show of paintings at the Walker Galleries . <P> If there was doubt of Artist Grosz 's accomplishment in oil , the wiry strength , textural richness , clean color and solid finish of several still life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of these paintings made all the more striking a number of gruesome , garish or ruined landscapes and the latest , largest picture on view , A Piece of My World ( see cut ) . This one harked back to the line drawings the artist made at 23 , when he was a German pacifist who had been condemned to death but let off with front-line service on the Western Front . It was a grey and dirt-colored allegory of war which , like the Thirty Years War in Europe ( 1618-48 ) , lasted so long that men forgot , in disease , starvation and insanity , what they were fighting for . The witlings who stumble to the attack in A Piece of My World do so with forks for bayonets , rats for their baggage train , ruin for their objective . <P> A roundish , solid man in immaculate dark clothes , with fine tight features and bright brown eyes , George Grosz has more to say of his precise technical discipline than of his feelings . But last week he confessed to a fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly as he declared : " Every survivor is a haunted house . " <P> Croat 's America . Once known as Yugoslavia 's finest portrait painter , Croatian Maximilian Vanka was not months in the U. S. two years ago when he painted , for a little Roman Catholic Church in Millvale , Pa. , a stunning set of murals to which art lovers have been making pilgrimage ever since ( TIME , July 19 , 1937 ) . Last week slight , courtly , volatile Artist Vanka nearly popped with affability and shyness as Manhattan 's Newhouse Galleries opened an exhibition of his work in the U. S. <P> Like his friend , Louis Adamic , " Maxo " Vanka has a love of poor people and a tireless zeal in studying them . Among his sepia drawings were two that made many a visitor gulp with humanitarian rage : spots of sunlight on a wall under Brooklyn Bridge with bums standing in each spot for warmth ; three old slatterns on an alley bench , one drunk and swollen , clinging to elegance with a shawl , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show were Artist Vanka 's palette knife paintings , smooth , slightly van Goghish , brilliantly composed , of a Bowery poolroom , a small-time movie house , cheap restaurant .
