In 1912 William Edgar Borah was one of the few liberals of the Republican Party who did not abandon the sinking political ship of William Howard Taft and bolt the party . Last month Senator Borah frightened conservative Republicans of Taft 's native State by announcing that he was going to run in Ohio primaries to prevent the naming of a favorite son . who would be used to deliver Ohio 's convention vote to a boss-picked , Old-Guard candidate . Last week Ohio Republicans scurried about to find a rival candidate to prevent the Ohio delegation from going to the Idahoan by default . Few avowed candidates wanted to risk a possible defeat in Ohio at the Senator 's hands . <P> To encourage them , the Republican State chairman took a poll of 10,000 Ohio Republicans on their preference in candidates . First place ( 56.3% ) went to Governor Alf Landon of Kansas . That did not help much . Governor Landon thanked them kindly but declined to contest Ohio without stumping the State , which he could not do because it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job as Governor . Second place ( 20.8% ) in the poll went to Senator Borah . That helped even less . Third place ( 13.2% ) went to Colonel Frank Knox . Publisher Knox declined to take the risk . Fourth place ( 4.1% ) went to Herbert Hoover . Mr. Hoover was not even asked . Fifth place ( 2.9% ) went to Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan . He asked to be excused . Sixth place ( .6% ) to Senator Lester Dickinson of Iowa , who said no thanks . <P> Balked at every turn , Ohio 's leaders decided to pick the best man they could from their own State . They selected one of Ohio 's most reputable Republicans , Robert Alphonso Taft , elder son of the 27th President of the U. S. , grandson of Grant 's Secretary of War and Attorney General . Lawyer Taft 's chief qualifications were : 1 ) his name ; 2 ) his " gold-clause " suit for $1.07 against the U. S. Government , a suit against which the New Deal 's best legal talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Ohio law requires every primary candidate for President to have a running mate on the ticket , not as an aspirant for the Vice Presidency but as a second choice for the Presidency to whom Ohio convention delegates may turn in case their first choice can not be nominated . As second choice on the Taft ticket was named Charles R. Frederickson , onetime president of the Ohio Manufacturers Association . Favorite-Son Taft 's job will be to sit tight , become a rallying point around which Ohioans can gather to save Ohio from Borah.
