W E HAVE no end of bird's-eye views of places  --  especially of Hollywood . The literary birds from the East fly over fast ; but whatever else they ignore , their keen eyes miss none of the worms . We are told again and again just how the movie worms look to those birds of passage . They look very wormy . It is , perhaps , only fair that something be said about how some of those birds look to the worms . Some of them look pretty funny . They leave their aeries in New York and London , swoop down on the rich pickings in Hollywood , then fly back and chatter madly about how ridiculous a place it is . Nothing could ever induce them to go back  --  except the offer of more of the same easy money . Yet , while they are writing so hilariously of their impressions of Hollywood , Hollywood is , perhaps , hilarious over its impressions of them  --  sometimes not hilarious but contemptuous , disgusted . This is what Fly Mayer would have called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hand That Feeds Them ACCORDING to the almost unanimous reports of the satirists of Hollywood , the town is chiefly re-markable for the ignorance , the greed , the extrava-gance , the ostentation , the imbecility , the hostility to true art , the l3ceotian swinishness , the bad morals , bad manners and bad taste of its inhabitants ; the monot-ony , obscenity , timidity , repetitiousness , insincerity , Philistinism , of their output ; the bad architecture , bad furnishing , bad surroundings of their homes ; the cheap scenery , trashy mountains and stupid ocean of their landscape , the low Cultural and social estate of the whole region , and the utter inability of the barbarians to appreciate the true value and inspiration of Eastern visitors . Otherwise , Hollywood is all right . The critics seem never to be troubled by a doubt about the full justice of their diatribes or the high quality of their own credentials . IV hen they speak of bad art they always know just what good art is , and it is always their own way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is always a lack of what they themselves possess , which is always intelligence . Now , as forme , I have a congenital distrust of anybody who starts out by telling me just what good art is . He assumes that a matter of personal opinion and of shifting whim is a firm foundation for a final judgment . His major premise is false , and he is either unaware of the fact or assumes that I am ; hence 1 discount his further procedure as nothing more than a confession of his own limitations and prejudices . So Doctor Johnson or somebody said to a man who criticized a certain statue : " That . is not . a criticism of the statue but a bit of autobiography . " Being only human and highly emotional , I have my own violent convictions and likes and dislikes , but I am incessantly learning how untrue , unwise and unimportant they are . Since I despise my own most ardent persuasions , I naturally despise those of other people even more and I find it hard to stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics who flounce around the poultry yard , clucking about how great and wise and artistic they are and how contemptible all the other pigeons are . Hollywood has been for years the meek victim of a horde of such critics , every one of whom discredits himself in advance by his cocksureness as to just what , is high art , pure morals and true intelligence . All the while , with all her faults , Hollywood has been turning out a vast amount of stuff and leading a vastly busy life on a plane probably quite as high as that of her critics . And that is not saying much . I am reminded of one writer who seemed to sum up this whole tribe of critics . He had been so highly praised for a talent of very limited range and small output that he had managed to impress one of the most easily impressionable people in the world  --  a Hollywood producer  --  sufficiently to secure a contract , including transportation and expenses , for a protracted period . For his literary services he received a wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East or would ever earn again anywhere . He dawdled about Hollywood for months and , according to those who dealt with him , made only the most idiotic suggestions and turned in quite impossible material . In any case , none of it was ever used in the picture with which he was chiefly concerned . In spite of these omissions , the picture was well received by press and public . ? When the Wife is Only a Distant Relative P ERHAPS his writing was too good for his em- ployers to appreciate ; at any rate , it was not used . Yet he returned East and published bland statements accepting large credit for the picture 's success , while deploring the woefully low state of Hollywood in general . In New York , before I went Hollywood , I had known this man and the woman he married . When he came out on his money hunt he came alone . I stumbled on him first at a gathering where he was paying rather heavy attention to a pop-eyed cutie . I should never have noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not felt a strange impulse to confess  --  or boast  --  that he was living in sin with the little lady , But what sickened me was the fellow 's excuse for his dereliction . " Old man , " he panted , " you know how I love my wife . You know how wonderful she is and how I adore her . I meant to be true to her . God knows I did . My soul is still true to her , but  --  well , there 's something in this Southern California air  --  this moonlight  --  the tropical breezes and the palm trees  --  it just swept me off my feet . It hypnotized me . I 'm helpless . I ca n't account for it . But God knows I love my wife . " It is a terrible thing when a person goes literary all over you . It is perhaps excusable for a writer to go literary over the laity , but over a fellow writer I might have wondered why this lad allowed such an inferior siren to blind him to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : The force of attraction varies inversely with the square of the distance . This man 's wife was three thousand miles away ; and three thousand squared is nine million . The nauseating thing was his trying to lay the blame for his own incandescence on Californian nights , which , as a matter of record , are almost always cold . The writer 's transfer of his own weakness to the climate was typical of no end of literary works , such as those novels which Englishmen write describing how Englishmen go wrong in Paris or along the Riviera or in moonlit Italian gardens . They always fill me with a desire to scream : " Has the moon no influence in England at all ? Did no one ever go wrong in an English garden ? Is infidelity to fianc6es a Sicilian , a Parisian or Venetian invention ? A foreign monopoly ? Are Englishmen safe from temptation as long as they stay in England ? Southern moon , my eye ! What . about Eskimo morals ? " ( Conefnued on Page 66 ) ( Ceneiriuod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Treasury . Then it has some bonds to redeem . How does it redeem them ? By ' nailing out Government checks . On receiving a United States Treasury check , you take it to a bank . You may deposit it there or you may take it in money . Suppose you want it in money . The bank counts it out to you in paper hills . You say , " But that Government bond was payable in gold . " The bank says  --  or it did say ? " All right . Here is the gold in place of the paper money . How will you carry it ? " But you did not want to carry it . You only wanted to know you could get it , for if you could get it you knew your paper money to be the equivalent of gold , dollar for dollar . During the same ten years in which the Government redeemed S9,000,000. - 000 of bonds without the actual use of gold , private obligations to an aggregate very much greater , such as railroad bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were redeemed in the same way , not with gold but out of income measured in gold-standard money , the same money serving as measure again and again . All anybody wanted to know was that paper money was equivalent to gold . It is not until people begin to distrust the equivalent value of paper money Of course , people have been going wrong in gardens since Eden , and men have been whining since Adam : " The woman tempted me . " But the whining has not yet become , pretty , and it is not pretty when Eastern literary men say , " Hollywood tempted me , " blaming Hollywood for their own love of money , fair women , what not . I hold no brief for Hollywood as a home of idyllic innocence . Most of the people who come to Hollywood have lost their innocence long before they get there . And innocence is a quality hard to restore . Hollywood does not pretend to be a solitude for anchorites or a retreat for repentant celibates . Yet it is silly to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is downright nonsense in this impudence of its critics . They all come from communities where , according to their own preachers and police , vice is rampant . Yet they take a look zit Hollywood and run home with idiotic clamor about its superlative immorality . Hence those who do not get out there are stimulated to believe that it is the haunt . of strange vices , that the days are given over to the murder of high art , and the nights to orgies of extravagant and occult evil . When I am away from Hollywood I am always tieing implored to expose some of the mystic secrets of sin out there . When I flunk miserably , I um accused of hiding something precious or unspeakable . The novels and other works of fiction devoted to Hollywood are frantically fantastic . Not long ago a book was written that , under thin veils , related much ugly gossip . Gossip is hardly scientific proof , but there is , of course , much inebriety and depravity in Hollywood . It is made up of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the manuscript before it was published , and I said : " All this is very exciting , but in my little home town in the Midwest there that they want the gold itself and are willing to carry- it into hoarding . The hoarding episode was in two phases . First it was simply a hoarding of money , in distrust of the banks . Probably not one person in ten thousand knew the difference between a gold certificate and a national-bank note , a greenback , a Federal Reserve note or a silver certificate . All kinds of money were equal . After three years of frightful depression and disillusionment , people believed implicitly in only two things  --  Government bonds and money . The hoarding of money , although it was a calamity for the banks , was nevertheless a significant fact . Never was there any doubt about the integrity of money . That was something to build on . Instead of being built upon , it was destroyed . The second phase opened when this faith in money began to weaken . Then people began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money and to select out the gold certificates ; they began also to demand the gold itself , wishing to hoard it . But the gold certificate was even better than gold for purposes of hoarding .

" They nodded : " Oh , of course ; and in our home town there were just as horrible things as any we 've found in Hollywood . " I foolishly commented : " Then why are n't you honest enough to say so ? Why do you present this book as an indictment of Hollywood 's unique attainments in wickedness ? Why do n't you say instead : ' In spite of all her golden opportunities to be good and pure and consecrated to art , Hollywood is really no better than this average American town ' ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young authors were not foolish enough to take my advice . Their book was hailed by Eastern critics as a faithful portrait of a pest hole and had a large sale . There was a whole series of articles written by a man who could not have drawn many sober breaths while he was there . . I saw him drifting across a busy stage in such a state that he had to be steered to a seat , where he fell asleep awhile , then wandered away , lugging a bottle of whisky with him . But when he reached New York there was nothing convivial in his grim denunciations of Hollywood drunkenness . Dozens of such birds fly across that Southern California scene , publishing their own hazy impressions and leaving unpublished memories among their slandered hosts . The market for Hollywood scandal is insatiable , and the visiting writers are canny enough to supply it at the cost of no little priggishness and hypocrisy . And they abuse it in the name of high art and high morals ! I was considerably agitated recently over an article by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the big money there . The wife described her anxiety when the call came , her alarm over leaving what was  --  by implication , at least  --  the idyllic purity and sweetness of New York literary life . in Hollywood she found what , she distinctly implied , could never be encountered in New York  --  people who flirted , who drank , who were unfaithful . She found broken homes there  --  men and women who not only forgot high art for money but who forgot their marital vows , forgot that there was a prohibition law , forgot even the delicacies of etiquette . When her distinguished husband was entertained at a gorgeous dinner , he was seated at the hostess ' right : but his wife , instead of being placed at the host 's right , was stuffed into a corner with the poor relations and the more rubbishy guests . This might have happened there or anywhere , for there are all sorts of hostesses ; but it was peculiarly uncharacteristic of Hollywood . It was more of an insult to the guest than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been heaped on New York hosts and hostesses by foreign visitors ? In my own experience , Hollywood takes especial care to be charming to the wives and daughters of visiting notables . Some of the wives and daughters have left very quaint memories of their own bad manners . Hollywood receives great numbers of titled foreigners , and some of them have been as boorish as others have been charming . Some of the titles , of course , have been false too ; even New York is not without its mistakes in receiving HomanotTs . But to return to this particular New York wife . Just in time , she got her husband out of the pagan jungle of I lullywood and returned with him to the serene and lofty purity of New York 's Bohemia . The Pot Calls the Kettle Black Of course she did not definitely assert that New York is a haven of Arcadian simplicity and safety , but this was tacitly assumed . It . was the necessary basis of the whole story , for where would be the excitement about taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article always leaves me gasping , for I was brought up to believe that New York was a great plague spot of vice where now-rich people went to show off , where snobbery and social climbing abounded , where pretty girls sold their souls for food or diamonds . or both , where the theater was the vestibule to hell , and literary life was a sordid and vulgar trade . Foreign visitors and certain groups of local critics were always bewailing the vile quality of New York 's output in all the arts , and the moralists were unanimous in denouncing its infamies . My own experience of New York was , and is , that it has all the qualities that must be expected of so many million people , but that , in general , it is a beautiful , generous , gracious community and a glorious place to live , And so , when I read these wholesale indictments of Hollywood , I can not but remember how beautiful a land-scape it tills , how kind and eager and sincere , generous and gracious and ear-nest are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them at their work and their recreations . I know their vices and their virtues . They have their good days and their bad . They have their black sheep and their white . They love their homes , their children , their families , but not all of them are in-fallible . They want to be wise and ar-tistic and successful , but do not always know how . The wildest of them have their gentle qual-ities , their fine hours . The greediest.of them can he generous . But , all in all . they are as good , as intelligent , as creative as any other commu-nity in the world . The Arts In the great metropolis of which Hollywood is a part there are two very large universities and several large colleges , the Huntington Library and Art Museum , the California Institute of Technology , with Millikan and Einstein on the faculty , museums of world-wide fame whose paleontological collections are famous , a magnificent amphitheater where the best music is played to the largest audiences in the world , astronomical observatories of international importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A school of autoehthonous architecture has been developed there . The motion-picture people themselves have developed and are developing , with all its scientific and mechanical implications , the newestand most influential of all the arts  --  or , if you prefer , industries ; for " industry " is quite as honorable a word as " art . " Who would ever guess any of this from the reports of the visiting satirists ? Can it be that they have never taken the trouble to look into these other phases of the scene ? Can it be these visiting authors were not truly interested in those higher things whose heck they so bewail in Hollywood ? We are used to the tourists who return from Paris with nothing but stories of cheap dances and a few dirty post cards . We are used to the reports of New York brought back by visiting buyers who were " shown the town , " but only the chorus-girl and night-club phases of it . We discount those travelers ' tales .

Many of these authors are lured there by producers who have heard of their fame and hope to profit by their genius . Not all of them are hard drinkers by any means . Not all of them are self-satisfied . Many of them have qualities that Hollywood could profit by . Most of them are kept waiting a ridiculously long time , but this is not untrue of seekers after employment in New York or elsewhere . Cooling heels in anterooms is one of the most ancient of the experiences of genius . Many authors have been badly treated in Hollywood , but Hollywood has paid high for this idiocy . One of the gentlest of geniuses and one of the most valuable for Hollywood  --  P. 0 . Wadehouse  --  quietly regretted that he had been paid a hundred thousand dollars for doing next to nothing . This remark was taken up , and it stirred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wodehouse has written nu ferocious assaults on those who slighted him . f am not attacking all the visiting writers or defending all the producers . God forbid ! But it is roughly true that the fiercest critics have brought least to Hollywood and left the poorest im-pressions , In the development of its gigantic merchandise , Hollywood employs fiction and drama as raw material  --  and sonic of it is pretty raw . To prepare this material for recording by the camera and the microphone . amity changes EVENING POST in printed or theatrical texts are absolutely inevitable . What these changes shall be is a matter for diversity of opinion . And there is no lack of that diversity . I suppose that few authors have denounced more violently than I the changes made in rendering texts usable . But I have not howled in public or rushed into print with denunciations of people whose money I have accepted . This seems to me the least charming of the faults of the critics of Hollywood . They sell the children of their brains into movie slavery for large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Simon Legrees treat their purchased chattels as chattels . There is something not quite cricket about this . An author should either refuse to sell or , having sold , suffer in silence . The moving-picture people have a curious habit of paying enormous sums for books and plays , only to throw away most of what they have bought . But , after all , that is their business  --  and their funeral . And perhaps the folly of the purchase would have been more costly still if they had not discarded what they bought . Who can tell ? There was national clamor over Hollywood 's treatment of one very eminent American author whose novel was hailed as a great masterpiece . It was put on the stage , and then bought by a motion-picture company for something more than one hundred thousand dollars , which was a pretty neat bit of money for a very sympathetic study of a young murderer . This novel was the author 's very own . It had a very large sale as a book and very high praise . The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motion-picture people might do to his plot , any more than it could he disturbed by the fierce criticisms and parodies of such literary people as did not like it in its novel form . The author , as a fond parent , was naturally eager to see his hundredthousand-dollar child well treated by March a , r934 the movies . But he must have realized that any cinematic version absolutelY must begin by a murderous condensetion and lopping off of his numberless pages . No audience would sit through more than nine or ten reels of anything . If this novel had been put on the screen as written , it would have required from three hundred and fifty to four hundred reels and the expense would have run into millions . The author could hardly have expected to see more than a fortieth part of his story on the screen . George Bernard Shaw is the only author I know of who has refused money for the motion-picture rights to his works . He is said to have refused a million dollars . But I have seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason he refused the money was that , because of double income taxes from two nations and because of the high brackets where his income hovers , his taxes would amount to more than the million he would receive . This was doubtless a typical bit of Shavian exaggeration , but the remnant for him would have been , doubtless , small . I really believe that Shaw would make no outcry against moving-picture changes in his text , for he has most cheerfully accepted enormous royalties from The Chocolate Soldier , a comic opera based on his play , Arms and the Man . And what motion-picture adapters do to a play is not a circumstance to what comic-opera librettists do to it . There was , as with all of Shaw 's jokes , a big element of truth in his famous remark to Sam Goldwyn , who was once dickering with him for motion-picture rights : " The difference between us , Mr. Goldwyn , is that you are interested in art , while I am interested only in motley . " I know Sam Goldwyn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes to be art and that he has always been willing to squander fortunes on it . There is , of course , ( Continued on Pape 60 ) S ( Continued front Pare 58 ) difference of opinion as to just how artistic his work is . But , in the name of heaven , about whose art work is there no difference of opinion ? Are all literary critics agreed upon all literary works of art and art standards ? Are all art critics agreed ? All musical Critics ? I was reading the other day what Hanslick , one of the most eminent of music critics , said of Tschaikovsky 's Violin Concerto , now accepted as one of the purest masterpieces in that form . Hanslick said , " Friedrich Fischer , describing lascivious paintings , once said there were pictures ' one could see stink . ' Tschaikovsky 's Violin Concerto brings us face to face with the revolting idea : May there not be musical compositions which we can hear stink ? " Even the most ardent critics of the worst moving pictures have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclopa-dia with the devastating abuse heaped on masterpieces . Two eminent authors I have discussed have said dreadful things about the pictures based on their novels , but wo must remember that dreadful things have also been said about their novels . In fact , both of them have been legally banned in some communities . I do not agree with such verdicts . They appall me . But neither do I approve the self-satisfaction of a writer who proclaims that his work is so perfect that any change in it must be ruinous and sacrilegious . Above all , I can not applaud the behavior of an author who sells the rights to his novel and , while clinging to the money , denounces as wrongs any employment of those rights . I am not defending any or all the alterations made in material purchased-by motion-picture producers . Many of the alterations seem to me supremely silly and even vicious , But I say " seem to me . " The purchasers themselves often bewail the alterations . They are themselves the victims of a system that has grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movies The ideal thing would he to have a novel or a play bought by somebody who ardently loved it , directed by a director who shares the author 's feelings in every respect , and enacted by a east that corresponds exactly with the characters as drawn . But even then , you would have to begin by excising about nine-tenths of the action and dialogue , and all the author 's comment and description . Next you would have to find a distributor as ardently in love with the story as the author , and a long , long chain of exhibitors with theaters and an equal enthusiasm for the idea . After that , you would have to persuade millions on millions of people to go to see it . Otherwise the experiment would fail . And , above all , there would be no hundred thousand dollars in advance for the author , That Hollywood should never be subjected to criticism nor deserve it is unthinkable . Hollywood is her own severest critic . But the true evils , the abundant evils , are more easily recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression . What caused them ? Who is to blame for them ? Who is to cure them ? And how ? The fault I rind with my fellow writers who pour such unmerciful abuse upon the town that has been so generous  --  so foolishly generous  --  with so many of them , is that they are not fair . They live in glass houses and throw stones . They ask impossible things . de- /1ounce blameless people , revile the vic- tims of a system they did not originate and can not control . The accusations of base commercialism and greed come ill from authors who have themselves been guilty of both . Let them either withhold their hands from the dotted line of sale or withhold their squawks when they are dissatisfied with the slave drivers to whom they sold their children . Most unjust of all criticisms of Hollywood , it seems to me , are the allegations that it is a place of great immorality . I sincerely believe that the morals of the motion-picture people are probably as good as those of other communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure , and whose conduct is innocent . The amount of drunkenness , devilment and divorce is no greater than the average about this lively nation . Dance halls , night clubs and places of evil resort are probably a little fewer there than in most cities . Studio children are eared for , educated and cherished with extraordinary devotion . As readers of books and lovers of art , the studio people rank high . They work very hard at times and must often risk their lives in the hardships of their careers . They have periods of idleness which Satan sometimes uses , but which are also as well employed as elsewhere . What the Dear Public Wants It is all too easy to slander them , because the publicity of their lives gives immense publicity to the most . trivial of their faults , their pettiest domestic tangles . But the attacks on them are so innumerable and unmerciful that scarcely anything else is published , except in the fan magazines . Yet a hundred million Americans , hundreds of millions of people about the world , know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity as to their idiosyncrasies , and devour an incredible amount of their wares . The public expects movie people to be a little wild , and would hate to think that they are not . They are . Perhaps a billion people are interested in Hollywood , are customers of Hollywood work . Yet one who reads the travelers ' tales about it might well believe it to be but a sink of iniquity , bad morals , worse art. , vile ostentation , crude Philistinism , unmitigated commercialism  --  a place from which no good thing could come , since no good people live there . But it is really not quite so bad as all that . It is really no worse than any place else . And it pours forth a Niagara of entertainment for a sad and boresome world . It is high time that someone put in a good word for a community which , in spite of its human errors , provides the globe with an absolutely incalculable amount of comfort , emotional stimulus , education in conduct , etiquette , costume , science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drama , diversion . The motion pictures are accused of encouraging crime and corrupting the young , but all the crimes they are said to foster flourished long before there were movies and flourish worse whore there are none . Take the motion picture from the world and imagine the ghastly void it would leave . An institution of such variety and such vastness is , of course , open to criticism , and needs criticism . But the critics should preserve perspective , and Come into court with clean hands . The satires of the satirists need satirizing.
