" Soldiers , officers , they who call me a military dictator slander me ! <P> " Soldiers , officers , I am your comrade ! " <P> Thus last week spoke shrill , wasp-waisted little President Chiang Kai-shek to troops at his capital , Nanking . Shrilly he continued : <P> " I leave now to direct the anti-bandit campaign ! If I succeed I will retire to my birthplace near Ningpo-thereby proving to the world and to the nation that I have no ambition to establish a dictatorship nor another dynasty , as charged by my reactionary enemies . If I fail , I will die fighting ! " <P> By his " reactionary enemies " ( whom he hopes to clean up next after the bandits ) President Chiang meant the new self-styled Chinese Government at Canton ( TIME , June 8 ) . Its most august member is wizened Tang Shao-yi , in 1912 First Premier of the Chinese Republic . <P> When charges were made in the last U. S. Presidential campaign against " Hoover 's Chinese record " venerable Tang refuted these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an honorable man . Last week the President presumably saw in the New York Herald Tribune ( No. 1 Republican newsorgan ) a message addressed to himself by Tang Shao-yi , commencing , " My dear friend . . . . <P> " Behind Nanking 's rococo faade , which some foreigners have helped to erect , there is working a political system , or rather a family corporation whose idea of running the country is the management and exploitation of China as the property of Chiang Kai-shek and his so-called family . " <P> Modestly , Venerable Tang called his message a mere " explanation " of why he joined the Canton Government . It implied , delicately , a plea for U. S. recognition .
