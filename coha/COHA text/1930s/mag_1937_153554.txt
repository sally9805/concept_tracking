At a vast luncheon of alumni who attended Yale 's graduation exercises in New Haven last week , a father and son flushed with particular emotion when President Angell rose , characteristically tugged his ear and announced the creation of a Jane <P> Coffin Childs Memorial Fund to be " devoted primarily to medical research into the causes and origins of cancer . . . . It is the greatest gift yet made to Yale by friends who prefer anonymity . . . . It represents the greatest opportunity of its kind ever given any university . " <P> Starling Winston Childs , Manhattan utilitarian whose wife , Jane Coffin Childs . died last October , soon left the alumni gathering . Son Starling W. Jr. , who remained , eventually explained : " My mother died of cancer and my father has never forgotten it . He has always wanted to do something about it . He has established the fund together with another person , who prefers to remain anonymous , as his contribution to the fight against the disease . The fund is created primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cure . " <P> Advisers of the Childs Fund are to be : Yale 's Medicine Dean Stanhope Bayne-Jones , a bacteriologist and Rockefeller Foundation protege ; his predecessor as dean , Pathologist Milton Charles Winternitz , who at the American Medical convention announced new discoveries about the hardening of arteries ; Rudolph John Anderson , biochemist ; Dr. Ross Granville Harrison , biologist who began the artificial cultivation of living tissues , for which the Rockefeller Institute 's Alexis Carrel is more famed ; Rockefeller Institute 's Francis Peyton Rous. whose discovery of a type of cancer ( Rous 's sarcoma ) which can be transplanted from one chicken to another gave students of cancer a powerful new instrument of research . <P> The Childs donation to Yale , whose disbursement these scientists will manage , was $10,000,000 , precisely the amount which the world 's No. 1 cancer authority , Manhattan 's Dr. James Ewing , says is necessary to establish an effective cancer study institute . <P> For a decade Dr. Ewing has declared that with six $10,000,000 institutes , scientists could soon control cancer . Nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was $2,000,000 which Steelmaker William Henry Donner of Philadelphia , transient father-in-law of Elliott Roosevelt , gave for an International Cancer Research Foundation ( TIME , June 20 , 1932 ) . Before that the biggest cancer war chest was the $1,400,000 of the George Crocker Institute for Cancer Research , which Dr. Francis Carter Wood manages at Columbia University . <P> Dr. Ewing 's own institution , Manhattan 's Memorial Hospital , had only $1,000,000 . Last spring John D. Rockefeller Jr . increased that with land and $3,000,000 for a new building close to Cornell Medical School , where Dr. Ewing &; staff teach , and close to the Rockefeller Institute and its cancer investigators , notably Drs . Peyton Rous and James Bumgardner Murphy .
