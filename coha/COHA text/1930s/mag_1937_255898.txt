" This State is no larger than a good-sized eighteen-hole golf course . . . . It is the most heavily telephoned State in the world . ... It can provide a telephone for every inhabitant . . . . Although the Pontiff has his own telephone and although it is listed in the telephone directory of Vatican City as number 101 , no one can call him . The apparatus is so constructed that when the number is dialed , the Pope 's telephone does not ring . . . . The Pope has surrendered to the use of the fountain pen for signing all his documents , although he unfailingly dips the pen into the inkwell before applying it to the paper . . . . No one ever thinks of filling the pen but the inkwell is always filled . . . . In the Papal State the projection of films is prohibited . The Pope never sees even the most innocuous news reel . . . . Although there is no crime in Vatican City there is a jail . . . . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . No better conditions exist for workers than those prevailing in the service of the Pope . . . . They have enough to spend on simple amusements . They are secure and happy in the highest sense of social reform . . . . There can never be a breath of scandal . Family and social probity are an obligatory minimum . . . . The Pope is air-minded , permits the cardinals to fly , and has even projected a fleet of helicopters . " <P> Typical are the above quotes from A Reporter At The Papal Court by Thomas B. Morgan ( Longmans , Green , $3 ) published last week . As might be guessed , fact is that no other correspondent has ever combined such a keen American nose for newsy Papal intimacies with such a respectful Roman nose for bowing reverence to the Holy Apostolic Roman Catholic Church . It is a credit to the intelligence of the Holy See that Mr. Morgan was granted in 1929 what was then the first and is still the only exclusive interview ever given to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedict XV died , Correspondent Morgan had entered the death chamber by permission and kissed the slippered foot of the late Pontiff even before the fact of Death , ascertained by physicians , was officially certified by Cardinal Gasparri and made known with the words " Vere papa mortuus est . " With his inquisitive yet reverent eyes . Observer Morgan noted that the Cardinal did not observe the quaint Papal ceremony for determining Death once used but since fallen into disuse : " The ceremony consisted in tapping the Pope on the forehead with a small silver hammer and calling him by his first name three times . " <P> The private life of a Swiss Guard , the yearning to communicate with other planets of the Pope 's chief radio technician , and the number of bars in the Papal State ( four ) are all as familiar to Correspondent Morgan as the first names by which he called servants of the Holy Father during 18 years in Rome representing Associated Press , then United Press ( TIME , Nov. n , 1935 ) . He tells why voyaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , invariably salute His Holiness with " nine ' NAVYS ' and three ' HOLY FATHER 'S . ' " <P> After the first such youthful cheer some years ago Pius XI was all smiles and calmly turned to the cheerleader . ' ' Do it again . That is worth an encore , " he commanded .
