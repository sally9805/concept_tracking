The Right Hon. Richard Bedford Bennett is a solemn , pious and abstemious citizen . But like New York 's James John Walker he has friends always anxious to do him favors . Premier Bennett waits for no summons . Last week , anxious to throttle a " whispering campaign , " he hurried before the Canadian Parliament 's Committee on National Railways to explain about the rent he is paying for his suite in the Chteau Laurier . <P> In the U. S. it is generally accepted that great hostelries harbor public characters for something less than the usual rate be cause of their advertising value . Under such an arrangement Calvin Coolidge lived at the New Willard in Washington when Vice President ; under such arrangement , Vice President Curtis lives at the Mayflower . <P> Canadians are sensitive . They wanted to know last week why Premier Bennett was paying only $400 a month for an apartment in a hotel belonging to Canadian National Railways ( owned in turn by the Canadian Government ) when it had just been testified that the 17 rooms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $110,743.94 . <P> Alterations were made at the insistence of Premier Bennett 's good friend Sir Henry Thornton , president of C. N. R. When he discovered how much money the redecorating would cost Mr. Bennett ordered the work stopped , but Sir Henry went ahead anyway . Asked Liberal M. P. Ross Gray : <P> " The rent comes to something over $13 a day for 17 rooms . ... Do you consider it a fair price ? " " I pay what I am asked to pay , " boomed Premier Bennett . " Does a guest usually pay more than he is asked to pay ? . . . Do you desire to know what I pay for my boots and the bills I pay my tailor ? " <P> Mr. Gray : I suppose you pay retail prices for your boots ? <P> Premier Bennett : I pay what I am asked to pay . <P> Sir Henry Thornton came forward to take full responsibility for the $110,000 suite , but there was the additional matter of the Premier 's private railway car . Mr. Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , once used by Canada 's Governor Generals . Ever thoughtful Sir Henry built a brand new private car of his own , offered to swap it for Old York . The swap was made . Explained Sir Henry : <P> " The officials of the company never felt quite comfortable while the old car was being used . "
