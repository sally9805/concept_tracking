txt The Board of Estimate , which on Dec. 6 approved the sale of the Sixth Avenue elevated structure for $80,000 to George T. Weissbaum , West Coast scrap metal dealer , will hold a special session at 10:30 A. M. today to act upon Mr. Weissbaum 's failure to pay the purchase price and post a performance bond of $45,000 by midnight last Saturday . The board , it was disclosed yesterday , has its choice of several courses of action . It may . declare Mr. Weissbaum in default , order cancellation of the sale contract and declare forfeit the $5,000 down payment made on the purchase price at the auction sale Dec. 5 . Or it may grant an extension of time for paying the rest of the purchase price and posting the performance bond . The board may have to consider this alternative should Mr. Weissbaum or his representatives tender the cash and the bond at or before the special meeting this morning . Payment " Arrangement " Questioned - Mr. Weissbaum , in a statement issued early yesterday morning , declared that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present the bond at Controller 's office at 10:30 A. M. today . But a spokesman for the Controller declared yesterday that the " arrangement " was entirely unilateral . Mr. Weissbaum , he said , had indicated Saturday to Seymour Graubard , law clerk of the Department of Finance , that he would not be able to meet the midnight deadline . Mr. Weissbaum asked for an extension of time until this morning , it was said , and was told that he could not have it . He was reminded that the official deadline was Saturday midnight and that a representative of the Controller would be on hand until then to accept a tender . Soon after midnight J. W. Haslett Jr. , secretary to the Controller , announced that the deadline had been passed without word from Mr. Weissbaum . Yesterday Mr. Haslett said that Mr. Weissbaum , should he have the cash and the bond ready today , would have to tender them directly to the Board of Estimate . In official circles it was said the Controller probably had no authority to grant an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given Mr. Weissbaura the benefit of every legal technicality under the terms of the original contract of sale . $5,000 Deposit Paid Heretofore announcements by city officials have said that Mr. Weissbaum would be required to pay $80,000 in cash and post a performance bond for $40,000 . Examination of the original sale contract discloses that a performance bond of $45,000 was required and that Mr. Weissbaum , having paid a deposit of $5,000 on the bid price , had to pay a balance of $75,000 . In its haste to speed demolition of the elevated structure , the Board of Estimate 's approval of the sale to Mr. Weissbaum was voted le than twenty-four hours after bid was accepted by Controller Goidrick . The vote was take with Borough President James Lyons the only dissenter , despi the fact that only a partial rep on the successful bidder 's fina cial and credit standing was th available . It also was taken wi knowledge that Supreme Court Ji tice Philip J. McCook was to he that same morning a taxpayet argument for a temporary inju tion against removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pected daily . It is awaited by et officials with keen interest in vi of pending proceedings in the Fe eral courts where Judge Robert Patterson is to hear argument this morning on an application filed by Thomas E. Murray Jr. , receiver for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company , asking that he be directed to surrender immediately to the receiver for the Manhattan Railway Company all elevated lines now operated as part of the Interborough system . Vacating of Stay Asked When Judge Patterson granted Mr. Murray authority last July to disaffirm the Interborough 's lease of its elevated lines he also stayed the exercise of that authority pending the outcome of appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals from his disaffirman.ce ruling . Argument on the appeals will be heard Jan. 17 .. The application now before Judge Patterson is in effect a request to vacate the stay imposed in July . In asking for authority to get rid of the elevated lines at once the Interborough receiver cited the city 's condemnation of the Sixth Avenue structure and its avowed intention to tear it down at the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only one of its elevated routes which paid more than it cost to operate , and its demolition would make the elevated lease more burdensome than ever . The injunction sought by the taxpayer in the litigation before Justice McCook declares that the city by tearing down the elevated structure will destroy its claimed right to a single five-cent fare ride for passengers on a combined subway and elevated system under Interborough operation . The same paint is made in the application filed by Mr. Murray . The city 's representatives and those of the Transit Commission will appear before Judge Patterson today to oppose the Murray application and to contend that nothing has happened in the receivership situation , or that of the elevated lines as a whole , to warrant vacation of the stay . The city also will ask for a lien on the $3,500,000 which it paid Dec. 5 to the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company as trustee of the Manhattan Railway 4 per cent first-mortgage bonds The payment was made in conformance with an agreement between the city and a protective committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of any Sixth Avenue condemnation award for $12,500,000 . Current Tax Claim $700,000 Mr. paid over the $3,500,000 in cash and the cancellation of the city 's transfer of tax lien against all Manhattan Railway property accounted for the balance of the $12,500,000 . The city now contends that the Manhattan 's fiscal condition is such as to require that the court grant the municipality a lien on the $3,500,000 to protect a claim of $700,000 for current taxes . If and when the actual demolition of the elevated structure begins ? and it now appears certain that it will be after Jan. 1  --  the general su- pervision and engineering of the job will be in the hands of the B ) ard of Transportation . That body as been asked by Lee Thompson : rah , director of the real estate ureau of the Board of Estimate , to undertake such supervision because of the necessity of properly safeguarding the completed and ending construction work on the sixth Avenue subway line , which Lns directly under the elevated structure . The request by Mr. Smith came alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stimate and the office of Borough zli " esident Stanley M. Isaacs of Manhattan conferred with Chief agineer Jesse B. Snow and Divisipn Engineer Byron Houghtaling the Board of Transportation . If e Board of Estimate cancels the 4ity 's contract with Mr. Weissbaum it probably will direct Mr. Isaacs to e move the elevated structure and lie will let the necessary contract c private interests .
