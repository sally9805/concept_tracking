In pocket billiards ( vulgarly called " pool " ) , pale , dark-haired Ralph Greenleaf ranks about tops , has been champion most of the time for 15 years . Last week in Philadelphia Billiardist Greenleaf and lantern-jawed Billiardist Irving Crane each had eight victories and three defeats after a three weeks ' tournament among twelve top-ranking players . In the eleventh inning of the playoff , Crane , having scratched five times , found himself with a total of minus one to Greenleaf 's 49 . Then Billiardist Greenleaf strode to the table and started sinking balls so fast that one had scarcely thudded into a pocket before another followed it . Blandly running 76 , Billiardist Greenleaf packed up his cues , moved off with the match , $1,500 , and his 16th world championship . <P> Holder of the 18.1 balk line* championship almost continuously since 1906 has been stumpy , grey-haired Willie Hoppe . Last week in a curtained enclosure in Manhattan 's noisy Capitol Bowling and Billiard Academy , Champion Hoppe defended his title against the challenge of Jake Schaefer , sharp-nosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Champion Schaefer unfortunately turned up tremendously off form . On the third day , Champion Hoppe clicked off a run of 169 , two nights later two runs of 85 and 94 . The best Champion Schaefer could run was 137 . Champion Hoppe retained his championship , 3,000 to 2,567 , despite a last day rally in which Champion Schaefer returned to brilliant form . <P> Champion Hoppe 's facility with a cue is the sign of a youth spent in such diligent attention to billiards that he amazed experts before he was out of knickerbockers . He has held every title in billiards , although now he holds only the 18.1 balk line and the cushion carom . A quiet , smiling little man , he enjoys telling of the time at the turn of the century when Mark Twain watched him play a great billiardist named Sutton . Except for one inning in which he could not score , young Billiardist Hoppe sat tranquilly aside watching Sutton run out the block . As Sutton clicked off the final point , Mark Twain solemnly stepped over and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulate you , William , " said he , ' ' on your remarkable tenure of that chair in the corner . " <P> *In 18.1 balk line , a player is allowed one shot to nudge the object ball out of anchor , eight cushion rectangles chalked off on the table , or out of balk , the centre rectangle . In 18.2 , two consecutive shots are allowed .
