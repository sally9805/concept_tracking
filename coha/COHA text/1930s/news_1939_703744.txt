txt In an effort to increase efficiency and economy of operation , leading railroad executives are currently conferring with steel companies on adoption of a standard 45 toot rail in place of the present 39 foot section . The longer type rail has been in use in Europe for some time where it has resulted in a substantial reduction in carrier maintenance costs . While discussions are still in the exploratory stage , It was learned yesterday that a number of the larger railroads have expressed willingness to pay a premium of $1.00 a ton for the 45 foot sections . This would compensate the leading steelmakers for an estimated $5,000 , - 000 to $6,000,000 aggregate cost of installing new machinery to produce the new type rail The prevailing price for the 39-foot standard is $40 a ton . Further Discussions Planned Further negotiations between the steel companies and carrier executives are scheduled in the near future , the rail makers desiring assurance that all roads trill desire the new length At the same time , the steel companies wish to he certain that the carriers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future It is pointed out that in England the standard length is 78 feet . while in Germany a 100 foot rail has been used successfully . So insistent are the rail makers that the proposed change in length of rail be definite and approved by all railroads that a special meeting of the hoard of directors of the Association of American Railroads possibly may be called to crystallize the opinions of the carriers Individual railroads and the Association of American Railroads have had the subject of the 45-foot rail under consideration for many months , with general agreement that the longer rail would make for lower maintenance costs Particularly since the advent of Ligh speed passenger and freight trains , operating officials have leaned toward increasing the length of the rail . With longer sections , fewer joints naturally will be reuired . In addition , there wdl be smaller welding costs . Steel Makers Proceeding Carefully Despite the willingness of some of the largex : railroad systems to pay $1 a ton more for the 45-foot sections . leading makers of steel rail are approaching the situation with deliberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reimburse steel producers for new plant expenditures. it is not considered likely that their plans for changing mill equipment will pass beyond the discussion stage until conferences are held with representatives of all of the railroads of the country While the advisability of adopting a longer rail length as a standard has been under consideration for some time , the necessity recently of cutting expenses wherever possible has spurred rail management into going ahead with plans for the 43-foot sections It is pointed out that it will cost no mme in labor charges to install 45-foot tail than a 39-foot rail Because of the pending conferences , it is understood that orders for a considerable tonnage of new steel rails are being held up pending a determination of the proposed change in the standard length L. F. Loree , former president of Delaware &; Hudson Railroad . conducted experiments with long rails by welding shorter lengths into an integral unit .

Sonic engineers declare that approximately 50 ; ' : of rail maintenance costs aie at the rail joints . The longest single rail on the Delaware &; Hudson is approximately 7,000 feet . Because of Its cost , however , the company has discontinued the welding process .
