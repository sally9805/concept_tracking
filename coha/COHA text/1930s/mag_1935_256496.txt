For the last few years the only publicly-owned stock in United Electric Light &; Power Co. , a Consolidated Gas subsidiary , has been owned by the wife of Thomas E. Murray Jr. , currently receiver for Manhattan 's Interborough Rapid Transit Co . All the rest of the stock was owned indirectly by Consolidated Gas . But merger of United Electric with other Consolidated power properties operating on the island of Manhattan was blocked by Mrs. Murray . Not that Mrs. Murray refused to sell her stock : she obligingly offered it to Consolidated last winter-at $4,500 per share . <P> No one better knew the value of those 30 shares than Consolidated . But the idea of paying $135,000 for a minority interest whose book value was only $1.800 was too much even for the great New York City utility . Last week , however , either Mrs. Murray relented or Consolidated reconsidered : the utility announced that at long last it had acquired the famed holdout shares . Price : unrevealed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt; - ? -           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
