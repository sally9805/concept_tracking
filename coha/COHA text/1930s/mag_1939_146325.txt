Royal Visit <P> Sirs : <P> Congratulations upon a difficult job performed with a modicum of success . You have managed to introduce a cheap and flippant note even in your account of persons most sacred to Canadians : your story of the Royal Visit to Canada . . . . <P> Your talk of bullet-proof glass , for instance , is just plain tommyrot . Even though British law has made the gangster 's profession a precarious one in this country , still we do know the difference between bulletproof glass and unshatterable or safety glass , with which latter the Royal car and many others in Canada are equipped . Your insistence upon this entirely fictitious bullet-proof glass is one of the most odious insinuations you could suggest against a loyal people . <P> Again , your article gives the impression that , because in Quebec and Montreal the crowds failed to yell hysterically and throw vast quantities of ticker tape and toilet paper - as happens in certain cities-their loyalty to Their Majesties was very cool . . . . <P> CHARLES J. BASTIEN <P> Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Royal Visit in the Province of Quebec damaged your magazine 's international reputation for accuracy and objectivity . <P> We , the English-speaking Aldermen of the City of Montreal , are proud of the really wonderful reception accorded Their Majesties by the Canadians of French origin . We also can testify that Mayor Houde acquitted himself with honor and dignity on this memorable occasion . <P> J. ALEX . EDMISON <P> LEO J.

Your articles have been fair , direct and intensely interesting , and now you , my Galahad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have ( oh , boor that you really are ) spit in the Holy Grail . That tacky , smart-alecky corruption of the King and Queen 's visit ! Bad , bad taste . <P> Granted you are not privileged to sympathize with the significance behind the British throne , but why ca n't you acknowledge with dignity the sacrifice two magnificent people are making of their lives ? <P> DOROTHY M. SKAITH <P> Port Credit , Ont . <P> Sirs : <P> Being an American citizen born of American parents and having lived here for the past eight years , I must protest and tell you that I was ashamed of your description of the Royal Visit to Canada . <P> When the King &; Queen came to Montreal , they traveled 24 miles of the city 's streets , and all along the route they were cheered and applauded by one and all , including French Canadians . As for myself , I can tell you that I was so much moved by the mere sight of them that I had goose flesh all over me . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . TIME prints in its issue of May 29 the most ludicrous and stupid account of the Royal Visit that I ever have had the unpleasant opportunity of reading .
