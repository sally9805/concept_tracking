txt Prosperity Shop Needs Help . To the Editor of The New York Times : In preparing- to meet the necessities of the coming Winter , may we ask citizens and visitors to bear in mind that the indiscriminate giving of clothing is not always the wisest way to help the community in a crisis ? By donating the clothing you do not need to us , families who prefer to pay can purchase what they need for almost nothing , and they will not only not be objects . of charity but will also be helping to support the free hospital service they may need . We also ask you for household goods ; . for anything and everything , ? very good articles and articles you might not think worth while . Everything helps to swell the fund . Our shop is a permanent oneThe Prosperity Shop , Inc. ; 1279 Third Avenue , We ask you to come and see us and we beg you to respond to our plea .
