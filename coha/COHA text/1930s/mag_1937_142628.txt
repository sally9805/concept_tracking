U. S. Presbyterians are less famed for radical zeal than Methodists or Congregationalists . Last week conservative members of the presbytery of New York , which 25 years ago founded and still pays most of the expenses of Labor Temple in seething 14th Street , learned with consternation that they now were identified with a lean , Netherlands-born preacher who only lately had ceased believing in revolution by violence . Labor Temple , meeting place for workers of all faiths , had chosen Rev. Abraham J. Muste to be its director , succeeding the late Rev. Edmund Bigelow Chaffee ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) . <P> Schooled mainly in Reformed theology , Abraham Muste held Reformed and Congregational pulpits , was head of Brookwood Labor College 1921-33 , has been secretary of the Amalgamated Textile Workers , has spent nights in jail ( for " agitating " ) . Though he has recanted the barricades , he is still vaguely Marxian , vaguely Trotskyite , mostly ' ' Musteite " - as other sectarian radicals call his followers of the American Workers ' Party . Preacher Muste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' The Church , weak and imperfect as it may be , exists , and it seems to me that after the example of Jesus , we have to take our place within it and work from that point .
