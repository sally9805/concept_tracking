 | Matilda Stevens ' hats came to mean something in Hazelton . One had to he worthy in order to obtain a hat  --  although she admitted the wives and daughters of preachers even when she was in doubt . The cloth enjoys many courtesies . To solicit Aunt Matilda for a hat , and be blackballed , as it were , meant that there was something lacking . The lack might be hard to define ; but Aunt Matilda had seen it , and it must be there ! One young woman was so blown upon by rumor rising out of the fact that Aunt Matilda had refused to make over her hat that the girl was subtly forced to give up her place as teacher in the village school . Aunt Matilda and her familiars did not have the ballot , but they were not without their influence in all the affairs of the village . They were the censors of the town . Many things were decided upon there by the wives of leading citizens which , later , the men would believe themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of it , stretched a rather extensive garden . There was more than an acre of ground in all . A high , thick Osage orange hedge , which had got quite beyond control , ran around two sides of it . This hedge was , in fact , almost a thorny forest . A grape arbor and fifteen or twenty fruit trees , plum , apple and cherry , were a part of the riches of this domain . The hedge was not impenetrable . Jack discovered that some boys , working from an alley at the back , had cut a hole through it ; a little runway that looked scarcely big enough for a dog . They used to crawl through to steal the fruit . It was not really the fruit which tempted them ; any one of them could have got all the fruit he wanted at home . It was the hedge which created the temptation . After dark they might have climbed the front fence from the street and helped themselves with comparative security . But they preferred the hole , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of adventure . There was the added spice that it was perhaps more wicked to steal from Miss Matilda Stevens than from most other people . She had the reputation of being more  | religious than the ordinary person . When you stole from her you were not only breaking the laws of this world , but you were trifling with the next world also to an extent not included in ordinary theft . It was almost as thrilling as putting yourself in the way of seeing a ghost . This garden was cultivated for Aunt Matilda by a singular being named Jim Shale . In the days before the isolation of the village had been broken down by radios and motorcars and moving pictures  --  before the little towns all became suburbs of New York and Chicago and other cities and everyone began to dress alike and speak alike and dance to the same phonograph records and form their opinions from the same syndicated newspaper articles  --  every little pond in the country swarmed with its own queer fish . And their queernesses were apt to show themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small communities . Mister Splain was the chief village backslider and one of the most notorious village drunkards . But it was from the lips of Jim Shale , who worked sometimes in his aunt 's garden , that Jack first heard the terrible word " freethinker . " If ever a man on earth lived a life of desperate secret adventure and high romantic peril , it was this Jim Shale . When but a very young man the seeds of religious doubt had been planted in Jim 's mind by the question : " Where did Cain get his wife ? " Jim pondered over it , off and on , for something like two years , and then he came to the astonishing conclusion that he did not know . From that he degenerated , or progressed , into skepticism of the story of Jonah 's remarkable adventure with the great fish . By the end of another two years he whispered to himself , guiltily but joyously , that he was a " freethinker . " This secret gave a zest to existence . Jim went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight the sensation he might create by rising in the pew and suddenly demanding of the preacher and congregation : " Where did Cain get his wife ? " At  | other times he would follow the sermon with attention , muttering to himself : " Well , mebby you think you got me stumped . And mebby you have got me stumped ! But what Robert Ingersoll could do to you would be aplenty ! " Not that Jim had ever heard or read Ingersoll ; Ingersoll was little more than a name to him . Dr Charles Stuart was reported to have a volume of Ingersoll in his library , together with the works of two wretches even more abandoned called Tom Paine and Voltaire . Jim was always on the point of asking Dr Stuart for these hooks , but he never quite dared . He tasted a heady pleasure in hinting darkly to Aunt Matilda and others of her circle the truth about his beliefs and unbeliefs . He would make ambiguous remarks and tremble for dizzy moments upon the very brink of discovery . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometime he would end it all with a sensational plunge into confession . Prudence and cowardice always held him back . He was also restrained by the notion that so long as he was secretly a freethinker he had an advantage of some sort over the rest of Hazelton.  | JIM 'S REAL VOCATION  --  he made gardens only by favor , as Aunt Matilda trimmed hats  --  gave him many opportunities to hint at his state of mind without actually revealing it . He was the gravedigger ; the village paid him a small monthly wage to take care of the cemetery . " I 've saw , " he used to say , " a many of ' em go into the ground , but I ai n't never yet saw one come out ! " Or he might be so bold as to vary it in this way : " They stay right where I plant ' em ! " Or , more subtly , to a neighbor : " Jeff Johnson , your missis needs soddin ' over . A little more sod onto her grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder and faster than she is now . And a real tombstone , instead of that board arrangement you got onto her , would n't hurt her none , either . She 's goin ' to be right there forever , so fur as you or me knows . " The cemetery was separated from the town by a small creek and was situated upon a knoll . Jim lived near it , in a little cottage , and knew more about it than anybody else . He even knew who were the occupants of the unnamed graves . People used to come and ask Jim , if they had been away from Hazelton for fifteen or twenty years , just where a father 's or a mother 's or a sister 's grave was . People are not supposed to forget these things , but many do . And Jim knew the Hazelton graveyard as well as Talleyrand knew the world . He had an uncomfortable way of speaking of the people buried there , and their wants and requirements , as if he had just met them casually at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the day before the Hazelton Weekly Banner went to press  | with the editorial reproduced in a previous chapter , the editor of that paper , Mr Winfield Scott Renfrew , otherwise known as " Windy " Renfrew , sallied out upon the street with the proof of it in his pocket . It was Mr Renfrew 's custom , whenever he had dashed off an article which he particularly liked , to charge forth with the clamp proof and read it to such citizens of Hazelton as he deemed worthy to hear . On this occasion Jim Shale was working in Aunt Matilda 's garden , with Jack getting in the way generally . Not because he deemed Jim Shale worthy , but because there was no other listener available , Windy read it to Jim over the fence . " How many population did you say there was in town ? " asked Jim thoughtfully . " Eleven hundred and twenty-seven souls , " said Windy , sweeping the horizon with a wave of his hand , " not counting some fiftyseven souls in Henpeck , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name applied to a small adjacent settlement by right Hazeltonians in their sense of urban greatness , and fiercely resented by the people of the tinier hamlet . " Eleven hundred and twenty-seven ai n't so many to brag about , " said Jim . " It 's more than Springtown 's got , " said Windy a little truculently . " Springtown 's got only eight hundred . " " Say , Windy , let me tell you something , " said Jim , pausing with his hands upon his spade and his chin upon his hands . " You ca n't run it over me that-a-way . I got a growin ' population in my end of town ! I got ' em in rows . And I 've got ' em for keeps , too . " " For keeps ? " asked Windy , puzzled . " Well , " said Jim , " there they be ! I ai n't never seen any of ' em movin ' away , have you ? " He was silent a moment , and then came a step nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of my end of town , Windy  --  with wings or robes or harps or any of them things onto ' em  --  you just up and say to him , preacher or no preacher , Have you ever saw that happen ? ' " From Windy 's expression Jim feared that he had gone too far this time ; that he had made quite clear his disbelief in immortality .  | So he added hastily : " Not that I would wish to be took for a freethinker , Windy . " " What 's a freethinker got to do with it ? " asked Windy . " Oh , nothing , " said Jim . And then , to get on safer ground : " I was noticin ' the first Mrs Renfrew yesterday , Windy . " " Huh ! " Windy received a shock . He had been left a widower five years before but had married again . Then he remembered Jim 's habit of speaking of the people " in his end of town " as if they were still alive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagged in some , the first Mrs Renfrew has , " said Jim . " She needs buildin ' up and roundin ' off , neat and regular . You ai n't paid much attention to the first Mrs Renfrew , Windy , the last two or three years . " " Fix it up  --  fix up her grave , Jim , and I 'll pay you , " said Windy a little shamefacedly . " How much will it cost to put it in good shape ? " " I du n no . " Jim spat reflectively . " Say a year 's subscription to the Banner ? " The bargain was concluded on that basis , and Windy went back to the Banner office . But the word " freethinker " had caught Jack 's attention . " What 's a freethinker , Jim ? " he demanded . Jim took a fresh chew of tobacco . " I du n no as kids ought to know about that , " he said . " But you 're a freethinker , ai n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea into your head , sonny ? " " Well , when you said you was n't , you said it like you was . " Jim was startled . " You notice a good deal fur a kid in short pants , do n't you , sonny ? " he said . " Well , you are one , " accused Jack stubbornly . " Is it worse than being a liar ? " " Considerable , " said Jim . " There ai n't nothing on earth considered nigh half so bad . Liars  --  jes ' plain , ordinary liars  --  is considered nowheres by the side of freethinkers . Why ? "  | " Because , " said Jack , " I 'm a liar . And I thought if I owned up to that , maybe you would own up about yours . " It was really a temptation to Jim , and for a moment he was almost inclined to make the trade . But he conquered the impulse and tried to eradicate from the boy 's mind the impression that he was a freethinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on this same day that jack found a breach in the part of the hedge which separated his aunt 's place from the place next door . The Joneses were moving out , and someone else was moving in . A little girl , a year or so younger than himself , whom jack had never seen before , was peering through at him . She had two brown braids , and in her arms was a dilapidated doll . They regarded each other in silence for some moments , and then the girl remarked : " My father 's a doctor ! " Jack retorted : " My father 's an angel ! " It was evident that she was not familiar with this conception ; she had no reply ready , and jack pushed his advantage to the utmost : " And my mother 's a angel too , and- " She interrupted him : " My doll 's got the croup ! " Jack paid no attention to her remark but gathered all his grandeur into one crushing recital and flung it at her : " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my aunt Matilda , she 's a dressmaker , and I 'm a freethinker ! " It produced a sensation quite unexpected by jack . Neither of the two children had noticed the approach of a rather stout gendeman ,  | bearded and middle-aged , who came toward them across the yard . At Jack 's sensational declaration he laughed . The next moment he had hoisted the little girl to his shoulder and was smiling down at Jack . " What is a freethinker ? " he asked without any preamble . Jack put his mind to work on it , hesitated , and then , out of the depths of his wisdom , answered : " Oh , he 's always diggin ' around ! " " Digging around ? " " He digs graves , " said Jack , " a freethinker does . " The man laughed . Then he caught sight of Jim Shale , digging away on the other side of the fence , and began to comprehend . " Does he dig gardens too ? " " Yes sir , " said Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in he ai n't never seen come out . " The man set the little girl down and walked to the gap in the hedge . " Hello , Jim ! " he said . " How are you , Doctor Stuart , " said Jim . " Gettin ' moved in all right ? " " Yes , Jim . Say , Jim  --  what 's a freethinker ? " Jim almost dropped his spade . With confusion written on his brow he looked from the boy to the doctor , and from the doctor to the boy . His attitude was a confession of guilt ; he mopped his brow , on which little beads of perspiration were coming out . And he walked nearer to the fence and said hoarsely : " Doc , whatcha drivin ' at ? " " Jim , I 've found you out . " " Doc , " said Jim in an agony of apprehension , " if it was known around town , where would I be at ? You goin ' to tell on me , Doc ? How 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this town against me ? " Dr Stuart grinned at him , nodded his head as if promising discretion , and turned toward his own house . Jim watched him go and then muttered to himself as he resumed his digging :  | " I 'll betcha if a body could get at the truth about him , he 's one himself ! " But it was Aunt Matilda who impressed upon Jack most forcibly the awfulness of being a freethinker . She caught him digging at the edge of the garden the next day , with Barbara , Dr Stuart 's little girl , in the role of an admiring observer . They were getting ready to bury one of Barbara 's dolls . " What are you children doing ? " asked Aunt Matilda . " Diggin ' a grave , " said Jack , " like Jim Shale does . " And then he explained , with a certain relish : " We 're freethinkers , me and Barbara . " Before the amazed Aunt Matilda could express her shocked surprise Barbara corroborated : " We dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' ditches too ! We 're both freethinkers ! " " Jack ! " Aunt Matilda descended in a cloud of wrath . He got his spanking first , and afterwards a lecture upon his crime in letting the word " freethinker " pass his lips . Then Barbara , frightened and crying , was led to her father , her mother being dead , and the nature of her offense particularized . Aunt Matilda was astonished for the second time . " I ca n't sec that the children have clone anything wrong , Miss Stevens , " said the doctor . " There arc plenty of worse words they ' night have picked up , you know . " " Hut , " said Aunt Matilda , " they said  --  she said  --  she was one ! " " When you come down to that , Miss Stevens , " said the doctor , laughing at her so palpably that it maddened her , " there might be worse people in the world than freethinkers . " Aunt Matilda 's jaw dropped . In telling of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in telling it  --  she said she wondered that a bolt from the sky did not strike him down with the wicked words on his tongue ; she was prepared to see something like that happen . It is conceivable that she might have relished it .  | The authority of the churches extended into every department of the communal life . Aunt Matilda was a member of the informal , self-constituted committee which saw to that . Jim Shale would certainly have lost his job as gravedigger if it had become generally known that he was a " freethinker . " His fears were justified . Orthodox people would have been scandalized at the thought of their dead being buried by an " infidel , " for , in some vague and mystic fashion , they believed in " the resurrection of the body " ; or at least they said they did . Scarcely anyone ever defied the rule of the churches openly . People of comparative wealth might have stayed away from church without suffering any great loss in consideration and standing  --  although the more prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were precisely the elements that confirmed the power of the churches ? but Jim Shale was a day laborer , and if his sentiments had been published he would have been called " trash " and treated as " trash . " Aunt Matilda and her neighbors were not the unmixed descendants of the English Puritans of the seventeenth century , nor of the New England Puritans . Hazelton had been settled by people from the country districts of Ohio ; chiefly from what was known as the " Western Reserve . " The blood of several varieties of Protestant sects was in them . Pilgrims from England , Scotland , the North of Ireland , working through Virginia and other seaboard colonies , had crossed the mountains and met and mingled their blood and their prejudices in the Western Reserve . New York and Pennsylvania had contributed Dutch and German blood ; Lutheran and Calvinist met and married , and their offspring mingled again with the sons and daughters of Massachusetts Congregationalists and Presbyterians , or Rhode Island Baptists , or Delaware Quakers . Something like a definite new people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a generation or two , and then some of them moved on again , across Indiana and Illinois , and farther West , for  | new settlements , new amalgamations . Wherever they went they took their churches and their schoolhouses and their instinct for self-government  --  they might govern themselves badly , and they frequently did , and do , but they were jealous of doing it themselves ; or , at the worst , of the illusion of doing it themselves . Individualistic in their earlier days , the perils and pressures of pioneer life began to make them huddle together mentally , and by the time the pioneer era had passed the accent was strongly placed upon conformity within the community . Even toward the beginnings of the present century the rule of the churches in places like Hazelton was scarcely less absolute than it had been in New England in the witch-hunting period , although it was frequently expressed and enforced in a more roundabout way . And on the whole it was not so gloomy . There was plenty of sport and frivolity that Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazelton had wanted to dance around a maypole , for instance , Aunt Matilda would not have stopped him  --  but she would n't have let him do it on Sunday . And even if he did it on Saturday , she would have been doubtful about it until the pastors of the churches and the heads of the Sunday schools had given their sanction . Aunt Matilda 's neighbors were people who could laugh ? although they never liked being laughed at . They were inclined to be a friendly and happy people when their deeper prejudices were untouched . But at the same time an element struggled in the mixture as sour as anything which ever condemned a Hellenic deity , a statue of a Catholic saint , a bowl of wassail or a tavern song .. . struggled , and sometimes triumphed . Puritan is not altogether the right word for Aunt Matilda and her intimates . She herself might have something of the cutting edge of the authentic old Puritanism , something of its blind fervors of conviction ; but for the most part her fellow townsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theirs was a somewhat mitigated Puritanism . They were several generations removed from the witch hunters . They needed a deep stirring of one sort or another to bring out of them the fire and danger , the frenzy and dervishism , which were latent in their  | natures . As far as Hazelton was concerned , Aunt Matilda , operating through her circle of intimates , did all the stirring she knew how ; she considered it her mission in life . She felt that she had been divinely appointed to make this one town , at least , walk straitly . And Jack was entirely at her mercy . Life in Hazelton was a good deal easier if one were a Protestant of some variety . Many other communities in the same general region were not quite so intolerant . There were only three or four Roman Catholic families in Hazelton . One Catholic citizen by the name of Jim Clancy deftly turned the flank of local prejudice by enforcing upon himself and his family an austerity so rigid that it exceeded even the Hazeltonian ideal and became almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but respect the Clancys , although she did it with a puzzled sigh ; she had to admit that none of them ever used liquor nor tobacco nor bad language , that none of them ever profaned the Sabbath nor broke the laws , that all the Clancy faces gleamed always with soap and virtue , that they were quiet and thrifty and self-respecting ; that they even held aloof from certain amusements quite innocent in themselves . They might , indeed , have been a little community of monks and nuns to judge by their way of life . They went Hazelton one better in everything that the most circumspect Hazeltonians professed . But all this did not " get them anything , " except a cold , enforced respect , from Aunt Matilda and her particular friends . Jim Clancy could no more have been elected village clerk , or a member of the school board , than he could have flown with iron wings . He was a Roman Catholic , and that was that . Jack , as he grew older and more observant , used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they were inflicting some unusual sort of penance on themselves . Eddie O'Toole , a jolly Irish cobbler of the Catholic persuasion , opened a shop a few doors away from Aunt Matilda 's place . But he lasted not more than a couple of years ; and Jack , innocently enough , was indirectly responsible for his going . Jack and three or four other small boys used to like to sit about the shop and talk to Eddie while he worked , fascinated by his manipulation of wax  | ends and leather , and above all by the stories he told them in his flavorous brogue , for Eddie delighted in talking to them . One day Aunt Matilda passed by and spied Jack in the O'Toole shop . She sailed in and hauled him out , literally , by the ear . And within an hour Jack was being examined by Aunt Matilda and Miss Emmeline Paisely and others of the inner circle . Jack said the boys liked to hang about Mr O'Toole 's shop because Mr O'Toole told them stories . " What stories ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , about . . . about leperkorns , " said Jack with the latest Celtic tale still alive in his mind . " Leperkorns ? " Aunt Matilda also gave the word a Midwestern pronunciation . She had never heard of leprechauns . She turned to Miss Emmeline Paisely . " What are leperkorns ? " she asked . " Some sort of Jesuits , I suppose , " said Miss Paisely . " Priests ! " cried Aunt Matilda with shuddering abhorrence . " No ma'am , more like brownies , " said Jack . But he added , unfortunately for Eddie O'Toole : " There was somebody like a priest in the story  --  only it was a praste ; he was the good man of the story . " " The good man ! " Aunt Matilda was now convinced that an effort had been made to proselyte Jack to the Roman Catholic religion . " Did he show you beads ? " she asked . No , Jack testified , Mr O'Toole had not shown him beads ; nor had he said anything in Latin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall down and worship them . Nevertheless , the story got about town that Eddie O'Toole was trying to put Roman Catholic ideas into the minds of the children ; and pretty soon O'Toole 's little business languished and almost disappeared . O'Toole himself never quite understood it ; he would have been very much astonished if he had discovered that he was considered an emissary of the Pope 's , working to overthrow Protestantism in the Mississippi Valley , for he did not think of himself as eligible to the inner councils of Rome at all , as it had been five years since he had been to confession . But about this  | same time a hushed rumor drifted into Hazelton that a plumber in St Louis , called in to do some work in a Catholic convent , had discovered stacks of arms in the basement . About every other year this rumor used to float through the Middle West  --  sometimes it was St Louis , sometimes Chicago , sometimes Cincinnati , sometimes Louisville , where the stacks of arms had been discovered ? and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazelton , or , at least , to pretend they credited it , and get a certain thrill out of the pretense . No doubt , three hundred years ago , when all Europe was engaged in religious wars , churches and religious institutions both Protestant and Catholic became convenient repositories for arms upon occasion . The story has stuck in the Protestant imagination , and there are still out-of-the-way places in America where it might be credited . It dies as hard as the old medieval Christian tale that the Jews celebrate certain religious rites with the blood of Christian babes , a slander that struggled for revival in certain superstitious gentile regions even within the present century . A Jew named Einstein came to Hazelton and opened a clothing store about the time that Eddie O'Toole , honestly perplexed by his growing unpopularity , left the place . But Einstein did not prosper . No " story " was started against him , as in the case of O'Toole . He was merely let alone ; he never really got his business going at all , and he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong opposition to fight from Catholics or Moslems or Jews or infidels , the two Protestant churches of Hazelton fought each other . In Hazelton , Mr David Hamlin 's church , without any reference to its denomination , was always popularly referred to as the White Church , on account of the color of the building . When it needed paint it got a coat of white , with green trimmings ; this had been going on for so long that it was felt that any other color would be a most radical departure indeed . The other church , over the congregation of which the Rev. Alexander Sprague presided ,  | was known as the Hill Church , because of its location at the summit of a knoll . Any knoll is called a hill in that flat country . The Hill Church and the White Church doubtless followed each its own particular creed ; the pastors preached sermons several times a year accentuating doctrinal points of difference , but these distinctions , while they may have been felt by a dozen or so members of each organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Church , and there was the Hill Church ; you held by one or the other of them , or else you were damned . Not so much damned to all eternity , perhaps , as scarcely respectable in Hazelton ; it was not so much a matter of hell-fire as of earthly prosperity and comfort . The very fact that there were no sharp divergences of belief gave the little struggles between the two churches an aspect something less than dignified . If the Hill Church gave an ice-cream social or a chicken dinner , the White Church , within a fortnight , endeavored to outdo it . If the White Church imported a traveling evangelist and started in to save the community from perdition , the Hill Church also began a series of revival meetings . Hazelton was " saved " at least seven times a year , with great emotionalism ; and one church was forever attempting to proselyte from the other , with much consequent recrimination and backbiting . Nothing so greatly delighted the members of the Hill Church as to find some widow woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended the White Church , and assist her with clothes for her children , or with coal . Her necessities were supposed to be a reflection upon the quality of the White Church 's religion . The White Church would not rest until it had retaliated in kind . The result of this sort of thing , no matter what the motive , was so far good that no one was ever really destitute in Hazelton . Four or five families had been trained to the acceptance of alms in this fashion ; they were the fattest people in Hazelton . The rivalry between the two churches usually became more active for a couple of weeks preceding local elections . Jack got his first impression of politics when he was still quite a small boy . One Miss Ella Springer , backed by friends and relations , aspired to be a  | teacher in the public school ; she wanted the situation which had been held by Miss Emmeline Paisely for many years . Miss Paisely , one of the most indefatigable obituary poets in that part of Illinois , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Hill Church . Mr Henry Gage , the banker , and a deacon in the White Church , was a candidate for the school board . It was understood generally that if he were elected Miss Paisely would keep her position in the school . If Mr Tucker Ackles were elected he would see that Miss Paisely was ousted and give the place to Miss Ella Springer , as he was a deacon in the Hill Church . So the lines of battle were drawn . The campaign was all the more fierce for being so restricted in area . Aunt Matilda and her cronies of the White Church , who gathered daily at her dressmaking shop for the manufacture and dissemination of gossip , did not fail to canvass the character of Miss Springer . One day Jack heard the question put bluntly and directly to Aunt Matilda : " Would you make Ella Springer a hat , Miss Stevens ? " Aunt Matilda did not answer in words . She merely pursed her lips and went on sewing as if she had not heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matilda Stevens had refused to make a hat for Miss Ella Springer . Speculations followed as to just why she had refused ; they sprang up like fungus . Hints and insinuations went the rounds as to the possible character of the friendship between Miss Springer , who was a withered nymph of fifty , and Mr Tucker Ackles , a horse-faced faun of thirty-five . Nothing that you could quite put your finger on ; no definite , scandalous allegations . The Hill Church indignantly repelled this underhanded attack on the part of the White Church and retorted in kind . The preachers pretended not to know what was going on and , to do them justice , neither of them liked this sort of thing . A small minority in each church was honestly disgusted . Nevertheless , these were the lines on which the struggle was fought out . Jack , while this was going on , used to look at Miss Springer , when she appeared on the street , very much puzzled ; there must  | be something terribly wrong about her , and he wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Splain about it . Mister said he did n't know , but suggested that it might have been discovered that she was a secret drinker . " Or else , " he added gravely , " mebby it 's been found out on her that she do n't love Jesus as much as she used to , or something like that . Why do n't you go ask your aunt ? She ought a know . " Jack did n't , and remained puzzled . Few persons really believed that there was an affair going on between Mr Ackles and Miss Springer , although a good many witty things were said about it on the street corners and in front of the livery stable where the loafers used to gather and pitch horseshoes . And a few weeks after the election most of the rancor that had been stirred up seemed to have disappeared from all but a dozen stubborn hearts . Nobody implicated in the row had realized just how outrageous he or she had been . There was very little of the commodity known as good taste in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or herself as really despicable ; they had just conformed to the conventions of battle , as they knew them . Elections and church rows were , in reality , dramatic amusements . There was not much entertainment in Hazelton . Perhaps a dozen families took the Chicago papers . Only a half dozen or so subscribed regularly for magazines . There was no public library in the town . Now and then a repertory company came along and played Uncle Tom 's Cabin , East Lynn , Hazel Kirke , The Outcast 's Daughter and The Hidden Hand , in the town hall . There was an occasional " medicine show . " There were the frequent revival meetings . At rare intervals there was a lecture ; there were two or three circuses a year . There was the county fair in the fall . Contact with the outside world was of the slightest ; " drummers " came and sold goods and talked , but they were not generally thought to be stable characters . A few people went to Chicago for brief visits . A few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; but these , almost uniformly , settled in larger towns after they had finished and came to Hazelton only when they had to . Social life of all sorts centered about the churches ; they stood , in fact , for civilization , such as it was . A few generations earlier , in the pioneer days , the country communities , in the very nature of things , were compelled to develop and exercise powerful positive virtues ; and this merely in order to keep alive . They were engaged in a breathless hand-to-hand battle with a new country ; they must conquer to exist ; they had no time to vegetate . And then , a little later , the Civil War troubled the life of all the country places . It shook and stirred and kneaded ; it called for sacrifice for the sake of a generous idea , and sacrifice and generosity were born in response . But in Hazelton , when Jack was growing up , there were few general ideas . Numbers of villages of this sort had sunk into stagnation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land was rich and black and fat ; the necessity for struggle of the sterner sort had been removed ; there was nothing external to force them to sustained spiritual or mental activity ; they were rather prosperous on the whole ; they were satisfied ; they were smug and complacent ; they resisted change . The only living thing , in reality , was the church ; and this church ( whatever its denomination ) they distorted to their own image . This rule of the churches  --  and this is not so odd  --  seemed to have no great effect upon the actual conduct of the community , in affairs that really mattered . That is to say , when you did a thing you were apt to be effectually judged , not by the deed , but by whether you belonged to one or the other of the churches . A man who seduced a servant girl , for instance , if he were a church member and signified his formal repentance to the congregation , did not lose caste particularly ; he could even be a drunkard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and manage somehow to keep his standing . But a person who was not a church member  | had to walk in a very strait path indeed ; he had to be more conspicuously moral than anybody else if he wished to get any credit for being moral at all . And questions of morality occupied everybody 's thoughts . Here , as everywhere , the unpardonable sin was to be an anarchist or an unbeliever ; to be different . There is very little consistency anywhere ; the very same gossips who could hound a man or woman to the point of desperation could also , upon occasion , be veritable ministering angels in the houses of sickness and grief and destitution . There was , at times , genuine charity as well as cant and persecution . Pettiness and ignobility existed along with simplicity and kindliness . Individuals , here as elsewhere , were capable of rising higher than the mob morality of the community , or of sinking lower . Aunt Matilda , who had gotten herself referred to now and then as an old shedevil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had felt her power , could wear herself out in unpaid services to the helpless , and all as a matter of course and without expecting any particular credit for it . Aunt Matilda used sometimes to wonder who there would be capable of holding the town up to its highest standards when she was dead and gone . Not but that there were plenty of good people , of course ; people of whom she approved , in a general way . And yet it had been her experience that the best of them needed her to make them toe the mark at times . The only two persons with whom she had never been able to find any great fault were her brother and herself . Her touch upon the town was sometimes very direct and personal . Often , of a cold winter night , when he began to be of an age to trust with such errands , she would give jack some such order as this : " You to round and see if that Jeff ' White has left his horse tied in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . If he has , go and report it to the city marshal . " She was not unkind to animals , although she did not make pets of them nor coddle them . She could command a considerable portion of the main street from the front veranda or the windows of  | her house ; and if she saw a boy tie a tin can to a dog 's tail she had him reported to his parents , and sometimes to the city marshal . If she could catch him herself she would shake him up and thump him painfully all over his head with her thimble . If a tramp asked for food , she gave it to him , and lectured him all the time he ate it on being a worthless , good-for-nothing , low-lived scamp . If he were particularly ragged , she would make him saw wood or hoe a few rows of potatoes , haranguing him while he worked , and then send him to some male friend with a note commanding a better pair of cast-off trousers for him . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a member of her own church got the better of a young lawyer , a new arrival in the village , in a most flagrant horse trade , she wrote her friend a letter and told him that , as a church member and a socalled respectable citizen , he ought to be ashamed of himself , and made him trade back . She called one evening on Sam Walker , one of the more important citizens of the place , whom she had known for years , and announced without preface : " Sam , you 've been a widower seven years . It 's time you were getting married again . " Sam , startled , thought for a wild instant that she was going to tell him to marry her , and determined to resist to the bitter end , although people did not usually resist her . She was then past sixty , and he was about forty-five . " That Kahler girl who 's been keeping house for you the last three years  --  she 's the one you 're going to marry , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rather large mass of accumulated evidence and suspicion that had come to her . Sam was a member of her church , and she liked him . She did n't want to see him getting into trouble , and she did n't want a scandal in the White Church which the Hill Church could crow over . Sam hemmed and hawed a little , and married the girl  --  just in time , as it developed . She saw to it that there was no Sunday baseball within the corporate limits of Hazelton ; she insisted that the severest possible  | penalties be inflicted for minor violations of the law ; she never hesitated to tell a young Sunday-school teacher when she thought the teacher was dressing too gaily or conducting herself too gaily ; she banished several books of which she did not approve from the church library ; she kept a watchful eye upon the choir and upon conduct at church socials ; she censored home-talent dramatic productions and even , now and then , those of traveling troupes . She had made it so hot for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . She could be just and kind , according to her lights ; and she could also be cruel and narrow and harsh and mean . She gave Jim Shale a terrific dressing-down , one day when he was weeding in her garden , for the copious expectoration of tobacco juice indiscriminately upon all vegetables within his range . Jim took it silently and meekly , but when she went away he gazed after her resentfully and muttered to himself : " Just Ol ' Miss Church herself , that 's what she is ; just Ol ' Miss Church  --  gol darn her ! "  | MISS EMMELINE PAISELY was jack 's Sunday-school teacher . And it was to her that he suddenly propounded the question one Sunday , when he was eight or nine years old : " Who made God , Miss Paisely ? " Jack had been wondering about it a good many Sundays before the question popped out of him , rather unexpectedly to himself . Miss Paisely herself had never wondered much about anything . A bony , prim old maid with a taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local reputation as a " poetess , " nothing internal or external had ever urged her to the attempt to form any original conception of God . She was conscientiously imparting to her class of a dozen or so bored youngsters the moral  --  or what her quarterly Sunday-school pamphlet said was the moral  --  of the lesson they had just read when Jack put the question . Her first thought was to pretend she had n't heard it . But that , she saw in an instant , was impossible . The whole class had been startled ; three or four of the boys were wondering if they dared to giggle . And Jack , in his earnestness , gave her no chance to evade : he repeated the question : " Miss Paisely , who made God ? " There was no special Sunday-school room separate from the church auditorium . Miss Paisely 's class was well down toward the front of the church , near the pulpit , and next to a class of adults who , under the guidance of Deacon Henry Gage , weekly examined colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into terms of American money and inches , and simulated an interest in the theory that Solomon 's amorous Song of Songs is an allegory expressing " the love of Christ for the Church . " Jack 's  | high-pitched young voice rang out during a lull in the activities of Mr Gage 's class ; a half dozen of the members , including Mr Gage himself , turned frankly and inquiringly toward Miss Paisely and her pupil with countenances expressive of every degree of surprise from a startled incredulity to a sense of outrage . The effect conveyed to Miss Paisely was that they were all waiting upon her words , and she became flustered . Fleetingly indignant , she wondered how they would like to have that question asked of them ! But she was a schoolteacher . She must be mistress of the situation . It might react upon her professionally if she were not . Her ability to keep order in the schoolroom would be doubted . She decided upon a " strong " course , much as a bishop or a premier confronted with an analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " do not raise your voice so loud in Sunday school . And you must n't ask questions like that ! " This should have been enough ; it should have closed the incident . But , unfortunately for Miss Paisely , Jack was descended from generations of preachers , men capable of being sincere and tenacious where a spiritual ( or theological ) point was involved ; forebears with the habit of debate . " But , Miss Paisely , if God made everything ? " Mr Henry Gage interrupted . Belatedly , but genuinely , sympathetic , he essayed to help Miss Paisely ; he suddenly thrust across the division between the long pews a Bible open at the first chapter of Genesis and , as Miss Paisely grasped it , dashed his finger down the initial verses . Miss Paisely took the volume with a gasp of relief . Then she assumed her most solemn and authoritative manner and read , point-blank at jack : " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . And the earth was waste and void ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters . " Increasingly conscious of the attention he had attracted  --  for everybody in that part of the church had now turned toward them  | ? Jack squirmed and flushed . The fact that the very Bible itself , and not merely the quarterly pamphlet , had been invoked to put a quietus upon him , had its effect upon Jack and upon the rest of his class , now awed and hushed ; and , indeed , in a measure upon the adults also . " Now , Johnnie , " said Miss Paisely , " I hope that is perfectly clear to you ? " " Yes ' m , " said jack tentatively , getting redder and redder , and wishing he were anywhere else . A dozen pews away Aunt Matilda , conscious that jack was making a disturbance in the church , lifted her head and glared at him ; the Rev. Mr Hamlin himself looked inquiringly but forgivingly ( forgiveness being Mr Hamlin 's specialty ) toward him . Jack had no desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole . But he wished also , and especially now , to understand ; he had really puzzled a long time over the question before he ventured to ask it . Just at the moment when he became most acutely conscious of the sensation he was creating he also became aware that he had lied in saying : " Yes ' m . " And suddenly , on the point of tears , he reversed himself and fairly shouted : " No ' m ! I mean , no ma'am ! That does n't tell who made God , Miss Paisely , that Bible does n't ! It just says he was there and made other things . " Everyone heard this time . And instantly it was no longer possible to pretend that anyone in the church was interested in anything except jack 's question . They were more interested in Jack 's question than they were in Jack ; the center of interest passed beyond the particular boy , beyond Miss Paisely , beyond Mr Gage , beyond Aunt Matilda herself . The whole Sunday school turned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smiling meekness , internally Mr Hamlin was somewhat stingingly aware that many eyes rested upon him as if in challenge . He must answer ? not so much Jack as every faction in his congregation . He felt it . He must answer so that those who were against him could find nothing in his words to condemn . There is an administration party and an opposition in every church .  | Mr Hamlin accepted the challenge . " Our young friend here , " he said , pausing a moment on his way to the pulpit to lay his hand benignly upon Jack 's head  --  for he gravitated to the pulpit quite instinctively ? " our young friend here has raised a question ! Yes , our young friend here has raised a ques-tion ! " And once in the pulpit he began , after an appreciable and impressive pause : " Yes ! And I am glad that our young friend here has raised the question  --  this particular question ! For it gives me an opportunity to say . . . " It is scarcely necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr Hamlin was well grounded in theology . It was irreproachable ; if the opposition had expected anything of which they could make capital , they were disappointed . It was more than satisfactory to what may be called the government party ; they felt it to be a triumph . In fact , it satisfied Mr Hamlin himself ; he was a conscientious man and demanded of himself that he satisfy himself . It left Jack with the impression that he had been answered ? how was it possible that he had not been answered ? ? and that when he was old enough he would understand the answer . As Aunt Matilda grimly herded him home he reflected that there was a surprising number of things that he would not be able to understand until he was older . He was quite willing to believe that older people understood these things . But if they did , why could n't they explain ? He felt certain that when he arrived at an age to understand he would be able to make other people understand too . Jack 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Members of the Hill Church , although they did not phrase it that way , were of the opinion that it showed conclusively the  | quality of the spirituality possessed by the White Church . Members of the White Church who were not particularly friendly toward Aunt Matilda , although not daring or caring to be openly unfriendly , thought it showed Jack to be a Wicked Little Boy . Old backsliders , and such of the stubbornly unregenerate as boldly pitched horseshoes every Sunday in front of Crandell 's Livery and Feed Stable , where they could be seen by people on the way to and from church , slyly wanted to know of each other what light , if any , the Rev. Mr Hamlin 's answer had really thrown on the question . Miss Ella Springer , who coveted Miss Emmeline Paisely 's place in the village school , held the opinion that whatever it was that made little Johnnie Stevens ask such a question , it was only the sort of thing that could have been expected to originate in Miss Paisely 's Sunday-school class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of youth in the public schools also . Mr Windy Renfrew got Mr Hamlin to write out his answer to the question at great length , and published it serially in three issues of the Banner . Chalk was stolen from the schoolhouse by bad boys in their teens , and the question written on the door of the village calaboose , on the sidewalk in front of the post office , and on the side of the railroad station . They would have written it on the church buildings themselves , but none of them dared so greatly . Jim Shale said nothing about it publicly : took no part in any of the discussions , facetious or serious , to which the incident gave rise . But he was tremendously impressed . Whenever he came across Jack , for weeks afterward , he regarded that innocent youth with a furtive but profound admiration that had a tinge of jealousy in it . For Jim could not conceal from himself that jack 's question " laid all over " his own constant , inward query : " Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker , who lived in one of the largest and most pretentious houses in the town , was sitting on his front veranda at the noon hour , a few days later , when Jack passed by on his way to school . Mr Gage called to him :  | " Oh , Jack ! Come here a minute ! " Surprised at this notice from an adult , and somewhat embarrassed , Jack passed slowly up the gravel walk to the porch and sat down near Mr Gage . Mr Gage beamed at the boy in the friendliest and most reassuring fashion . There was also curiosity in his regard . " When you asked that question  --  the other day in Sunday school , " he inquired after a few preliminary remarks , " did it come to you right then and there ? Or was it something you 'd been thinking about for a long time ? " " I 'd been thinking about it , " said Jack , feeling the genuine friendliness in the man , and conscious now that this was not going to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped Miss Paisely save her face in the church . " I used to think about things like that a good deal myself , " confessed Mr Gage . " Used to talk ' em over  --  with your father . You probably do n't remember your father very well . " " Did he explain ' em so you could understand ' em ? " asked Jack . Mr Gage considered , quite seriously and sincerely , rocking in his chair , and with the tips of all his fingers delicately joined . And then , with a sudden , most disarming smile , he leaned toward Jack and confided in a low tone : " I thought I understood ' em while he was explaining  --  but afterward it always got away from me ! " Jack nodded comprehendingly . " Maybe it 's always that way , " he said . " Maybe , " said Mr Gage . He gazed at jack with his rather handsome , slightly protuberant large brown eyes in silence for a moment . Then : " What are you going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was ? " " Probably , " said Jack soberly . " Aunt Matilda says I am . " " Well , " said Mr Gage , " if you have any trouble getting off to college , come and see me . " He rose and beckoned Jack to follow him into the house . " Ever see my library ? " said Mr Gage . It was a good-sized room , and the walls were lined with bookcases with glass doors . There  | were thousands of volumes , and even Jack could perceive that the room was almost entirely unused . The books were all in sets ; most of them had never been moved at all after having been placed on the shelves ; the leaves of nearly all of them were uncut . " Come over here any time you want to , " said Mr Gage , " and help yourself to any of these books you want . I 'll tell Mrs Gage . " As if something vaguely worried him , he looked about the cases and murmured : " No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs Gage does n't . I 'm ashamed to say I do n't . And my children never seem to read anything . " Nothing would have surprised Mr Gage any more than to see one of his children with a book . All his children reminded him a little bit of rabbits , and he wondered sometimes if they reminded other people of rabbits . As Jack , after thanking him , went on toward the schoolhouse , Gage had for a crazy instant the grotesque impulse to call the boy back and say : " You must know some of my children  --  do they remind you and the other boys of rabbits ? " Mr Gage admired sincerity . He was always fascinated and charmed when he saw a conscientious man sticking to his principles in spite of temptation and opposition . He had admired jack 's father ; he thought he saw some of the father 's traits creeping out in the son . He was conscious of a benevolent impulse to help the boy forward in the world . And he liked the lad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would Henry Gage have had the courage himself to get up in church and ask " Who made God ? " or any other question calculated to throw public suspicion upon his own orthodoxy . He took such questions privately to his pastor , as he had told Jack  --  or he had taken them there , years ago , when he had taken them anywhere . But just at this time Mr Gage was having spells of uneasiness about himself . He was getting along toward forty years of age , and he was far from satisfied with his existence . Although he never  | thought of himself so , there is no doubt that he was by far the most sophisticated inhabitant of Hazelton . He got away from Hazelton as often as he could , on the pretext of business , making frequent trips to Chicago and even to New York . And there was always an intrigue with some woman mixed up with these trips . Gage was good-looking , he was eminently agreeable ; women liked him . And as for him , a good-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known it and had existed in a continuous fit of tense-lipped jealousy from their early marriage to her early death . She had left him three children whose eyes protruded more than their father 's . Gage had n't intended to get married again but had found himself wedded once more by the time he was thirty  --  and for the life of him , he could not make out whether his present spouse was honestly unaware of his affairs with other women or too discreet to make a row about them . Besides his legitimate children , there were two or three illegitimate ones in the neighborhood whose mothers he had hushed up with money ? and all of the children looked , to Gage , like rabbits , no matter who the mother might be . Henry Gage 's admiration for uprightness and sincerity was a most genuine thing . He always felt humble when he was in the presence of a person whom he knew to be superior to himself . And it annoyed him to be a hypocrite . But how could he help being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who led it . And he was helpless where women were concerned . Both things were genuine with him . It worried him . Mister Splain had never lost interest in Jack  --  nor in Aunt Matilda 's chickens  --  since the time of his miraculous ascension and inexplicable return to earth . And meeting the boy shortly after the sensational Sunday of the question , he drew Jack from the street into the hardware shop and whispered : " For that matter , Bub , who made Mister Splain ? Huh ? Ever think of that ? Who made Mister Splain ? " Mister 's interest in himself never faltered .  | And there were other echoes . The Rev. Alexander Sprague , of the Hill Church , meeting the Rev. Mr Hamlin on the street as Mr Hamlin emerged from Aunt Matilda 's house , where he had been making a pastoral call , complimented the pastor of the White Church upon the manner in which he had answered Jack 's question . " Where , " said Mr Sprague , " do you suppose the boy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible class ? " " I ca n't imagine , " said Mr Hamlin , visibly trying to imagine . Mr Hamlin was a tall man with mild eyes and a mild smile and a mild nose . That is to say , the nose was large and well formed and aquiline ; just the sort of nose that should have been forceful and aggressive-looking . But it missed looking aggressive in itself ; it missed making its owner look aggressive ; it rather accentuated the noncombativeness of his general character than belied it . It just happened to have the shape of a conqueror 's nose , but it had none of the conquering spirit in it . It was a proboscis which never trumpeted . " I ca n't think , " said Mr Hamlin , " where he could have picked up the idea . " " Not from his aunt , " said Mr Sprague with the air of graciously conceding that no adult member of Mr Hamlin 's congregation ( though the congregation might fall short in some ways ) would have put the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to no irreligious influences , " said Mr Hamlin . " No , of course not , " said Mr Sprague . They were standing on the sidewalk near the hedge which divided Aunt Matilda 's place from that of Dr Stuart , and Mr Sprague was gazing toward the doctor 's house . Mr Hamlin saw Mr Sprague 's eyes suddenly lighten and become fixed , and Mr Sprague repeated , but with a different intonation , " Of course not . " Subtly impelled , Mr Hamlin turned to seek the object of the other 's gaze . He perceived instantly what had caused Mr Sprague 's  | change of manner . Dr Stuart , who had been smoking and reading a paper on his veranda , had laid the paper down and was very evidently engaged in explaining something to Jack and his little girl , Barbara . They had brought a book to him , which he held open in his hand , and the three were discussing their subject with animation . The distance was too great to catch the trend of the conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the interest of the instructor . " Of course not , " said Mr Sprague for the third time , and Mr Hamlin stirred uneasily and compressed his lips . Mr Sprague was short and dark , compactly but not heavily built . One felt a sense of something compact and wieldy in the mind that functioned behind his rather bulging forehead ; he was in his forties , and it seemed a little strange that he stayed in so insignificant a place as Hazelton ; patently he had qualities . Among them was the quality of suggesting to another the impression that was in his own mind with a minimum of words . He had the gift of insinuation . " I have found in my pastoral work , " said Mr Sprague , still regarding the little group on the veranda , " that it is not always easy to determine just what influences are at work . " " But surely , " said Mr Hamlin , " Doctor Stuart would not deliberately ... " He hesitated for a word . " Implant ? " breathed Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted Mr Hamlin . And neither one finished the sentence , nor named the thing Dr Stuart would , or surely would not , implant . " Perhaps not  --  er  --  deliberately , " said Mr Sprague . " But , you think . . . carelessly ? " Mr Sprague was silent a moment and then murmured something to the effect that figs are not raised from thistles . Mr Hamlin seemed to think it possible that Dr Stuart was not exactly a thistle . " He does a lot of good , in his own way , in Hazelton , " suggested the pastor of the White Church . " In his own way , " said Mr Sprague . It was evident that Dr Stuart 's way could never be Mr Sprague 's way ; Mr Sprague 's manner  | faintly implied that he would be shocked and grieved to discover that it could be Mr Hamlin 's way . " He has never been publicly antagonistic to the churches , even although he has always kept away from them , " said Mr Hamlin . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself that he did not dislike him ; he succeeded in making himself believe that ; he told himself resolutely that if Dr Stuart were a " strayed sheep " it was his duty to lavish all the more love upon him and hold himself in readiness to lead him back into the fold . " No , never publicly antagonistic , " said Mr. Sprague . He appeared to reflect . " I have not found in my work , " he continued , " that public antagonism is the hardest thing to combat . But I have always found , and no doubt you have , too , in Doctor Stuart a disposition to evade any definition of his exact attitude . And it is possible that he is  --  it is now and then the case with people who are called freethinkers  --  honestly unconscious of the extent of his influence upon the lives of others . And sometimes , if people like this are appealed to , in a liberal spirit ... " Mr Sprague paused discreetly . He did not say that if any young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart he would tactfully remind Dr Stuart that it would be unbecoming to attempt to shake the foundations of that young person 's faith . But Mr Hamlin got it . He got it as definitely as if Mr Sprague had asked him : " Are you going to do your duty and speak to Doctor Stuart about what he may carelessly and unconsciously put into that child 's mind , or are you going to shirk your moral duty ? " Mr Hamlin had n't exactly seen all this . He felt that he might never have seen it if left to himself . He felt a shade of resentment toward Mr Sprague , who seemed to be involving him in what might be an embarrassing talk with Dr Stuart . But immediately upon feeling this slight resentment Mr Hamlin forgave Mr Sprague for having caused him to feel it . Mr Hamlin 's own impulse would have been to make another attempt to win Dr Stuart himself over to the church ; but he had already tried that more than once , and Dr Stuart had been  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasive.  | If it was his duty to say something to Dr Stuart about Jack , he would do it . He began to feel that it was his duty ; he straightened his slightly bent figure and moved toward the doctor 's gate . " Let us speak to him together , " he said , in which was a chill rather than a flush of resolution ; and laid his hand upon the gate . " You will pardon me , but is n't it . . . " Mr Sprague 's face and eyes finished for him : " Is n't it a question of a member of your flock , and your duty ? " But Mr Hamlin could do a bit in the way of creating a situation and implying a challenge , himself , when put to it . He said with directness : " But you 're coming with me , are n't you , Brother Sprague ? Surely we stand together for the righteous cause in this town ? " So they opened the gate and went up the path together . Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain something in Ivanhoe ) rose to greet them with a smile but wondered " What the deuce ? " internally . If Mr Hamlin unconsciously prided himself upon his forgiveness , Dr Stuart was rather consciously pleased with himself as a tolerant person . It was not altogether easy for Mr Hamlin to begin . " I want to consult with you , " he said when they were seated , " about a matter which ? " Mr Sprague interrupted softly : " Pardon me  --  but might I suggest the absence of the children ? " Dr Stuart turned a large blue eye upon the pastor of the Hill Church , remembered that he did n't particularly like him , stroked his brown beard , remembered that he must be tolerant above all things , and told the children to run over to Jack 's yard and play . And then , as Mr Hamlin still showed evidences of hesitation , Dr Stuart suggested helpfully : " You wanted to see me about something which you think it better that the children should n't hear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , about the children themselves . " ( He tentatively took up the idea of including Barbara as well as Jack in his appeal . ) " About their spiritual life . " " Damn it , what 's coming now ? " said the doctor to himself . " Whatever it is , I 'll try to get around it without hurting Hamlin 's feelings , if I can . As for Sprague . . . " Dr Stuart ( on one of those occasions when the tolerance he cultivated so consciously had failed ) had called Mr Hamlin a God damned fool . It was in the doctor 's own house at that . Mr Hamlin had been forgiving him for it ever since . It had happened at the time when the doctor 's wife lay fatally ill . She was one of Mr Hamlin 's most pious communicants . And Mr Hamlin had insisted on praying with her and discussing with her the state of her soul . The physician forbade the preacher 's entrance to the sickroom , for he still clung to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was certain that any excitement would shorten it . But to Mr Hamlin it seemed that the woman was dying without the support and consolation she was entitled to . He had believed the doctor 's unwillingness to arise solely from the hardness of an unbeliever 's heart ; he had , in fact , and being honestly mistaken , tried to argue against this man whom he conceived of as so bigoted . It was then that Dr Stuart had called him a God damned fool and had taken him by the elbow and conducted him to the door . Perhaps , on that occasion , Mr Hamlin had to a certain extent enjoyed being a martyr . Perhaps he continued to enjoy it , while continuing to forgive Dr Stuart . At any rate , both men thought of this incident , now four or five years old , as Mr Hamlin said : " About their spiritual life . " And , aloud , Dr Stuart merely repeated :  | " About their spiritual life ? " " An adult , " put in Mr Sprague , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spiritual life of a child . " " And , " said the doctor , combing his beard with his fingers and smiling at Mr Sprague , " you are inclined to think that any influence I might have would necessarily be harmful ? " " No ! No ! " said Mr Hamlin with conciliatory eagerness . " We do n't think for a moment that you would deliberately try to make freethinkers of them . " " Thank you , " said the doctor . " I am not sure that I would ? although , you know , I 'm not so sure that if I did it would be utterly demoralizing . " Mr Sprague looked at Mr Hamlin as if to say : " You see ! " Mr Hamlin looked sad ; very , very sad . " The little boy  --  the little Stevens boy , " said Mr Sprague , " seems to have acquired from some source a disposition to question the foundations of the Christian faith . " The doctor remembered the " Who made God ? " incident then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " What you really want to know , then , is whether I put Jack up to asking who made God ? and you want me to promise never to do it again . Is that it ? " Certainly it was n't the way Mr Hamlin had intended to put it . He found himself suddenly and rawly in the midst of the matter without having been given an opportunity for a tactful approach . Dr Stuart having put it that way , Mr Hamlin hesitated again before proceeding . It was Mr Sprague who said : " Oh , but you 're wrong , Doctor ! We had n't thought of you as intentionally putting Jack Stevens up to anything . " Mr Sprague may not have been conscious of stressing the word " intentionally , " but he did stress it , ever so slightly . " Intentionally ? " said the doctor . " I see . " And he regarded Mr Sprague with just a glint of malice . " Not intentionally then  --  the thought being that I am so thoroughly iniquitous that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace to the morals of the young , including my own daughter ? " Mr Hamlin had a worried sense that everything about this conversation  | was going all wrong , and a feeling that its wrongness was largely due to Mr Sprague . He made an effort to right it . " Believe me , Doctor Stuart , nothing was further from my mind than a willingness to think that you would consciously influence Jack against . . . against the belief that his father subscribed to . But we are not always conscious of the influence we have upon the young . And I feel that , as the child 's spiritual director , I have a right to beg of you  --  that it is my duty to beg of you ! ? to be careful . To be careful ! And I felt certain that , although you do not believe as I do , you would understand my feeling and respect it . " Mr Hamlin had achieved directness and a considerable dignity , and arose when he had finished ; the others got up too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't influenced the child . Nothing has been further from my thoughts . I never try to influence anyone about such things . As a matter of fact , I never discuss them . " He stooped and picked up his pipe from the floor of the porch , and when he had relighted it , went on . " I have never discussed such things with either of you , have I ? You have tried to discuss them with me . Both of you . Really , you do n't know what I believe or what I do n't believe  --  is n't that so ? Is n't your assumption that I do n't believe as you do based on the very fact that I have always avoided discussing such things with you ? Think it over and you 'll find that it is ! " Mr Hamlin cleared his throat as if to say something , but the doctor put up his hand and interrupted him : " Pardon me  --  just a moment more . I wo n't influence the boy . I wo n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm concerned , I 'll give no bias to what you may choose to teach him . If that is what you wanted , you have it  --  as a promise , if you like . " " Thank you , " said Mr Hamlin , and shook hands with him . Mr Sprague also shook hands with him , and they turned to go . But as they walked down the steps of the veranda , Dr Stuart suddenly laughed , and they both stopped and wheeled round again , Mr Hamlin genuinely astonished , and Mr Sprague flushed and offended .  | " Excuse me , " said the doctor , " but I just thought of something . I really was n't laughing at you . " " At whom were you laughing then ? " asked Mr Sprague 's rather eloquent eyes and Mr Hamlin 's mild and patient nose , though neither man spoke with his mouth . " The entire human race , " said Dr Stuart in explanation . " The entire human race  --  well , you know , each member of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally superior to every other member . . . . I catch myself at it . I once intended going into the ministry myself . . . . Yes , really . . . . Be careful and latch the gate , wo n't you , please ? Cows and things get in. "  | DR STUART , indeed , had been brought up to a creed as rigid as that of either Mr Sprague or Mr Hamlin . One of his earliest recollections was of being soundly whipped for whistling on " the Sabbath day . " It was a harsh and gloomy sect to which his parents had belonged . He sat and smoked and thought about it after the two preachers had left . He was glad that he had escaped an open clash in his interview with the ministers . He put down the escape to his own tolerant attitude of mind . He had , secretly , a fear that someday this tolerance of which he was so vain might fail him ; so he was constantly calling his own attention to it , constantly making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm glad , " he mused , " that it did n't take a turn where they asked me directly about all this who-made-God ' business . I might have retailed to them the familiar idea that we all make our gods in our own image , and they would have thought I was blaspheming . They make one sort , and I make another . And it was a most unpleasant and barbarous sort of deity my forebears made  --  unpleasant and hard to get away from . I wonder if I 'll ever return to him ? " For sometimes he was afraid that he might revert to this God of his fathers , the savage Jehovah of the Old Testament . It was a fear which cropped up in his consciousness again and again ? this fear that he would " return to the tribe " ; that he would go back to the herd from which he had escaped . For , as he grew older , he could not conceal from himself that his very skepticism was more and more shot through with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had departed ; he doubted the old-time religion in its own terminology . He fell to speculating just what a deity created in the composite image of Hazelton 's orthodoxy would be like . " He would have rather large ears , " murmured the doctor , devoting a fresh pipe of tobacco to the fancy . " Big ears , slightly pricked forward , so as not to miss anything that was said about him . His eyes would bulge out a little , for he would strain them trying to spy in all directions at the same time . His lips would hang somewhat loose ; yes , a little loose and gossiplike , and he would haggle a good deal over the prayers said to him . He would always want one more . And he would probably feel that he had to belong to the Republican party  --  it would look a little better ! " Country doctors ( as well as city ones ) are compelled in the course of their practice to forgive a good many bills owing to them , simply because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy in this respect as many other doctors , and said as little about it . Once Mr Hamlin detected him in a secret charity  --  supplying a family ( who would never pay him for his professional services ) with proper food at his own expense because the three children were rickety and would never get over it without the right diet . " A very Christian thing to do , " beamed Mr Hamlin . " Do n't say anything about it , " said Dr Stuart , " or I 'll have every bum and loafer in the township on my hands . " " Very Christian ! " repeated Mr Hamlin . " I have my hopes of you yet  --  we 'll have you in the church yet ! " Secretly enraged , the physician retorted : " Christian ? Why not pagan ? Why not Buddhistic ? Why not Moslem ? Why not Jewish ? Christianity has never had any monopoly on that kind of thing . " Mr Hamlin had been puzzled and grieved . He could n't understand why anyone should do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to deny its Christianity . Unless  --  the very thought of it gave Mr Hamlin a thrill of horror  --  unless that person wanted it understood that he detested Christianity itself . It never occurred to Mr Hamlin that there was a far simpler explanation ; an explanation as simple as the fact that Dr Stuart considered  | his motives , and the origin of his motives , nobody 's business but his own . He presently shocked the preacher still further by remarking : " Have you ever thought much about the pagan influences in early Christianity , Mr Hamlin ? " Mr Hamlin had n't thought of them , and had n't heard of them except in the vaguest and sketchiest way , and his look said he had n't so plainly that he did n't need to speak . " I 've always thought Jesus himself must have been somewhat influenced by the pagans round about  --  he got over toward Tyre and Sidon once or twice , did n't he ? And Galilee , where he was born and brought up , was full of pagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judaism ! " Mr Hamlin looked stricken and went away from there . The two men really detested each other ; but each tried to hide it from the other and from himself , Mr Hamlin by conscious exercise of the Christian virtue of forgiveness , and Dr Stuart by conscious exercise of the liberal virtue of toleration . Perhaps the doctor was more unjust than the preacher . He did n't give Mr Hamlin credit for the sincerity that was Mr Hamlin 's . What other motive than absolute sincerity , devotion to a beloved work , could possibly have made Mr Hamlin a preacher in a place such as Hazelton ? It meant a life of poverty and shabbiness . In the first place , the salary which he was supposed to get was very small ; and in the second place , he never got all of it , in money . Henry Gage paid half of it out of his own pocket , and the rest of it was seldom paid . His congregation occasionally gave him things in the way of garden produce  --  as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for what they withheld from him in money ; and this had been going on for so long that Hamlin had lost his original sense of humiliation at accepting such things . Many village churches kept their preachers in a condition of genteel mendicancy in this fashion .  | Mr Hamlin had a meek and rather silly wife ; and she was so much the creature of the church that she felt apologetic and looked apologetic when , by dint of great contrivings , she got hold of a new and decent dress or hat to wear . She worshiped her husband , and he loved and pitied her . They had a daughter growing up , who realized the situation better than either of her parents , and who hated the town and the church people with a deep and sullen intensity which never found expression . She clearly perceived that her parents had been put into the position of beggars and that she herself was an unpaid servant of the congregation at every sort of church function . Hamlin honestly wished to serve his fellow men . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the ministry . He used to pray a good deal over the situation . But he never heard in answer to his prayers any voice , inward or external , which told him to leave the ministry . On the contrary , he became more and more convinced , the more he prayed , that a life of humble selfsacrifice had been required of him by his Creator , and that he would be a recreant and a sinner if he deserted his post . He forgave his congregation for treating him badly , all the more readily because he saw that they really did not know they were doing it . Hundreds of country-town preachers were being treated in the same fashion . Miriam , the daughter , had heard a very clear answer to her own constant prayer . The voice told her to leave Hazelton when and how she could , and as soon as she could . She pitied her parents , but they would never be any different ; she could never help them to be otherwise , in character , than they were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She was a girl who would have been handsome if she had not been ill dressed and bereft of all joy . At seventeen she was already busy spinning desperate little plans for escape , which she confided to no one . " And when once I get away , " she used to say to herself with a secret relish of the profanity of the remark , which would have overturned the village if she had uttered it publicly , " when once I get away from here , I 'll go to hell before I come back again ! "  | The effect which his question in Sunday school had produced made Jack rather uncomfortable for two or three weeks . And then he gradually became unself-conscious again . He had no great inherent desire to do anything other than conform ; he never doubted that Mr Hamlin had answered him fully and authoritatively and that when he got older he would quite comprehend ; he had no especial impulse to quarrel with established authority so long as established authority let him alone . But , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the effort to conceive of a beginning before the beginning , of a deep below the deep , worried him again and again . It was a trouble that he did not get rid of for years  --  that he never got rid of entirely . This worry over the beginnings of the universe visited him oftenest at night ; he would awake screaming and sweating from an exploration of vague gray abysses , terrified by something vast and imminent and formless . His eye , when he awakened , might fix itself upon a cap or coat hanging upon the wall , and for an instant his strangling terror would connect itself mysteriously with the cap or coat ; and he would tell his aunt Matilda , hovering over him anxiously with a kerosene lamp , that that was what had frightened him . Aunt Matilda would then dose him with worm medicine . His midnight beatings of his wings against the awful bound of boundlessness , his unwholesome adventures with infinity , gradually became less frequent as he grew . But the dreams , if dreams they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was about twelve years old by a chance remark which he heard Mister Splain make . Mister had just been thrown out of Tom Meek 's barroom , having  | exceeded his credit limit and having pestered Tom Meek for some hours thereafter to the point of distraction and frenzy . Jack came across him sitting on the edge of the sidewalk with his feet in the gutter . " Bub , " said Mister Splain , jerking his thumb backward over his shoulder toward Tom Meek , who was still standing in the doorway of his place of business glowering at him , " do n't you never let that man there sell you any liquor ! Liquor is one of the things that 's ruined Mister Splain . And the James boys too ! " " The James boys ! " muttered Tom Meek in deep disgust . One reason he had become physically violent with Mister Splain was because he had been so thoroughly wearied hearing Mister babble of the James boys all afternoon . Jack was embarrassed by being , as it were , drawn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best families did not stop in the vicinity of the barroom in Hazelton . But he did not feel like deserting his old friend Mister Splain . " That man , " said Mister , pointing to Tom Meek , " has got a small soul , Bub ! The old outlaw 's seen many a small soul , but he 's never seen anywheres a soul as small as Tom Meek 's soul ! " He got to his feet , with Jack 's assistance , and , an audience of half a dozen having collected by this time , he shook a denunciatory finger at Tom Meek and declaimed : " Tom Meek 's soul is so small that if there was twenty million souls the size of his'n into a flea 's belly , them souls would all be so fur apart they could n't hear each other if they hollered ! " Jack 's mind seized upon the figure and retained it and made it the plot of the next nightmare . He thought  --  and it was a ghastly thought and chilling  --  that his soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flea 's belly ; all these pieces of soul were trying to shout to one another that they might reassemble as a unit . And the consciousness that this thing , which was , could not be , sickened him .  | And then the conception varied . He had been studying elementary physiology in school and had been interested in the circulation of the blood and the manner in which the corpuscles , laden with life , voyage through the body . He dreamed that his soul , shrunken to an atom 's size and perched upon a blood corpuscle , swam swiftly through his own body ; a soul that cowered at the reverberations of a vast , regular , throbbing thunder . Sometimes this thunder seemed to be from the beating of his own heart toward which he floated as toward a maelstrom ; sometimes it was the seizing and overwhelming utterance of God ; sometimes it was the voice of his late father , the Rev. John Knox Stevens , thundering from the pulpit . The idea took still another turn . The original thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone 's . The third form was characteristically Jack 's own . It occurred to him , while he was awake , that all the multitudes and millions of planets and stars , including our world , might themselves be merely corpuscles of blood that voyaged through the pulsating veins of a God . And this God himself might inhabit a world which was one of millions and multitudes of worlds like itself . And , once more , each of these worlds might be merely a corpuscle of blood in the veins of a still greater God . . . and . . . and . . . The multiplication , the geometrical progression , became monstrous beyond expression ; it made him feverish . His waking mind recoiled from this new figure of infinity , grown out of a flea 's belly ; but the genius of his nightmares , the peculiar fiend of his imagination , the quick hag of his dreams , shook it over his pillow and devastated him with it . These plaguing intimations of cosmic vastness are not so rare among children of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic age passes without fulfilling its promises ; acceptance , conformity , smother it . But there still linger in many of us , far along in our dull maturity , dim recollections of such things as the first time we ever saw the stars ; although it is difficult to fight backward toward and recapture the sense of that impact in its simplicity and directness and fresh wonder . One summer evening after supper Jack and a couple of other  | boys sat on a grass plot in front of the Hill Church playing mumblety-peg . The sun set and it became too dark to play , but the boys still lingered in the warm and airy dusk . Along the western horizon there was a flickering line of fire ; for a few miles from the village , in that direction , were the beginnings of a large swamp , and occasionally in rainless weather the dry grass and rushes above the sloughs and ponds would catch fire and burn down to the level of the water and mud . From even a slight elevation , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see for many miles in that country , and the boys watched the distant flames until the night grew darker and the sky above them was filled with myriads of throbbing stars . There seemed to jack something terribly lonely , intolerably melancholy and desolate , there on the western horizon , where the fires were flickering ; he did not know why , for he had often seen swamp fires such as this before . But the fires this night seemed to indicate a gateway through which one might walk , following the departed sun  --  might walk into a region of emptiness beyond the bounds of the familiar , friendly , populated earth . Jack lay back on the grass and looked up at the stars . And presently he began to be overwhelmed by them , in a way that he had never before experienced  --  there were so many of them , so many myriads of them , and they were so remote , and yet , somehow , he himself had got out there where they were , out there where they were trying to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their loneliness made him indescribably , intolerably lonely . He had gone through that gateway in the west , he had traversed great desert reaches , he had gone beyond the touch and ken of his companions who lay a few feet distant , he was out there in the vastness , and the vastness pressed heavy on and ached his own littleness . There was too much of it all for him to take in and warm with the human heat of his own brain and blood ; it took the human heat out of him ; even the stars and planets could not warm it all with their valiant pulsations . This first clear sense of the individual ego 's nothingness ( and yet how should it be nothing , since it had this sense ? ) in relation to  | infinity made the boy want to wail ; the intensity and reality of his strange emotion made him want to howl as a dog howls at the moon . As we grow older we learn how to veil and cover the immensities and the realities for the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not howl at the moon ; we affect to trim its wick and hang it over Broadway and tell it that it is not so bright or decorative , after all , as an electric sign . And if a meteorite impinges upon our earth ( which is also a star ! ) we hastily hand it over to somebody very learned for a chemical analysis and think we have got the better of the situation that way . Maybe we are obliged to ; it is perhaps impossible to live comfortably with infinity , with eternity , with the absolute  --  with the gods . Even demigods frequently find themselves chained on Caucasus or nailed up on Calvary or , more terrible still , popularly accepted and turned into grotesque nonsense . Jack 's mood may have communicated itself to one of his companions , Tommy ( alias " Fatty " ) Wilson by name  --  or , like as not , Fatty , who was nobody 's clod in spite of his nickname , had been experiencing something similar on his own account ; for presently young Wilson sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' make you scared tonight ! " He said it with an apologetic chuckle . It was customary in Hazelton either to conceal an unusual idea altogether or to state it with a measure of self-deprecation . Nevertheless , Jack felt grateful to Fatty , and the remark was the beginning of a real friendship .  | IT MUST NOT be supposed that these seizures and speculations were all the stuff of Jack 's expanding life . There was a side of him essentially athletic and sentimental . When he was twelve years old he fell deeply and romantically in love with a lady some fifteen years his senior . It was the first of a series of sprawling puppy loves . This lady was a Miss Griffiths , his schoolteacher . She never knew with what fervor and reality she was loved . There are few things more charming and pathetic and idiotic than these young puppy loves of boys for women  --  romantic and ridiculous , poetic and ideal . The boy may be an utter little barbarian in many of his aspects , and yet he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a period when he is altogether chivalric and sentimental ; puberty has not yet seized upon him to perplex him and mingle the erotic with his dreams . He may , or he may not , be accurately aware how the human species is generated ; but in either case he does not think of these saints , these angels , whom he loves , as women , as females of the human species ; he is capable of dying for love of them without realizing them as lovers . It is impossible for him to think of them as any man 's lovers . Jack went through a period of acute apprehension . He was afraid , all the time , that the next moment his love for Miss Griffiths might be discovered . If anyone mentioned her name in his presence he blushed so that he felt he might as well have bawled his secret to the universe . He wondered that people did not know it merely by looking at him . He was discovering the poets in Mr Gage 's library ( where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart 's house , and he tried to write verse expressing the state of his affections . Her name was Elinor and he considered it  | the most beautiful name in the world  --  but he did not dare put it in his poems . Somebody might find them , and he would be " joshed " about it ; and that would have driven him to homicide or suicide . He tried to draw pictures of her during school hours , but if he suspected that anyone might be looking he would hastily add large mustachios or a thick beard to the sketch  --  an entirely superfluous precaution , as the sketches never looked like her or any other human being . He gathered that she was partial to violets , and this not altogether original predilection seemed to Jack to testify to a wonderful nature . Boys of this age are as sentimental as girls get the credit of being , and sometimes they try to hide it under a surface of brutality , of deliberate uncouthness . He should have liked to bring violets to her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume an attitude of flippant misbehavior in school , which he felt was calculated to throw the world at large off the scent ; it served also another purpose , for she would reprimand him and that brought him into contact with her . He suffered exquisite pangs when she disciplined him , and enjoyed his sufferings ; she herself was puzzled at his occasional outbreaks of juvenile deviltry . Jack suspected that the principal of the school was " sweet on her , " as they said in Hazelton , for sometimes they walked home from school together ; and Jack used to have visions of himself and this gentleman pumping lead at each other from shiny nickel-plated revolvers . Aunt Matilda visited school one day . Occasionally members of the school board , interested parents , or one or the other of the preachers , made a call and sat with expressionless faces or false smiles while the poor teachers put the pupils through their paces . It was customary to ask the visitor to " say a few words . " Children whose parents or guardians said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange sort of shame seized upon them . It appeared that Aunt Matilda was there , grimly , to ask the pupils a few Bible questions ; and to make sure that the Bible was read in school every day . After she got through with Jack 's room , she visited every other room in the school . She ended with the principal of the school , a Mr Walters . Only  | an hour before her visit she had heard that some dreadful thing called Evolution was being taught to the high-school classes by this Mr Walters , who was new in the town . She thought about it for a few minutes , and then she resolutely donned her most orthodox bonnet , took a Bible in her hand and descended upon the school . " I hear , " she said severely to Mr Walters , while the whole gaping room marked her words ( a thing that did not worry her at all ) , " I hear that you 're teaching some kind of nonsense called evolution in school  --  men being descended from monkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution , " said the young man , prepared to argue about it . " It 's against Genesis ? " she inquired . He admitted that the evolutionary theory did not accord with a literal interpretation of Genesis . " My advice to you , young man , " she said , " is to stop it . Stop it yourself , before I have to . " " But it 's in the textbooks that the school board have adopted , " he objected . " We 'll change the textbooks , and we 'll change the school board , too , if we have to in order to get rid of it , " she said firmly . " But the best plan would be for you to just drop it and say nothing . I do n't want a row in our town right now , unless I 've got to have one . Here 's a Bible I 'm going to make you a gift of  --  you go home and read it , young man , and get rid of some of your wicked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After this she visited the school library and calmly took away with her two or three books that she was doubtful as to whether the children should read . Nobody opposed her . Jack looked out the window and saw her go up the street with an inexpressible relief . It was after school that same evening that Jack told Fatty Wilson  --  everything . They sat together on the bank of the creek which meandered through the woods . He had to tell somebody , and Fatty had more understanding than any of the other boys . Fatty received the confidence in puzzled sympathy . Presently he exclaimed that this was like things you read about .  | " Yes , " said jack , " it 's like- " But he paused just in time . He had come across a volume of Keats in Mr Gage 's library , and " La Belle Dame Sans Merci " had so fascinated him that he had learned it by heart . Of course Fatty would not have read that ; but it seemed , somehow , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as unlike as possible to the faery heroine of that immortal fantasy . She was a good , honest , pretty , unimaginative young woman destined to marry a prosperous farmer and bear him five healthy children within the next ten years ; and she would not herself have had the faintest understanding of , or any great patience with , the man or boy who imagined she bore any resemblance to the cruel charmers of romantic poesy . But at this moment she was all of them to jack . He was suffused in an idiocy of sentiment so utterly without defense that only a blackguard could ridicule it ; he could find an elfin princess in any handsome girl even though the girl 's mentality were such that it would have dismissed him and his dreams as absurd and incomprehensible rubbish . At times his youth was made a little lonely because there did not seem to be in Hazelton any companion with whom he might talk of the things which were so bright and vital to him , or so mysterious and shadowed ; Fatty came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on behalf of the Cave Gang , to burn the schoolhouse , or violently get rid of Miss Griffiths somehow . Jack slowly shook his head , rejecting the friendly offer ; and young Wilson was visited with a clearer perception as to how things really stood . " Great snakes , Stevie , " he said , " you do n't mean to say you like being in love with Grouchy Griffiths ? " " Honest , Fatty , I do kind o ' like it , " said jack . Before the awfulness of this revelation Fatty was aghast . Words failed him . He had not suspected that such depths as these exist . To be in love with your schoolteacher is bad enough ; but to like it ! He shook his head in melancholy dejection . Poor old Stevie ! Fatty felt no superiority to jack , however ; a sense of the precariousness of human existence came to him , dimly , for the first time in  | his life ; he turned pale at the thought that he himself , even he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might be falling in love ! The fat boy , startled at this thought , felt himself all over and flexed his muscles , as one who has had a bad fall looks for serious injuries . If he felt it coming on , he determined to make a struggle against it . But he could not talk about it any more . The boys started home and they walked in silence until they came to the point where their ways diverged . " Stevie , " said Fatty as they paused , " you know that big gray flint marble of mine . You was always stuck on that big flint shooter . " " I used to be stuck on it , Fatty . " " Well , then , Stevie , I 'm going to give you that ! You can have that gosh darned marble , Stevie ! " And the fat boy , overcome by his own generosity , hastily skipped homeward , scientifically stoning all dogs , cats and chickens he got within range of , in a manly denial that such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack carved a heart on an elm tree in the yard . He cut his own initials in it , and then , greatly daring , Miss Griffiths ' initials also . But a little later he became alarmed , and went out again with his jackknife and effaced the whole design . His aunt Matilda saw him . " You 'll kill that tree , " she said , " stripping the bark from it . " And then , noticing it was an elm : " Do you chew slippery ellum bark ? " " Uh-huh , " said Jack . " Do you have a craving for it ? " " Yes ' m , " said Jack . " Humph , " said she , looking worried . She dosed him with worm medicine and then , for good measure , tied a little bag of asafetida around his neck . This smelled so badly that it made him an outcast among his fellows for days . Finally he took out the asafetida and  | put in lumps of chewing gum . His aunt Matilda discovered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been acting a lie ! " she said . For additional punishment she made him learn the Beatitudes by heart . Years later Jack remarked to a companion who commented on his knowledge of the Bible : " Know it ! I ought to know it ! I was licked through every chapter of it , a verse at a time . " As a peculiarly solemn correction she used sometimes to make him stand and look at the picture of his father , the Rev. John Knox Stevens , when he recited verses from the Bible . The picture was a crayon enlargement from a photograph , with the odd funereal grays and blacks which such pictures display . Never as long as he lived was Jack able to dissociate these ghastly crayon portraits from Bible verses . Whenever he saw one of them he began to hear a faint clatter of verses , gabbled rapidly and meaninglessly . If there was a picture of his mother about the house , he never saw it . With all her watchfulness there was a good deal of Jack 's life which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less innocent , athletic deviltry common to boys in country towns . The Cave Gang  --  Hicksie , Stonie , Fatty Wilson and Jack  --  stole watermelons , plums , apples and peaches , and now and then a chicken which they cooked and ate in their Cave , without any qualms of conscience ; they kept these activities and their Sunday-school proprieties in separate compartments of their minds . The Cave itself inspired them . To the south of the village was a strip of thick timber , a couple of miles long , and from a quarter of a mile to half a mile wide , with a creek winding through it . In a high bank of the creek , near where the stream lost itself in one of the bayous of the big swamp which began a mile or so to the southwest of the village , the boys had discovered the entrance to the Cave . Sixty years earlier it had actually been used by horse thieves who preyed on the property of the settlers . They would hide stolen horses there and on dark nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raft them down to St Louis or Cairo and sell them . Finally a posse of vigilantes bloodily rebuked  | this traffic . The Cave had been forgotten until the four boys , wading down the creek , discovered the entrance behind a jungle of hanging grapevines and wild blackberry bushes , cleaned out the sand and gravel and took it for their headquarters , keeping the secret to themselves . Naturally they played outlaws there ; summer and winter they spent all the time there they could manage to steal away from adult supervision . On one occasion they had taken Mister Splain out of the calaboose on a dark night , and guided him there , three quarters drunk , telling him he was kidnaped and held for ransom . It was easy enough to get hold of Mister . Fatty 's father was at the time mayor of the village , and the keys to the lockup were usually taken to the mayor 's house by Cy Emery , the " city marshal , " after Cy had locked up one of the village drunkards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keys more than a day or two at a time , especially in the winter , for Cy was forgetful . Once , in zero weather , Cy had locked up a tramp in the calaboose and forgotten to feed him or provide him with fire for three days , at the end of which time the man was dead . If Cy had not been such a good church member , there might have been a great deal of scandal about this in the town . When the Cave Gang guided the inebriated Mister to the cave , they found they had a white elephant on their hands . Mister was exactly suited with the life , but the boys , after a couple of days spent in purloining food and waiting on him , got tired of the game . When they informed him he was free , Mister protested : " Ai n't the old outlaw been kidnaped fair and square and legal ? Huh ? Well , then , you ca n't turn him loose like this ! I could have you boys arrested for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear any more talk of turnin ' Mister Splain loose ! Kidnaped I am , and kidnaped I stay , and I 'm a-gonna have chicken for dinner , or you boys is gon na go to the penitentiary ! " Mister had a weakness for chicken , no matter how it might be come by , second only to his weakness for alcoholic beverages . He imposed upon the boys to such an extent that they stole three or four of them for him . Mister entered into the business of being a  | captive with an immense gusto . A relish which began to seem to the boys to verge upon the sinister crept into his artless warblings . It appeared from these impromptu ballads that one of the things he had to regret in his sinful past was that , in company with Frank and Jesse James , he had participated in the complete extinction of several growing boys who had angered the outlaws by sloth in foraging for chickens . " Boozleheimers , them boys was , " said Mister Splain , using a word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good-fornothin ' boozleheimers . But at that we had n't any more ' n shot ' em before we was sorry for it  --  Frank and Jesse and Mister Splain was all sorry . " He caroled plaintively : " Mister Splain , he was an outlaw , With Frank and Jesse James ! But he weeped when he slew them boozleheimers ? O-oh , Mister Spla-a-in ! " Finally the Cave Gang deserted him and Mister returned to his room above the hardware store . But for two or three weeks afterward the members of the Cave Gang were a bit uneasy as to whether he might report them to their elders  --  not in revenge for having kidnaped him , but in revenge for having liberated him . Mister would have liked to spend the summer as a prisoner . Jack 's aunt forbade him to be out nights ? " running around with trash , " as she put it . But she went to bed early , and he had no difficulty getting out of his window at the back of the house and reaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and not much trouble getting in again a couple of hours later the same way . He and the rest of the Cave Gang were therefore generally in on charivari parties , Hallowe'en depredations and the like . He had the usual number of schoolboy fights , but this was not because he was quarrelsome or unusually combative . He fought a good many times when he did n't want to fight at all . Whenever he became emotionally excited , it was difficult for him to keep from crying ; and when he felt himself about to cry , he fought at once for fear the tears would be mistaken for cowardice . He was  | not a tough kid nor a rowdy , but he was active , full of life , and tall and strong for his age , and he conformed to the accepted juvenile hoodlumism of the place and time just as he conformed to the sentiment with regard to the churches . When he was detected by his aunt Matilda , he took his licking philosophically , as a part of the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . " She hammered him a good deal . She kept on hammering him after he had become so big and strong and she had begun to grow so feeble that it ceased to hurt him at all , and he let her do it for a while . He knew that in her own strange way she loved him , and he knew that she thought it her duty to whip him . She loved him , and she would make sacrifices for him , and he knew it , but he could not find in himself any spontaneous affection for her at all . One day , when he was about fourteen , he suddenly turned and took the whip away from her , and caught her hands and held them firmly . She found herself helpless . " You 've got to quit this , Aunt Matilda , " he said . " It gets you all excited , and you 'll be having another one of those spells with your heart . " The old lady collapsed , so that he had to hold her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do want you to be good . " He knew it was true ; that that was what it was all about . He helped her to her bed and made her lie down . She tried to kiss him , and he dodged instinctively , and got a damp peck on the ear which was repulsive to him . He wished that he might have kissed her , for he knew that was what she wanted , but he could n't make himself . He went out and left her , without looking back at her , for he knew she was crying . Her tongue-lashings did not cease , but she never tried to whip him again or to kiss him again . Miss Griffiths was succeeded in Jack 's affections by a lady who played the part of Little Eva in a traveling Uncle Tom 's Cabin show . It was a tent show and it stopped in Hazelton for three days ? long enough for Jack to learn that Little Eva was happily married  | to the man who played Simon Legree , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black hands on the plantation and occasionally helped bark when the bloodhounds were not loud enough . With these discoveries Jack 's passion drooped and withered in his bosom . After Little Eva there were half a dozen more of these sudden , transient puppy loves . He could look at the picture of a girl in a magazine illustration and fall in love with her , and endow her with the most extraordinary qualities .  | PUBERTY overtook Jack rather early ; his sexual imagination was awakened and given a definite turn before he was fourteen . There was a pretty , lively , red-lipped little hussy of seventeen who had been taken by his aunt Matilda to help with her housework and learn the dressmaking trade , who began deliberately to trouble and inflame the boy . This girl 's name was Cherry Salters , and Cherry was born to harlotry as the sparks fly upward . There used to be a great deal of discussion as to why girls " went wrong , " in the decades before so many young women of the current era laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil they meant , anyhow , by " wrong . " But there need never at any time have been any question or investigation or theory concerning Cherry Salters . The fact was that Cherry gave herself up joyously , eagerly , frequently , promiscuously , delightedly , to sexual adventures because she cared more for them than for anything else on earth . No man ever seduced Cherry ; she began trying to seduce men and boys instinctively at an age so early that it might sound incredible if it were set down . A certain contemporary scientific jargon might excuse her by saying that she was " oversexed " ; but Cherry herself never felt the need of excuse or apology or justification . Harlot and strumpet and prostitute are scarcely the words for her ; they sound sordid and commercial , and Cherry , at the outset of her career , was anything but mercenary . She became a paid whore later , but at first there was a kind of innocence in Cherry 's unconventionality ; she had no theories about her life , or about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she obeyed her controlling impulses as simply and happily as a nymph .  | And the creature managed to remain for years one of the most innocent-looking things alive . Her eyes were of a deep , sweet violet color ; the color of a violet drenched in a dewy purity . Her hair was golden ; the kind of hair that painters used to love to give to saints and angels and madonnas ; the hair that goes traditionally with the heroines of folklore . She was slenderly round and graceful and voluptuous . Wholly conscious of her desires , she was but half conscious of her own arts which made her desirable to men , practicing them instinctively . Naturally Aunt Matilda had no idea of the sort of person she had taken into her home . Nobody knew about Cherry yet , except five or six young men of the village , although rumors were beginning to spread beyond this favored group . Cherry was at the outset of her public career at this time . Jack , because of her beauty , was beginning to fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabolical idea came to Cherry of exciting him  --  or scarcely the idea , since Cherry did not really have ideas ; say , rather , the idle , primitive , animal instinct . There was a steep and narrow back staircase in the house which Aunt Matilda and Jack inhabited . It ascended from the kitchen to the upstairs hallway . The plan of the house was simple . At the front , on the ground floor , were two rooms , separated by a hallway . They had once been a " parlor " and a downstairs bedroom , but both these front rooms downstairs were now taken up by Aunt hlatilda 's dressmaking and millinery business . The " front stairs " led from the downstairs entrance hall to the " upstairs hall , " and there were four bedrooms opening off the upstairs hall . Back of the rooms on the ground floor which were devoted to business purposes was the dining room , the largest room in the house , and used by Aunt Matilda not only as her dining room but as a general living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pantry . Cherry was up and down the narrow back stairs , from the kitchen to the second floor , a dozen times a day , and always at a lively gait . One morning , as Jack emerged from his own room ,  | Cherry , bounding up the back stairs , breathless and laughing , bumped into the boy . " Those stairs , " she panted , " certainly do get my breath  --  feel my heart jump ! " She took the boy 's hand and placed it in her bosom and held it there . She looked at him with her deep violet eyes , and breathed upon him with her moist red lips parted , and leaned against him , careful that he should feel her weight and warmth and the pulsations of her body . Jack had known vague , groping desires before ; but he had never thought consciously of a woman 's breasts . " Why , " said she after a moment , smiling at him and pushing him away from her , " you 're panting yourself  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was choking and his pulses were beginning to throb ; he knew why  --  and yet he did not quite know , either . " What makes you act so funny ? " said Cherry . And then the little demon caught the boy to her again and kissed him , pressing him to her body . No one had ever kissed him like that before , or told him about kisses like that ; nor had he imagined such kisses . Cherry laughed at him again and scurried into her own room , and left the door ajar . He stood trembling in the hall ; he leaned up against the wall and shivered and choked , unable to take himself away from that vicinity , staring at her door . Presently she appeared in the doorway with the waist of her dress off , her breast and shoulders nude , stuck out her darting red tongue at him and closed her door . After a while the boy got hold of himself and went away ; but this was only the first of many similar persecutions which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years later she paid dearly for her folly . She " came by it honestly , " as the saying was in Hazelton . Her father was a fool . A most flamboyant , dangerous fool was Clem Salters , her father ; and he had the same wide-gazing , long-lashed , beautiful eyes as his daughter , except that Clem 's eyes were of a grayish-blue color  | rather than the deep violet . Clem was a drunkard , a liar , a thief , a braggart and a rowdy ; a dangerous barroom fighter and a crook to the core of his childish , foolish heart . He was capable of extravagant generosities , capable of any bravery , capable of any lie or pretense , capable of anything , good or bad , which was calculated to attract attention to himself ; altogether egoistic and ingenuously amoral . Clem was a veteran of the Civil War , from which he had emerged at the age of twenty-five ; which is to say that as the nineties of the last century waned he was approaching sixty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of Pickett 's men who reached as far as that fatal fence where the Confederacy received its death wound , had stood up to each other in a berserk ecstasy of battle and thrust each other through again and again with their bayonets until both fell , apparently dead . But Salters had lived ; had even returned to the war to be wounded again in its last year . And later , in the Far West , Clem , with two pistol bullets in him , had reached and slain an authentic bad man with a hunting knife . He had returned to Hazelton from the West in his forties , bringing with him , from a dance hall in a Western mining camp , the handsome woman who had been Cherry 's mother , and had settled on his inherited farm at the edge of town . Since then Clem 's life had been simplicity itself . He never did any farming or made any attempt to keep his place up . When he wanted money he mortgaged ten acres or twenty acres and lived on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died when Cherry was a baby ; by the time Cherry had gone to work for Aunt Matilda there was nothing left to Clem of his patrimony except fifteen or twenty acres immediately surrounding the old farmhouse . The house itself had become so dilapidated that it was almost uninhabitable , and Cherry was glad of the privilege of living with Aunt Matilda , where she worked . Clem camped happily enough in the disintegrating ruin , and now and then he made a trip into a strange region to the west of Hazelton and came back with a strange woman who would serve him as  | mistress and housekeeper for a few weeks or months until he got tired of her . This strange region was known simply as the Swamp ; it has all but vanished now , drained away to uncover farming land . But at that time it was seventy or eighty miles in length , and anywhere from ten to twenty-five miles broad . In wet weather it was almost a lake , with wooded hummocks , wooded islands , swales and ridges of high land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshes , ponds , bayous , creeks , sloughs , matted with reeds and cattails and water lilies and rank slough grass , alternated with stretches of plain and ridge , and muddy roads wound through it . One or two little hamlets , many miles from any railroad , were in this swamp ; and there were several families of backward people ? " white trash " ? in the middle of it , living on the islands and ridges . These people were known as " Swamp Angels " to the inhabitants of such towns as Hazelton on the edges of the marsh area . These villages , and the farms all about , were inhabited by a tame , quiet , flat sort of conventional people , for the most part ; for generations they had been tame and quiet and proper . But the Swamp was wild at its heart ; wolves were still found there in Jack 's youth , and the Swamp Angels were nearly a century behind the villagers in enlightenment and civilization . They were the descendants of some trashier caravan of Westward-trekking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early days , and who had stuck there in the mud ever since , strangely unrelated to the prim communities round about . Clem Salters spent a good deal of his time hunting and fishing and trapping in the Swamp ; and , as has been said , it was there he would go and hale forth a temporary mistress from time to time ? some persons said actually with force and threats if necessary  --  and fling the jade back into her native mud again when he was through with her . Clem was a great patriot in his barroom conversations ; a great defender of the home ; a knight for virtue ; a man of impeccable honor ; a violent Republican . One of his favorite amusements was  | getting into altercations with Democrats in Tom Meek 's saloon and hitting them with heavy glass beer schooners , simply because they were Democrats . In a rough , individual sort of way Clem was a jaunty dresser ; he affected a G.A.R. hat at all seasons , and he wore it rakishly . One of his favorite remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Acquaintances said that Clem might just as well as not go to hell for a friend , as he was going that way himself anyhow , and anything he might be able to do for the friend would n't take him out of his road . He never went to church , but he considered himself a militant champion of the Protestant orthodoxy . One time Jim Shale , slightly under the influence of liquor in Tom Meek 's place , hinted his skepticism so clearly that Clem Salters understood his drift . Clem cocked his hat and scowled at Jim , and then he held out his right hand . " You see that hand ? " " Uh-huh , " said Jim , who was easily intimidated and wished that he had kept his mouth shut . " You see the thumb on that hand ? " said Clem , sticking it out at a right angle and moving it stiffly . " Uh-huh , " said Jim , backing away . Tom Meek and Mister Splain and everyone in the barroom gazed fascinated upon Clem 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar , " once gouged the eyes out of an infidel . He was one of these here la-de-dah college professors , and me and him got into an argument in the barroom of the Palmer House in Chicago . He said mankind was descended off of these here Darwin monkeys and apes . " There was a strained silence , while Salters relaxed his thumb and poured himself a drink . " You got no ideas of that kind , about monkeys , have you ? " continued the bully presently . " Course not , Clem , " said Jim Shale . " I 'm damn glad of it , " said Clem , " for your sake . " Jim got away as quickly as he could .  | One of Clem 's favorite themes was the virtue of American young womanhood . " If any man , " he used to say to the crowded barroom , " was ever to offer a word of insult to , or lay a disrespectful hand upon , that little golden-haired girl of mine , down would come the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Tom Meek was almost the only person who was not afraid of Clem , among his habitual associates . Tom had repeatedly stricken him with bottles and bung starters , in the interests of peace and order . They never kept any resentment toward each other after their collisions . Tom used to say to him plaintively now and then : " Now then , Clem , you 've went and made me give you a black eye again ! And how does it look  --  people comin ' out of my place with a black eye ? Huh ? That 's the kind of a thing , that black eye , that gives liquor a bad name . What the hell you want to make me give you a black eye for ? Huh ? " The church and the barroom seem always to have needed each other in the small American community . Secretly , mystically , instinctively , they have both felt it , while refusing to acknowledge it . Ormuzd and Ahriman , Jehovah and Satan , Jesus and Judas , have not been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dualism of the universe , the strophe and antistrophe of choric planets and suns , the violet dramas of light and darkness , the clash between cosmos and chaos , good and evil , have been quaintly and conveniently objectified for several generations by the struggle between the church and the saloon ; a struggle which ( lid not end but merely put forth new phases during the era of national prohibition . It is one of our genuinely American struggles ; neither the English public house nor the French nor Italian wineshop , nor the German beer garden , has had centered upon it any such fervid animosity on the part of the militantly religious people as the American saloon has enjoyed . For enjoyment is the word . In Hazelton , and many other such villages , the barroom never made much pretense of being a place of innocent gaiety . A sink of iniquity it was called , and the barroom  | habitues accepted the designation and rejoiced in it . They took a hangdog delight in being wicked ; in being called wicked and thought wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a drink of whisky or a glass of beer , as he might have gone into the lunchroom for a cup of coffee and come away again thinking nothing of it . The village drinker knew he was watched ; he drank stealthily or defiantly . As he became a drunkard  --  and many country-town drinkers became drunkards simply because the pressure of public opinion molded them into that shape  --  he drank more and more defiantly ; he drank to rebuke the flagrant righteousness of his adversaries . Liquor was self-conscious in Hazelton and the towns like it long before it became nationally self-conscious in America . The Hazelton saloon always took a certain pleasure in its own disrepute ; it was low , it was tough , it was rowdy , it was trashy , it was an evil influence , it trafficked consciously with sin and Satan .. A young man , of the respectable element , could find a thrilling moment ( after having been crossed in love or having quarreled with his parents ) in walking publicly into the Hazelton barroom and drinking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A husband who felt himself oppressed or henpecked could assert himself in the same way ; or a laboring man consciously suffering from economic injustice . The respectable element was strong enough numerically so that it might , at any time , have wiped out the barroom entirely . But it never did . Subtly , obscurely , powerfully , subconsciously , church and barroom , in the communities which still quivered internally with a scarcely mitigated puritanism , complemented and responded to each other . Each felt the other as a place of refuge and escape from itself ; each needed the other in order to keep life from being too utterly commonplace . In many individuals there was the unrecognized need of both . Mister Splain was one of the few who openly avowed his need of both . Puritanism has always been unable to exist without an Adversary , an Enemy  --  the Church of Rome , the Church of England , Apollyon , witches , Negro slavery ( in the North ) , Negro equality ( in the  | South ) , the barroom , the bootlegger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drake smashed the jaw of Spain ; sometimes it is petty , as when it persecutes a country schoolmaster for teaching the Darwinian theory of evolution ; but always it needs a Foe . It carries in its bowels a kind of fire which demands combat ( and this was also true of the god Baal , making him at times a very unpleasant neighbor ) . The Orthodox Jew and the typical Yankee puritan are strangely alike in this one thing : they need , in order to be actively happy , an enemy to send their warrior Jehovah forth against . Neither the young liberal , intellectual Jew nor the young liberal , intellectual Yankee is ever very happy . In an odd way the churches of puritanism , the righteous , keep a fast hold upon their own outcasts , their own black sheep and goats , their barflies and rowdies and disreputables . The iniquitous of their own clan they may condemn , excommunicate , war against , persecute ; but they keep their hands upon them , too , and use them in their wars against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ku Klux Klan upon occasion employed as avenging angels to carry out the avowed ethics of the Klan . The immorals , the outcasts , the thugs , the recognized desperadoes , are occasionally entrusted with the enforcement of the moral law . There is always this mystic unity between bad and good in every system of theology ; they seem unable to do without each other . There was in Illinois at this time , as in several other states , a local option law ; that is to say , each community could vote as to whether it wanted a barroom or not . In Hazelton , one year the town went wet , the next it went dry , with unfailing regularity . As soon as the town went dry , the barroom closed , as such , and became a restaurant . Nearly as much liquor was sold in the place when it was called a restaurant as when it was called a saloon , and almost as openly . In the " dry " years the two drugstores sold more liquor , usually disguised as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the " wet " years . On either side the barroom was a " billiard and pool parlor " ; and these billiard rooms were felt by certain of the ultra-respectables to be almost as disreputable as the saloon itself  --  almost but not  | quite . Church members in good standing might play pool or billiards occasionally without a rebuke ; but not too often . And it was felt that the billiard rooms were no places for growing boys of the better element to be hanging about ; they were too near the saloon ; their tone was too much that of the saloon . It was felt that they were , in a way , " feeders " for the saloon . The boy who hung about the billiard room this year might be hanging about the saloon itself next year . Some of the church people openly accused the proprietors of the billiard rooms of maintaining them as traps in which to catch the unwary and innocent and prepare them for corruption . This was always bitterly denied . The billiard room did not feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Clem Salters was still proclaiming to the admiring barroom what he would do to any black villain who offered a word of insult to " that little golden-haired girl of mine " when it was discovered that Cherry was pregnant .  | CHERRY had not been feeling very well , and Aunt Matilda had called in Dr William Young to see her . Dr Young was a member of the Hill Church , not of Aunt Matilda 's own White Church ; but , still , he was a church member . Dr Stuart was more and more losing the business of the stricter sort of church people in Hazelton . Not that they held a caucus on the matter and officially passed the word to boycott Dr Stuart . No such overt action was necessary ; things got about without much being said directly . Dr Young , after he had seen and examined Cherry , looked at her with a regard something between quizzicality and cynicism and said : " Humph ! " He did not tell Cherry herself what was the matter with her ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken . Cherry 's mentality  --  what she had of it  --  had never taken into account any thought of consequences ; she was an unreflecting little rip . " Engaged to be married ? " Dr Young asked her . " Huh-uh , " said Cherry with a negative shake of her head . " Better go and get engaged , " said Dr Young . And then , being acquainted with Clem Salters , he gave half humorously and half seriously this further bit of advice : " Tell your dad the man you want to marry right away , and have him get the wedding fixed up . " With that he left Cherry  --  who began now to understand what he meant  --  in the dining room and stepped into the shop part of the house to apprise Aunt Matilda of the situation . Aunt Matilda was alone in the shop . Dr Young , being anxious to get this embarrassing disclosure over with as soon as possible , came to the point directly . " The girl 's going to have a baby , Miss Stevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room .  | Aunt Matilda dropped the hat frame she was working on and looked up with her mouth and eyes opened to their widest capacity . She gasped . She was honestly astonished at the information . " I 'm afraid there 's no doubt about it , " said Dr Young . " I 've told her she ought to get married as soon as she can . " And with that he bowed himself out and was down the street halfway to the corner in a moment , expressly disclaiming by his manner that his interest in the affair could possibly extend beyond this present diagnosis . Presently Aunt Matilda 's jaws came together again , and she picked up the hat frame and shifted her rocking chair until she faced the partially closed door that gave into the dining room . She stared at that door , on the other side of which was Cherry Salters . And in the dining room sat Cherry Salters , also staring at the door , on the other side of which was Miss Matilda Stevens . Aunt Matilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at herself . She should have known better than to take Clem Salters ' daughter into her house ! Trash ! But the girl had been pretty and good-natured and willing , and Aunt Matilda had liked her . Who could have suspected this of her ? She always went to Sunday school , and recently , at Aunt Matilda 's suggestion , she had actually become a member of the White Church . Aunt Matilda had never heard of anything wrong about her before . And now  --  the inconvenience , the annoyance , the criticism , the disgrace , which she had brought into the house ! And the man  --  who was the man ? Aunt Matilda 's impulse was to walk into the ( lining room and grasp the girl by the shoulders and shake her half to death . But she made no move . She sat and frowned at the door . " I 'm going to catch the dickens in a minute , " Cherry said to herself . " Old Miss Stevens is going to come right through that door in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to get a little scared . She knew that having a baby was a dreadfully painful sort of experience , and she wondered when she could expect to have hers . " Who can the man be ? " Aunt Matilda continued to wonder , and  | she looked at the door as if she expected that Cherry might fling it open and answer the question . Cherry , at this same instant , began to wonder the same thing ? who the father might be . But it was idle to pursue that line of speculation . She had no way of telling . She had several admirers . Suddenly Aunt Matilda wondered what it would be like to be young and expecting a baby . Hard and rigid and puritanical as she was in many ways , the inexperienced old spinster had more of the maternal imagination in her nature than the young strumpet . No matter how many children Cherry might have , they would never any of them be other than unwelcome accidents to her ; the nature of the nymph was so strong in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope Pa do n't go on the rampage , " said Cherry to herself , her elbows on the dining-room table and her chin in her hands , as she continued to gaze at the door with those beautiful , wide , violet eyes of hers . She had often wondered if her father knew of her way of life . She could not tell , just as Henry Gage was unable to tell whether his wife knew of his affairs with women . Cherry had thought several times that her father must know . One of her young men , a clerk in a drygoods store , had given her half a dozen pairs of silk stockings and untold quantities of hair ribbon . And there had been numerous other gifts . Clem had scowled at them and commented on them , and some of them he had calmly appropriated and presented to various of his Swamp Angels . He had never taken any pains to conceal from her the character of his relations with these women . Cherry appraised at its real value all her father 's sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never possessed at any time any genuinely protective feeling concerning his " little golden-haired angel . " At the same time she thought it possible that he might imagine it was a proper time for him to become violent .  | It would all be public property soon enough , Aunt Matilda reflected . And how her enemies would gloat ! How the gossips would reflect on herself ! As a gossip herself , she knew just what would be said . How the Hill Church would crow over the White Church ! She must get into touch with her own church people at once . This must be made a church matter from the beginning ; she must have the moral support of her own clan . It must be investigated as a church matter , faced as a church matter , somehow disposed of as a church matter . The church people  --  her own church people ? must find out who the man was ; and all the implications involved in his identity must be appraised and dealt with before the affair became quite public . She wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hill Church ; Dr Stuart would have been better ; all this was ammunition for the Hill Church . But the first thing to do was to find out the man . Angry as she was at the girl , Aunt Matilda still somewhat pitied Cherry , as well as condemning her . For she did not as yet realize Cherry , as Cherry was . She thought of Cherry as an inexperienced young thing who had been seduced . Seduced while living in her house , while under her protection ! Aunt Matilda rose , pushing her chair back . It scraped along the floor . There was an answering scrape from the dining room . Cherry had also risen . Aunt Matilda pushed the dining-room door wide open , and the two women confronted each other  --  the arid vestal of Midwestern puritanism and the dewy wanton with her wide eyes  --  and there was a moment of deep , mutually fearful scrutiny before either spoke ; for each was afraid of the other . In spite of her selfrighteousness , and her stern principles , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinner had penetrated more deeply into the mysteries of existence than herself ; and the  | thing which she obscurely feared was an assertion of the girl 's superior vitality pointed and leveled like a rebuke at her own sterility . She feared the mystic , derisive laughter of the unborn child stirring in the girl 's body , for she would never have a child herself . She did not phrase these fears to herself ; but they were there . Cherry 's fear was much simpler . She had no thought of her baby nor any realization of herself . Her fear was as simple and almost as animal as that of a sneaking little Maltese cat which has finally been caught with its head in the cream pitcher . " Cherry , " said Aunt Matilda , " who is the man ? " " I du n no as I ought to say , Miss Stevens , " said Cherry , hanging her head . She did n't see any use in telling Miss Stevens that she had n't the slightest idea . " You must tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger escape  --  for all her other emotions and reflections were underlaid with anger . " Do n't you know that the man who got you into this trouble can be sent to prison for what he 's done ? " " To the calaboose ? " asked Cherry , whose ideas of prisons were limited to the local little one-room jail in the village where tramps and drunkards were sometimes locked up . She suddenly thought of all seven or eight of the possible fathers of her child shut up at once in this small place , and giggled . " To the state penitentiary ! " said Aunt Matilda , flushing at the giggle . " You must tell me who it is , whether you want to or not . " " I do n't see as it would do any good , " said Cherry a little sullenly , " for anybody to go to the penitentiary . Besides , Doctor Young said I ought to marry him . How am I goin ' to marry him if he 's in the state penitentiary ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Aunt Matilda firmly . " The minister and the leading members will decide what is to be done about it  --  and whether the law is to be called in or not . You could go to jail yourself , if we do n't keep you out . Do you know that ? You are a member of the White Church , and you must tell Mr Hamlin and the leading members everything . This after-noon ! "  | Cherry stood and fumbled with her apron strings . " I du n no , " she said finally , " as the church has got anything to do with it . " But when Aunt Matilda reaffirmed that it must be a church matter , Cherry ceased to object . She was uncertain as to her rights . But she was as well aware as Aunt Matilda that , ultimately and effectually , the churches ruled the place . She was familiar with the fact that meetings of prominent church people occasionally sat in judgment on the actions of members of the congregation , independently of the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Church might bring her within their jurisdiction . She was n't sure . She did not , in any event , know how to dodge it , unless she walked out of Aunt Matilda 's house and appealed to her father . And this she did not want to do , for she was afraid that he would make trouble of some sort . The telephone was not in general use in towns such as Hazelton in those days . When Jack came home from school at noon he was sent trotting about town with notes . He did n't go back to school in the afternoon ; he made a feint of it , walked around the block , got into the house , unnoticed , by the back door , stole up the back stairs quietly and waited in his room . His curiosity had been aroused . He intended , if possible , to find out what sort of church meeting this was that he had been sent to summon . He had gathered that it had something to do with Cherry . And his interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had but recently overheard one of the older boys make a remark about Cherry which had enlightened him concerning her . He had comprehended that while she merely troubled and perturbed himself , for her own diabolical amusement , there was something much more serious going on between her and several of the young men . So , at three o'clock that afternoon , when the conclave met in Aunt Matilda 's dining room , Jack was sitting halfway up the back stairs . His shoes were off , so that they would n't scrape on the steps and betray his presence , and so that if he were forced to make a sudden retreat he could do it without a clatter . He was listening so intently that he was practically one big ear . The level of the kitchen was some three steps lower than that of  | the dining room , and the door between the two rooms was commonly left open , and hooked back against the wall so that it would stay open . Jack hoped that no one would think of shutting it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , he felt pretty safe . The door between the shop and the dining room was closed and locked . It was a warm autumn afternoon . The dining-room windows were open , and the kitchen windows were open ; and the door into the kitchen would probably be left open , too , for the sake of air . There was no door at the foot of the stairway on which he sat ; the stairway began abruptly with a rectangular hole in the kitchen wall . From where he huddled with his shoes in his hands he could hear everything , although he could see nothing . Aunt Matilda had put all the spare leaves into the extension table in the dining room , and Cherry sat at one end of it . At the middle of it Aunt Matilda had placed the huge old illustrated Bible from which Jack had once derived his infantile notion that God was bald-headed . Nobody knew for what specific purpose the big Bible was there , but everybody acquiesced in its being there . In a way it presided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was intimidated . She was too careless , too courageous and too foolish , fundamentally , to be very greatly frightened ; but as her judges and captors seated themselves about the table on which reposed the big leather-bound book with its brass clasps , she perceived that she was in for something too uncomfortable to giggle about . She began to feel rather important , too . Like her father , she enjoyed attracting attention . Three church deacons had been notified : Henry Gage , the banker , Winfield Scott Renfrew , the editor of the Banner , and Mr Daniel Baxter , the village undertaker . Of Mr Baxter little more need be said now , or at any other time , than that he was too deaf to hear anything that was going on , too nearly blind to see anything clearly and too dull to understand ; he appeared to pass his life in  | semisomnolence waiting for one of his own coffins to catch up with him , and at the end of the present examination of Cherry he startled everyone else by remarking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look to me like she 'd steal spoons ! " The Rev. Mr Hamlin and his meek and silly wife were the first arrivals . Then came Mr Renfrew , looking preternaturally solemn , and Miss Emmeline Paisely , looking frightened . Miss Paisely had been gradually attaining in Hazelton the reputation of being " sanctified " ? a condition difficult to explain unless the reader has lived in a country town and known some widow or maiden lady ( always dressed in dusty black ) of whom this " sanctification " has been reported . The final arrival was Mrs Henry Gage , who came with the information that her husband , because of important business , would not be able to be present . Everyone was relieved at this . Especially Mr Hamlin . All these people ( with the possible exception of his wife ) were really aware that Mr Gage had affairs with women ; but they all pretended to themselves that they did not know it . Mr Gage paid half the preacher 's salary out of his own pocket and was glad to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , sincerely , his need of the church ; he needed the church as much as  --  even more than , he sometimes thought  --  he needed women . But Mr Gage had no disposition to act as one of the judges at the trial of any woman taken in adultery . Mr Hamlin started the proceedings with a prayer for guidance , and he petitioned likewise for the divine grace to descend upon the spirit of their errant young sister . He genuinely pitied the girl and so did his wife . The eloquent and slightly nasal prayer floated out into the kitchen and up the back stairs . Jack , through force of his churchgoing habit , bowed his head when the prayer began . And then he raised his head again , startled . He had heard a light step at the top of the stairs , behind and above him .  | He looked up , and there stood Miriam Hamlin , the preacher 's daughter . She had followed her father and mother to Aunt Matilda 's house with a message from a neighbor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the conclave was gathering , and she had perceived that a meeting of great importance must be forward . One glance at Cherry Salters , palpably a captive , and this girl Miriam had divined everything . How she had divined it , it would be impossible to say . Mirian Hamlin was now twenty years old , and neither her father nor her mother had ever told her anything about the actualities of existence . No one else ever had . She was incredibly ignorant . She was curious . But she had always striven valiantly to suppress even her curiosity . Nevertheless , one moment of the atmosphere of Aunt Matilda 's dining room , and this girl who knew nothing perceived that everything she had wondered over was about to be discussed . She was a girl full of small , internal , ineffective revolts against her life and the town , and one of them seized her now ; she left the dining room determined to know . She passed through the shop , but not to the street . She knew the lie of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole up the front stairway to the upper hall , intent on the same plan of eavesdropping by the way of the back stairs that had occurred to Jack . If she had thought of Jack at all , she would have thought of him as being at school . She drew back , flushing and flustered , as Jack looked up at her . She was on the point of flight . " S-sh , " warned Jack in a light whisper . And then , holding up his own shoes , he pointed to hers . The handsome , shabby girl looked at him , frowning and flushing and paling , for a moment or two . Then , with a sudden access of resolution , she sat down and took off her own shoes and , holding them in her lap , sat on the steps just above Jack . At first , as the inquiry got under way , Cherry was inclined to flare up occasionally , with brief spurts of defiance . Later she grew more and more interested in herself , responding to the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherry had never thought of herself or her activities as being so important before ;  | she began to derive a certain gratification from the sensation she produced . " Who is the man ? " Cherry replied to Mr Hamlin as she had previously to Aunt Matilda . " I du n no as I ought to say . " Driven from that position , she finally answered . " I du n no as you could exactly say it was a man . It was one of the boys . " " What boy ? " " Well , " said Cherry , " one of the big boys . " " What big boy ? " Cherry was silent as long as she dared to be . Not from any wish to protect any particular youth , as her examiners believed , but because she honestly did not know how to answer . Finally she said , referring specifically to the parenthood of her child : " Well , maybe it was one of the big boys , and maybe it was another one of the big boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the court of inquiry perceived from this reply that Cherry 's condition could not be the result of a single offense  --  of a First False Step , as the saying was . " Do you mean , " said Mr Renfrew , frowning heavily , " that you are not sure that . . . that ... " He paused . " Do you mean that there was more than one sin committed ? " said Mrs Hamlin . " Uh-huh , " said Cherry , nodding her head affirmatively . This was worse than anyone had expected . Miss Emmeline Paisely caught at the white ruching above her high blackcollar and seemed to be trying to faint , but not quite able to  --  just as a martyr , burning at the stake , might wish to die instantaneously in the flames without being able to accomplish it . Still , Miss Paisely did not leave the room . " With whom was the first sin committed ? " asked Mr Hamlin . " Well , " said Cherry , " do you mean the first sin about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All this thing about the " first sin " bored and puzzled her . What difference did that make , anyhow ?  | " Who was the person , Sister , " said Mr Hamlin gently , " who first wronged you by leading your feet from the strait and narrow path of virtuous womanhood ? " " As near as I can recollect , " said Cherry , " it was two or three years ago . And I do n't just exactly remember what boy , Mr Hamlin . There were two or three boys there . " " Where ? " The whole table was now quivering with curiosity . " At the picnic , " said Cherry . She pouted and frowned , trying to recall the details . " It was a Sunday-school picnic , " she went on without any appreciation of the mental devastation she was causing . " One of our  --  one of the White Church 's . You folks must all remember it ? you were all there . It was that time we all went in hay wagons over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games there all one Saturday . Why , Mr Renfrew , I rode in the wagon you drove  --  you must remember that picnic ! " Looks of horror were exchanged all about the table . So this child 's downfall had come about at a White Church Sunday-school picnic ! That would be a fine thing for the Hill Church to get hold of  --  or the heathen in outer darkness ! And yet none of them doubted he truth of her assertion . Cherry perceived something of the effect she was having ; she was not intelligent , but she had her own kind of cunning . Something told her that , somehow , her narrative was turning the tables on her inquisitors . She paused and looked around . " You folks want me to go on and tell you all about it ? " she said . " Yes , " said Mr Hamlin . He tried to be a just man . If this thing was going to hit any of his congregation  --  well , it would have to hit ! Truth was what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but a trifle faintly . He did n't like to think of a big church rumpus looming up ahead of him , with the necessity of admonishing , scoring , condemning , several of his own congregation . But he was devoted to duty ; he wanted to be honest and sincere ; he frequently prayed to have the courage to do what he thought of as being God 's Work . " Go on , " said Mr Hamlin.  | Cherry considered , seemed to meditate and assort her recollections . She was now entirely at her ease . " It was this way , " she said with a reminiscent smile . " After we all had our lunch I went off through the thick woods with some of the other kids , pickin ' flowers  --  girls , they all was . And we come to the bank of the crick that winds through the grove , and I took off my shoes and stockin 's and went wadin ' in the water . None of the rest of the kids seemed to want to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and they was all way out of sight and hearin ' . " And it was nice in there , in the water , all alone , with the sunshine comin ' through the trees , and ferns all along the crick banks , and minnows swimmin ' past my legs , and the soft sand comin ' up kind of squidgy-like between my toes , and I guess I must ' a ' waded along for quite a spell , sort of talkin ' to myself , and got further away from the rest of the folks than I figgered on . " And pretty soon I heard some boys laughin ' and splashin ' somewheres , and come around a bend in the crick and there was three kids in swimmin ' in a swimmin ' hole , gallopin ' and divin ' and splashin ' water onto each other . They was so busy havin ' a good time they did n't see me at first , and just for fun I slipped out of the crick and up onto the bank behind a tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clothes into hard , wet knots , so as they 'd have to chaw raw beef before they could dress . " She paused and giggled again . Windy Renfrew put his hand suddenly to his mouth and coughed . The simple narrative had suddenly reminded Windy of a most amusing episode of his own youth ; and he was really suppressing an answering giggle that had taken him by surprise . Miss Emmeline Paisely kept her gaze fastened desperately upon the Bible , as if for support ; she had never been in swimming in a creek or lake in her life ; she felt that something terrible was coming ; the solid brass clasps of the big book seemed somehow to promise her defense from the world 's facile heathenism . " I got both hands full of mud and clods , " Cherry went on , " and I clodded ' em and mudded ' em from the bushes before they knew  | I was there , and then they saw me and tried to splash water onto me . And then I set down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled things at me . " " What did they yell ? " It was Mrs Henry Gage who sought this detail . " They yelled , Ticky-ticky Tom Boy , half girl and half boy ! ' " said Cherry . " And pretty soon one of them yelled at me , Hang your clothes on a hick'ry limb and do n't go near the water : " " Oh , " said Mrs Gage . She was sitting next to Mr Baxter , the undertaker . She withdrew her gaze from Cherry and performed a service for Mr Baxter . She brushed a fly from his eyelid . It had been crawling there , and the sight of it had been worrying Mrs Gage . It had not worried Mr Baxter at all ; he was not altogether asleep , and yet he seemed to have no sense that the fly was on his eyelid  --  it was as if , at that moment , his coffin was ever nearer than usual to Mr Baxter . Mrs Gage looked from Mr Baxter around on the rest of her fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was much better qualified than Mr Baxter to sit as critic upon this bucolic romance which was being so naively narrated to them . She was a woman who craved romance herself , but she never gave any outward signs of it . Perhaps if she ever did become quite sure  --  absolutely certain  --  that Henry Gage was taking to other women the romance and passion which rightfully belonged to herself , she would be capable of raising merry hell with Henry Gage . " Why , " said Aunt Matilda severely , " did you stay there  --  where those boys were with their clothes off ? " " I was kinda havin ' fun , Miss Stevens , " said Cherry . She added : " They was mostly under water anyhow  --  at first . " There was another pause . It was Mr Hamlin who finally said : " Well ? " " Well , " said Cherry , " pretty soon I went in swimmin ' too . " " You mean you  --  you took off your own clothes ? You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Aunt Matilda . " There was n't anyone else around but the boys and me , " said  | Cherry , " and they dared and double-dared me to ! And pretty soon we got to runnin ' foot races on the bank of the crick , and then we all got to wrasslin ' with each other , and then we chased each other through the trees ... " There were two or three of the people who heard her who were capable of guessing that they were listening to a purely pagan idyll : Mrs Gage and Jack  --  and Miriam Hamlin , who sat out of sight on the stairway , her face pale and still , her lips parted , gazing straight before her , looking into a world the very existence of which had always been concealed from her before . But what could Aunt Matilda , or Emmeline Paisely , or Mr and Mrs Hamlin , or Windy Renfrew ( to say nothing of the more than half defunct Mr Baxter ) think except that they were hearing a narrative of shameless wickedness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees and thickets , dappled with sun and stained with trodden grass and clutched at by jealous vines , pursuing their golden nymph  --  this was a theme and a tune that Cherry 's judges might never hear or never understand . The primitive Jewish poets and theologians had put sin and snakes in their Edens , and the puritan inheritors of that bleak morality had kept them there , and were really more interested in the sin and snakes than in the Edens . But Pan and his natural music , Pan and his creatures , are not so easily excluded from life as they are from ordained systems of morality . Always , somewhere , in spite of thought , in spite of law , the sun shines and the river sings and the blood dances . " My hair got caught in a wild blackberry bush , " went on Cherry , " and one of the boys loosened it for me . And when he was loosening it , I kind of let my arms go round his neck and  --  I ai n't putting any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth  --  for thanks , sort of  --  and then ... ?  | They had asked Cherry for details , and now Cherry gave them ? details so vibrant with a naive and sensuous poetry that they felt compelled to hush the little wretch 's mouth . And hushing her they found difficult , for she seemed suddenly seized and carried on by her own narrative , and excited by it ; and at the same time she evidently felt pleased that she was shocking them . She was wrought upon nervously by her story , and those who listened to her were wrought upon nervously ; a kind of hysteria seized upon Aunt Matilda 's dining room and pulsated through the prim house . Occasionally Mr Hamlin or Miss Paisely or Aunt Matilda would interrupt her with a sharp ejaculation of prayer for the girl 's immortal soul , and this would bring from her again , as if she were spurred and pricked by it , another quick leaping strophe of her wanton song . The big Bible retained its brass-bound dignity , and Mr Baxter clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tingling with emotion or sensation . On the back stairway Jack was conscious that Miriam Hamlin had gripped his shoulder as if her hand were a vise . He disengaged her fingers and saw that she had been quite unaware of what she was doing . She was scarcely conscious of his presence . She looked queer , and Jack was frightened for her . Knowledge had come to the ignorant girl in a great tide ; it had filled all the creeks and bayous of her being with a sudden flood . And knowledge had come to Jack himself ; pubescent boy and the newly awakened woman sat there in a queer community of breathless psychic experience that was beyond the power of either to define . Always in after years they felt it again in each other 's presence , but never at any time did either one speak of it to the other .  | PRESENTLY a kind of quivering silence fell in the dining room . The church , and this little she-demon it had started up out of the heathen brakes and brush , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush into an interval of silent prayer . Cherry ( or Sister Salters , as they had been calling her for the first time in her experience ) bowed her head also as the rest of them prayed . But she looked up through her long bronze-gold lashes which fringed her provocative eyes , and wondered about these people who were praying for her . She was foolish , but she was possessed of certain intuitive faculties ; and she knew , without the necessity of reasoning , that neither Mr nor Mrs Hamlin could ever have known anything about the sort of wild adventurous joy which she habitually courted . Cherry was quite ready to believe herself wicked , since all these superior people told her she was ; at the same time she was not too stupid to perceive that these were not the most understanding critics of her own particular chosen sort of wickedness , since they could never have been extraordinarily tempted by it themselves . She looked at Matilda Stevens and Emmeline Paisely  --  two old maids ! ? with contempt . She could hardly keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon whose nonsensitive countenance another curious fly was holding another clinic ; but she tactfully thrust part of her hand into her mouth and turned the nervous laugh into something that might pass for a nervous sob  --  and , indeed , when Mr Hamlin heard it , he was encouraged , for he thought an impression was being made upon the wanton young heart . Windy Renfrew , Cherry decided , was a person who might have some blood and understanding in him . And Mrs Gage .. .  | As she looked at Mrs Gage through her long lashes she became aware that Mrs Gage was likewise studying her through fingers left ajar . Cherry felt that Mrs Gage might understand her , if she chose to . But few people in Hazelton ever fathomed the reticent and discreet Mrs Gage . She was interested in Cherry , greatly interested , but her interest might never work into either words or deeds , or anything other than this deep , appraising contemplation . " Who were these boys ? " said Mr Hamlin , lifting his head from prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long countenance from a nosebag full of sustaining oats . The job was still to be finished ; the preacher was intent that ultimate justice should be done . " Honest , Mr Hamlin , I do n't like to say , " said Cherry . " You must , " said Aunt Matilda . " Well , then , " said Cherry , " if you want to know so bad , you go and ask Mr Gage . He 's a member of our church . And he came along and  --  and found us all there . . . together . . . and ... " There was a moment of embarrassing silence . Mrs Gage herself broke it , to everybody 's relief , by asking the question that no one else liked to ask because Mrs Gage was there : " What did Mr Gage say ? " " He said , Oh ! My , my ! Excuse me , I did n't know there was anybody here . ' And he went away . But from the way he acted we all knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted like . . . " Cherry paused to consider a moment . " He acted , " she proceeded presently , " like he thought it was n't nobody 's business but ours . That 's the reason we all knew he was n't going to tell . " There was another pause in the inquiry . It had been , manifestly , the duty of Henry Gage , as one of the deacons of the church , to report to his fellow church authorities this irregularity of conduct at the picnic . He had n't done so , and that was an obvious failure in his duty . Nobody liked to call attention to this failure on the part of the most influential deacon , who kept the church going .  | And everybody ( with the possible exception of Mrs Gage ) knew exactly why Mr Gage had not reported it . He had n't felt like casting the first stone at anybody . Another unspoken question began to fill the room . And everybody carefully refrained once more from looking at Mrs Gage . That self-contained woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her courage  --  asked it . " Has Mr Gage , " she said calmly , " ever spoken to you about this matter since then ? " There were implications in this question beyond its easy surface , but Mrs Gage 's air was such that even after she asked it the others continued to wonder how much she knew about her husband 's affairs with women . " No ma'am , " said Cherry . " Who were those boys ? " said Mr Renfrew loudly and peremptorily . His tone angered Cherry . " Well , then , " she said , " if I 've got to tell , I 'll tell ! One of them was Walter Renfrew , and one of ' em was Tom Baxter , and one of ' em was Clarence Paisely . " She had named Windy Renfrew 's son and the moribund Mr Baxter 's grandson and Emmeline Paisely 's young nephew . Miss Paisely neither paled nor flushed ; she turned a little blue ; the lids of her eyes went shut , to exclude the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr Renfrew 's face swelled and turned red ; he said something chokingly and breathlessly that might have been " My God ! " and might have been " By God ! " and got out of his chair and went and stood looking out of one of the dining-room windows , with his hands in his pockets . Mr Baxter and his fly expressed no emotion whatever ; they had n't understood . No one else looked at these striken ones , and they did not look at each other . Cherry saw something of the devastation she had caused , and she was cruel enough to enjoy it .  | " You kept askin ' me and pesterin ' me , " she said , " and now I 've told you ! " Mr Hamlin began , automatically , to lift a prayer . But this child of Satan cut in on him . " It was those three then , " she cried , " and it 's been them three ever since , and besides them , it 's been . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the White Church also . She seemed , now , to be possessed of a positive mania for naming people . She was excited . Mr Hamlin tried to pray again . But Cherry shrilled : " It was them , and there 's a grown man too ! And they 're all the fathers of this baby  --  they all are ! " A grown man too ! Again a question filled the room . Everybody ( with the possible exception of Mrs Gage ) thought once more of Henry Gage . Cherry was at first surprised that she was not pressed as to the identity of the grown man . Then she gathered from the averted faces of her inquisitors that they were nervous as to the identity of this grown man . She was not acute , but she began to get a stronger sense of her own power to annoy these people , to make them suffer , to disgrace them . She did not think specifically of Henry Gage , but she did understand that they were all trembling for fear the grown man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She giggled . Her giggle sent a shudder around the room . With the perception that she had all of them at a disadvantage , she began to feel better-natured . The little monster became lenient . " You need n't be so scared , " she said . " The grown man ai n't a member of our church ! He 's a member of the Hill Church . It 's Mr Tucker Ackles . " These people would have been more , or less , than human if they had not breathed an audible sigh of relief ( all but Mrs Gage and Mr Baxter ) . Miss Paisely 's eyes opened , and she became less blue . Winfield Scott Renfrew turned back to the table and sat down again , and there was the dawn of a splendid idea in his face . Tucker  | Ackles of the Hill Church ! Renfrew looked around on the others with something almost like the beginnings of a smile on his countenance . Tucker Ackles was as prominent in the Hill Church as Henry Gage in the White Church ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note in his voice almost cheery , " I think this is a matter for the Reverend Mr Sprague and the Hill Church to deal with . " " I ai n't going to talk to any more churches about it ! " said Cherry swiftly . " The grown man , and not these ignorant young boys who have been led astray , " said Mr Renfrew , developing his idea , " is undoubtedly the father of our unfortunate sister 's child . " There was something like sunshine again in Mr Renfrew 's soul . This should be the White Church 's story , and they must all stick to it , he determined . " These boys of ours must , nevertheless , be disciplined , " went on Mr Renfrew with the impressiveness of the politician . " Poor Mrs Ackles ! " breathed Mrs Henry Gage . If this woman had a deep , individual sense of humor , a quiet , subtle perception all her own , there was no one within sound of her voice quite capable of appreciating it . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves : " Poor Mrs Gage ! " " The great question , " said Mr Renfrew , developing his theme , " is whether these children of ours " ? and from his tone it might have been gathered that the " children " were little more than babes in arms , instead of lusty lads of seventeen to nineteen ? " is whether these children of ours should be disciplined by their families or whether their discipline should be made a church matter . " He meant , really , whether their disgrace should be made a public matter ; and his auditors understood him perfectly . They saw clearly enough the opportunity of putting the onus of the whole affair upon the Hill Church , through Mr Ackles.  | But , unfortunately for this scheme of Mr Renfrew 's , there were consciences in the room . " These boys , " said Mr Hamlin , " are members of my church . This has been taken up as a church matter . And as a church matter it must be disposed of . It is my duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . And I shall look to everyone here for support . There is a moral responsibility that can not be evaded . " This was an utterance that took considerable courage . In carrying the investigation to its bitter end , Mr Hamlin might well raise a church row that would push him out of a job . " This is not , " added Mr Hamlin , " a matter of White Church or Hill Church . It is a matter of our duty as Christians , in the sight of God . " Neither Mr Renfrew nor Miss Paisely ( the sanctified ) made any enthusiastic response to Mr Hamlin . His wife stroked his sleeve . It was impossible to tell by her countenance what Mrs Gage thought , and Mr Baxter never had thoughts any more than he had sensations . Cherry listened sullenly . " I do n't see why , " she said , " we got to have any more investigations than this one we 're havin ' now . " Everybody disregarded her . Aunt Matilda began to speak . She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " is partly mine . Largely mine . I ca n't dodge it . Cherry 's been here with me for a year . She 's been out nights a good deal . With the other young people . I should have known where she was and who she was with . She 's going to have a baby . I ca n't throw her out . I wo n't throw her out . Where could she go ? I " " I could go home , to my pa ! " said Cherry somewhat truculently . She was beginning to resent the idea that these people were licensed to dispose of her future . " There 's no place , " went on Aunt Matilda , " for her to go to , that I know of , except her father 's house . And even if he were a  | fit person to look after her , the house is in a terrible fix  --  why , the rain comes through the roof . " " The roof , " submitted Windy Renfrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to see Cherry through it , " said Aunt Matilda . " And I 'm going to reclaim her . Make her understand that she must live the right sort of life  --  and make her live it . I 've failed in my duty toward her ; and now I 'm going to make up for it . " The others were not insensible that this determination on the part of Aunt Matilda was the expression of a real generosity . It meant domesticating a lively scandal ; it meant letting herself in for a share of the disgrace , since it would be a public acknowledgment that the disgrace had come about at least partially through her laxity . But she thought it was the right thing to do . So she would do it . No matter how it might damage her , she would do it . She had failed in her duty . She would atone . " I may need some help in money , " said Aunt Matilda . " She 's got to have her baby in peace and quietness . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her father , and she ca n't be shoved off among strangers . We ca n't put it all onto Mr Ackles . We ca n't put it all onto anybody . Nobody knows whose baby it is . I 'll keep her here and take care of both of them till she can help herself . But I 'll need some money help . " " Mr Gage , " suggested that gentleman 's wife placidly , " will help you with money . " She added : " He 's helped two or three unfortunate girls during the last ten years . " Mr Hamlin rubbed his large mild nose and looked openly and steadily at Mrs Gage . She was either more innocent , or more cynical , than he could conceive of a wife being ; and the preacher had an almost uncontrollable impulse to ask her frankly and bluntly which it was . She returned his gaze serenely ; and he controlled his impulse . Perhaps he reflected , with an inward humiliation , that his own living , like hers , came to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Henry Gage . He was kept too . " I 'm going to keep Cherry here and protect her , " said Aunt Matilda .  | " There 's Jack , " murmured Miss Paisely . " Jack . . . influence . . . " Her voice died away . " Jack 's going to have to learn things , " said his aunt . " He can begin now . " Jack , on the back stairs , had been learning rather rapidly this afternoon ; and when he sat down there he had already known more about some things than Aunt Matilda . " I 'm going , " said Matilda Stevens , fixing Cherry with a look that was almost a threat , " to make a decent woman out of her ! She 's going to do what I tell her , " said Aunt Matilda  --  and she felt a kind of grim efficiency nerving her as she spoke ? " and she 's going to go straight in every way after this . " Aunt Matilda felt herself getting emotional . Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Cherry Salters felt it as anger , and an answering anger rose up in her to meet it . " I 'm going , " said Aunt Matilda , actually believing that the heat that now possessed her was a heat against Sin , and not at all a heat against the girl , " I 'm going to take all the nonsense out of Cherry Salters ! " Cherry got to her feet , and her face was alive with resentment . " Listen , " she said , " I ai n't wanted to get you folks mad at me , and I ai n't said much . But I 'll tell you honest , now , what I think . I think the White Church has n't got any right to boss me , nor the Hill Church neither , nor you , Miss Stevens , nor you , Mr Hamlin , nor nobody else ! I just joined the White Church because Miss Stevens thought I ought to  --  I was workin ' here , and I did n't want any words , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I ai n't goin ' to let you folks run me and boss me and tell me what to do ! I ai n't goin ' to live here and be ordered around ! I ai n't goin ' to be told what to do about this baby nor about anything else ! I 'm goin ' home and live with my pa . I got a right to . My pa , he 'll figure out what to do about me and any trouble I get into . None of it is anybody 's business but mine and my pa 's anyhow ! " She moved toward the kitchen door , defiant and altogether the daughter of Clem Salters . Aunt Matilda sprang up and took a step toward her with outstretched  | hand . It was , in its effect upon the girl , an assertion of physical dominance . She felt as if she were about to be grabbed and haled into captivity  --  and that , indeed , was Aunt Matilda 's impulse . Cherry recoiled and crouched against the wall . Something violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gazed levelly , and with a deadly ferocity which daunted the older woman , upon Aunt Matilda . Presently she spoke . She was not given to profanity as a rule , but she had heard a good deal of it . And now a speech that one of her father 's Swamp Angels had once flung at him came facilely out of her . " Do n't you lay a finger onto me , " she purred through her teeth , " or I 'll cut your God damned heart out ! " Aunt Matilda fell back , afraid , her hand upon her bosom . The effect upon her could scarcely have been greater had Cherry actually and physically slashed at her with a knife  --  nor upon her companions . They were frozen with horror ; and with terror too . Cherry was not merely beyond the jurisdiction of these people ; she was beyond their comprehension . But they felt one truth about her clearly enough : that if there had been a weapon within reach at the moment , and Aunt Matilda had persisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as naturally and readily as the words came to her mouth . She backed slowly down the steps into the kitchen , and it was then that Mr Baxter peered out of the shadow of his coffin to assert that she did not look to him like a person who would steal spoons . Perhaps , many years before , Mr Baxter had actually been a member of some court assembled to try a servant girl accused of stealing spoons , and the years between had fallen away from him , so that after the lapse of a quarter of a century he supposed that former investigation to be still in progress . But no one will ever know , and to insist on plucking one of his notions out of the twilight between two worlds , where Mr Baxter dwelt , would be too indecently like robbing a grave . And yet this old gentleman 's nods and snores and gurglings and ejaculations had weight in the councils of his little city . Cherry , still gazing into the dining room from the lower level  | of the kitchen upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last blow of her primitive ego , burst into a peal of laughter in answer to Mr Baxter 's remark . For the possibility of a kind of barbarous practical joke had occurred to her : the notion of going forth and telling the world that Mr Baxter himself was the father of her child ! Still laughing , she started up the back stairs . There was a scramble and a flutter above her . She saw Jack getting to his feet , but she did not see Miriam Hamlin . The preacher 's daughter , with her shoes in her hand , had darted across the hallway and into Jack 's room , closing the door behind her . Cherry paused at the top of the stairway and smiled at Jack . She understood that he had been listening . She put out her hand , to draw him toward her . But the boy sidled and dodged , and glowered at her . A fortnight before , he had been ready to fall in love with her , to give her a sentimental adoration . Then she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He had not quite realized that there were girls and women as promiscuous as she . And now he felt a sudden quick hatred for her , simply because he had once been ready to fall in love with her . He did not reason it out , but she had done something to his ideas about women  --  she had raped the virginity of his imagination . " Oh well ! " she said as he recoiled from her . She stuck out her tongue at him . This child of iniquity was still a child . She could stick out her tongue ; or she could pluck forth a knife ; both were true expressions of her character . She went into her room and began to get her things together , preparatory to going home . Jack softly opened the door of his own room . Miriam Hamlin , her shoes still clutched in one hand , was looking out the back window as if meditating a jump . She turned with a gasp when he came in . " What shall I do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ? They must n't see me  --  they must n't know ! They must n't know ! "  | They could hear the buzz of voices coming up from downstairs , where their elders were once more debating the case of Cherry Salters . How long they might talk and pray down there , there was no telling . If Miriam tried to steal down and out through the front hallway she might be caught , for the conference might break up at any moment . She was in a panic lest she be discovered . Jack realized , with a swift extension of his faculties , that the girl would almost die of shame if it were known that she had been an eavesdropper on Cherry 's story . It became , to him as well as to her , the most important thing in the world that she should get away unnoticed . Her arms , although her shoes were in her hands , were crossed over her breast in that odd defensive gesture of modest women who are surprised in deshabille ( Lady Godiva rode through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Jack pointed to the thick honeysuckle vines that covered the back part of the house . Without a word she dropped her shoes and scrambled down with the help of the vines . He tossed the shoes after her , and she picked them up and scuttled across the back yard in her stocking feet toward the open door of the stable , as swift and fledged with panic as a silly chicken . Halfway to the stable and Mister Splain shouted at her . He was lolling partly out of his window . Miriam dropped one shoe but kept on and disappeared within the stable . Jack was down the vine in a moment and picked up the shoe . " Cherubs , Bub , cherubs ? " said Mister Splain inquiringly . He had a half-pint bottle of whisky in one hand ; with the other he pointed first toward the stable within which Miriam had disappeared , and then toward Cherry 's window , out of which Cherry was leaning to mark Miriam 's flight . Jack did not answer . Mister Splain , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Splain , he was an outlaw With Frank and Jesse James ! And many a woman 's throat he cut Oh-h , Mis-ter Spla-a-in ! "  | Inside the stable , Miriam sat on an oats bin , panting . Jack handed her the shoe , and she put her shoes on and buttoned them up , and then looked about her . Jack felt strangely protective . " Listen , " he whispered . " You can get out the back door of the stable into the alley , and the alley comes out on a side street right next to the wagon shop . Shall I go with you ? " She considered . It would certainly look better to have someone with her if she should be seen coming out of an alley , she thought . She nodded assent . But before they left the stable she suddenly smiled on Jack and kissed him . It was not like the kisses with which Cherry Salters had troubled him  --  but it was somehow more like them than it was like any kiss which any other girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home that evening he was surprised to find his little golden-haired daughter there . She told him everything . Clem made a list of names . He glanced at the old army musket hanging on the wall and silently rejected it as a clumsy and obsolete weapon . Then he dug from a closet a big .45-caliber single-action Colt 's revolver of a model that was a favorite in the Far West years ago , and began to clean and oil it . " What you goin ' to do ? " asked Cherry . " None of your God damn business , " replied Clem to his little golden-haired angel . " ' T is too , " said Cherry . " If it 's on account of me , it 's my God damn business . " " Nobody , " said Clem , drawing a piece of greasy cloth through the barrel of the weapon , " nobody can trifle with an old soldier 's daughter and not pay the penalty . " " You go and shoot somebody , and you 'll get hung , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matilda Stevens ' heart out , " and what good will that do ? "  | " Mebby , " said Clem enigmatically , " mebby I wo n't have to shoot nobody . " He loaded the gun and put it into a holster , which he fastened to a belt , discarding his suspenders . His coat was long enough to cover it , but it made a perfectly apparent bulge , and this was as Clem intended . That night everyone in Tom Meek 's barroom knew that Clem Salters was packing a gun and that an affront of some sort had been offered to his little golden-haired angel . It was at that time a rare thing in these small midland communities for anyone to carry a gun , but it was not absolutely unknown ; now and then some romantic braggart of nineteen or twenty felt that he could not exist a day longer unless he had a pistol on his person ? although he seldom did anything with it . By noon the next day there were few people in Hazelton who did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reason for it spread over the community . Names began to circulate . The excitement and scandal gratified Clem exceedingly . Cherry 's examination had taken place on a Tuesday . On Thursday , Mr Tucker Ackles kindly lent Clem five hundred dollars . The same day Windy Renfrew lent Clem nearly half that sum . Others , whose sons had been implicated , did what they could . The village experienced something like a reign of terror . Cherry herself began to enjoy the situation . She went to the post office while the mail was being distributed and greeted everybody jovially . A third of the village gathered in the post office twice a day for this function . The cream of the jest for Cherry was that every male person in Hazelton seemed afraid to speak to her publicly  --  and also afraid not to . She began to lie and implicate men and boys who had never had anything to do with her , even very old men and quite young boys . The Salterses became , in fact , a public menace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches attained such terrific proportions that , in order to keep the churches together at all , it finally became necessary to grant something like a general amnesty in the Cherry Salters matter , as is sometimes the policy of a government after a civil war . Everyone was under suspicion  --  public suspicion  | and , frequently , suspicion in the heaving bosom of his own family . Clem went to Chicago and stayed drunk for three months on the proceeds of his daughter 's shame  --  or shamelessness . He wrote for Cherry to join him ; he wished to continue to live in Chicago off the wages of her sins . But Cherry refused to leave Hazelton . She was afraid of the city ; moreover , there was something essentially pastoral in her nature . She liked the creek , she liked the woods that stretched in a great semicircle about the village , she liked the country and country ways . While her father was absent , she continued to practice her irregularities ; she became a professional , a country whore . When Clem returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tactical error . He did not think it possible that Henry Gage had not been mixed up in this affair , despite Cherry 's denials . He called at the bank and announced to Henry Gage that he had " come to talk things over . " Gage led him back to his private office and swiftly took him by surprise . Without preamble he thrust the muzzle of a revolver into Clem 's stomach . Gage might have certain moral cowardices , but he did not lack the more physical sort of courage . " I 've been sort of waiting for you , Clem , " said the banker mildly . " I had an idea you 'd be here sooner or later . " Never was a man more delighted at his own innocence than Gage at that moment . " I have n't had anything to do with your girl , Clem , " he went on , " and I do n't intend to be blackmailed . " " Why , Henry , " said Clem , standing uncomfortably with his hands up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend that drops in to sec you on business ! What I come for was to raise some money on that ten acres I got left down there by the edge of the swamp ? negotiate a mor'gage . " " You ca n't , " said Gage . " You ca n't do any business with me now or any other time . And if you ever come in here again , I 'll shoot you . And I would n't even be tried for it . You 've got a bad name in Hazelton , Clem , and everybody ' d be glad to get rid of you . "  | Clem let loose a volley of curses and threats . " Back out , " said Gage , propelling Clem before him . " Back out to the street and keep your hands up . And remember what I said . " Clem began openly to live from the proceeds of Cherry 's infamy , without in the least abating his public habit of bluster . And for several years the Salterses and their house at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hill Church habitually referred to as " a moral plague spot in the community . " Cherry 's baby , fortunately for itself , had been born dead . Once again before Cherry 's career was ended she was to become a factor in Jack 's life and development . All these people had their influence upon him , direct or indirect . Influences that mingled themselves imperceptibly with his being . The period between fourteen and seventeen was not a happy time for him . On the east side of the principal street in Hazelton there were at least eight stores . The west side , if you counted the photograph gallery and the post office as stores , boasted eleven . It is a regrettable fact that Jack , between the ages of fourteen and seventeen , was at one time or another discharged from a respectable , if not lucrative , position in each and every one of these places of business . From some of them he even managed to get himself discharged two or three times .  | THE FILES of the Hazelton Weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens , one of Hazelton 's brightest and most enterprising young hustlers , has accepted a position in ... " In Sam Jackson 's jewelry shop ; or Martin Oldsmith 's pharmacy ; or Fred Smith 's grocery ; or Henry Williams ' drygoods store . But Jack never lasted very long ; he was not a consistent " hustler " in spite of the friendly and ungrammatical Mr Renfrew . Martin Oldsmith , the druggist , was sure , for quite three weeks , that Jack was born to be a pharmacist . He displayed a keen and intelligent interest in the Dispensatory and the Pharmacopoeia which Mart had never been able to communicate to any of his former assistants . Martin could never understand why this interest suddenly waned . And yet it was all very simple . For Jack 's interest was almost entirely quasi-romantic and literary . He would open the Dispensatory to the article on gum arabic , for instance , and learn that it is produced from several species of acacia growing in Africa and southern Asia . And he would get a picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Arabs and caravans ; there would stream before his inward sight a panorama glittering with the life and movement of the East . The figure of one Jack Stevens , changed somewhat from the reality , but recognizable , would be certain to appear sooner or later , and the caravan ( leaving the transportation of gum arabic to more sordid and commercial individuals ) would suddenly resolve upon a pilgrimage to Mecca , meeting with many adventures by the way , usually encountering an oriental princess or two  --  and perhaps , in the end , finding that it had been going to Bagdad instead of Mecca all  | the time , Haroun-al-Raschid having summoned his young friend Stevens to his court . Jack 's interest in the drug business was precisely so deep , and no deeper . He was not interested in selling hairbrushes or patent medicines . He was not interested in selling anything . His failures , nevertheless , gave him many moments of unhappiness and melancholy . The world began to seem a difficult place , and himself a useless character . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aunt Matilda was failing . Hitherto he had only been able to help her by paying his board ; there had been weeks at a time when he had not done even that ; the day was approaching when he would have to take care of her ; it was time to settle on something and stick to it . But settle on what ? He had no doubt that somewhere , if he might only discover it , the sort of thing that he could do awaited him . But what was it ? And how could he get to it ? Dr Stuart , who guessed what was the matter with the boy , tried to put courage into him from time to time . But it was not courage which Jack lacked just then ; he had enough basic confidence in himself ; it was definite direction . Aunt Matilda could never quite understand why Jack lost so many jobs . She began to watch for weak spots in his character and found plenty of them ; it was her thought that jack had inherited them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having " serious " talks with him . These always turned upon her idea that it was some hidden moral infirmity which prevented him from getting ahead in the world ; and Jack got no more practical help out of them than Job did from the counsel of the friends who came to talk things over in his hour of affliction . Aunt Matilda held to the simple doctrine that , if you deserve well of Providence , you are bound to get along in a material way , unmindful of that text which points out that the rain falls upon the just and the unjust alike . The decline of her own business  | puzzled Aunt Matilda more than a little , for she was conscious of her rectitude . Nevertheless , in spite of this consciousness , she took to examining herself , as to spiritual matters , with an unwonted particularity . She began finally to look for possible sins in herself with almost as much diligence as she had , all her life , devoted to the task of finding sins in her neighbors . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew whether she would be justified in making herself a bonnet . Every doctrine recoils upon itself at last , suddenly exhibiting claws and teeth . The sense that he was good for nothing much was accentuated by his aunt Matilda 's habit of comparing Jack with his father . And it got mixed in with a recurrent dream which Jack had had from his childhood days . The dream was sufficiently uncomfortable without this new element . It had begun with Jack shortly after his father 's death . In the dream he was always sitting in his aunt Matilda 's dressmaking shop  --  the big room at the front of the house which had once been a " parlor " ? at a small table . It was night , and on the table was a kerosene lamp . As he sat there , quivering with an expectancy of he knew not what , he would hear footsteps mounting to the back porch , and these footsteps had in them an undefinable frightening quality . Presently he would hear the latch of the kitchen door at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It squeaked upon its hinges . It was closed . He would hear it latched again . Then there would be footsteps , still faint , crossing the kitchen floor . Someone , or something , was approaching through the night ? slowly , and with a certain terrible stateliness and deliberation . The footsteps , a little louder , would enter the dining room . Slowly , through the quiet of the midnight house , which seemed larger in this dream than it was in reality , the footsteps would cross the dining room . Someone , or something , would pause on the  | dining-room side of the closed door , just outside the room in which Jack sat staring and silent in a growing chill of dread . Presently a hand would be laid on the knob of the door , on the dining-room side . There would be a slight click as the bolt moved in the lock . Jack could see the white knob , on his side of the door , slowly turning . In a moment the door would be opened , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? This gradual , menacing approach through the hushed house always bereft him of the power of motion . The door would swing slowly open . His father would enter and close it behind him . His father would always be dressed in the long black coat which he had worn in the pulpit ; his brow and mouth were stern , although not unkindly ; always his long black hair was roached back , as if he had just passed his hand through it , preparatory to one of his denunciations of iniquity . He would stand and look at Jack . Jack , from his side of the table , would stare back . The boy , in these visions , was always possessed by the feeling that the reason for his being so frightened would become quite clear to him in another instant ; just now it was not clear . He groped for the specific reason , but with his father 's first appearance he could not capture it . As his father looked at him over the kerosene lamp , across the dim room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him suddenly , and he would cry out : " But , Father , I thought you were dead ! " With that his father would move toward him . He would come deliberately across the room , every footstep an additional blow upon jack 's oppressed heart , and stand on the other side of the table , looking down upon the boy . With a slight smile , which did not abate the awesomeness of his presence , he would bend forward and speak for the first time . " I am dead , " he would say . With the terror of this Jack would scream ; he would awake  | shaken and sweating and chilling . But with an instinct for secrecy about such things , he never told his aunt Matilda this dream , even when he was very young . The nightmare had come to him several times a year . But when he was about seventeen , and feeling that he was of little use to anyone , and wondering if he ever would be , his father 's aspect in the dream began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurred more frequently . His father was scornful because he did n't seem to amount to anything ? that was the sense which would be with jack when he waked . And Aunt Matilda 's habit of comparing him with his father accentuated the shame which he began to feel at his own failures . He began to cry out a question to his father , in the dream , a plea for some guidance ; but he never could get anything coherent out of himself . The dream refused to be wrested from its idle terror to any practical purpose ; it had worn itself too deeply into the grooves of his subconsciousness . His father was increasingly displeased with him ; that was all he got out of it . In his waking moments he tried to tell himself that , of course , it was only a dream and all nonsense ; but the impression clung and contributed to his youthful troubles . One day his aunt directly confessed her disappointment in him . " I used to think , " she said , " that I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think you have n't got it in you . You would n't stick to it . " He acquiesced in this abandonment of the plan ; just at this time he felt no strong impulse in that direction . The immediate thing , anyhow , was to get into something that would permit him to give more substantial help to Aunt Matilda as soon as possible . It was from the Hazelton Weekly Banner , which had so many times chronicled his " acceptance " of " positions , " while turning a friendly blindness to the frequency of his failures , that Jack got the first straw of help and the first ray of hope . One afternoon , having used up the main street , Jack attacked the side street on which the  | Banner was published , and interviewed Mr Renfrew . Jack had always kept off this street before , as it was devoted chiefly to blacksmith shops , the farm implement business , the carpenter trade , the " livery and feed " industry and so forth ; it was the abode of arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , as the result of his conference with Mr Renfrew , the Banner , the next week , published the following sprightly article : Mr John Stevens , better known as Jack to his many friends , acquaintances and fellow citizens in our thriving little city , is now a member of the Banner 's staff . A scholar , a Christian and a gentleman , he will lend ornamentation and adornment to the profession in life which he has , after looking around him considerably in a business way , made up to as his choice for a life profession . Tom Crandell , who will always have his little joke , the genial livery-stable keeper , dropped in to see us from across the street yesterday . " Well , Jack , " Tom says , who is quite a humorist in his quiet way , " are you sorry that you learned the printing trade ? " " No , " says Jack , " Tom , I am not . " " Well , then , Jack , " says Tom , laughing , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This bored Jack considerable for he had been working at it only two days at that period of time . Well now , Tom , you can poke fun at young Mr Stevens all you want to , but we are here to tell you he is picking it up quite fast , and we congratulate the citizens of Hazelton and vicinity as well as Jack and ourselves upon this new acquirement to the Banner staff . Tom paid us a dollar for a year 's subscription while he was in . We wish we could say as much for some others who come in and sit around and use our pens and paper and our cuspidor . Some people will do that and then have the cheek to borrow the Banner to read from a neighbor . Well , about the meanest cuss in the world is the man who grudges the printer to make a living for self and family , say we . Windy 's " staff " consisted , before Jack joined it , of Phil Marks and Molly Clark . Phil was a journeyman printer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive words in any one day . His reticence and the meditative way in which he chewed tobacco had given many people the mistaken idea that  | Phil was a thoughtful person . In reality his silence was caused by the tobacco ; there was always so much of it in his mouth that he could not speak without getting rid of it , and Phil hated to lose a quid . Molly was a flat-chested poor relation of Windy 's , a drab-haired creature with long bony fingers with which she set type , two days a week , with a rapidity which seemed almost miraculous to Jack . The rest of the week she assisted in the Renfrew housework . Molly 's only ambition in life was to marry Phil . There were times when Phil had the notion of proposing . But unluckily , at those times , his mouth had always happened to be filled with a fresh " chew " of tobacco , and he could not speak . Thus the golden moment was deferred from season to season . Once Phil had even gone so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of a brass-lined galley while she was bending over the imposing stone ; but at the flame of elation which burned up in her small green eyes he flew into a sudden panic and hastily corked up the words he had been about to utter with an immense bite of Plowboy 's Plug . Mr Renfrew himself occasionally deigned to set type or kick the job press , and now and then a tramp printer drifted along and worked for a few days . Jack might have become a fairly good printer in time , if he had not at once developed an engrossing interest in the editorial side of the business . To collect news and see it published in the paper , and even to try his hand at editorials , was a kind of work so much like play that he wondered why people were ever paid money for doing it . Renfrew encouraged him to write . Renfrew himself , on the whole , preferred to spend his time sitting with his feet on his desk smoking Pittsburgh stogies . Jack had his own private opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then succeeded in eliminating some of that gentleman 's more atrocious offenses . He was forced to do this surreptitiously , and once Mr Renfrew caught him at it .  | " This ai n't the way I wrote this piece , Jack , " said Mr Renfrew , puzzling over a proof . " What 's happened to it ? " " I changed it a little , " confessed Jack . " Huh ! You did ? What did you do that for ? " Mr Renfrew regarded Jack with surprise . " Well , " said Jack , " it seemed to me that you had said the same thing twice in that editorial . " " Well , " said Renfrew , going over the proof again , " maybe I did . But I changed the words some when I said it the second time , did n't I ? " " Yes sir , " said Jack , yearning to rewrite the whole article but not daring to suggest it . " You did . But still ? " " Let ' em go  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Windy . " It helps fill up . One main thing you got to learn about this business , Jack , is the little dodges that fill up space . You notice sometimes I get on the high horse when I 'm writing , do n't you ? Like a speaker making a regular oratorical address ? Well , I 'll tell you , Jack , that 's just a dodge too . Naturally I 'm plain as an old shoe . But the long words fill up space . And in a town like this where nothing much ever happens , you got to fill up space somehow . " And Mr Renfrew winked in enjoyment at his own sagacity . The nearest Jack ever came to a genuine clash with the goodnatured Mr Renfrew was over a series of poems by Miss Emmeline Paisely . Miss Paisely had been a flourishing obituary poet for many years . But though life is short and art is long , there fell a season , a very healthy season , when there were not deaths enough in that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmeline Paisely reasonably busy . It was then that Miss Paisely conceived the startlingly original idea of writing a set of poems dealing with death in the abstract and general , rather than death in the particular instance . Out of her mental and spiritual parturition she gave birth to that remarkable series which she called the " Sarcophagean Sonnets " ? there was some reference to a sarcophagus in each of them . " Mr Renfrew , " said jack when the editor of the Banner handed  | him the first one to put into type , " I do n't believe we 'd better print this . " " Hey ? Why not ? Miss Paisely 's been writing poetry for the Banner for twenty years . I do n't know as we 'd dare to come out without some sort of an obituary poem by Miss Emmeline . What 's the matter with it ? " " Well , " said Jack , " it is n't really a sonnet , to begin with . A sonnet ought to have fourteen lines , and this one has seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and this is more or less like blank verse . " " See here , Jack , who makes the rules for sonnets ? " " They were made a long time ago , Mr Renfrew . " " Laid down in the old country , I reckon ? Huh ? " " I think it was in Italy , Mr Renfrew . " " And those same rules have been followed , as laid down hundreds of years ago by the Dagos , ever since ? " " Why , yes , Mr Renfrew . " " Well , then , it 's time for a change ! An editor 's got to be original , Jack ! He 's got to be American , too . If Miss Emmeline Paisely wants to start a new kind of a sonnet , right here in our home town , it 's our business to brag up her sonnets and not run ' em down . See ? You got to remember always to be a home paper , Jack . " " But , Mr Renfrew , there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in blank verse , it 's something else . " " Did n't Shakespeare write a lot of his poetry without any rhymes , Jack ? I know he did . I 've seen some that he wrote that way , myself ! And I 'll tell you what , Jack , you may not appreciate it , but there 's some mighty solemn thoughts in this poem of Miss Paisely 's . It 's like Thanatopsis : You just write a nice little piece to go under it , saying that it 's like Thanatopsis , ' and we 'll print it . " " But it does n't appear to mean anything , Mr Renfrew . It 's all mixed up  --  you ca n't tell what she 's driving at . " " That 's what makes it poetry , Jack ! You go and read Thanatopsis , ' and you 'll see the same kind of language and the same beautiful thoughts that Miss Paisely has got in this one , all kind of  | gloomy and beautiful in the middle , and kind of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like prose does , Jack , poetry does n't . I like the rhymed kind better myself : it jumps along livelier . But there 's some mighty good words in this , Jack , and into the paper she goes ! " And in it went , although Jack and Windy quarreled before it got into type , and Jack nearly lost his job . Thereafter Jack suffered Miss Emmeline in silence , and it was not long before he began to print verse of his own in the Hazelton Weekly Banner . He had never shown his attempts at verse to anyone except Barbara Stuart and to his friend Fatty Wilson . When he began timidly to publish verses , signed with his initials , he was very selfconscious ; he expected to be heckled about it . But nobody said anything , either because the public had failed to identify the poet from the initials , or because the verse , modestly printed in small type , escaped general notice . Miss Paisely was the crowned and laureled singer of that county , anyhow , and none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of Jack 's poems which had an unusual genesis . He and Fatty Wilson , on a warm Sunday afternoon of spring , took a walk through the woods and down the creek toward the cave where they had played at being outlaws a few years before . They had not even seen it for nearly two years , a long time in the consciousness of youth ; time enough for a kind of adolescent sentimentality to spring up in relation to their former activities there . The creek passed within two or three hundred yards of Clem Salters ' ramshackle habitation , and the two boys , as they drew within earshot of that dingy stronghold of disrepute , were startled by the cries of a woman and the oaths of a man intermingled in savage clamor . They stopped , looking at each other in excitement , almost hoping for a real adventure in this place where they had so often played at adventure , and then ran through the trees and  | bushes without any notion of what kind of thing they were going to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Clem 's house . Clem was beating a woman with a hickory stick . But he was not having his own way about it altogether ; the two of them were making a great to-do over it . She was a strong woman of forty-five , and she was desperately fighting back , clutching at the stick , kicking , clawing and scratching , screaming , cursing , trying to bite , and Clem was striking her anywhere and everywhere he could . Her hair was over her face and her clothes were half torn off her ; one of her lank and pendant breasts , with a purple bruise across it , flopped and swung out of her tattered waist in a way to sicken the mind of man , as Clem caught her by a wrist and whirled her about . She was one of Clem 's Swamp Angels ; he was conveying to her that their romance was definitely ended and that he wished her to go back to her former home . Moreover , she had evidently offended his nice sense of propriety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they burst through the underbrush : " You God damned muskrat , you , I 'll learn you to fool around with Cherry 's beau ! " Cherry herself sat on a log near the front door of the house , her eyes large and glowing with appreciation of this entertainment , and her red lips parted in a glowing smile . The spring sun heightened her color where she lolled , and the easy lubricity of her attitude was that of one of Rubens ' vivid jades . Out of an open window behind her leaned her current " beau " and paddled with her neck and breasts . " Come and see the fun ! " Cherry greeted the boys cheerily . She disengaged her lover 's hand and indicated a place for them beside her on the log . She was pregnant again ( and this brat , unluckier than her first one , lived six or eight months after its birth ; the Rev. Alexander Sprague once explained that a double portion of infant damnation was in store for these twice unhallowed babes ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sluggish fish of swampy inland waters , and the unmitigated bestiality of the scene , with all its squalid connotations , struck on the clean senses of jack and his companion like a nauseous wind .  | The boys , after their first gasping pause , moved forward together . It was not in either one of them to see a woman savagely beaten without defending her . But they did not rush . The sensual fetor had immediately sickened them . They moved for the honor of the human species , rather than from any imperious necessity of anger , and it took all their resolution to advance . They were both unusually big and husky for seventeen , and the two together might hope to lick Clem , stick and all , though it would be a nasty fight . But , sickened as they were , they did advance ; and their attitude made their intention evident . Clem took his left hand from the woman 's wrist and dropped the stick from his right . From the ground he picked up an open jackknife with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swamp , fishing , that morning , and he had been cleaning bullheads and carp when the impulse to whip the woman had come upon him . As the boys stepped toward him , he crouched and braced himself for that upward , ripping thrust at the belly which is the instinct of all born knife fighters . On the blade of the weapon were smears and fish scales and half-dried vestiges from the knife 's recent employment . " Come on , boys , " said Clem quietly . A cruel grimace of anticipation bared his tobacco-blackened fangs . " Come on , and I 'll see if the blood in yer guts is any redder than ' t is in them there bull-heads ! " They stopped , twenty feet from him . Only insanity would have gone on . He meant it . There was murder in him . No half-dozen men , quite unarmed , had any business trying to rush Clem Salters when he had steel in his hands . The boys looked from the stained blade to Clem 's wide , fool 's eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . They turned back among the trees and bushes , shaken and ashamed , avoiding each other 's eyes , feeling like children with the nerve suddenly slapped out of them , daunted , and hating themselves for it . The heroes they had admired in books would have gotten the better of this situation somehow , by some glorious stroke of courage and cleverness , but they had been defeated ; without  | a blow , too ! They were boys , still near the days when they had played at outlaws and heroes ; they did not have enough experience of life to know that in retiring they had nothing to be ashamed of . They felt that their chivalric and romantic impulses had been kicked aside like sprawling puppies by a brutal fact ; they vaguely perceived that it was old Clem 's readiness and resolution and his instant appraisal of their unready youth which had stopped them , as well as his knife . As they went back into the timber , a hoot of laughter followed them . Cherry laughed , her " beau " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insults . Clem laughed . And the wried jade he had been beating , still rocking on her knees where Clem had flung her , ceased fumbling at her bruised teat and let out a shrill cackle of derision . " Scairt ! " she cried . " Scairt ! Stuck-up dudes ! Scairt ! " Jack stopped , at this multiple shout of laughter , and then went on again . But the chorus of derision rose and pursued . Suddenly the anger which had been in abeyance rose above his sickness , rose above his reason , and he whirled around , sobbing . Without an instant 's hesitation Fatty dived and tackled Jack about the knees like a football player , bringing him to the ground . Fatty knew that when Jack cried it meant that he had come abruptly to the pitch where he would charge anything in an unreflecting idiocy of emotion , and there would be some minutes while the blood of pride or shame was in his temples when he would be unaccountable for his actions . The boys threshed and walloped on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten loose , in spite of anthills , thistles or cow dung ; he clung fast , and the viscid bits of fish offal on that obscene knife were horribly present to his mental vision as he clung . " You do n't want  --  that dirty knife  --  in your gizzard , Stevie , " he gasped . Jack 's head struck against a stump , and he was still , partially stunned , for several minutes . Fatty lay on the ground and panted . They went to the creek and straightened out their Sunday suits and tidied themselves up as well as they could . They followed the little stream toward the cave , a quarter of a mile away , bickering  | crossly with each other , disillusioned with themselves and with all the world . They grew more acrimonious as they went along . When they arrived at the cave they found evidences that Cherry had been using it as her bower and temple ; she had fixed it up as an outdoor meeting place for herself and her lovers . This contributed to their anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Pretty soon they came to blows , and they fought each other with as much vigor as if there had been some cause for their fighting . They went into a clinch and wrestled , and as they whirled each other round and round Jack was seized with a sudden thought . " We 're not fighting each other , " he gasped , letting loose of Fatty . " Huh ? " said Fatty , willing enough to quit . " We 're not really mad at one another , " said Jack ; " we 're mad at ourselves  --  each of us is mad at himself . " Fatty got the point . " Yes , " he said slowly and consideringly , " we 're sore at ourselves because we did n't have the nerve to tackle old Clem Salters . " They looked at each other , embarrassed and shamefaced . " Just a couple of damned fools , " said Fatty . They both laughed and went once more to the creek and washed up  --  it was a rather dirty afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his discovery that they had not been fighting each other , but each had been fighting himself , that Jack made his verses  --  he felt somehow under the necessity of lifting the emotions of the miserable afternoon out of the mud in which they had wallowed , before the mud could dry upon them . He objectified the thought that he had been battling with himself , he romanticized and deepened the experience , and wrote : I was the avenger ; Hotly I chased my quarry Through the thickets ; At the blind end of a ravine The brute rocks penned him  | And flung him back to me ; And with a sniffling sob And writhen arms lifted to cover his face He stood shaking , Waiting the death he dared not envisage . Into his sick entrails I drove the broad blade .. . And when he fell I saw the upturned face : It was mine own ! He signed his poems in the Banner with his initials only . But modesty , or fear of ridicule , was unnecessary . Not more than four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , ever paid any attention to them , as far as he knew .  | EVEN BEFORE the " Sarcophagean Sonnets " were finished Miss Emmeline Paisely was fluttered by the fear that her muse would be obliged to turn again from death in general to death in the particular instance . Miss Paisely called on Aunt Matilda , who was ill . Miss Paisely , to do her justice , was not an unkindly soul . She never suspected that her calls upon the sick and ailing had anything depressing inherent in their very nature . And if she sometimes called and found her  --  her  --  how shall it be put ? Not her patient , surely . Nor yet her victim . Say , prospective subject , then . If Miss Emmeline sometimes called and found her prospective subject almost in the article of death , is she to be blamed for being a bit forehanded and going from the sickroom directly to the chamber in which her threnodies were composed ? Miss Paisely was no facile bard , to dash off an obituary poem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand days of unremitting toil . Miss Emmeline had a very positive notion of the dignity of her art ; she was seldom willing to spoil promising funereal verses by haste ; she was a slow poet . In short , if an obituary poem were to be published in the Banner the same week that its subject died , Miss Emmeline must have an early start . Once or twice she had started almost too early ; artistic enthusiasm had betrayed her . This was notably so in the case of Uncle Lemuel Parsons . She called on Uncle Lemuel , who was eightyeight years old and ill with a variety of diseases , and she did not think by the looks of the old man that he could live forty-eight hours . Grieved and full of sorrow for Uncle Lemuel , she wrote his poem . But Uncle Lemuel was a rather touchy old gentleman ; the sight of Miss Paisely angered him ; he referred to her as a " damned buzzard "  | and vindictively vowed to live to be a hundred , just to spite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him an interest in life ; on the day when the whole village had expected him to die he sat up in bed and demanded a poached egg . He lived four years longer . Two days before the Banner went to press , in the week when Uncle Lemuel was to have died but did n't , the Simpson twins were drowned . Miss Paisely made some hurried changes in the poem that had been intended for Uncle Lemuel , entitled it : " Lines in Memoriam for Angel Ralph and Cherub Rufus Simpson , In Death as Birth They Were as One " ? Miss Emmeline , like Wordsworth , sometimes got a great deal into her titles and subtitles  --  and published it . But it was not a popular success . Miss Emmeline was uneasily conscious of her failure , although the members of the bereaved family were too polite to hint their disappointment . She set down her nonsuccess bitterly to hasty work . She resolved then never to rush a poem again . Miss Emmeline was tall and thin , and since her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked with very short mincing steps , and as she moved down the street she looked a little like a closed-up umbrella hopping along . On the afternoon that she visited Aunt Matilda , Jim Shale noticed her as she left the house . He was digging in Dr Stuart 's garden and drew near the fence as she passed the Stuart place and stopped her . " Miss Paisely , " said Jim , " I had n't no idea Miss Stevens was this sick . " " This sick ? Why , what do you mean by this sick , Mr Shale ? " " Why , hai n't you been to see her ? " asked Jim , as if that were sufficient explanation . But as Miss Paisely still looked perplexed he explained further : " You do n't mean to say , Miss Paisely , that the doctors is gittin ' ready to pass her along to me an ' you ? " Miss Paisely looked shocked ; her manner disclaimed the desire to figure in any sort of partnership with Mr Shale .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what you mean , Mr Shale , by passing her along to you and me . " Jim politely removed the quid of tobacco upon which he was chewing , tossed it neatly over his shoulder , wiped the palm of his hand on his thigh with fastidious care and said : " Well , you know the sayin ' around town , do n't you , ma'am ? " Miss Paisely , who had arrived at that age when to hold conversation with any male creature , even a Jim Shale , partook of the nature of an adventure , elevated her nose and indicated , by a dignified movement of her head , that whatever the horrid and essentially common nature of the alleged saying might he , the existence of such a saying was news to her , and not particularly interesting news at that . Nevertheless , her dignity and disgust were not so strong as to compel her to leave . " The sayin ' around town is , " said Jim , drawling as if he enjoyed making the communication , " that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get well . When the preachers begins callin ' , it 's gittin ' serious . But when Miss Emmeline Paisely is seen makin ' ' em a visit , Jim Shale might just as well begin to break ground fer  --  fer the place they 're goin ' to stay in fer keeps , Miss Paisely . " Miss Paisely ejaculated a fluttering and frightened " Oh ! " both mouth and eyes rounding into agitated Os . She looked all about her with quick , jerky turns of the head , as if with some faint idea of calling for help ; and she took two or three frightened hops straight in front of her , as if she might fly away like an elongated crow . But she neither flew nor fled . " Mr Shale , " she said , " how impertinent ! How dare you repeat such talk to me ? " Jim either felt , or successfully acted , complete innocence of any intention to offend Miss Paisely . " Why , Miss Paisely , " said he with an air of willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no call to git mad ! What could you expect ? " Still Miss Paisely did not quite take her departure . " Expect ? " she queried , in the act of hopping a little further away . " Well , " said Jim , applying the salve of flattery , " when a young  | lady 's been knowed and noted for as many years as you have , Miss Paisely , fer a bang-up , first-class , A-i obituary poet , faithful and reg'lar as the preacher and the undertaker theirselves , never missin ' a shot , so to speak , ai n't it reason to suppose that people gits to look onto her as more or less of a sign and a omen ? You got no call to git sore , Miss Paisely ; you orter feel proud so many reads your poetry and clips it out of the paper . " " Clip it out , " said Miss Paisely somewhat breathlessly . " Do they do that ? " " Some does , " said Jim . " Relatives , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Some that ai n't relatives of the departed does , " said Jim . " Who ? " asked Miss Paisely . Jim hemmed and hawed . He was not easily embarrassed , Jim . But he suddenly exhibited something very like embarrassment . He picked up the spading fork which he had leaned against the fence and examined it with every mark of deep interest , as if it were a new thing in spading forks and he wondered if it were really going to become fashionable . He was silent so long that Miss Paisely hopped tentatively away a few feet , saying in a discouraged tone : " None but a relative would cut it out and save it , Mr Shale , I 'm sure of that . " " You 're dead wrong , Miss Paisely , " said Jim earnestly . " I cut some of it out myself . " " Are you interested in poetry , Mr Shale ? " " I 'm quite a reader , " said Jim , " on rainy days . And them there Sarcophagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person in my line of business might get real interested in them , Miss Paisely , could n't you ? " Miss Emmeline , agitated as she had not been in years , nevertheless possessed sufficient presence of mind to smile upon him . It was the smile of flattered genius and it is the same upon the face of a Balzac or an Emmeline Paisely . " If you 're interested in tombs and graves and such things in  | earnest , like them Sarcophagus Sonnets indicates , Miss Paisely , it would give me a heap of pleasure to show you over the graveyard some afternoon , " went on Jim , waxing bold . " There 's a lot about graves , and the way the people in ' em act , that the ordinary run of folks do n't know , Miss Paisely . I 've moved six or eight of my folks down there to different plots in the last ten years . You might find some of that knowledge useful in your poetics , Miss Paisely . " " Mercy ! " said Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not faintly , but vividly . It had been so long since a man had offered to show her over any place , even a graveyard ! She followed her ejaculation with a prim little inarticulate sound that was neither assent nor dissent . " That there word sarcophagus , ' now , " went on Jim , who was supremely happy in the thought that he was holding his own in converse upon the high plateau of culture with a person who dwelt habitually in those altitudes  --  for Jim considered his to be an intellect unjustly denied its due meed of recognition ? " that there word sarcophagus , ' now , is a stem-winder , Miss Paisely . A humdinger ! It had me up a stump , till I borrowed Doc Stuart 's dictionary and looked it up . It 's a jim-dandy word . But I want to ask you something . " Jim lowered his voice and looked around suspiciously . Miss Paisely was frightened at the conspiratorial air which he assumed . " There 's a line every oncet in a while in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkin ' that mebby . . . mebbywell , it set me to thinkin ' that ... " Jim seemed to find it hard to go on ; he had struck an impediment of some sort . Miss Paisely pressed a trembling hand to her black silk bosom . Jim , in a hoarse whisper which seemed to be as rusty as his spading fork and hands and overalls , continued after a gulping moment : " Set me to thinkin ' , Miss Paisely , you might be privately a freethinker . Be you one , Miss Paisely ? " " Mercy ! " Startled and offended , and puzzled as well , the sanctified Miss Paisely was off for sure this time .  | " Now then , ai n't that like a woman ? " said Jim as he gazed after her . " Gettin ' scared over nothin ' and runnin ' off like that ! " There was disappointment in his face : he had hoped Miss Emmeline , for whose talents and powers of intellect he had the most profound respect , was secretly an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a most exquisite jest . As she hopped around the corner she looked back , and blushed when she saw him looking after her . Jim brightened up a bit . He still continued to gaze at the corner which she had turned , and admiration got the upper hand . But there was something else in his expression too  --  a look vaguely resembling the preoccupied , meditative , caressing glance of a tailor who is an artist in his line ; a tailor who is mentally fitting and trying on for some favorite customer . " A long , narrow hole , Miss Paisely would take , " murmured Jim almost fondly , almost tenderly . " Mighty nigh a six-foot grave fer length ; but fer width , two foot wide would be more ' n aplenty space . " When Jim was greatly interested in people he would frequently let his glance dwell upon them in this brooding manner ; it was not an inspection that denoted any desire on Jim 's part to be engaged in the task of preparing a last resting place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of considering people in relation to his profession , as so many artists do . He had been covertly inspecting Aunt Matilda a good deal lately . It does n't cost very much to live in a country town . It cost less in those days than it does now . Before Aunt Matilda died the tendollar-a-week salary which Jack had risen to in the Banner office was more than half of their income .  | Aunt Matilda 's business had dwindled almost to nothing . She no longer had an assistant in the dressmaking shop , or the need for one . There were whole days when she never sewed a stitch , but sat , in the intervals not demanded by her housework , with her Bible in her lap and her spectacles pushed up into her hair , staring out the window . She seldom read the Bible , but it seemed to be a comfort to her to have it in her hands . She was fond of saying that she believed it " from cover to cover . " If there was anything in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of believing that particular thing more vehemently  --  if there can be degrees in belief  --  than any other part of it . Which , when you come to think of it , is evidence of an essentially loyal sort of nature . If believing is a merit in itself , it is certainly more meritorious to believe something that is hard to believe , something that needs a great effort on the part of the believer , than something so altogether credible that just anyone can believe it easily . Aunt Matilda had a constitutional preference for the God of the Old Testament , the God of commandments and sudden , savage punishments . Mr Hamlin , who liked to preach outside of church as well as within , on one occasion held forth to her at length concerning Justice and Duty and Love and Mercy , with the idea of reconciling the earlier Hebrew notions of Jehovah 's character with the New Testament conception of a deity so predominantly loving that he incarnated himself in Jesus , the type of mercy . But Aunt Matilda did n't know exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt any necessity for a wordy attempt at reconciliation . " The God of the New Testament , " Mr Hamlin had said  --  he was a great student of biblical commentaries and talked just like them at times , with little pauses and motions of his finger and forward thrustings of his large nose in place of punctuation marks ? " is above all else a God of love . " " Humph ! " Aunt Matilda had answered him . " If you mean by that that the God of the New Testament does n't believe in punishing disobedience and unbelief , you 're wrong ! "  | " With the advent of Jesus , " continued the preacher , " there was ushered in a new order of things She interrupted him . " Jesus Christ was n't so wishy-washy , " she said indignantly , " as some people nowadays try to make out . " Her mouth set in a grim line . " He was his Father 's own Son ! " She meant it reverently , but the sentence had such a colloquial flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proboscis . " Christ , " said Aunt Matilda with a certain stern relish , " promised plenty of punishment Himself . And when things did n't suit him , he could curse them , too  --  just like his Father ! " The preacher opened his mouth , as if to demur to her conception , but she swept on triumphantly : " Do you remember the story of the fig tree ? " She opened her Bible , found the place and read : " And on the morrow , when they were come out of Bethany , he hungered . And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for it was not the season of figs . And he answered and said unto it , No man shall eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever . And his disciples heard it . . . . And as they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto him , Rabbi , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away . " " There , " said Aunt Matilda naively , " that shows that when Jesus Christ got mad at a thing he could blast it to death , does n't it ? He was his Father 's own Son ! " " But , my dear Miss Stevens  --  " But Aunt Matilda was on a favorite topic , and not to be headed off . She regaled him with every text in Matthew , Mark , Luke or John , in which Jesus threatened ; she loved what she called a " strong Scripture . " " Those that sin shall be punished , " she concluded grimly , " and Jesus Christ says so often enough , though you 'd think to hear a lot of folks talk nowadays that he was a namby-pamby mollycoddle who did n't believe in hell-fire or damnation or justice of any sort ! "  | This conversation took place early in the summer during which Aunt Matilda died . She knew she was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , she named the date , and she was within a week of being correct . And in dying , she even felt a certain satisfaction at having come so near the exact time in her prediction . According to her friends she had been having " spells with her heart " for several years . Dr Young , after a careful examination succeeding one of the " spells , " told her : " There is nothing on earth the matter with your heart itself . Your attacks are due to chronic indigestion . If you 'll eat what I tell you to eat , and not eat so much between meals , it will get better ; you may get entirely over it , and live a dozen years yet . " Aunt Matilda would on no account eat what she was told to eat , or when . She resented the idea that she ate too much  --  and in all conscience she was thin enough . It was one of her favorite fictions , in which she actually deceived herself , that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But really she was " picking and piecing , " as they said in Hazelton , all day long , and without getting any nourishment out of it . She particularly resented being told that her heart was not organically affected . " Heart disease " was so much more importantsounding than nervous dyspepsia or attacks of acute indigestion . Besides , she knew it was her heart . Her " spells " were attended by a smothering sensation , a sharp pain as if her heart had been grasped by a hand and were being actually squeezed and twisted , an inability to get her breath and a numbness in the extremities . " You have attacks of what is called false angina pectoris , " said Dr Young , " as distinguished from true angina . You aggravate the condition by not taking any exercise , by never going out into the fresh air and by habitually overloading your stomach . " He patiently explained the pneumogastric nervous system to her , but he could never get Aunt Matilda to acknowledge any connection  | between her debauches on pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the philosophy of Aunt Matilda a heart was a heart and a stomach was a stomach ; she knew she had " heart disease " because her heart hurt her . And she took to patent medicines , containing anywhere from twenty-five to fifty per cent of alcohol , which nostrums sharpened her appetite temporarily and hurt the old lady 's digestion permanently , exactly as cocktails would have done . " Mind you , " said Dr Young , " I 'm not saying that one of your spells ' ca n't kill you . In fact , if you do n't behave yourself I think you will die in an attack of acute indigestion some night . " After a couple of years of the patent medicine , the " spells with her heart " became more frequent . But Aunt Matilda stuck to her patent medicine and her " pieces between meals , " set the date of her death for the middle of August and sat down by the window to wait for the " spell " which would take her off . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young ; she knew she was going to die of it ; she knew when ; and she hit the date about right . As the old lady sat there by the window she had ample time to review her life . A hint of the thing that was uppermost in her mind came out in a conversation with Jack one afternoon . " Jack , " she said in a matter-of-fact tone , " I 'm going to die inside of a month . " " Why , Aunt Matilda , you know the doctor says " In a few weeks , " said Aunt Matilda , ignoring the interruption with a certain dignity . " And I 've been thinking over a lot of things . " Jack did n't believe she was going to die in a few weeks ; nevertheless , her conviction daunted him . He wanted to " cheer her up , " as the saying is , but he did n't know how to do it . " But , Aunt Matilda ? " he protested . " Hush up , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm talking about ? "  | Jack hushed up and waited , with the uneasiness of a youth who feels that he is going to be made the recipient of some sort of spiritual confidence . It is always uncomfortable to listen to anything in the nature of a confession . Yet the need for confession is one of the most imperative in human nature ; a thing which the Roman Catholic Church , with its long experience , recognizes . " When you get ready to die , " said Aunt Matilda rather helplessly , " you  --  you look back , you know . " Jack felt the impossibility of contributing anything to the discussion and did n't try . " You judge yourself , " went on Aunt Matilda . " And you think , if you had things to do over again , you would do differently . " She paused , and then added : " Probably you would n't do any dif-ferently ! " I 've done a lot of things I should n't have done , " continued Aunt Matilda . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone in Hazelton is , " said Jack with a vague idea of comforting her . " A gossip , " said Aunt Matilda . " And envious . On the whole , rather envious . Not that I ever let it show very much . " She seemed to find a difficulty in proceeding . Jack fidgeted . " You 've been good to me , Aunt Matilda , " he said . " Naturally , " said Aunt Matilda complacently . " I said I 'd do my duty by you . And I 've done it . I never spared the rod when you were a child . If you ever amount to anything , " she continued , looking at him in a self-satisfied way , " it ' 11 be because I started you right and made you mind and spanked a lot of the foolishness out of you . " Under the circumstances Jack did n't like to quarrel with her . He had begun to realize very young the unbridgeable gap between her temperament and his own ; he had never confided any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never felt that she understood him in the slightest degree ; he had hidden all his brighter , inner life from her instinctively , too sure that she would not sympathize with it or comprehend it even to consider sharing  | it with her . So it came to him as a surprise that she actually believed she had been the principal formative influence of his life . " The only thing that worries me much , " said Aunt Matilda , " is the suspicion that I 've been too hard in my judgments on people and things all my life . " She said it with the air of arguing it out with herself . Jack thought she always had been too hard in her judgments , but he politely lied . " There 's no use accusing yourself of that , Aunt Matilda , " he murmured . " What do you know about it ? " said she . " Do n't contradict me ! " Jack subsided . She went on : " Some people would say I was too hard on your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I was . " She had more than ever the air of a person quite willing to reason it out  --  but a person confident , all the same , of victory in the reasoning . " And then , maybe I was n't . She was a fool , your mother was , Jack . " Jack squirmed in his chair . But he made no retort , for he remembered that even if Aunt Matilda were not going to die in a little while , she at least thought she was . He wished that he could get away . " I did n't want your father to marry her . I knew she was a fool the first minute I set eyes on her . I do n't think , on the whole , I was too hard on her . " She paused once more , and when she resumed it was with a sigh , as if she found it impossible to reach a conclusion of her inner debate . " Well , " she said , " whether I have been too hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same set of rules I 've tried to live by myself . " Jack wondered if she had some specific thing to tell him . He did not know how to interrupt the reverie into which she had fallen , to ask her . But presently she looked up , appeared to wake from her musings and guess his unspoken query . " You 'd better trot along back to your work , " she said . " I did have something I was going to tell you all about . But I guess now that I wo n't . I was going to tell  | you to be sure and not fall into my fault of being too hard . But I do n't think you need that advice . Your danger is apt to be the other way . You 're more like your mother . She was too flighty and easy . " Jack departed , hesitatingly . In spite of the anger that he could not help feeling at what he considered the old lady 's gratuitous insults to his dead mother 's memory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But he had never been demonstrative with her . He could n't be now . She did n't expect him to be , he thought . The point that Aunt Matilda almost talked over with Jack , and then did n't talk over with him , was one that had been bothering her ever since she had made up her mind she was going to die . Aunt Matilda , under her hard exterior , had been indulging in the dubious luxury of self-pity for some weeks . Dying is a lonely sort of business . No one can do it for you . But every human being who dies craves some sort of help in getting the thing through with . Aunt Matilda had been thinking what a lonely old woman she really was . She had been wishing Jack were her son  --  one of several sons and daughters . She had been wishing that she had married . That young fellow , the printer whom she had dismissed because he drank , more than forty years before , kept coming to mind again and again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard on him , " she would tell herself . " He really loved me ; if I had married him I might have changed him . I could have changed him  --  but I was too hard ! " That had been the thought back of her conversation with Jack ; but she had found she could not talk about it after all . But the thought obsessed her more and more . She perceived plainly enough that she had really refused life , with all its risks and warmer possibilities ; she actually tortured herself about it at moments . But there would be intervals when she would bitterly defend her course : " Marry him ? Of course I could n't marry him ! Why , he drank ! You ca n't save anyone from himself ! Each person  | has to do his own saving or losing . I did right ! My judgment was right ; why should I be afraid to say my judgment was right when I know it was right ? It usually is right ! I was n't too hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it is odd that this romance of her youth should so suddenly become vital and charged with meaning for her again , after having meant so little for so many years ; but we are seldom done with anything . Least of all is a woman , even so stern a woman as Aunt Matilda , often done with a romance , more especially if it has been the only romance of her life . But she got done with it , in the sense that she found an answer to her debate , a week before she died . She had been sitting out on the front porch in the late summer afternoon , looking up the street , and had seen Jack helping a fellow who had stumbled and rolled off the sidewalk into the gutter . Jack had picked the man up and steered him  --  he was thin , bent , shabby and unmistakably drunk ? around the corner , evidently toward the Banner office . When the boy came home to supper half an hour later she asked him : " Who was that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jack carelessly . " Who is he ? " " A tramp printer , " said Jack . " What is the man 's name ? " she asked . " Boyd , " said Jack , " Billy Boyd . " He repeated aimlessly . " One of those tramp printers , you know . Mr Renfrew says there used to be a lot of them ten years ago . " " Sit down , " said Aunt Matilda . She was still sitting on the porch ; Jack had paused there . He sat down . " Does he drink a good deal , this man ? " asked Aunt Matilda . " All the time , " said Jack , wondering at his aunt 's interest . " That is , he 's drunk as often as he can get hold of the money to get drunk . He 'd trade his coat for a drink . " " A low-lived tramp and rascal ? " said Aunt Matilda . " He 's a tramp , all right , " said Jack , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that he 's a rascal . I do n't believe he 'd steal , that is . We let him sleep in the office . " " Drunk all the time , " murmured Aunt Matilda  | There was an odd smile on her face as she said it . A smile with a tinge almost of triumph in it . She sat for a few moments after Jack had gone into the house . Finally she rose . " I was right , " she said . " I was right in my judgment after all . The man turned into a sot . It was in him to be a sot ! I did right to turn him off ! I was n't too hard on him ! I 'm glad I did it ! " Indeed , it was in her mind that perhaps Providence had sent Billy Boyd to Hazelton at that opportune moment for the express purpose of showing her how right she had been , and letting her die in peace and confidence , without any further self-reproach . This coincidence that Billy Boyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , since tramp printers went everywhere in those days ) seemed to her to partake of the nature of a miracle . A most timely miracle ; for the date which she had set for herself was not so far off now . Yes , surely God had sent him to show her ! It was almost as definite as if God had appeared in person and said to her : " You were right , Matilda Stevens ! " But presently a doubt struck her . There might possibly be more than one Billy Boyd who was a printer and drank . She must be absolutely sure that this was her Billy Boyd before she could accept this as a special dispensation divinely calculated to relieve her mind . " Jack , " she said that evening after supper , " where does that tramp printer sleep in the Banner office ? " " In the boss 's room , " said Jack . " He curls up on a pile of old newspapers . " " And snores and snorts and fills the place with the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-huh , " said her nephew . " But he 's not sleeping there tonight . He 's in the lockup . He fell through one of the front windows of Tom Meek 's saloon , and when Cy Emery picked him up and tried to get him to go into the Banner office , he kicked Cy on the shins . So Cy took him to the calaboose . " Cy was the " city marshal " ; he was thoroughly aware of Aunt  | Matilda 's importance in the village , and would , no doubt , do anything he could to please her . " You go to Cyrus Emery , " she said after a moment 's thought , " and tell him to send me the keys to the calaboose . Tell him I want to talk to the man locked up there . " She knew it would be all over town by noon the next day , but she was not the sort of person to care about that , once she had made up her mind . But she might as well give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to say something . " Tell him , " she said , " that I used to know this man , years ago , before he was a drunkard , and that I want to talk to him about his way of life . " This was , as far as it went , true ; and it was sufficiently like the things she was in the habit of doing to satisfy Cy 's curiosity , and that of the people he would tell it to . Jack did not like the mission , but he found Cy Emery loafing around the hotel and was back in twenty minutes with the keys . Jack accompanied his aunt to the lockup . This sat near the edge of the village , not far from the railroad track , and it was a good half mile from Aunt Matilda 's place . The old lady was compelled to lean heavily on Jack 's arm , and she murmured to herself nearly all the way , which vaguely alarmed the boy , as he had never heard her talk to herself before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the railroad switchyard and right-of-way , she found pretty hard going , and stumbled more than once . A dim light shone through the dirty barred windows of the calaboose , and nothing could have looked more forlorn and wretched than this little building surrounded by ashes and cinders , old cans and bottles , all the rusted junk and debris of a village dumping ground . It was not more than thirty feet square , and it had originally been painted that same peculiar uninspiring reddish brown so much affected by railroad companies for their tool houses and freight depots . Tramps , loafers and bad boys of the village had carved and chalked unseemly symbols and smutty legends all over its outer walls . A rusted and broken stovepipe stuck out of one corner of the roof , at an angle of blackguardly jauntiness , like a mangled cigar butt out of a hobo 's mouth .  | The space inside the building had been divided into two portions by a row of iron bars . The inner room was the cell , and it contained two wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , a chair , a water pitcher , a slop jar , and little else . In the outer room were a large potbellied iron stove , a heap of soft coal and a shovel in one corner , a coil of heavy rope , several spades , a long and heavy iron poker for the stove , picks and other tools which were the property of the village , and a pair of rusty iron handcuffs of prodigious size hanging upon a nail . When Aunt Matilda and Jack unlocked the heavy outer door and went in , they discovered the man behind the row of bars playing solitaire . Cy Emery had given him a kerosene lamp , warning him that if he were so careless as to set the place afire he would certainly burn to death before anyone could get him out . The man had the lamp on the chair and was sitting on one end of his bunk with his feet crossed like a child , and the cards spread out in front of him . The prisoner was frightfully nervous . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been making a desperate effort to control himself mentally by fastening his attention upon the cards . When Aunt Matilda and Jack approached the bars , he jumped from the bed and peered out at them , trembling . He was a man in his late sixties , and , unkempt and unshaven though he was , the structure of his head and features spoke of anything but a bestial character . A deep cleft down his forehead and between his eyes suggested both thought and despair ; his mouth was weak , but nevertheless around its corners some individual and ironical humor had graven its characteristic lines . He was a shattered ruin , but he was not a tough . " Are you Billy Boyd ? " said Aunt Matilda , moving directly toward her point , as always . At the woman 's voice he picked up the tin lamp with its smoky chimney , held it above his head and tried to look at her . He was , indeed , so fluttered from his debauch , and so apprehensive of the advent of a delirious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | his senses . He was not quite sure that anyone had come into the place , after all . His hand shook , and the kerosene lamp threw its light in shaken washes of yellow over his own bald forehead and over the thin white hair of the woman who stared at him through the bars . Ironically these two were golden-haired as youth for a moment ! " It is a lady , " he murmured finally , and placed the lamp upon the chair again . Jack , who hung back looking and listening among the shadows , he had not noticed at all . " It is a lady , " he mumbled again , and , sitting on the bed , he pulled his shoes on over his bare feet . It was a warm night , and he had been sitting with his shoes and socks and coat and shirt off . The impulse to make himself presentable before a lady possessed him ; but when he picked up his coat he was so flustered and confused that he took it upside down . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius . He picked it up and looked at it stupidly ; he opened it and seemed about to start to read it , when Aunt Matilda spoke again . " You do n't know who I am , do you ? " She was n't sure of him at all , now that she had seen him ; and she must make sure . That was what she had come for . Recalled to himself again , he thrust the volume in his pocket . He hiccoughed and then took hold of his shaking underlip between his thumb and finger as if to steady it , with that gesture of the confirmed alcoholic which is at once so repellent and so pathetic . " I 'm sorry , ma'am , " he said apologetically , trying to pull himself together . " I ca n't say that I do recall you , just at the moment . " He politely endeavored to suppress another hiccough . He added : " I 'd ask you to sit down , but there does n't seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Billy Boyd , do n't you remember Matilda Stevens , whom you used to know years ago in Vancetown , Ohio ? " " I get around a good deal , and I meet a good many people "  | he began to say in his apologetic manner . And then he stopped short . " Stevens ? " he said , frowning . " Stevens ? " She waited for him . " Did you have a son who was a preacher , Mrs Stevens ? " he asked . " And a daughter ? " " I 'm not Mrs Stevens , " she said . " I 'm Miss Stevens . " She paused , to make sure that his wavering mind was for the moment fixed . " The preacher was my brother . I 'm the daughter . " " Stevens , " he murmured , and it was evident that recollection was coming to him . " Uh-huh ! Stevens ! The Stevenses used to run the town ! " He meant not the town he was in now , but the town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her , frowning and trembling , and sat down on the bunk again . Presently he covered his face with his hands and sat there and shook , and tried not to hiccough . She looked through the bars at him , unconsciously taking hold of two of them in her hands and pressing herself against them , while the shawl fell back from her head and the light from the kerosene lamp in front of her turned her strong face to a parchment color . She wished now that she had not come . She had come with no charitable impulse ; she had come to make certain that this worthless tramp whom she had seen stumbling and falling upon the street was the youth she had rejected more than forty years before . She had come to justify that rejection to her selfrighteousness , to be able to tell herself that she had not been unjustifiably harsh in that old day ; that she had been right . Now that she was here , her motive for coming seemed mean and unworthy and despicable to herself . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to reject this man ; but she was getting no sense of triumph out of it at this moment . Only pity . Pity for him . Pity for herself . Pity for the years that were dead to them , without ever having been alive . She had loved him , and she had turned him away , harshly , and he had come to this . She might have reclaimed him ! The emotion that was upon her suddenly made her see the bowed figure upon the bunk , not as it really was , but with some far-off , faint , remembered aura of  | the man 's vanished youth . It came to her that she owed him a life . ... If she were not going to die . . . She sobbed ... . The man looked up and frowned at her across the smoky lamp . " I k-know you n-now , " he stammered . " S-Stevens . The S-s-t-tevenses ! Why d-do n't you g-go ? " " Oh , " she cried out , sensible that his voice , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of it . " Oh , it was all my fault ! All my fault ! If I could only marry you yet , and make a man of you ! " He reached forward with a quick snatch , as if afraid she would get it first , and seized the lamp and blew it out . " G-go ! Go ! " he shouted . And , " All my fault ! " she cried in reply . For a strange moment the place was full of their confused cries mingling in the thick dark that stank of kerosene smoke . " You 're everything I 've always hated ! " he screamed . But she was not listening ; she was crying : " I owe it to you ! I owe it to you . " She began to try to pray , standing there in the dark and sobbing . " Go ! Go ! " shrieked the man behind the bars . " Or I 'll break through and kill you ! " He picked up his chair and began to beat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to her through the stinking blackness and the hysteria that filled the building , and took her home . The implications of the scene were not lost upon the boy . He knew that he had witnessed an incident violently illustrative of the essential defeat of his aunt 's life ; he even guessed that if these two had married violent scenes must have happened to them years before . It gave him a sharp and overwhelming sense of the queerness and complexity of human existence . It was funny , too ? that was the way he put it to himself , as he guided the old woman to their home ? " funny " to think that Aunt Matilda , even Aunt Matilda , had been in love once ! Indeed , in a way , she still was . He perceived something of her pathos .  | When Matilda Stevens was gone , old Billy Boyd began to weave up and down the hot , close place like an animal in a cage . And that is precisely what he felt like . Yes , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman must have been , and that he had once made love to her  --  had promised to marry her  --  and how the Stevenses had started at once to dominate his young life ! The Stevenses ! They had constituted the first impulse that had sent him fleeing from settled and stuffy respectability . And he had been fleeing them and their like ever since . Matilda Stevens ! He recalled now the evening he had deliberately filled himself with liquor and breathed it in her face ! That had finished that affair , as he had meant that it should ! With the thought he rummaged under the pillow of his bunk and found the quart bottle of liquor he had placed there . Cy Emery had had no objection to his having a quart in his cell with him , as long as he could pay for it . Cy had even bought it for him and brought it to him , charging only the very moderate fee of two drinks for himself . Boyd had known he would need that quart to sober off on if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger point one little drink at a time . But now he took a big drink , and then another one , and it did anything but soothe him . It began to excite him all the more , to contribute to the disintegration of his nervous organism . He lighted his lamp again with fumbling hands , and his cell looked more like a cage than ever . Liberty , or at least the illusion of it  --  that had always been the great craving of his life . He had never tied himself down , he had never let himself ( except on a few rare occasions such as this one ! ) be shut in . He had followed his trade wherever the English language is spoken and English types are set  --  South Africa , California , India , the Yukon , London , New England , Montreal , Texas , New York , Australia . Deck passage or steerage , blind baggage or sidedoor  | sleeper , tramp schooner or shank 's mares  --  it had been all one to Billy Boyd , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vagabondage there had grown stronger and stronger in him an almost superstitious dread of anything like a settled existence ; a house in which a steady family dwelt was , to him , like a trap to a fox . The orderly , respectable life of the ordinary citizen  --  he turned pale when he thought of it ! He tilted up the bottle again and thought of some of his narrow escapes . These Stevenses , when he was a young fellow , who had started out to oversee every department of his life , even before he had married the girl  --  that had been a close call ! He took another drink , and thought of other close calls . He took more drinks ? and more of them . Until presently , between the old liquor that was in him , and the fresh liquor that he was adding to it , the man became almost wild . His mind for many hours had been hovering near the verge of an alcoholic hysteria , and now it passed beyond the verge . He lashed himself up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last ! The things that he had been running away from all his life had finally trapped him , were closing in on him . In his broken mental condition the physical limits of the little jail became the actual limits of the world he was going to have to live in hereafter . What had that woman said to him ? That it was her duty to take charge of him and make him over  --  make another man of him ? Yes , that 's what they were going to do  --  they had him in a trap at last , all these smug , conventional , respectable people who had been always chasing him  --  and now they would come and mock him in his trap ! This woman would come again and get him ! He imagined now that it was she , personally , he had been running away from all his life , although he had really not thought of her before in many years . But in the rapid pictures of his wandering existence which raced through his disordered brain , she now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , pursuing , pursuing . What was it she had said she was going to do with him ?  | He could n't remember . . . Lock him up somewhere . . . lock him up ! But he was locked up , now ! He became frenzied , and dashed himself against the bars . They were going to come and get him , now , any minute , and do something with him  --  that woman , and all the people like her  --  hundreds of them  --  thousands  --  millions of them  --  the night outside was full of them  --  full of them  --  stealing nearer and nearer , through the darkness . . . nearer and nearer . . . He screamed , but the people out in the shadows pretended not to hear . They were crafty ! They were cunning ! Well , he would be cunning too ! They should n't get him ! He needed another drink . Then he could think more clearly , he could think how to fool them ! There was nearly a pint of liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into himself with one prodigious gulp . He laughed , for he realized at once that it had made him cunning . Again he could hear the people outside stealthily creeping closer  --  but he would n't be here when they got in ! He 'd made his plan ! They should n't find him ! With a shaking hand he thrust a leg of the chair which he had broken to pieces through his bars , and got the end of it engaged with the looped handle of the long iron poker which lay beside the potbellied stove . With infinite patience , moving it as quietly as he could , an inch at a time , so that the sly multitude outside should not hear , he worked the handle of the long poker within his reach . He snickered with satisfaction and self-applause as he grasped it . Five more minutes of careful work , and he had used the poker to hook the coil of heavy rope from the wall outside the bars , and had drawn it into his cell . He climbed on his hunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars of the high little window , tied a loop around his neck and , just as his enemies began to whisper and mumble and close in upon the building , jumped off the bed . It was his impression , as he died , that he had been too clever for them all .  | When he was sure that his aunt had gone to bed , jack quietly slipped out of the house again . He was filled with a curiosity about Billy Boyd . He slowly made his way across town toward the calaboose again . He had not definitely made up his mind whether he would talk to the old man ; but he was drawn to look in and see him . Billy Boyd had broken away from Aunt Matilda in his youth , and Jack was perceptive enough to realize that the man must have spent his life running away from the things which she stood for . But when he got near the calaboose , it was dark , and everything was quiet . He supposed that old Billy Boyd must be asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little building . He did not know that the tramp printer had already killed himself . There came no psychic emanation from the forlorn , dirty structure to indicate that a human spirit paused there for a moment , looking on the rust and wreckage of its discarded body , before tramping on into the infinite  --  an odd little hobo ghost that had often comforted itself with the reflections of Marcus Aurelius . But from the quiet and darkness there did come to him the sense that there was no further struggle going on in that immediate vicinity . He went back home and got into bed , and before he went to sleep he wept a little , for he was an emotional and sentimental youth ; he wept because he saw , dimly , that his aunt Matilda 's harsh and sterile life had not been , after all , exactly the kind of life she had planned for herself when she was a young woman . Aunt Matilda herself had a bad night . But when she finally got to sleep she slept late  --  late for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine o'clock in the morning . When she awoke it was with the pleasant sense that she had done something particularly nice for somebody . She could not at first remember just what it was that she had done , nor in whose behalf she had been active ; but the impression that she had been beneficently occupied with somebody 's affairs was strong upon her .  | Presently she remembered Billy Boyd , and her visit . Her mind at once began to work on plans for his reform , She regretted that she was not going to live long enough to take charge of the rest of his life . But something could be done in the little time that remained . She would have him out of that cell this very day . She would have him cleaned up , make him sign the pledge , get him a steady job at the Banner office and turn him over , so to speak , for the rest of his existence to the little group she had already selected to carry on in the village after her departure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was all there was to it ! It was about ten o'clock when Jack brought her the news that Billy Boyd had hanged himself . The body had been found by Cy Emery when he went to take the tramp his breakfast , and the whole town was most agreeably excited by the incident . Jack had thought it better to tell his aunt himself , rather than let her get the news from some other quarter ; he feared for the effect upon her and dreaded the job of telling her . It was plain enough to Jack that her visit the night before had been the immediate cause of the suicide , and he thought that he was going to witness some terrible eruption of self-reproach , selfrecrimination . He was mistaken . Nothing of the kind occurred . He should have known his aunt Matilda better . Her mind leaped instantly to the very heart of the matter , seized upon it with an almost clairvoyant directness . " Huh ! " she said . " So he 'd rather die than be decent ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions of her mind , almost terrified by this consistency in her character which had immediately found expression in such a withering epitaph for old Billy Boyd . After a moment or two of silent thought she added with a certain grim satisfaction : " It seems I was right about him at first ! I had n't been too hard on him  --  he was that kind of person ! I was right ! " And that important matter being settled , she ceased to worry about it any more , like a sensible person .  | It was not so easy for her nephew to put it all from his mind . Poetic and impressionable , the whole incident graved itself deeply into the stuff of his being ; its yellow light and black shadow washed themselves scenically into the pattern of his nightmares , and the sharp clamor of the cries he had heard that night in the darkness of the calaboose got into the cadence of the verse he was trying to write . But her attitude did not take away from jack 's essential , growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pity that did not make him love her any more , either . It did make him adopt her own point of view that she was going to die very soon , however ; and from that moment he began to think of her as if she had already died . He was not sufficiently analytic to see this as a subconscious wish that she die as speedily as possible now and get that disagreeable business over with . Before she died  --  or rather , while she was dying  --  Aunt Matilda had a further triumph . Her judgment was vindicated once again . She gasped to Dr Young , who was in attendance : " You were wrong , and I was right ! Right about the date  --  and it is heart disease ! " The doctor did n't feel like quarreling with her , under the circumstances . He reflected that , in the end , whether it is an organic affection of the heart or acute indigestion , it comes to much the same thing : we all die of being ourselves . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her nephew . " I did think , " she managed to say between her paroxysms , " I wanted you  --  to be  --  a preacher . But youwould n't  --  have stuck . Too soft ! All of ' em  --  too soft  --  these days ? preachers  --  too soft  --  everybody  --  too namby-pamby ! Wishy-washy ! " And with this final definite assertion of her point of view Aunt Matilda 's spirit departed from among the comedies of this bewildered planet to meet ( for all anyone knows certainly to the contrary ) the dignified approbation of an anthropomorphous deity ? or ( for all anyone knows ) the ironic levity of Caroline Peters . Certainly  | if there is any poetic justice mingled with the lyric progress of the stars , Caroline Peters should have had her chance near Matilda Stevens ' deathbed ( even though the obligation of invisibility were laid upon her ) since Matilda had been so uncomfortably dominant in the neighborhood of Caroline's.  | IT SOUNDS BRUTAL  --  and perhaps it was brutal  --  but it was true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberation . He struggled against it ; he felt ashamed of it ; he did not admit it to himself ; nevertheless , there it was . Youth turns away from death and disease and sorrow ; it can not , unless it is forced , hold its attention to them . Aunt Matilda , in her own way , had loved jack . He had acquired the habit of saying that he loved her ; but in reality he had not . But he wondered about himself , and was shocked at himself , and considered himself a monster , when he began to experience a sense of freedom immediately upon her death . It is , truly , rather a ghastly thing to think of  --  if you pause to think of it  --  that here was a woman who had spent a great part of her life trying to do what she thought was right , and after she was dead the person she had loved best and done the most for felt , in spite of himself , liberated . Jack stung himself with self-reproaches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain of the self-inflicted laceration was grief . He worked himself into an emotion because he did not feel her death as deeply as he thought he should have felt it ; and under the stress of this emotion he made an expiatory resolve  --  he would become a preacher , after all . That was what she had wanted of him , before she began to consider him unworthy of it , and that was what he would do ! That was what his father , he thought , would have wanted of him . And he would be worthy of it ! He called on Mr Gage at the bank . Gage , who was now getting along toward fifty , had just returned from a business trip to St Louis , in which the usual woman had been mixed up , and he was feeling , if possible , more genuinely drawn toward the righteous life and its devoted practitioners than ever .  | " You remember saying to me several times " ? for Gage had repeated his original offer more than once ? " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , Mr Gage ? " Gage 's handsome face lighted up ; here was a chance , right here , to do something fine ! He was humbled because of his most recent sins . He had been thinking , before Jack came in , of doing something for Miriam Hamlin . He would have liked to see that girl well dressed , well fed , making trips to the city for the theater , going to dances , amused , happy ; he was sure that it would bring out beauty in her . But he did not dare do anything for her ; it would certainly be misunderstood in Hazelton . He might even  --  he knew himself so well ? eventually become confused as to his own motives . He did not know whether he even dared to give her the place in the village school from which Miss Paisely was about to retire . But here was Jack , needing something . Mr Gage beamed . " I surely do , jack , " he said . " I 'm going to take you up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same college from which his father had been graduated , he said  --  Calvin College , located in a small city thirty or forty miles distant  --  and he would no doubt need a year in the preparatory academy attached to the college before he could matriculate , as he had quit school before he was sixteen to go to work . He had figured it all out ; he would need a small loan to start with , but he could undoubtedly find work in the college town , and he would continue to work for Mr Renfrew during his vacations . " Listen , Jack , " said Mr Gage when he had finished , " do n't go to Calvin College . I 'll send you East . I 'll send you to Princeton , if you like , or Harvard , if you 'd like that better . " " But , Mr Gage " began Jack and stopped . He thought it was too much ; too great an obligation to incur . But he did n't like to seem ungrateful in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin on a sum that would startle many college youths today . Finally he said : " Mr Gage , I 'd really like to go to the college my father went to . " Gage understood that readily enough . But he murmured :  | " You 'd have more fun at one of the big , old Eastern universities . " " Well , " said jack , knitting his brows and speaking to himself , " I 'm not going for the fun of it , exactly , you know . " The next instant he flushed , for it sounded like a rebuke ; he felt that he had spoken like a prig . " You 'll make a mistake if you do n't get some fun out of it , " said the banker , " as much fun as they let young preachers have , anyhow . And do n't work your way through college , jack ! You can keep up your classes and make your living . But you ca n't do all three at the same time  --  classes , outside work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when I went to college . They missed out on most of the fun . " Several of his own popeyed children were in college  --  or had gone to college  --  and they had seemed to be willing to concentrate on the fun while they were in school . And yet there was one thing about his children he liked : they all showed an eagerness to get into business for themselves , and a knack of succeeding at it . Gage had been that way himself . His father had left him the bank when he was little more than a boy . Now , besides the bank , he owned a half interest in the hotel , one of the local lumber yards , the major portion of the grain-buying business and several farms . More than that , he had quietly bought , some years previously , thousands of acres of land in the Swamp , at very little more than nothing per acre . Drainage on a large scale was beginning in the swamp district , as Gage had foreseen it would ; he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acre sell for three hundred dollars an acre . Dozens of people of all sorts had come to him persistently for business advice since he was in his twenties , and he had given it , kindly and patiently and repeatedly ; he had given so much help , in time and management and money , to so very many people , and had asked so little for it in return , that it always seemed to him that the whole region had been in a conspiracy to force wealth upon him ; the control of many of the businesses which he resurrected and vitalized gravitated naturally into his hands . It was all so easy to Gage that he had no pride about the matter ; the people whom he admired most were not men of affairs ; they were  | people of intellectual achievement and spiritual integrity . He would have liked to see that sort of people doing better financially . It was out of that wish that he spoke next to Jack . " If you go to a big Eastern university , Jack , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting influential people . And that may mean a city church . You do n't want to be a preacher in a town like Hazelton all your life . " " Why not ? " said Jack , who had been feeling humble because of his self-reproaches ; as humble as Gage was feeling because of his latest woman . " Well , " said Mr Gage , " look at Mr Hamlin ! " He had always paid part of Hamlin 's salary ; he would have paid all of it , willingly enough , except that he believed it good policy for the rest of the congregation to have a little financial interest in the church . " Hamlin is a good man , but  --  well , he just barely gets along . " Gage had raised Hamlin 's salary several times , but the preacher and his family remained shabby . Mr and Mrs Hamlin had a mania for giving things away ; they subscribed money to missions , foreign and domestic , that would have been much better spent on clothing , in Mr Gage 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr Gage . " You always have , " countered Jack . " I 've had to , in a way , " said Gage . " I inherited property here . All my business interests have been here . They kept growing on me . I 've known how to handle things here . Maybe , in a big city , I would n't have done so well . . . all that rush and strain and bustle ! But just the same , a country town . . . " He joined the tips of his fingers and rocked back in his chair , and thought . Jack said nothing , but waited . " Whatever you do in a country town , " said Mr Gage , " gets pinned onto you . Pinned onto you for life . Always afterwards , you are that  --  and you ca n't ever be anything else .  | " For instance , there 's Sam Walters , the carpenter  --  you know Sam . He 's really a good fellow . One Fourth of July , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town constable . That started the story that Sam was a hard case . He is n't really , but it 's made him one . Made him think of himself that way . Every Fourth of July since then Sam 's tried to lick the town constable . That 's all there is to Sam , in Hazelton  --  he 's just the man that tries to lick the town constable on the Fourth of July , and that 's all . You see ? It 's put that stamp on him . What else he is and does and thinks about , nobody knows or cares . Suppose it had been in a city ; Sam would have got arrested and fined and it would have been forgotten at once . Sam would have had a chance to forget it himself . He could have been all the other things that are in him , besides just the man that tried to lick a policeman . " You see what I mean , Jack ? In a country town you 're what the town decides you are  --  everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city you can be all the things you are , because nobody cares very much about little things . Sam Walters ca n't ever think of himself as anything but a hard case , and so he ca n't ever be anything else . Ca n't ever be the other things that he is . That 's what 's the matter with country towns . " Jack smiled , thinking of himself and not of Mr Gage . " Well , " he said , " I 'll be thought of as a preacher , and I 'll be a preacher . " " Yes , " assented Mr Gage . He sighed . He was thinking of himself . He suddenly wished this boy were this boy 's father . He would have liked to ask him directly : " Do you think my soul is damned to all eternity because I am a hypocrite ? " He would have liked to say : " How can I help being a hypocrite ? I love the church and believe in it . But I love women ? and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sin about it at all ; it all seems so natural and right ! Afterwards , when I think of the church again , I know it must be wicked . " The thing that puzzled Gage was that the times when he felt the most exalted  --  excited in a revival meeting , or something of  | that sort  --  were precisely the times when he was most apt to become attracted to some woman . But he could n't discuss such things with this boy . Nor with Mr Hamlin , really . Why did n't Hamlin come to him , someday , and arraign him fierily and bitterly for his sins ? Why did n't Hamlin scourge him and whip him and force him to his knees in an agony of repentance  --  as Jack 's father had done two or three times ? Poor Hamlin , he could n't do it ! Hamlin had enough courage for most things . But he , Gage , he . . . The banker flushed with shame and could Hamlin do ? He and his family had to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all a damnable mix-up . And this boy  --  would his help make a coward of this boy , and hurt him , as it had hurt Hamlin ? What did the boy know about him , anyhow ? It suddenly became a necessity for Gage to find out . " See here , jack , " he said , " what kind of label is pinned onto me in Hazelton ? What do people say about me ? " The official story that the White Church knew of the town 's richest man , and that Jack knew , and the " better element " generally , was that Gage had been guilty of various youthful indiscretions , that he had repented of them and confessed , and had come back cleansed into the fold of the godly . His trips away from Hazelton were not spoken of among Jack 's intimates , although the churchless heathen in outer darkness were witty on the subject ; Jack honestly attached no significance to them , if he thought of them at all . Jack , embarrassed and red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all washed up and forgiven and gotten rid of , huh ? " said Mr Gage . Jack nodded . Mr Gage sighed again . He wanted to help this boy . He did n't want to hurt him . If he helped him , with money , to become a preacher , Jack must know the kind of man who was helping him , and make his choice . That was only fair . " Well , " said Gage , " I wish it were true . But it is n't . I 'm just as bad after women as I ever was . Maybe worse . "  | Jack looked out the window , and for several long moments there was a painful silence in the banker 's private office . Finally the boy spoke as if he were the older man , and if there was any priggishness in his attitude neither was conscious of it . He wanted to comfort Mr Gage , whom he liked . " You know , Mr Gage , " he said , " I have an awful hard time myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't sleep , some nights . There are four or five girls around town  --  well , you know ? they 're pretty sporty . I have a dickens of a time staying away from them . " It really did give a queer kind of comfort to the older man . " Look here , " he said seriously . " I 'll tell you one thing that 's true . As long as you do stay away from ' em , it 's not so hard as if you ? well , go with ' em . I was about your age when I got to running with them . But if you go with ' em once , after that it 's harder to keep away than if you 'd never started . " " I had an idea maybe it was that way , " said Jack with an equal seriousness . There was another silence , while they both considered masculine frailty and temptations . Jack had supposed that by the time a man got to be Mr Gage 's age the temptation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about that , too , but did not feel at liberty to do so . Oddly enough , the fact that Mr Gage was married did not awaken any especial condemnatory impulse in Jack . He had the poet 's instinctive knowledge that other men of imagination would always crave variety in their experience , whether they resisted the craving or not . He had had no experiences himself , but he craved both experience and variety . He fought the craving , but so far from condemning , he felt sympathy for Mr Gage . Gage was aware of the sympathy . " You know , " he said hesitatingly , " if you were a preacher , maybe I could talk things over with you , and  --  well , maybe if I help you to be a preacher . . . you can help me figure out a lot of things . Maybe we can sort of  --  well , help each other . " It was actually upon this somewhat absurd and sentimental basis that they presently came to an agreement about the help Jack
