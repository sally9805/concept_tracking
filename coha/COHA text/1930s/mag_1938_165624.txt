Most educated U. S. grownups trudged in youth through eight years of elementary school and four years of high school . But in the last 20 years junior high schools and junior colleges have burgeoned . Today , the 8-4 plan , still the rule for most youngsters , is considered old-fashioned by many educators . The up-to-date child rides through his public schooling on a 6-3-3-2 or 6-4-4 model . In the 6-4-4 system ( notable example : Pasadena Calif. ) the pupil spends his childhood in a six-year elementary school , feels his adolescent oats in a four-year junior high , grows to manhood in a four-year senior high which takes in the junior and senior years of the old high school , the freshman and sophomore years of college . He gets a general education until the last two years , then buckles down to preparing for a job or a university . <P> Last week a national commission that comes as close as any body to speaking for the nation 's educators as a whole , formally condemned the 8-4 plan , recommended 6-4-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was the National Education Association 's Educational Policies Commission . The report* was written by fat-jowled. conservative Professor George Drayton Strayer of Columbia 's Teachers College . Prime argument for this plan , which has long been championed by University of Chicago 's President Robert Maynard Hutchins , is economic : it neatly disposes of the generation of youths between 16 and 20 , who once went to work but today are at loose-ends , unable to get a job and not keen for college . <P> <P> *The Structure and Administration of Education in American Democracy-National Education Association , Washington .
