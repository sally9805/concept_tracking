For 18 years bearded old Jacobus J. Jonker got poorer , greyer and dingier washing South African gravel in the prospector 's enduring hope of someday finding a diamond as big as an egg at his feet . Three miles away from his miserable diggings at Elandsfontein another prospector had found the Cullinan Diamond , big as an orange , one hot January day in 1905 . A $5,000 find several years ago enabled Jacobus Jonker to hire a black Kaffir boy to do his digging . One of the Jonker sons was watching the black one day last week when the Kaffir threw his hat in the air , screamed : " Good baas master , I found it ! " <P> " It , " a flawless blue-white diamond big as a small egg ( 726 carats ) became at once the world 's No. 4 diamond. * <P> Said Jonker next day : " I entrust everything of value to my wife . That night we bound the diamond in a cloth and tied it around my wife 's neck . I saw her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors except the front door . There my two sons , myself and two friends kept guard with loaded revolvers until dawn . Then I handed the diamond for safekeeping to the manager of the Premier Diamond Mine . " Hastily last week Prospector Jonker sold his precious find to Sir Ernest Oppenheimer , board chairman of South Africa 's Diamond Corp. , Ltd. , for $312,000 . <P> Digger Jonker planned to buy first a top hat and frock coat , then a sheep farm , then " a good present for Johannes , " the Kaffir who screamed " Good baas ! " <P> Experts last week christened the new diamond the " Jonker Stone , " guessed that it may be a lost chip off its onetime neighbor , the Cullinan . The Cullinan made nine big stones of which the two biggest are now in the King of England 's sceptre and crown . <P> *No. 1 , Cullinan ( 3,025 k ) ; No. 2 , Excelsior ( 969 k ) ; No. 3 . Great Mogul ( 787 k. ) .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
