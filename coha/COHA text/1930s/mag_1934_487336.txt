0NCE upon a time the United States adopted a Constitution , generally credited , and I believe rightly , with being the greatest document of its kind in world history . It was not , however , perfect ; many of the provisions in it were changed from time to time , and many others were construed in the light of later developments in a vastly different way from what was at first intended . The important historical fact , however , is that America adopted the Constitution , achieved more perfect union , measurably established justice , provided for the common defense , and accomplished certain other things which it had become necessary to accomplish . I think the young country did a great job when it adopted that Constitution . I would even go so far as to say that the greatest thing about the Constitution was its adoption ; for until we decided to have a federal government , we could n't possibly have a good federal government . There were issues . There were sharp differences of opinion . There were those who placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who felt that everything depended upon State and local rights . Both groups , however , had sufficient statesmanship to perceive that the adoption of one basic , nation-wide code was necessary . America was then an agrarian civilization with a superabundance of land . In the course of time America became an industrial country , with the unique possession of industrial resources sufficient to provide everybody with a standard of living higher than many of the rich could have had in previous civilizations . But everybody did not enjoy any such standard of living . Even in good times wealth was badly distributed . Then the depression arrived , and millions of Americans had nothing whatever , except hand-outs from charity . The masses could n't buy the products of our machines , and there was now no land upon which they could settle and produce a living for themselves . Even many of those who were settled on the land could not make a living out of it because enough people could not buy what they were raising ; and in the century of transformation from an agrarian to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living in the old agrarian way . From a humanitarian standpoint , it is obvious that such a situation was intolerable . Also from a social standpoint ; for no social stability , assuredly , can be maintained if great masses of the population are deprived of the means of life . There is , however , another standpoint . This was a business civilization and business was in a bad way too . Until our machines had become so marvelously productive , the average business man could think and plan largely in terms of the community in which his business was located ; and even in business depressions he could sell to those who had money and extend credit to those who were hardest hit , and could often manage so that both he and the community were able somehow to weather the hard times . With the coming of mass production , however , these community limits all but dis-appeared . Business after business was now conducted on a nation-wide scale . Our industries had become so productive , in fact , that they could not be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the masses , obviously , unless they were employed , could not . From the business standpoint , therefore , it was imperative that something be done to provide the masses with buying power . Some employers had come to see the economic necessity for high wages , and for higher and higher wages as better and better methods resulted in more capacity to produce . But this had not solved the problem . For the average employer was not a social scientist , and could not be expected to be . Many of those , moreover , who could see the advantage of a high wage level could not pay high wages for fear of losing a trick to some competitor who could not see it . Nevertheless , from all standpoints the situation was intolerable . There had always been more or less trade in the old agrarian days , but when trade was interrupted , life could still go on . Now , when the mechanism of exchange broke down , everything broke down . Our whole nation had evolved into one economic community , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our economic functions . We prided ourselves on our individualism  --  we who were building up this greatest of all collective enterprises in the history of the world . Our first thought was that any such nation-wide planning of business was unconstitutional , rather forgetting that the Constitution itself was evolved from the necessity of a nation-wide code . When it was suggested that business must discover a method of providing the masses with sufficient buying power to purchase the products of this new mechanism of production , the very creators of that mechanism were shocked . But if we had studied business a little more closely than we did , we might have observed that business for many decades had been furnishing our masses with all the buying power which they had . But business had not done this planfully . It had paid wages because it could n't get labor any other way ; and with those wages the industrial workers had bought enough at times to keep ever so many businesses going . When more was produced , however , than business could sell , business laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the result that business could now sell even less than before and thousands were reduced to want . When the so-called New Deal flashed into our nation 's thinking , it seemed to be mistaken generally for a new theory of society . Many upheld it as a better social theory than any proposed before , while many viewed it with alarm , calling it a violation of our ancient liberties and a regimentation of life under a political bureaucracy . Still others waited to see what the New Dealers would propose ; and the New Dealers proposed a number of measures which these critics did not believe to be economically sound . It seems to me that the New Deal can never be comprehended from any such approach . The New Deal is not a new solution for old problems . It is a solution for a new problem  --  a problem arising from the evolution of machine industry and the evolution of American society from an agrarian to an industrial civilization . Nor is the New Deal to be confused with any one of the experimental measures adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal going . The New Deal , as I see it , is a movement toward a nation-wide economic constitution , because the time had come when it was no longer possible for industry , agriculture , and trade to function in harmony with our American ideas unless we did evolve an economic constitution . If we want to go on with democracy , and I am sure we do , the New Deal points the way . It is , as I see it , the same way in principle as that by which our infant democracy was protected and nourished  --  by the nation-wide organization of democracy under an adequate code . I have , therefore , more than business reasons for supporting the New Deal . I have patriotic reasons , humanitarian reasons , even political reasons , for aside from the question of business profits , I loathe absolutism and dictatorship . As a business man , however , I prefer to keep the discussion within the realm of business . To business , the New Deal is imperative . It is n't a question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Business under any condition mutt have a code . It is merely a question of whether our big-community business can operate under the old , little-community code , and it has been amply proved that it can not . I may seem to speak as if I thought that the needs of business men were paramount ; as if the purpose of human life were to keep business prosperous rather than the purpose of business to supply the needs of human life . But that is not the case . I emphasize the business approach to the problem only because I am a business man ; nevertheless , if American business does evolve a nation-wide code adequate to the needs of business , there will and can be no opposition from any other element in our society . For whatever the details of such a code may be , its basic principle must be nation-wide planning to enable the masses to purchase the output of modern industry . Idealists may be content with a mere equitable distribution of wealth , but business , if it is to be prosperous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses have more and more buying power . There might be an equitable distribution of wealth which would still leave everybody poor , but business can achieve no lasting prosperity now unless the masses enjoy a standard of living which hasscarcely yet been thought possible . Only such a standard of living can absorb the products of machine industry , and only such a standard , therefore , can keep the masses employed . The masses , I know , do not and will not object to that , however much they may have objected to business programs heretofore . In the period when this new industrial machine was in the making , labor and the consuming public were rightfully suspicious of business domination ; and business , to win its points , had to smash through these objections with all the strong-arm methods which seemed to suggest themselves . But that period will be over at the moment that American business comprehends the business opportunities inherent in this New Deal . We shall no doubt differ as to methods and measures , but all of us  --  business men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciously working on the same problem , that of getting buying power to the whole people . Now , as to some of the details of our proposed economic constitution , which so many seem to confuse with the Constitution itself . I am second to none in acknowledging the extraordinary leadership of President Roosevelt , but it has never kept me from questioning a number of those measures . From the very start I could not concur in the suggestion that we must raise prices , and it was hard to understand why almost everybody , including the Administration , seemed to accept price-raising as an immediate objective . I could concede that it might be necessary , as a temporary measure , to raise prices if possible on certain raw materials and farm products . But the great problem , as I saw it , was the problem of enabling the masses to buy more and more , and I argued , and still argue , that people can buy more , other things being equal , if prices are low than they can if they are high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in this new era and promised to find out by fact-finding research and , where necessary , by experiment . The great thing about fact-finding as a method of procedure is that one may start out all wrong and still wind up all right ; whereas , if we follow traditional practices instead of facts , we may start all right , but because of changing conditions we may nevertheless wind up all wrong . I could follow Roosevelt , then , with no misgivings . Price-fixing would go out , I was sure , when it became obvious that it could not solve the problem , and if I am not mistaken , it is already going out . Nor did he try , as many would have liked , to scrap our existing business system and mold one nearer to our utopian ideals . He simply dug up the reasons that our mechanism of trade was not working successfully and proposed action in accordance with these reasons . Some economists , I know , claim that there can be no such nation-wide planning as is now necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capitalism is just a , name we give to describe a certain period in economic evolution . If it does n't fit this new and necessary stage , I think we can find a word to describe the new set-up . I am for the New Deal , then , because I am a business man . I am for the New Deal because I am an individualist , not a Socialist , and because the Old Deal unnecessarily restricted our individual liberties . I am for the New Deal because I believe in profits , and the New Deal opens up tremendously greater opportunities for legitimate and continuous profits , and opens them up to an incomparably greater number of people . When the masses were engaged in digging their living directly from the soil , in their little agrarian communities , traders could make huge profits from exploiting them . But only a few , at most , could be exploiters . Business can no longer look to exploitation for its profits because we are all engaged in trading now , and there is no public which business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be profitable is the doing of things which need to be done and the doing of them by such progressive methods  --  which in general will be mass production  --  that the masses can receive the benefits . Since there is no limit to things that need- to be done , one may almost say that business opportunities will , under the New Deal , be unlimited . Business in the old days had a certain fascination , but it lacked some of the elements of good , clean fun . It was n't fun to hire little children until they were broken by disease or accident , and then bring on a new regiment of children to take their place . Employers , I am sure , did n't like to do that , but business , they were told , was business , and they had to do it because children were less expensive than adults . It was n't fun to have to engage in misrepresentation . It was n't fun to browbeat labor , or to corrupt government to secure those special favors which seemed so necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be decent , and only acted in ways like this because they did not feel free to act according to more humanitarian principles . In other words , business was regimented , and the meanest chiseler in the trade frequently did the regimenting . When he cut wages , they all cut . When he evolved some particularly sharp practice , others thought it necessary to follow suit . I am for the New Deal because it liberates business from all that . Because it frees business from the dictatorship of the chiseler , and eliminates only those practices which are not socially helpful . Nation-wide planning , of course , necessitates restrictions , but so does all social order . To achieve service , we must place a taboo on disservice . To achieve wealth , we must place a taboo on waste . We shall not have to apologize for unsocial actions in the future by saying that " business is business , " for business wo n't be that kind of business any longer . Business under the New Deal will be much more fun . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing various aspects of the New Deal . In the Driftway E 4 VERY so often the front page of the metropolitan press is agitated by the story of another youthful genius . The latest one , an unnamed hero of seven whose intelligence quotient reaches the dizzy heights of 230 ? making Einstein look like a nincompoop with a mere 200 or so  --  is now pursuing his way through school in Brooklyn . When the Drifter reads , however , that the lad is kept in association with children of his own age  --  in spite of the fact that he taught himself to read at two and has demonstrated an astonishing skill at mathematical calculation  --  he reflects that the life of the child prodigy is changing , and one can not doubt for the better . The Brooklyn unknown is being treated at every possible point like any other child . If he insists on being a genius , it will be evidently without any help from his elders  --  and on his own account it is encouraging to note that when he began school he exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a game with other children . CONTRAST this modern prodigy with one of the most famous and most pathetic of all child wonders ? John Stuart Mill . Mill described his own education and did not seem to deplore it , which is very likely the most deplorable thing about it . He recounted , in his " Autobiography , " how he learned Greek at three , how at the same tender age his task for the evenings was arithmetic and for the mornings , in walks before breakfast with his father , he was obliged to relate the substance of the books he had read the day before . When he was as old as four he was reading Hume and Gibbon ; by seven he had read the first six Dialogues of Plato , in Greek of course ; in his eighth year he commenced Latin , not only learning it himself but teaching it to a younger sister ; and by the time he was twelve he had finished a good part of Vergil , much of Livy , Sallust , Ovid , Terence , Lucretius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odyssey , " Thucydides , a bit of Sophocles , Euripedes , and Aristophanes , and he had even embraced Aristotle 's " Rhetoric , " in addition , of course , to innumerable works of history  --  so that when he was ten or eleven he began writing a " History of the Roman Government " ? not to mention elementary geometry and algebra , and had made more or less unsuccessful stabs at calculus and other portions of higher mathematics . It is not recorded that the little boy burst into tears when he was beaten in a game , for the simple reason that he had no time for games . He was permitted no vacations , he learned no sports , he had no boy companions . His father , the mentor and disciplinarian of this stern regimen , would brook no nonsense about relaxation , although for his son 's lighter moments he did borrow  --  not owning them himself  --  the " Arabian Nights , " " Don Quixote , " and the " Popular Tales " of Maria Edgeworth. a result of this welter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a number of books which nobody now reads , although one or two of them are worth reading , and to complete an eminently serious , although perhaps not too unhappy , life . He was not , in short , a genius , or even one of the great English writers . Indeed , the Drifter can not remember any of the great writers who was a child wonder , with the possible exception of Pope . This genius is a mysterious thing , compounded of natural talents , extraordinary curiosity , and great variety of experience . Nowadays educators with a prodigy on their hands are endeavoring to provide a well-rounded training instead of stuffing a young brain with more than it can digest . The Drifter has often suspected , indeed , that we have gone too far in this direction , and that we provide too many games and too little intellectual discipline , not only for our geniuses but for our ordinary children . But for little John Mill one 's heart is wrung . There must have been about two million parents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided news for them , looked at their offspring and remarked more or less pugnaciously : " He may not be a genius but he 'll probably have a better time if he is n't . " To which statistics merely add that he has about as much chance as the child wonder of being a genius after all . THE DRIFTER
