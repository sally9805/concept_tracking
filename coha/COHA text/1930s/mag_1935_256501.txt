KNEEL TO THE RISING SUN-Erskine Caldwell-Viking ( $2.50 ) . <P> The legendary character of the old South , all chivalresque , julepy and magnolious , is still stoutly upheld by such loyal romanticists as Stark Young and Julia Peterkin , but its present reputation has been considerably damaged by the nightmare realism of William Faulkner and Erskine Caldwell . Author Caldwell , particularly , has been almost wholly concerned with telling tales on a part of the South no Southerner ever boasts of-the poor white trash that clutters the South 's backyards . Often he makes his tattered crackers the scarecrow-heroes of wildly ribald yarns , but almost as often they appear as the victims of a reality that is unflattering but recognizable even to Southerners . <P> Critics of Author Caldwell who had begun to think that his zany style was effective largely because of its Rabelaisian grossness last week were thinking again , after reading Kneel to the Rising Sun , his latest collection of short stories . As in all Caldwell books , the phallic content was high-though not so gamy as to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories were more cathartic than aphrodisiac . Some of them : <P> A Negro fieldhand , making tracks across country one Saturday night to see his gal , is shot by a whimsical sheriff because he objects to being run in for vagrancy . <P> A well-fed farmer family lightens the after-dinner lull by laughing at the horrible trained antics of a half-witted Negro boy . <P> Best in the book , and well worthy of inclusion in a U. S. anthology , is the title story , Kneel to the Rising Sun : A spineless sharecropper , whose landlord persistently half-starves him and browbeats him , as he does all his tenants , one night finds his old father missing from the cabin . To help him search he rouses a Negro neighbor ; together they find the old man 's body , half-devoured by their landlord 's hogs . When they wake the landlord there is a quarrel between him and the Negro , which is the excuse the landlord has been waiting for . While the Negro takes to the woods the landlord rounds up a posse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their quarry , shoot him down from a tree . The sharecropper , his stomach full of two horrible deaths in one night , goes home to breakfast , but for once he can not eat .
