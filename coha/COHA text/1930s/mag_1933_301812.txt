Last month one Will Sanders , 16 and black , murdered an old white woman outside York , S. C. Next month Will Sanders will be electrocuted at Columbia . <P> Last week the prosecutor of Will Sanders announced that he will have the corpse trucked back to York immediately after the execution , exhibited all day on the court house steps . His reason : most Negroes doubt that the electric chair kills , believe that its occupants are secretly whisked away to prison for life . <P> The prosecutor 's announcement filled York blackamoors with morbid interest .
