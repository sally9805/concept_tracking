The new Constitution , given to India mainly by Sir Samuel Hoare when he was Secretary of State for India ( TIME , Aug. 12 , 1935 , et ante ) , was tested in its first trial-by-ballot last week . The voting was in what an ignoramus might call " only provincial elections " but several of the Indian provinces involved are each as large as Italy . Out of 350,000,000 people who inhabit India , some 35,000,000 cast the votes counted last week and of these about 6,000,000 were women . It was the claim of Mother Britain , voiced in her London Times , that as nearly as possible the new Constitution arranged that the ballots cast " represent the general mass of the people , depriving no section of the community of the means of giving expression to its opinions . " <P> About 5,000 candidates sought election to 1,585 seats in the new Legislative Assemblies of the eleven provinces of British India . There was , of course , no voting in the Native States ruled by India 's bejeweled potentates . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Hindu , and amid the Indian conglomeration of religions and races and sectional rivalries , this Indian National Congress Party won 715 seats , with returns complete except for eight seats still in doubt . At this Mr. Gandhi last week arose from his squatting retirement in a tiny country village . He literally walked back into Indian politics , trudging seven miles over a dusty road to take part in a Congress strategy committee at Wardha , no short walk for a spindly old fruitarian . <P> Mr. Gandhi retired from official leadership of the Congress in 1934 , but his scrawny fingers have never entirely left the helm . He is Conservative and friendly to Britain by comparison with violent Congress President Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who is always preaching about " Socialism " and has keynoted that for Congressmen to take office under the new Constitution " would inevitably mean a kind of Partnership with Imperialism in the exploitation of the Indian people ! " <P> In ensuing weeks it remains to be seen whether Congress members will sit down in the Legislature seats they have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration due to them under the Constitution - or whether they will adopt " wrecking tactics . " The Constitution was written with both alternatives firmly in the mind of Sir Samuel Hoare . Thus , if the 1,585 Deputies cooperate and join Viceroy Lord Linlithgow in making the Constitution work , well and good . If they resort to wrecking tactics , the Constitution empowers first the provincial governors and ultimately the Viceroy completely to overrule the new Legislatures . At the special Wardha strategy committee last week , Mr. Gandhi was said to be for cooperation , President Nehru for wrecking . The Congress bigwigs who conferred with them were " about equally divided . "
