A LONG LINE OF SOLDIERS A STORY BY MAC KINLAY KANTOR O F THE Daughters of Independence who advanced upon Washington that pale November Friday , two were also the daughters of Dean Lucan Clark , and one was his wife Agatha . In the Clark sedan had come Dean Clark 's granddaughter Constance Boston too , and Dean Clark . The oaks of Arlington wore their bonnets of dry leaves , the magnolias were still green and papery . Lucan Clark took his tongue away from its task of nursing three front teeth and opened his mouth and inhaled a bite of the crisp air as the car crawled upward through the cemetery . " Now , mother , " said Ethel , in the back seat . Dean Clark listened to his wife 's lamenting sobs . " I know it makes you feel that way to come in here , " Ethel continued somberly . " He 'd be thirty-six years old , girls ; think of it ! " Agatha cried . Ethel clicked at him . " Father , I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlington ! " Marietta Boston , the widowed daughter , exclaimed , " Well , my conscience , Ethel , Waldo 's been dead for seventeen years ! " " I want to see the Custis mansion , " Connie Boston told her grandfather . Lucan Clark tried to smile at her ; he was thankful for his ragged gray mustache , which lay as a blanket over his upper lip . " You saw it , Constance , from the bridge . " He added , " By the by , your great-grandfather is buried near the head of this little ravine . " " Is he the one in the library at home ? " " No , in my little study The portrait in the library is of Captain Leavenworth Clark , your great-greatgrandfather , who fought in the Mexican War . He ? " Marietta said from the back seat , " He was slain by the Comanches . Do n't you love the way father always says that , Ethel ? " and even Agatha forgot her grief in a ripple of laughter . Dean Lucan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Custis mansion is directly ahead , Constance . Those ginger-colored walls and out-buildings . " " Why do n't they call it the Lee house , Gandy ? " " Many people do , I believe . " He wished that she would not call him Gandy , now that she was nearly eighteen years old . When she was a tiny child and could not say Grandfather it had been rather quaint . But now each time she said it he felt like a certain breech-clouted East Indian , conducting a hunger strike in prison . " Very few cars , " said Marietta . Her mother gave a final sigh . " On Monday there 'll be all too many . Sometimes I do n't see how I can abide another Armistice Day . " They turned in at the parking area . Dean Clark assisted his family from the car , all except the slim girl in the gay plaid blouse and neat black suit , who had skipped from the car before he set foot on the ground . He stood beside ? the open door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tug as needed . They climbed from the back seat : Ethel , plump and smooth-cheeked , in spite of the fact that she was the elder of the two daughters ; Marietta , nearly as slender as Connie , and their mother , Agatha . Embroidered red badges dripped from their coats , their faces wore the righteous insolence of women who are convening for a Purpose . " Father , that necktie of yours . . . " Agatha dabbed her eyes with a morsel of handkerchief and adjusted her glasses . " You gave him that tie a year ago last Christmas , Ethel ! " Dean Clark smoothed the scorned item of haberdashery . " No , my dear . It was Marietta . " " Did I ? " exclaimed Marietta . " Forgive me then . Really , you 've worn it till it 's positively disreputable . " Agatha declared , " At least , Lucan , you must buy yourself some decent neckties . " They ambled ahead toward the mansion , where Constance was already summoning them . Dean Clark heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . Always , always . . . " Dean Clark remained behind to close and lock the car doors . The sedan looked middle-aged and straight-backed and out of place beside the lean , streamlined cars parked nearby . Nevertheless , it was a sound and faithful servant ; it had brought three Clarks and two Bostons safely over a grinding journey of nearly three hundred miles , from Syrian College , New Jersey . The distance seemed much farther . Dean Clark was tired ; they had arrived nothing was too good for Father Clark , of course , but nobody ever really went much to Arlington Cemetery except old soldiers and people like that . " He was the second youngest brigadier in the Army of the Potomac , my dear , " Lucan Clark had told her . The other place which he liked to visit was made of white marble . It too faced the rising sun . The Potomac breeze went withering against the pristine slab . . sometimes there were fresh wreaths , their blue ribbons blowing in the wind . And forever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and fro . Sometimes he wore the red-striped trousers of the marines , sometimes the half-leather puttees of the cavalry . Sometimes he was of the signal corps or field artillery . And on one memorable occasion he had worn the badges of an infantry regiment . Not , of course , the 165th Infantry , which had gone yelping toward a town called Haazavant in the last autumn of the Great War . Now Dean Clark was opposite the old slave quarters , and a woman came swiftly toward him down the steps of one building . She motioned , waving him back , and touching her lips with a fat finger . Imploring silence , he thought  --  how very odd of Ethel . " What is it , Ethel ? " he asked . Her pink face was tense and determined . " The others are inside . I stayed out to ask you again about Senator Noovan . " " But , my dear girl , I ? " Her soft , powdery lip began to quiver . " Father , do n't you care at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began . " Shhh . You 'll have them all out here , and I do n't want them to know ! Not yet . If I 'm able to come , that is time enough . Father , do you ask me to wear out my years of active life in that awful college library ? " " Pshaw , Ethel , " he said , " you are young . Forty-two or thereabouts . " She wailed , in a kind of frenzy , " I am old . Soon I 'll be too old . Eighty dollars a month , and buried at Syrian , when I might be doing ? I demand ? that you telephone Senator Noovan as soon as we 're back at the hotel ! " Dean Clark felt his thin nails squeezing thin flesh . " But , Ethel , he is not even from our State . He is not from New Jersey . And aside from that , I can not ask a favor from any man whose public practices have shown that ? " She gasped , " Murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about those waitresses and the liquor ? And yet you got his precious son out of that disgusting mess , and nothing came of it . The boy 's entire life might have been ruined ! He would have been expelled and disgraced , and perhaps his father might even have had to leave the United States Senate ! Think , " she exploded , " what you can do for me by one turn of your little finger . " " Yes , " he said , " in the dial of an automatic telephone . " He visualized the college library : it was an ill-ventilated morgue . But he had been happy there , many hours , surrounded by the right sort of books . .. . Ethel wanted to get out . Even being too fat , and Her face was swimming before him , and he knew that there must be tears in his eyes as well as in hers . Though his glasses were none too good any more ; he had been intending to have them changed for a year past . Twenty-two dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the spectacles , and wiped his eyes carefully . He imagined Senator Noovan 's face , a bull 's head roaring from a hundred newspaper photographs . " My dear girl , I shall consider it . There is truth in what you say . " Agatha was calling from a doorway . A LONG LINE They went to walk among the Lee ghosts . Constance stood beside him , and Lucan Clark liked that , partly because she was his only grandchild , and partly because she was very pretty . Her fluffy yellow curls fought their way out from under her flat black hat ; her eyebrows were plucked to a narrow arch ? almost too narrow an arch for the granddaughter of a Dean at Syrian College . " Were the Lees related to the Custises and George Washington ? " He tapped on the wire gate opposite the dining room . " Of course , Constance . I hope you include American History 2 in your schedule next year . That is my class . I shall en-deavor ? " She squealed , " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply superb ! How could Mrs. Robert E. Lee ever bear to leave this place ? " " Quite possibly , " said Dean Clark , " she could n't . The Federal government took it from her ; it was con-fiscated . " Connie pointed . " Mamma . Out at the front door ! Let 's go , Candy . " Agatha and Ethel and Marietta were waiting for them in the shadow of the enormous columns . " Lucan , " cried his wife , " it 's one-thirtyl I have to see if my evening dress is back from the cleaners ' . " He nodded . " I am quite ready . But if you do n't mind , I should like to see if the General 's grave is ? " Agatha sniffled . " Naturally , Lucan . Father Clark , poor soul . We 'll stop for a moment . " They stopped at the General 's grave , parking illegally on one of the winding drives . Lucan Clark went to look at the spot ; there was nothing to scc but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the others remained in the back seat of the car . " Did you think the grave would run away , Gandy ? " He smiled . " Not at all . They 're supposed to keep things in good order , you see , and I merely wished to ? " She examined the monument critically . " Who composed the inscription ? Did you ? Well , do n't you think it would have been a lot better if you 'd left off that part about Private and just said General Osborn F. Clark ? " " He rose from the ranks , " said Lucan , stubbornly . " He was one of the few who did so . Of course , there were the Confederate major-general , Nathan Bedford Forrest , and ? " Connie tugged at his arm . " Come along , Gandy ! Maybe we 'll trek over here again to-morrow and bring flowers  --  while the others are Daughters of Independencing around town . " Then she repeated , " Town , Town , " as if she had just discovered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me ! " " What , Constance ? " She had propelled him back to the car . " Betty , my lad , Betty ! Betty Town ? " " Constance , " said her mother , crisply , " your grandfather is not a lad ! He is Dean Lucan Clark of ? " " 1Tertz ! " Connie cried defiantly . " He 's a lad to me just the same . It was Betty Town , mother ! I totally forgot her . Rosalie made me positively swear to call her the first moment I got to Washington ; I 've got her ' phone number all written down , and Rosalie will be absolutely furious if T do n't call and ten Betty all about the folks in Syrian , and maybe have lunch with her , and so on and so forth . " Amid the splintering of her infinitives , Lucan Clark made out the story . He headed the sedan across the bridge ; he drove with his eyes on the icy apex of the Washington Monument , and on the dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staccato declaration into the laps of the three women who sat behind . Rosalie Town was her dearest friend ; Betty was Rosalie 's eider sister ; she certainly would call up Betty Town if it was the last thing she ever did , for it did n't matter in the slightest to her that Betty was eight years older than she or Rosalie , and already had been married and divorced . Lucan Clark 's teeth ached with the stubborn resolve of teeth which have won their right , through sheer neglect , to devil the very roots of the mind . He discharged his passengers at the north entrance of the hotel on F Street . There was a parking place in the next block , but it seemed expensive . Twenty-eight cents minimum , and dear knew how much per hour . The Dean chugged his way over to Twelfth Street , and south to Pennsylvania , and west again before he found a spot where he could leave the car without fear of accident or fine . Then he hurried against the wind , back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were soaked with tears , and her two daughters crowded close , fingering and clucking over the limp garland of lace which Agatha held aloft . " Ruined , " chanted Agatha , weakly . " Ruined . Absolutely ruined . " Lucan Clark reasoned that here was the hereditary source of Connie 's adverbs . " I ca n't face a banquet in a dress that the cleaners have treated this way . Girls , what shall I do ! " And then she roused herself to seek a white slip of paper , which she handed to the Dean . " It was in our box with the key . For you , Lucan , to call Operator Twenty-two , who has a message for you . " Then she went back to her mourning , and Marietta and Ethel to their advising , until Lucan Clark electrified them all as he stood by thetelephone stand . " The President wishes to talk to me , " he said . They squealed and made other mouse-sounds , and Marietta clutched at her heart , which startled her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be alarmed , " he reproved , while the dozen connections sputtered in his ear and a thin voice rattled , Repeater for Syrian . . . Newark . Newark . Hello Operator Newark in the bulbous tool beside his ear . " My conscience , father ! You gave us a start . " " 1 ca n't see why , my dear child . Some matter of college ? " Agatha chuckled sadly , " President Avery ! " and held the dress against her outflung bosom again . A pipe-organ boomed across the current , saying , " Dean Clark . This is President Ave ' y . " " Good day , sir . " " Dean Clark , we are faced with a serious matter . It began developing yesterday : we are faced with a seventhousand-dollar deficit in the fall building program . As Iong as you are there in Washington this week-end , I should like you to call on Mr. Dolph . You will recall the name : Mr. Gideon Dolph , the oldest surviving alumnus of Syrian College . " Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Certainly . He manufactured corsets . But I should n't like to call on him , sir . " Avery rolled his capacious voice . " Yes . Just so . . .. He is a very wealthy man , Dean Clark , a very wealthy gentleman ! Uh . In this hour of  --  extremity  --  we are apt to feel ourselves impelled toward any haven which ? " " I do not , " said Lucan Clark , " feel myself impelled toward this man , President Avery . It seems that such a matter is scarcely within my province as ? " Somebody squawled something about Newark again , and both he and Avery said Hello-hello back and forth , several times . Rage boiled in Avery 's voice . " Dean Clark , have you ever thought that it might be a very , very wise thing for you to make your own position here at Syrian a trifle more secure ? Has it ever occurred to you that the board of trustees looks with rather scant favor on your activities as chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whatever you pacifists call it ? " " Well , " said Lucan Clark . There was a long pause in which the women kept hissing at him , asking questions . He wondered what Avery 's face would look like , if he , Lucan Clark , were to say calmly , Go to grass .. .. . His lungs seemed breathing against their own will . Shorn of his rank , he could live and be happy , one way or another . Agatha and  --  the girls . He ? Now his house had a red-and-white sign , as he imagined it : For Sale . " I had n't  --  thought of it in  --  just that way , President Avery . " The President said , " Indeed , " which meant that he had , and so had the Board . " You wish me to call on Mr. Dolph ? seven thousand ? " Avery cajoled now . Dean Clark had a friendly and persuasive manner ; he would be an emissary superior to any other person . Gideon Dolph was an invalid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five . When the telephone was no longer an instrument of torture but only a black bracket sitting mutely on its stand , Dean Clark enlightened Agatha and the girls . In the next room , beyond an adjoining bath , Connie was ringing bells of laughter as she talked to Betty Town over another wire . Agatha pursed her lips when she heard Lucan Clark 's explanation . " I can hardly say that this is in your lineof duty . But , after all , Lucan , it would be splendid if you could do this for Syrian after all Syrian has done for your " Syrian , " he wanted to scream , but it was only a shudder in his dry throat , " what has Syrian ? ? " Ethel declared , " Gideon Dolph is rich as Crcesus . He was supposed to be quite a power during the Taft administration . I recall reading , when I was a girl ? " Agatha warned the Dean , " Put on another necktie before you go . Will you call for an appointment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll call for you , " suggested Marietta , " while you 're putting on a different necktie . " She ' phoned , and a man who might have been a secretary said ? reluctantly and after mysterious consultations  --  that Mr. Dolph would be willing to receive Dean Clark of Syrian College . Marietta seemed to feel that the seven thousand dollars were now assured , and by her good offices . Agatha cried , " That necktie is infinitely worse than the ether ! " " Not bad , " he told them . " But  --  as a matter of fact , I have only these two with me . " " Buy one , " said Marietta . They all chorused , " Buy one , buy one . " Even Connie added her clear soprano to the shout . She came from the other room , clicking her rouge into her handbag , her mother 's fur dangling from her arm . " Come along , my lad . I 'll see that you buy a honey . " " Constance Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my silver-fox fur to that Town woman 's home Really , I should forbid you to go . " Agatha said , wearily , " Marietta , let the child run along . After all , it 's only Rosalie 's married sister . " " Divorced sister , " said Ethel . " I 've heard things about ? " Connie promised , " Mothaw love , I 'll nurse it with the greatest of ease . Yes , yes , I know  --  the Mothaw-Daughtah banquet promptly at eight o'clock . Yes , yesl Come on , Gandy . " She went waltzing toward the elevators , but Ethel followed Dean Clark into the hall . She pressed a folded sheet of stationery into his hand . " While you are in the business of interviewing the Powers of Washington , " she said with rare jocularity , " you might try Senator Noovan . I telephoned as soon as we reached the hotel . He 's at the Butchman Park Apartments ; that 's out on Connecticut Avenue . I told them Dean Clark of Syrian College wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , father . " He was white . " Ethel I said I would consider  --  only that . " He set his aching teeth together , and drove them tighter and tighter with merciless pressure . " That dress , Ethel , " he managed to say , when he could control himself , " your mother 's evening dress . She said ? " " I do n't see how she can wear it , Father . This banquet means a great deal to her  --  the whole convention does . She might even be made State Regent of New Jersey . " " Would there be time for her to buy another dress ? " " Assuredly Marietta and I will take her right down . " Dean Clark said , " Then tell her to buy one . " He could say no more than that . " That is thoughtful of you , father . " She watched him with eager , frightened eyes . " And I ? " She twisted her hands together . A great voice clanged in his ears ; he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told Ethel , " I shall see him . Senator Noovan . " She kissed him good-by ; she smelled of sugary powder , not the provocative and acid flower-smell which Constance always carried with her . The red elevator lamps winked and beckoned . " Two have gone by , " Connie cried . " Bet on the third . Yup , here it isl " " Constance , " he said , dazedly , but marching just the same , " I had rather be shot . I mean it ; it would be easier . She hushed him , and they pushed into the crowded car . She squeezed his bony arm . " Do n't you worry , Gandy , " she whispered , " I know how you hate to buy new things . I know you 'd rather be shot . But I 'll pick out this tie for you ; it 'll be painless . And then you can drop me at K Street on your way . " Gideon Dolph was nearly eighty-two years old , and looked something like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber-tired wheels , and a German nurse and an English secretary remained in the room all the while that Lucan Clark was there . " How much you say ? " " Seven thousand dollars , " replied Dean Clark . Mr. Dolph bent the seams of the plaid robe across his knees until two of the green-plaid squares met and matched . " Lot of nonsense , seems to me , gymnasiums , " he said . " Good honest boys go to work in gardens , get strong and husky , way they used to . Worked many day in gardens ' ny was boy . Raised beans . Yah ? Seven thousand dollars . " He thought about the beans for a long time and matched more squares of the blanket . " Always asking for something . .. ca n't get along without . Do n't you think so , Dean  --  what 's the name  --  Dean Parker ? Yah ? " " In this day and age , " said Lucan Clark , " there are few gardens adjacent to Syrian College . We live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to mechanized aids . " He tried to remember what the athletic director had said at Monday chapel . " Records are falling year by year . Athletic records , I mean . The young athlete of to-day is more skillful and hardy than the athlete of earlier generations , and that would not be true if educational institutions did not ? " The Rhesus monkey squirmed and gnashed its jaws . " That 's basis complaint . Not educational , full of nonsense , football games , radios , racketeering . Yes , that 's so . Racketeering ! " " Scholastically , sir , we have accomplished a great deal . Only last year , the Rhodes Scholarship was ? " Dolph was trapped , and took refuge in coughing . The nurse crackled close and did things for him , and cast an indignant sterilized glare at Lucan Clark . " What 's Syrian College ever done for me , Dean Parker ? Yah . Or you ? Starve you on little salary , make slave of you , send you here , pester life out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Mr. Dolph , sir , I do not agree that this is the point in view . It is more vital to consider what we can do , you and I , to eliminate the mistakes of the past . If this present world has been formed as wrongly as you declare , then grant us the opportunity to work for better ? " " Yah , " said Gideon Dolph , " seven thousand dollars , lot of money , think it was a dime , people always come hands outstretched , asking for something , yah . " He snarled and grunted , and tried to make a joke ; his secretary and his nurse laughed obligingly at the attempt . Dean Lucan Clark felt icy perspiration on his neck , on his wrists and shoulders . Then , in a miracle , he had the promise . The secretary bowed him out at the door ; there was talk of a letter to be sent on Monday . Thesecretary whispered that Gideon Dolph was a very old man and a sick one , and should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff green check would go through the mail ; it would have the secretary 's personal attention and Gideon Dolph 's signature . Cease firing ! Lucan Clark drove and drove . Company  --  attention ! Here in the Butchman Park Apartments were dowagers , retired generals , a Cabinet member , expensive fly-by-nights , representatives and senators and their wives and mistresses and children . Here was a colored man in pea-green livery , here once more were elevators and a mile of corridor and a white door with a single pearl-button beside it . This bull was Senator Noovan ; his nostrils were as wide as twin caves , and no other Angus bull had ever worn a velvet robe like his . In the sun-parlor papers rustled and ice clinked in glasses , and five separate pairs of hard spectacles lifted themselves to peer at Dean Clark and the Chinese servant , until Senator Noovan closed the sun-parlor door behind him . He rumbled , " Caught me quite busy , Dean , but not too busy to see you . Bourbon ? Scotch ? Here .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this time . " Dean Lucan Clark held the cold glass clutched tightly in his thin hand . " Richard , I mean . What 's he ? ? " " It is not your son , Senator Noovan . Not at all . I came ? " Rhesus monkey and Angus bull , and he prayed that neither would ever know how they shamed and terrified him . Noovan grunted , " College business then ? What is it ? If you do n't mind my saying it , there are several very important constituents in there who 've come a long , long way to ? " " I have a daughter , Senator . She is unmarried  --  Miss Ethel Clark . For the past eighteen years she has been employed in the library at Syrian . " Senator Noovan swallowed the last of his drink . " Yes ? " " She would like to come to Washington . She feels that possibly in a wider field she might be able to broaden her own  --  capabilities . " He stopped long enough to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your many connections here in Wash-ington ? " Noovan interrupted , " Sounds familiar . " He moved to a coffee table , splashed some whiskey into his tumbler , and pressed the lever of a siphon . " Dean Clark , I 'm not quite as old as you , but I was n't born yesterday . You put it very shrewdly . Of course your daughter is n't from my bailiwick , and everybody and his dog is after me , but in this case ? " " I felt that , in some manner , you might be able to discover a situation in which ? " Senator Noovan had stiff black hairs rimming each nostril . " You do n't need to mince words with me , Dean . I get you . I got you the first time . Tit for tat , and fair enough ! You got Richard out of a serious scrape , and now I see what prompted you to do it . He 's an ornery piece , even if he is my own son . No great charm about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote voice was saying , " is not a bad young man at heart . I did not wish to see him ruined or losing his diploma . Since then he has repaid me by conducting himself with reasonable decency . " " Shrewd . " Noovan laughed again , and again his lumps of ice were alone in their glass . He fumbled in his velvet robe and brought out a crumpled telegraph envelope and a gold pencil . He scribbled . " Have your daughter write to this man . I 'll see him before Monday , and fix it up . Do n't worry . She 'll get something good . " Dean Clark stood up . " I know the ropes , " said the Senator . " I came in when Warren Harding did . I must say you 've got a new method of approach ! But I like you , Dean , I like you ! And ? " he lowered his voice ? " take good care of the boy . He 's all I 've got since Mrs. Noovan left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer the swollen , unblinking velvet of an Angus bull ; they were dull and sad , and Dean Clark could not hate this man quite as much as he wanted to . Here in the hotel on F Street were more men in uniform . They were not colored men ; they were as white as Dean Lucan Clark , but not so pale , and they moved with greased regularity to let him in at the revolving door and to ferry him skyward to his room  --  or rather , to his two rooms . Seven dollars for one , ten for the other : seventeen dollars per day . Constance slept on a cot in the room where her mother and Ethel occupied the beds . He would have to mark it down in his little book : seventeen dollars , and there was one-ninety-five for the tie which Constance picked out , and there was Agatha 's evening gown , though naturally she would be as economical as possible She might even be made State Regent . . . He went in and found Agatha trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ethel was beside her with a mouthful of pins . " Is n't this choice , Lucan ? " Agatha had culled that word from her granddaughter 's vocabulary , but always she said chice . " It . was reduced . We got it for twenty-nine eighty-five . " Dean Clark said , " I saw him . I saw them both . " In the next room Marietta was conversing with someone on the telephone , and , her voice was strident . Ethel began to take the pins out of her mouth rapidly . She made a little miaow . " Father , did he ? ? " He gave her the crumpled telegraph envelope . " You are to write to this man , and Senator Noovan will have it ? fixed up , " and then Ethel began to sob . " Ethel , what under the sun ails you , child ? Lucan , did you do what President Avery ? " Dean Clark wanted to shriek , " Two battles , by God in Heaven ! And won them both without adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Agatha . The seven thousand dollars is assured . " " Splendid , " breathed Agatha . " Ethel , what are you sniffling about ? He got it  --  he got the seven thousand for Syrian . " . . . She turned slowly , gazing at herself in the mirror . Her head lifted , her lips began to move in a whisper : Friends , fellow-patriots , Sisters of our Great Cause , I stand before you to-night in the role of candidate for ? Her glasses gleamed . The telephone receiver crashed in the next room , and a slender witch in a green dressing-gown rushed through the bath and in at the door , Marietta . She had aluminum curlers dangling all over her head . " Father , " she gasped , " father , you 've got to do something with that girl ! " " Girl ? " he asked as they gathered round her . The Mother-Daughter banquet , the Mother-Daughter banquet . Connie was at the Town woman 's apartment , and they were having a party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back at the hotel in time to attend the banquet . " Drunk , " yelled her mother . " I know she was . I could tell it by her voice . Connie ? was  --  drunk ! " Agatha said , sharply , " If I were dressed , Marietta , I 'd go up there and lug that young one home and give her a piece of my mind . " " You , " Marietta howled , " are a fine one to talk . A fine one ! You encouraged her to go . Grandparents ! Good grief , I never thought to see the day when I should n't have a home of my own , and had to let my own parents take the disciplining of my daughter right out of my hands ! Father , do something ! " He asked quietly , " You wish me to fetch her ? " " Good heavens , yes ! Right away . That woman ! The banquet 's promptly at eight o'clock , and it 's nearly night now . " From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always liked those Town girls . They were brimful of good nature . But perhaps Betty has grown a trifle  --  a trifle ? " " A trifle ! " echoed Ethel , viciously . " She 's well-named , if you ask me . Town woman . " " Oh , and that is n't her name , " Marietta cried . " Her married name is Alwin . Do you know the building ? " " Yes , " he said , " I left Constance there . " Captain Leavenworth Clark had come back to the fort , dismounted and staggering through the cactus , after eight days of fighting off Indians ; and immediately he had ridden all the way to the Arkansas River when he heard that some buffalo hunters were in distress . . . . General Osborn F. Clark wrote in his memoirs , privately printed : " Before we reached Monocacy Junction , on the march to Gettysburg , we were nearly exhausted . The heat was terrific , and dust got in our throats , and the men were disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having lately recovered from my Chancellorsville wound , and still wearing bandages . However , we held our place in column . " Lucan Clark drove to K Street . The building had a pink canopy in front of it ; he remembered that ; he imagined that there was a feel of California about the building , although he had never been to California . . .. The automatic elevator baffled him for a time , but at last he got out at the fourth floor . In Betty Town 's apartment lived a radio which sang like a drunken sailor , and it seemed as if a dozen girls were laughing , although there were only three . Dean Clark rang the bell . " I have come , " he said to the young man with oily-red hair , who opened the door , " for my granddaughter , Constance Boston . " The young man cried over his shoulder , " Casper Milquetoast in person ! " whatever that meant . Then he held the door ajar and bowed , spilling half his cocktail as he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ davenport ; she had discarded the coat of her suit , and looked very pretty and trim in her gay red blouse and black skirt . Her eyes were exceedingly bright . She had a squat glass in her hand in which a cherry and a slice of orange bobbed about . That drink , thought Dean Clark , did not look particularly sinful . But Constance was unsteady on her feet . So were some of the others : Betty Town , looking many years older than when the Dean had known her ; the oily-red young man ; another man who was silent and hid in a corner ; and a young girl and a bald-headed cupid who appeared from the kitchenette . Betty kept saying , " Dean Clark , you must sit down . I knew Dean Clark years ago , Frieda , I knew him well . . . . " He helped Constance with her coat . " My fur , " were the only words she said , and someone brought it to her with her bag . " Good-by , Connie Bennett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Boston did not sound like Bennett . Betty kissed Constance , andthen the door closed . Dean Clark could hear them inside all shrieking with laughter . Constance laughed too once she was in the car . " I suppose mother thinks funny , " she mumbled . " She sent me , " said Lucan Clark . " I did not particularly wish to come , but there seemed ? " " No way out ? " " That is not it , exactly . It was my duty to come . You are only seventeen , my girl . " Constance chortled , and squeezed his arm . " Blame it all , Gandy ! I ca n't go back to the hotel like this . " " No , " he said . And then , " Lower that window beside you . Not too much . There . " The tumultuous herd of cars squawked around them . Dean Clark drove sedately and carefully , though his eyes and teeth were both aching now . The girl beside him muttered , " Empty stomach  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I 've got to go to Mother-Daughter banquet Daughters Independence . " " Of course , " he agreed , " because they are depending on you . That is ? I believe , " he exclaimed , amid the devious twistings of a traffic circle , " that is why so many frightening things that we do , are done . " They were working toward the Potomac . " Not this way to hotel , Gandy . " " No , we have a safe hour before we must be there . I want you to feel better . I 've heard , " he added haltingly , " about ? The boys at Syrian have all sorts of ridiculous remedies . I recall hearing some talk of tomato catsup and hot water . " " Skip it , " said Constance , making faces . " Cup of black coffee would be better . " He brought it to her , from the neon glare of a tiny restaurant with an v  --  mon  --  IP enameled front , and she sipped the whole cupful as speedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the western sky looked like a crate of peaches . Constance said so . " And that little part to the south , Gandy . That 's yellower . That 's cheese wafers . But I like the whole business very de-cidedly . " " My dear child , " he said . This gate of Arlington swung toward them like a forbidding jaw , and Lucan Clark ground his brakes . " No chance . " A young man in khaki spoke from the dusk . " This gate is being closed . " " But " ? many times Dean Clark marveled how he came to say it ? " I have driven a long way , from New Jersey . My  --  my son is buried here . " The khaki youth looked at the license plate and flung his hands out , palms up . " Okay , Pop . When you drive out , go to that other gate over there . " " Why , Gandy ? " Their tires hummed up the slow-winding drive . " Why , my lad . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father . Did n't you ? General Osborn F. Clark . " She turned suddenly . " Unless , " she faltered , " you like to imagine that Uncle Waldo 's the Unknown Soldier . . " They paused in crunching silence , somewhere between the fighting-top of the battleship Maine and a great colosseum which shaped its classic paleness on the rim of the valley . Their feet were lonely but unafraid , echoing among the borders of marble . When they had progressed down more steps they faced the lights of the city  --  a great feast of winking or stolid dots crowded over the whole purple landscape . Here , a young soldier was pacing along a strip of rubber matting toward the little canvas sentry-booth which waited for him . Click , and halt . A pause . Click , and right-face . Again the pause , as if he were expecting some friend to wake up and speak to him . Click once more , and right-face , and the falling motion of Forward , March . Dean Clark and Constance came closet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe them . It was no part of his occupation to observe anyone who might be standing there . " Infantry , " whispered the Dean . " How do you know ? " " His uniform  --  his badges . You see , my dear girl ? " He paused , to nod toward the staring tomb of pure white , " You come from a long line of soldiers . Your great , great , great , great grandfather was Maccabaeus Clark , and he fought at Monmouth . His son , Lucan Clark , was in the second war for American Independence . Your great , great-grandfather was Captain Leavenworth Clark ? " Constance said , " Of course . Mexicans and Comanches . . . . And Uncle Waldo  --  your son Waldo was killed the year I was born . " " The town was Haazavant , in the Meuse-Argonne offensive , " the Dean told her . " One Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry , Forty-second Division . He was nineteen . He was killed , but something happened to his body . It was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm okay now . Let 's go , " and he came willingly . " Gandy , " she began , as they climbed into the sedan , " there 's been one of our Clarks in every war we ever had  --  successive generations . Except the Spanish War . " He stopped , with one foot on the running board . It seemed to the girl that his face was proudest porcelain in the gloom . " Yes . . . I do not believe in war , theoretically . I have spent a great deal of time fighting the idea of war and shall spend more . I opposed the compulsory military training at Syrian . Nevertheless , in Eight-een Ninety-eight , I did wish to go . In my blood , I suppose . I had a certain impulse ? " " You had two babies , " whispered Connie . " And another coming , " he said . " That was Waldo . There was no chance of my going . But I should have been glad to be a soldier . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  you must not laugh at me , my girl  --  to do brave things . Constance , I might have been a very brave soldier ! I could have obeyed every order , even disagreeable ones , even orders which made me afraid . I could have suffered pain and fatigue , I am sure , in a necessary campaign . " Still she laughed . It was the hysterically penetrating laughter of a young person who sees and under-stands all too clearly . She drew him into the car , baffled and hurt as he was . She kissed him . " Gandy , " she sobbed , " I 'm dreadfully proud to be related to you . " " Well , " he said . He looked through the windshield and squared his thin shoulders . " Now there have been three battles in one day , Constance . With little or no artillery support , until you offered yours . " " The General , " she swore , " would be very proud of you , Gandy . I 'm ab ? soluteiy proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . " I bct Uncle Waldo would be proud to claim you too . " At the mention of the name he turned away quickly and peered through the dusk toward the slope of the hill . Then he started the motor .
