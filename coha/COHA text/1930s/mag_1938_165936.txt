Sidney Hillman , able little Lithuanian-born leader of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America ( membership : 225,000 ) , last week emerged from WPA headquarters . He had just been discussing a new , shiny and portentous proposition with WTAdministrator Harry Hopkins . Said he emerging : " It will be some time before the proposal goes through-if it ever does . " But he made no secret of the details of his scheme . <P> In the clothing business , as in the wheat business , the cotton business , and many another business , a surplus of products has piled up . In New York , for example , there are 200,000 unsold men 's garments on the manufacturers ' shelves . Until these surpluses are sold , explained Mr. Hillman , his Amalgamated Clothing Workers will not get much work . <P> If the Government can spend tens of millions taking surplus cotton , corn , hogs , tobacco , turpentine , etc. , etc. , off the market , why can not it take off surplus garments ? Especially when perhaps 17.000,000 citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000,000 worth of men 's and boys ' cheap suits , distribute them to the needy and get Amalgamated Clothing Workers back to work , 30,000 or 40,000 of them in New York City alone ? <P> An obvious difference between clothing and farm products is that for the latter , more or less open national markets exist . Men 's and boys ' suits , made under widely varying conditions in different parts of the country , have no easily determined market price . If the Government undertook to stabilize the clothing industry , it would have on its hands a production- &-price; control problem beside which reducing next year 's wheat acreage would be child 's play . Moreover , if the Government should subsidize one manufacturing business , where then could it stop , at automobiles or animal crackers , at zeppelins or zithers ? Last month , in ordering 60,000,000 yards of cotton textiles for its sewing projects ( an increase of 45,000,000 yards over previous orders ) , WPA explained that one reason for expanding the order was to make work for the textile mills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for subsidizing labor through industry .
