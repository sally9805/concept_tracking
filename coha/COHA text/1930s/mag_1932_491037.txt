4 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 16 , 1932 steeple about 175 feet high , that . carries it to a total of 1046 feet , it exceeds the height of the Eiffel Tower by about fifty feet . For such costly and uncertain distinction most business men would not care to gamble , and they need not in order to profit from these modern buildings . Those who gaze in awe from the sidewalks at the gleaming tops of the country 's largest buildings generally overlook their true significance . This is not . height at all , but bigness . The bigness of our buildings is touching the lives of all our people in ways that . only a few of them appreciate . A long list of household conveniences and other everyday appliances of our civilization are by-products of skyscraper construction . In the coming years all of us will live in better houses and enjoy astounding comforts distilled out of the needs of these gigantic buildings  --  and they are giants . While height records were broken time and again in our largest cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more important feature  --  bulk  --  was gripping the minds of the men in the industry . Skyscrapers as Experiment Stations WHAT we know as whole-block occupancy has V V become fairly well established as the ultimate in economy and earning power where land values are high enough to warrant such an enterprise . Until the Empire State was completed in 1931 , with its 35,926,000 cubic feet , the Equitable Building , built in 1913-14 , was the largest office building in the world , containing 24,918,700 cubic feet . It is still one of the most profitable as well as one of the finest of buildings . Its unbroken , vertical walls rising forty stories on the building line were built before the set-. back laws were passed in New York . Hotels and apartment houses , as well as office buildings , have proved that whole-block occupancy is not only economical but necessary . Chicago produced the Stevens Hotel with 3000 rooms , occupying a whole block , with its power house across the street .. Apartment houses too numerous to mention , that occupy whole blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Commercial and industrial structures came under the same influence of bigness , and with Field 's Merchandise Mart , containing 55,000,000 cubic feet and 4,000,000 square feet of floor space , Chicago gained another record  --  the biggest of all commercial structures in the world . These and scores of other big ones are a phase of an insistence for larger and more economical units , But what are they accomplishing for people who do not own them or work in them ? In my twenty-sixth-floor office in New York there is a. small disk of gleaming metal set in the wall near the floor . It is a spring-hinged trapdoor that covers an outlet that is one of more than 7000 similar out lets of the building 's vacuum-cleaning system , by means of which all dust is sucked from the offices into the basement . Greatly improved in particulars , this ultra-modern cleaning vacuum plant . in its essentials is like the first one , which was installed in a big New York hotel . After that , a portable cartlike plant . was developed for use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had met that problem the manufacturers used some of their profits to develop the hand devices with dust bags which emancipated women from old-fashioned and inefficient brooms . And every woman who owns and uses one owes a bow to the big buildings which made them possible . Steam heat  --  indeed , all central-heating plants owe their origin to the skyscraper . After the first steam-heating plant had been installed in a Chicago skyscraper , myriads of Americans were released from the slavery of attending dirty , uneconomical and unsatisfactory grate fires . Then came the east-iron radiator into a new skyscraper , and presently radiators were displacing the unsightly rows of gilded steam pipes . Oil-burning plants were developed for skyscrapers to overcome the traffic in ash cans ; and these , like the mechanical stokers , were manufactured for small houses after skyscrapers had established the market . The newest type of radiator not long ago was to be found only in the most recently built skyscrapers . It is designed to be concealed in the wall so that . no floor space is sacrificed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine , and no woman who has seen one is likely to be tolerant of any other kind . Mechanical refrigeration was first developed to meet the needs of whole-block hotels , after which electrical refrigerators were produced in smaller and smaller units , until now they are to be found in tiny apartments and cottages . For that matter , the whole world would have been slower in providing electricity for home use if it had not been for the needs of America 's big buildings . The New York Edison Company 's first big client was the old Fifth Avenue Hotel when it was new . From that building , big in its time , and from a few other large ones , the use of current for lighting , and then for other purposes , spread down the side streets and kept on spreading until now farmers use it to perform a variety of tedious chores , including milking . The thermostat with which the heat supply is automatically controlled in so many homes today was produced to meet a market first offered by the skyscrapers . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into mass production for the small-house market ; and further benefits in the way of heating are on the way . When it becomes the common practice to heat homes with electricity , this will be due to the fact that skyscrapers will have shown the way and given the manufacturers a market . - Right now a greater blessing , that I am hoping and guessing is destined for the small house , is being provided in large units . Conditioned air will be as much in demand by tenants of office space in the future as central heating is today . By means of air-conditioning plants , the largest motion-picture theaters have made their interiors not only tolerable in the summer but actually more pleasant than the outdoors . A few of the biggest department stores in the largest cities were quick to seize upon this means of making their aisles attractive to shoppers in summer . Now the device is being applied to offices . General Humidity Meets a Reverse T HE value of conditioned air to a commercial es-tablishment is so quickly demonstrated that one is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building will be modern that does not supply it . In New York a large banking house , after many years of experience , had learned to expect the absence during humid summer months of more than 100 out of its 1100 employes . Most of those absentees stayed away because of abnormal summer temperatures . Then the bank moved into new quarters where the air is conditioned , and at once the absence factor became almost negligible , while the general efficiency of the organization was vastly improved . So the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company 's new building , now being erected on half a city block , will be air conditioned from top to bottom by a $500,000 plant . The principle is Simple . The air drawn in from out-of-doors first encounters dense sprays of water . During the summer this water is cooled by refrigeration . At this reduced temperature the air is cooled and condensation of the atmospheric moisture is produced just as we observe the collection of moisture on the sides of a glass of ice water . Automatic controls then adjust the temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // metal ducts to the rooms which are to be made comfortable . During the winter the process is reversed and the spray water adds moisture to the air , making up the deficiency common in our winter atmosphere . Actually it is hard to tell whether these air-conditioning plants are of greater value in winter or summer . With the ordinary steam-heating installations , unconditioned winter air may and frequently does have as little as 12 per cent of moisture . This condition , physicians tell us , is largely responsible for the prevalence of colds . But in summer we need no physician to convince us that the cause of our discomfort is not the heat but the humidity . Will workers for long be content to enjoy conditioned air only during working hours ? They will not , of course , and it wo n't be long , in my judgment. , before even moderate-priced apartment houses , big ones , will be offering conditioned air as a selling argument to prospective tenants . After that , as I say , I am hoping and guessing that conditioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mass production . Stone , brick and lumber , window glass and chimneys were the essentials of practically all constructed shelter down to the time of the skyscraper . Then , as we see , under the stimulus of big-building construction , a variety of new materials and appliances was made available for all kinds of shelter . Metal piping , the metal weather strip , copper and brass as building material  --  all these were passed on from the skyscraper to the little buildings ; but the most important development of the big building is still to be passed on to the dwelling house . That development is the craftsmanship , the speed and economies of the modern , organized builder . Applying Production Methods to Building T IIIS is a new skill , roughly analogous to the superior technic of manufacturing by which an American supremacy is demonstrated to the world in an outpouring of splendid but inexpensive utilitarian articles . Our automobile manufacturers , for example , dominate the world markets in spite of hostile tariff barriers and an abundance of cheap labor in the countries which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appreciated that American manufacturers have developed a skill which they would like to acquire for themselves ; but even in America it is not generally understood that the completion within the space of a year of a mountainous structure like the Empire State Building is an expression of another form of this same skill . Empire State was built in less than a year from the setting of the first steel column  --  a great fifty-two-ton affair  --  one of a group , of which each one was about the same weight , that supports the tower , and the load on each of which is more than 5000 tons . Thousands of tons of rook had to be removed before those columns were set ; and to be entirely fair , it must be recorded that the demolition of the old Waldorf Astoria Hotel took from October , 1929 , to February , 1930 . Then that rock had to be removed and the great grillage beds constructed to spread the loads of the columns ; for even the solid granite of Manhattan Island has its limitation of concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work of preparation had been done , and before April first of the following year the first tenants moved into the building . It was a stupendous task , measured by any standards , for in the time elapsed nearly 330,000,000 had been spent by the building organization under a most rigorous accountability to the owner . At times as many as 4000 workmen swarmed over the structure under intensive , orderly direction . At the height of the operation , for four successive months , more than $2,500,000 worth of work was skillfully accomplished . For weeks on end during this period the direct pay roll of the building organization for the 1900 men employed by it ran to more than $140,000 a week ; and this takes no account of the pay rolls of the subcontractors , who , during the same period , marshaled forces numbering more than 2000 men at the site , not to mention those in shops and factories engaged in the preparation of materials and facilities for the building . Then there was that business of ordering and of obtaining information for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as the discipline at the site , reflects the measure and quality of the directing organization . And finally came the coordination of the whole effort to the end that the great operation should suffer no interruptions and its smooth and rapid progress should not feel the jar of halts and delays , so costly and so destructive of the morale of the orianization at the site . It takes long-range vision and abundant experience to do all this . In Europe , in their modern structures , one sees an appreciation of every device or convenience that we demand so universally in our best structures . Europe uses many of them , but in the assembly there is given a painful impression both of archaic survivals and shocking lack of foresight . One notices in the hotels in London and Paris the most beautiful plaster and tile work . As marble and mosaic workers , their craftsmen are unexcelled , as are their artificers in bronze and metals of all sorts , But look more closely . Beautiful bathrooms are disfigured with wretched , rambling pipes hugging walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , exquisitely plastered , with ugly steam pipes intruding themselves brazenly in corners or gauntly in the middle of beautifully finished surfaces . And they take years to build their buildings , where we take months ! These things are not said invidiously , but to emphasize the fact that there craftsmanship is still dominant . Keeping Pace With the Movers S UPERIOR job management is the one thing that 0 has made the American skyscraper possible . If erected in the **42;394;TOOLONG fashion , their completion would stretch out over a period of years . Built that way , they would have to carry an impossible load of interest charges . In the shortest possible time the valuable sites upon which they are reared must be returned to earning power . For most of them there is still another consideration which requires that they be built in strict accord with a preconceived schedule . This is the renting season . The hurry to complete the Empire State Building was really a race to capture a crop of tenants . The renting season in New York is an utterly foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May first . That is moving day for office tenants , as all leases are written to expire with the end of April , and in the same senseless way apartment leases ex. pire with the end of September , making October first household moving day . So , before the old Waldorf Astoria registered its last guests , a renting organization for the projected building had been formed and literally every real-estate broker in New York had been provided with plans to show prospective tenants . Actually , some leases were signed before the Waldorf was demolished . Consequently , when the first column was set , the builders knew they simply had to complete the job in a year . So , you see , the essence of the new idea in skyscraper building is that time and dollars are coequal . It is now accepted procedure that architects determine the results to be obtained , while the building organizations devise the ways and means of accomplishment . This throws on the building organization two major activities . One is the gathering of information about the job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of parts in mills and shops away from the site . The other activity is the assembly of these parts into the finished whole . Every single task must dovetail with the rest of the work for the sake of that economy in time which we know to be money in a very real sense . This remote preparation of the parts of structures has engendered the assembly procedure in construction , and it is the keynote of skyscraper building . Further developments of the idea will be made on a vast scale , perhaps to the end that the skyscraper of the future will be almost wholly preassembled . The elements of the buildings of earlier times were worked almost wholly at . the site . Stone was hauled and hewn to size and shape . Lumber was fashioned into finish by carpenters ; and , in fact , all manner of detail was worked out by the artisans at the site in collaboration with the architect or owner who devised the plan and design . The economies of mass production in factories could not be achieved under those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because it was the best . way but because no better way had been devised . Now , for an understanding of the biggest of all changes for the better which are to come to the American people out of their skyscrapers , it must be remembered that this old-fashioned way of doing things still obtains generally in the building of small houses , small apartments , all small structures . Hence they are more costly than almost any other product we buy . Most of the changes which are to make small houses cheaper and better are to be seen in the structure of the room in the Empire State Building in which I am setting this down on paper . Saving Time With Templates There are arrangements for about 7000 rooms in the building , but the fact that any one of these rooms would serve to point my argument is the crux of the matter . The doorframes in this room were made in Long Island City . The doors were made in another city upstate . The frames are what we know as metal buck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster had been applied to the hollow-tile walls . Plastering is a messy job , which big buildings inherited from small ones . Incidentally , it is on its way out . The metal lining of a Pullman car will give you an approximate idea of what is going to replace plaster walls . At any rate , one hour after the plaster of these walls was dry , a painter came along , scraped off the smears and drops of plaster from the metal buck and trim and proceeded to paint . Then the doors were hung . The whole job had been templated . Template , or templet , is the term we use to describe the operation by which parts which are to be fitted together are made to coincide . In this ease , the screw holes for the hinges and lock plates , the boxes for the hinges and the doors and frames had been so made in separate factories that hanging the door was simply a matter of sending screws home . It was a matter of minutes to hang each door . Had we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in small houses , then , of ter the planes of the plaster had been established and the plaster had taken its own sweet time to dry , a carpenter would have come and set the jambs , and after him another would come to plane and trim , followed by another to cut and hang the door . There can he no uniformity about such work , and , consequently , each door placed in this manner represented a separate manufacturing job rather than a swift assembly operation . The new way , with templated metal buck and trim and doors , is so much better and cheaper that this door assembly will , you can be sure , go intb cottages . Making Spandrels Do Double Duty A total of more than 1500 industries were called on for all the parts that became the Empire State Building , so it is impossible for me to cite all the operations ; but a few were so revolutionary that I should refer to them . The spandrels , which occupy the space about four and a half feet wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one window and the bottom of the one above , are made of east aluminum . In earlier buildings these spandrels , made of brick or terra cotta , have been put together on the site . On this job they came from the foundry ready to be bolted into the outer wall , and on the inner side of each was a pair of hooks on which to hang the radiators that go beneath each window ledge . It was by a variety of such time-saving devices that it was possible to piece this mammoth structure together as a finished job so quickly . Why , you may wonder , has the building industry only lately discovered and applied some of these time-saving schemes ? From ancient times contractors , builders and artisans had been grouped as building-trade mechanics of one sort or autither  --  craf tsmen , if you like  --  with the graduated mason or carpenter or even cellar digger as the principal contractor . This mechanic , having come up through the trade , acquired recognition by his willingness to assume the risk of the total cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and such he remains in the popular mind as well as in fact in some of the lesser fields of construction . But his chief disadvantage on small-house jobs is the lack of one tool from his kit . That tool is bigness  --  bigness of operation . I am certain that this tool can and must be supplied if we are to solve our housing problem , for only bigness justifies the presence of the ablest management . Large construction companies ordinarily will not touch residence construction operations , one of their objections being based on the nuisance of dealing with wholly uninformed clients . But a more telling objection is the absolute impossibility of applying their large-scale forces to a small-scale job ; but just as soon as skyscraper-building intelligence is applied to housing on a large scale , housing will become better and cheaper . As yet there has been no general development on a large scale of housing groups by large building organizations specializing in that field . But it is a fair guess that the shortage of housing in and near the large cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong building organizations of the country in undertaking housing developments scientifically . Such undertakings will not be without precedent . In New York , the Rockefeller interests have launched two large enterprises in this class , the construction administration of which should attract the thoughts of the well-organized builders of the country . Similarly , the Buhl housing development in Pittsburgh and the laudable efforts of the Rosenwald Foundation and the Marshall Field Estate in Chicago point to an awakening in this field of construction that should be of vast proportions in the next decade . The Amalgamated Buildings , a development on Grand Street in New York , is an excursion into the field of cooperatively owned modest apartments which points the way to a possible line for the largest-scale builders . In our rush to develop industrial , commercial and office structures , modest residential development has been neglected , due in a large measure to the fact that it offers neither spectacular profits nor the security that commercial buildings have offered , Perhaps the awakening interest in this subject by philanthropists , together with the tendency toward actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this work . I feel , however , that there is a more dependable incentive that will bring this about. , an economic pressure , the same kind of force that makes the skyscrapers . In the United States we were building new construction at the rate of nearly $7,500,000,000 a year when the depression commenced in the fall of 1929 . Before the war we had thought that $3,500,000,000 annually was a pretty fair volume , but the surge of postponed construction due to the war started us in 1919 with a volume of about $4,500,000,000 and , except for a recession in 1920 and 1921 , the curve was upward  --  at the rate of $500,000,000 of increase yearly in 1927 , 1928 and 1929 . Large Sums for Small Building These figures represent recorded construction ; but of the stupendous total , new-building construction represented about 80 per cent , or more than S5,500 , - 000,000 , in the year 1929 . Highways , railroad construction , dams , tunnels and water-front developments represented the remaining 20 per cent . These figures do not take account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small jobbing , repairs and betterments ; and the sum of all this , a kind of reflex of the other activity in the cities , must easily have run to $3,000,000,000 or $4,000,000,000 annually in the five years prior to 1930 . Are such figures tedious ? None will think so who realize that here we have put a probing finger on the very heart of that which , when it stopped , we called depression . Construction was easily our leading national industry , both in volume and importance , and the diversity of its requirements made itself felt in almost every one of our industries . For example , 25 per cent of the total tonnage of our railroads was in construction materials and equipment . It is bard to think of anything we do that is not directly or indirectly affected by con- was in the large cities that **25;438;TOOLONG was most startling , and the spectaenlar achievement was , as always , the mammoth metropolitan structure , the skyscraper . In the period that succeeded the war , skyscraper construction flowered as never before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the old cities of the East tore down their proud , fireproof structures , some of them only two decades old , in order to build greater , bigger and better structures . Generally , where important demolitions occurred , obsolescence and reduced struc. tural values were met by the upward sweep of intensive land values , and choice metropolitan corners simply could n't afford the encumbrance of the buildings that were on them , whether new or old ; for the economics of the situation had demonstrated that large plottage was all-important to permit of bigger building . New Field for Big Builders When President Hoover was Secretary of Commerce , he gave great attention to construction , recognizing it as the fundamental index of the growth of our national wealth . On several occasions he gave public expression to his belief that public construction should be withheld during boom times and released during periods of depression , and extensive plans were made to put his ideas into effect . He also urged the idea on large corporations , pointing out the manifest economies that would result from launching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a high , boom market . In consequence , when the depression started in the fall of 1929 , the country turned to the construction industry with a frantic appeal that it do something , and straightway the plans of the Department of Commerce were brought out . Alas , there was no construction industry to turn to ! A few trade associations representing building-material manufacturers , a few building-trades groups , a few well-informed but impatient specialists on building materials  --  these were all that could be found to be even faintly articulate on this great subject . That there has been no tangible result is due to the complexity of the depression itself . Aye , but the Government was going to help ! The idea of the Government 's alleviating unemployment by rushing work on public buildings was doomed to be a disappointment by reason of the fact that it was government work . The total Federal program , including all that was authorized , but not started prior to the Hoover Administration , amounts to about $700,000,000 of construction . It was widely acclaimed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount in a single year would have meant only about 10 per cent of the normal construction capacity of the country . It shrinks to a drop in the bucket when you discover that the work is to be done over a period of seven years . During the first year of the program only $39,000,000 was spent by the Federal Government . Certainly there is little excuse for hope in that direction , and I am not blaming Mr. Hoover . The causes lie deep . Where , then , shall we look ? Assuming we have almost as many skyscrapers as we need at the moment , where can we find jobs for all who are linked with that which is loosely called the building industry ? From the top of any skyscraper a discerning person can see these areas that should be rebuilt . From such a vantage point in New York I can see into suburbs where there are square miles of badly built frame houses with monotonous exteriors , all no more than ten years old . Some , I know , are so badly designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly that the owners might expect to encounter difficulty in renewing the ' rst mortgages . A decade ago , or less , the ground on which they stand was farm land . The speculative builders who marketed these structures in a boom fostered by tax exemption , granted as a means of ? overcoming housing shortage , sold them for an average of about $7000 . Can we do better for the type of persons who dwell in such houses ; for people who want to escape from the status of apartment-dwelling rent payers ; for those in whom there is a strong instinct to own their own homes ? I know we can . I know that the management intelligence which makes skyscrapers possible can apply the skyscraper technic to the small house . I am convinced that for $7000 , or even for $5000 , houses can be built that would be worth twice as much as those ugly , jerrybuilt frame houses of the kind to which I am referring . These improvements are coming soon on the edges of our big cities . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be built as a single undertaking . Instead of 7000 rooms in one whole-block skyscraper , it will be a job of 7000 rooms in 1000 houses . The houses would be built , arranged and coordinated in such a way as to be of permanent social value to the community to which they are attached . They would have the most modern heating , lighting and sanitation devices . They would have window frames and doors that would never shrink or warp . Because they would be nearly fireproof , they would likewise be nearly verminproof , and in approaching these desiderata they would be gifted with a minimum element . of obsolescence . But I would not stop in the suburbs . Thwarting Genius by Neglect One of the reproaches of our American civilization is our slums . We know it is mainly in the slums , or in slum influences , that gangsters and criminals are spawned . Yet. , often enough to , convince thinking people that the slums represent a shameful waste of what should be a tremendous national asset , an ultra valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , an Irving Berlin ; sometimes he is an Al Smith . How much genius are we thwarting by our neglect ? It is not merely a problem of New York and Chicago . It reaches , with bad housing , even into the smallest town ; and we can not dismiss the problem by crying that it is a matter of poor human stock . We let that stock into our national corral , and now that the immigration gates are pretty well closed it is time we did something to improve it . The beginning , as I see it , should he made by improving the housing available to the poor . Literally hundreds of city blocks of slums could be torn down now and rebuilt with immeasurable benefit to the world in general and to the cities they disgrace . The people who live in them all pay rent or else they are evicted ; and what they pay should he seen as a mighty , potential reserve of credit . Somehow we must devise the means of making that credit justify financing on a scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-estate credit . We can do it if we lend less money abroad . When the Slums are Rebuilt There is no use in tackling this thing piecemeal , in parts of blocks ; the block should be the smallest unit , and half a dozen blocks better still . Some sort of government supervision has got to be brought into the scheme and some new thinking for these low-income people . It has been observed in all societies , as far into the past as there are records of a civilization , that unscrupulous capital has habitually endeavored to exploit . the necessities and misfortunes of the low-income element . Therefore some public agency has got to set up suitable standards for minimum housing requirements . Right now , with calculations based on experience in erecting numerous skyscrapers , it is possible to show that slums can be supplanted by buildings in which the apartments , including upkeep , management and depreciation , would cost no more than seven dollars a room a month , disregarding land costs . This can not be done unless unscrupulous capital is prevented from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could afford then to give to the dwellings that would replace slums management of as high a character as that which keeps our skyscrapers clean and orderly . It is obvious , of course , that skyscraper rooms cost more , but skyscrapers have many items of luxury unnecessary to residence occupancy . A skyscraper is a machine to stimulate the highest . types of efficiency , containing much costly machinery unnecessary to an apartment . These buildings that will replace our slums should be , as I see them , each a whole-block fortress for the protection of children , of families ; the roof a guarded , soundproofed playground ; the patio a lovely garden . But we ca n't do this unless we drive the selfish opportunist out of this field entirely . Happily , the big elements of the building industry are casting their eyes toward these fields . They can not always keep their organizations busy with skyscrapers , and slum eradication would make a wonderful means of flattening the disturbing peaks and valleys of construction . One does not have to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before anyone who goes to the top of a skyscraper and looks down upon his city . I can see it best from the eighty-sixth floor of the Empire State , for then , pressing against the soles of my feet , I can feel the mighty structure that contains the recipe oven as I gaze down upon the dinginess of the East Side . Up there I can sense the full force of the influence of the skyscraper upon American life .
