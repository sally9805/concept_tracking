txt Cuba 's general strike was long delayed and quietly and peacefully carried out . This is a tribute to the patience and good sense of the Cuban people . The event in itself has no particular significance . It does not indicate a marked political revolt , nor is it the product of alien-inspired Communism . Rather is it a dramatic notice to the world at large and to the Cuban Government in particular that the people of the great sugar island are reaching the end of their endurance of economic conditions which for fully five years have been " increasingly burdensome . The trouble is not all of Cuba 's making . Basically it is due to overproduction of sugar throughout the world . There has also been overcapitalization of many of the native and foreign owned sugar mills and plantations  --  properties bought . in the belief that the price of sugar would remain high . Add the efforts of the Cuban Government to restrict the sugar crop , and concentration of public works in and about Havana . Incidentally , the strict censorship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians , has not , been helpful . Besides , there is the uncertainty resulting from the threat of an increased sugar tariff in the United States . The latest increase as voted in the Senate will , if made law , ruin many sugar planters in Cuba and add to unemployment . As a one-crop country , Cuba has always been susceptible to the world 's production. ? When sugar was scarce as a result of the war in Europe , the Cubans made fortunes out of their ' sugar . But as the normal production of sugar has been resumed in other ? countries and even surpassed , the price has declined . For . the last five years many of the largest sugar estates in Cuba have been losing money . Nor was the situation improved by the efforts of the Cuban Government to restrict the crop , The result was to hamper Cuban growers at a time when there were no corresponding restrictions on other producers . The economic decline is shown not only in the sugar industry but in other lines of work . indirectly dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the discharge of many workers . The , increase in the number of unemployed has been accompanied . by , a decline in the pnrchaid. of all.sorts id merchandise and has , in ' turn , slowed up the entire business of the island . What the government of Cuba ' can ' do to relieve the situation is not clear . Enlarged public ' works are so ? localized as . to , benefit only a small portion of the people . , Renewed restrictions on the output of sugar can not help , as the price is determined not by Cuba 's production but by world supplies . Since Cuba produces scarcely a fifth of the world 's sugar , it is obvious that artificial attempts to raise prices by restricting Cuban sugar can not bring about the desired result . The power of the sugar lobby in the United States is so great that there seems little hope that there will be any further reductions in the tariff on Cuban sugars . The prospect for the Cuban industry looks dark . According to agricultural experts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
