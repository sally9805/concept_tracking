One day late in 1905 Elbert Henry Gary , board chairman of U. S. Steel Corp. , set a well-manicured finger firmly down on a map of northern Indiana . Said he to his directors : " This will be our metropolis . We 'll build near the railroad junction of Chicago where acres of land can be had for almost the asking , midway between the ore regions of the North and the coal lands of the South and East . " The Steel directors nodded consent . <P> Purchased were 8,000 acres of barren sand dunes . On March 12 , 1906 surveyors drove their first stakes among the tumbleweeds for U. S. Steel 's fiat city . Streets were laid out , houses built , water and gas mains sunk . Top soil was brought in to spread over the sand , to grow trees and grass in . Great scoopers chewed a mile-long harbor back from Lake Michigan . Railroad connections were made . Against the sky began to rise the jagged outlines of steel mills , foundries , tin-plate plants . Within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it by industrial magic rose Gary , great est single steel city in the U. S. A public demonstration occurred in July 1908 , when , with the city finished , the first cigar-shaped ore boat nosed its way into Gary Harbor , unloaded its cargo , set the mills to thundering . <P> Last week it took Gary four days of boisterous civic celebrating to commemorate its 25th anniversary and the passing of the 100,000 population mark . Parades moved down its smoke-begrimed streets ( Gary has aged far beyond its years ) . Schoolboys drilled , bands played , horns tooted - and the mills closed for a whole day while workers of 50 nationalities made merry . A downpour bedraggled the last day of the celebration , caused a postponement of park pageants . <P> What the late Chairman Gary would have liked best about his city 's jubilee was a banquet at the Hotel Gary at which was formed the Pioneer Society of Gary , composed of men who helped build the city a quarter century ago . Presiding was William Palmer Gleason who superintended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. S. Norton , now president of the Commercial Club who as agent for the Gary Land Co. did as much as anybody to develop the city . Present also was William Albert Wirt , the first and only superintendent of schools , who devised the famed " Gary Plan . " * <P> <P> *Under this plan public schools operate 48 weeks per year . Work , study and play are joined together as one educational unit . The school plant combines classrooms , playgrounds , gardens , workshops , library and social centre . High-school subjects are started in grammar school . The school capacity is doubled by operating on an 8-hour day with indoor and outdoor activities conducted simultaneously . Critics once loudly complained that this school system was arranged by the efficient Steel Corp . to meet the domestic needs of employes who used to work 12 hr. per day in the mills .
