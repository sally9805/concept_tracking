JUNIOR MISS A STORY BY MARGARET CULKIN BANNING S HEILA did n't know the new boy at the gasoline station but Carol spoke to him . Carol knew almost everybody . That was because she had gone to East High for a year before she went away to school . This boy was quite old , probably twenty , and very good-looking . . " Hello , Mark . " " Hello , Carol . How are you ? " She left it to him to guess how anyone would be who had a tan like caramel frosting and plenty of tennis muscle . " You working here ? " she asked . " That 's one way of putting it , " he said , giving her the look that showed that girls were never any trouble to him . " This is Mark Brett , Sheila Farmer . The two in the rumble , if they still happen to be there , are Becky Spengler and  --  but you probably know Joan Guilford . " " Sure I do . Hello , Joan . " Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that sociability in an attendant was not the most important thing . He became businesslike . " High test ? " " No , low , " said Sheila quickly , " I think that 's just as good . " " Just about , " he agreed , " unless you 're going to climb trees . How many ? " Sheila hated to mention a mean little number like four , but allowances wereallowances . She looked at her gasoline meter which had been reading " Empty " for the last two miles and said carelessly , " Oh , four will he all right . " He wiped her windshield just as carefully as if she had filled her tank with high test , and she thanked him with an appreciative glance which included his looks as well as his services . There was no change , and she started off with such dash that the two in the rumble scat were jerked forward . " Have some decency ! " shouted Becky over the restless back-firing . " We are n't just two old trunks back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her excited , " said Carol turning her head . " Do n't be such a lump . I never saw him before . Who is he ? " " He used to be the big shot at East High . " " When ? " " Oh , almost always . For a long while . He was a grand football player . I guess they hung on to him for that . And he certainly had all the girls wringing their hands . " " Have you heard what he told somebody ? " Joan called against the wind . They turned side faces to listen , Sheila with a casual eye on traffic . " He said that he 'd necked every girl in High School who interested him and that now he was beginning on the girls home from boarding school . " " There 's a break for you , Sheila . " Sheila made a noise of derision and defiance . " Nobody necks me , " she announced . " Is that getting to be a pose or do you really still feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . I just think it 's disgusting , " said Sheila . " It makes me sick . How any of you can let those greasy boys touch you when you know they go away and brag about it ! " Carol giggled . " You take it a lot too seriously , " she said . Joan , leaning forward on the rim of the rumble seat , explained : " It makes a lot of difference who the boy is , of course . But you have to have experience some day . " Becky said nothing . She was lifting her hand to salute three or four boys who rode by in a rush of wind and a red car . " Was n't that John Palmer 's new ear ? " " Is n't it a beauty ? " " His father gave it to him for getting a prize in Math at St. Andrews . " " You know all the older girls are making a fuss over John . Of course he does look at least twenty-one . " " Not to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He 's always been that way since he used to recite the Kings of England at us to show how smart he was . I met him on the street the other day and he looked at me with his **35;220;TOOLONG expression and said , ' Still getting along without make-up , are n't you ? ' Is he coming out to the cottage tonight , Beck ? " " He and Rufe and Cub and Bob . Cub will pick you up , and Carol and Rufe will go out with you too , if he can get his ear . His family may be going to need it and they have n't anything else but that electric , so it 's still a little bit up in the air . But he was going to leave word at my house . " " We can have our car if we take the blamed chauffeur , " said Carol with a touch of bitterness . " That would be a real treat  --  to ride behind old , doddering Oscar . " " I do n't know yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheila . " Oh , you simply must . " " Father says I 'm running around too much , " she quoted . " I wonder what they all want us to do . " " Enjoy scenery and read good books , of course . Play badminton in the back yard . Be wholesome . How I hate that fat word ! Father even had a fit because we went to the barbecue after that band concert the other night . " " Mother 's that way too , " said Joan . " She 's always talking about What Might Happen . " " I wish a little more would happen around here , that 's what I wish . " " There 's the Midsummer Cotillion , but we wo n't get invitations this year . " " I 'll bet they ask John Palmer . " " Oh , they always want extra men and , seen from a distance , John looks something like a man , " remarked Sheila . Becky said , " I was n't supposed to say anything about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be asked this year . " They were instantly attentive . Bill Spengler was important and anything he said was big news . He was Becky 's older brother and more than half way through Yale . " You mean us ? " asked Carol specifically . Becky almost lowered her voice as if the wind might carry talcs . " It is n't sure . Do n't say a thing about it . Because the older girls have n't decided . Some of them think that in your first three years of prep school you ought to be kept strictly off the scene . " " Well , maybe we would n't have a go and ask your mother about to-night . And then let 's get hold of the boys and get started . It 's three now . " " Mother 's having a luncheon . " " Ca n't you just speak to her ? " " I guess so . Probably I 'd better . If we 're going to get way out there and swim before dinner we 'll have to get started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove to Sheila 's house . Quite a number of cars were parked before it . " You wait here , " said Sheila . " I 'll go in and ask . " " You do n't think it would add weight if we all came in ? " asked Becky . " They always like to see the younger set , " said Carol . " It gives them something to disapprove of all afternoon . " " I 'm managing this , " said Sheila . " Stay out . Mother said that she did n't want us barging in and out to-day . " " Well , do n't take forever . " Luncheon was still going on . The house looked rather partyish with more flowers about than usual and a tang of cigarette in the air . Sheila skirted the front hall and went out to the kitchen to reconnoiter . There she ate a piece of angel food , a cheese roll , and two hunks of preserved cantaloupe . " Go in and tell them it 's all over , " she suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving in China . " Hilda started to laugh loudly and put her hand over her mouth to stop it . " There 's ice cream left , Miss Sheila , " she said , but Sheila shook her head . A girl had to think of her figure once ina while , and besides she 'd had ice cream at Joan 's for lunch . She stood near the door between the butler 's pantry and the dining room and listened . It was talk that was keeping them at the table , not food . " Of course I always say that it gets right back to the home . A girl will act as she 's been taught to act . " That voice belonged to Dolly Andrews ' mother , and she was one of the women who never ought to make a remark like that , thought Sheila . If she taught Dolly some of her tricks she should n't brag about them . " Have you seen little Becky Spengler this summer ? She 's become very pretty . Really a beauty . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he faded at twenty and forgotten at twenty-five . " Evidently Mrs. Spengler was n't there for lunch . " I was so amused to see that at the Country Club the other night young John Palmer was there and quite a beau ! " " That boy 's only seventeen . " There was a rapid , ironic voice . " Juvenile gossip always seems so abnormal to me . Scandal 's really the one thing adults might retain for their own use . " Everybody laughed . That was probably Mrs. Haglin . Sheila approved of her . She was old but she showed that a woman could be interesting after thirty . She went abroad a lot and had lovely clothes . When you met her in the locker room of the Country Club she was n't always audibly asking someone who that child was . She minded her own business beautifully . She heard someone else say in answer to some statement lost in the laughter , " I know , but they 're just children under the lipstick . " The chairs moved and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen entrance to the hall and tried to flag her mother . " Hello , darling , " said Mrs. Farmer . " I 'm so glad you came in . You know Mrs. Crosby  --  Mrs. Helm  --  Mrs. Haglin  --  yes , is n't she huge ? I ca n't imagine having a daughter this size . Do you know we wear the same clothes now ? We both shop in the junior miss department . " " That 's because you 've got a sixteen-year-old figure too , Helen . " Mrs. Farmer liked to hear that said . Ithad been a popular remark all summer . Sheila passed from hand to hand . She looked demure and agreeable and docile . She said that she liked her school ever so much , that she was going back about the middle of September , that she did like Connecticut , that she was having a grand time , and that she was awfully glad to be home . The answers were no effort . She always kept them on hand . " Is it all right if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic supper ? " she asked when that was over . Mrs. Farmer , a little flushed by her luncheon , attempted quick concentration . " Who 's going ? " " Just Becky and Joan and Carol and a few boys . Cub and Bob and a couple of others . " She did not mention John Palmer by name because that would admit thinking of him . It was rather a public interview . Several of the guests were listening , and Sheila knew that her mother would have to make it a model occasion . " Will there be some older person there ? " " Mrs. Spengler 's sister  --  the one who writes  --  is staying at the Lake . " " And you 'll get home early ? " Someone asked , " Just what is early ? " " Eleven at the latest , " said Sheila 's mother firmly . " Be sure of that , Sheila . You know how your father feels . " " 0 . K. " said Sheila . " She 's such a lovely girl , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably saying that , but it gave her no pleasure . Some compliments were no good at all . " I like the way she asked permission to go . I thought this modern generation did n't bother about permissions . " " Oh , Charley and I insist on knowing everything Sheila does , " said Mrs. Farmer . " You and Charley are optimists , " said Mrs. Haglin . " Is this a party to-night ? " " Oh , no . They just go out and have a swim and a little picnic supper . It 's a very simple , normal kind of thing . Just what I like to have her do in the summer . It 's so relaxing . And that cottage of the Spenglers ' is such a lovely place . The setting 's beautiful , and Bess has such good taste . " Sheila was half way down the walk . She saw a dusty car drive off and a small boy , who had emerged from it , lugged a duffle bag up toward the house . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke to him . " Hello , " she said , " did you get any honors at camp ? " " Maybe , " said her brother . " How are you ? Having any luck with the boys yet ? I see a whole crowd of gigglers parked out in your ear . " " You 'd better go to the back door , " said Sheila . " Mother 's having a party . " He looked disgruntled and then cheerful . " Good stuff to eat ? " he asked . She grinned . " Yes  --  pig . Gobs of ice cream . " He hurried , pulling at the heavy duffle bag , and she gave it a helping kick , but that was as far as an unsentimental affection would allow her to help a brother . " You did n't use my golf balls , did you ? " he asked . " Those horrid little twenty-five cent things ? " she answered ambiguously and went out to the waiting car . " We 're all children under our lipstick , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can go all right . Eleven 's the dead line . " She delivered the girls at their houses , went home , and reached her own room without adult observation . The room was very pleasant , for the afternoon sun was baffled by the deep awning outside her windows . She felt a little tired and pretty much in a hurry , for Cub would be along in about twenty minutes according to the last schedule . Clothes had to be considered . The white suit she had on was a total mess , and everyone had seen everything she had a thousand times . She wished that she had something to wear that John Palmer would notice . She did n't want to please him but only to startle him . It would probably be one more dull evening , the way they always were when you did n't neck . Sheila knew how it was . She was popular with the girls but not especially with the boys . They liked her all right . They respected her , as her mother said . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked in the glass at her black hair and white skin with its peppering of freckles . " I 'm tiresome to look at , " she said aloud and plunged into her wardrobe . There was nothing fit to wear . Grass stain on her sport shoes , and the white piqu ? suit had a streak of plum juice down the front . The yellow made her look fat for some reason and , good dress or not , she would n't wear it any more . The pink was in the wash . The knitted blue might have done but that must be at the cleaner 's , since it could n't be located . She looked at a couple of useless organdies and a row of uniforms of various colors on hangers . There they were , waiting . It wouldn'tbe so bad to get back to school . it would be fun to see Kit . But Kit would have so much to tell , and boys from every prep school in the United States would be writing Kit . And here she herself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing up no romance whatsoever . It was all very well to please your mother and ladies who came to lunch , but there was not much in it for you . She thought with a little homesickness of last summer when everybody had just played around and nothing had been so complicated , and of summers before that at camp . But you could n't be hanging around camps all your life of course . You had to grow up . Carol liked it and so did Joan and Becky , and they 'd always been her best friends . irrelevantly and fiercely she thought that she hated necking and went into her mother 's room to see what was there in the way of clothes . Maybe she could borrow something . In the best wardrobe her hands drifted along a line of evening dresses . She thought that when she grew up she would have dozens of them and wear one to dinner every night , not just for parties . Of course you could n't do it here . You could n't just sit opposite Jimmy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed , and wear evening clothes . You had to have a panelled dining room and only adults , very young but very worldly adults . People let themselves get in a rut , she thought critically . Mother and father did . There was n't really much to choose from . She could n't wear as many of her mother 's things as Mrs. Farmer said in her boastful amusement . The suits were too old looking , and the sport dresses were n't quite the same style . Of course there was that greenand-white linen . It was quite new , Sheila was perfectly aware . She had JUNIOR MISS ell seen her mother take it out of the box a day or two ago , and it came from a very good shop . She carried it back to her own room and tried it on just to have a look . It seemed a little youngish for her mother , looked at quite impersonally , but there was no doubt that it was a most effective dress . She heard an imperative honking outside and realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decision she made up her mind that she could explain to her mother that she had not had time to take it off , and she would be terribly careful of it and either press it in the morning or get Hilda to do it . She picked a small lump of white crocheted silk off a chair , rolled it carefully into a head covering , put an infinitesimal feather in the side of it , picked up a bathing suit , towels , and a bag to put them in , forgot a handkerchief , and was off . " Good-by , " she called as she passed the living room . Mrs. Farmer , who could play an excellent game of contract and at the same time be a conscientious mother , called back , " Good-by , darling . And remember , not later than eleven ! " The Spengler cottage had been one of Bess Spengler 's enthusiasms a few years ago , and she still did n't admit that forty acres of spruce-covered land on the edge of a blue-green lake and a shingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much to her as it had when she had so carefully furnished it . She had loved it but she always loved things so furiously that most of her passions were almost bound to wane . The deep porches with their bright , rain-proof hammocks and swings , the little bedrooms all in key , with blankets and bedspreads from hand looms in Carolina , were just as charming as they had been in the beginning . But after all the place lacked a golf course , and there were nohorses within miles , and Mrs. Spengler had just decided that golf and riding were the two things that keep a woman young . So it had seemed an almost perfect arrangement to let her sister  --  the one who had turned out so strangely to be an author and was a person to be proud of though she did have a way of putting things in print that made her family hlush  --  stay there and get inspiration by the brainful . The understanding was that the caretaker would do the cooking and also that the children , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then or bring some of their friends out for an occasional picnic supper . But otherwise Marian Wade 's inspirations were to be subjected to no interruptions . Miss Wade also had thought it was a good solution for her . The cottage was to her mind a little overdone and had lost rural values . She would have preferred to be spending the summer , as she had intended , in an inn on the edge of the Black Forest . There were too many printed linens , too much Deruta pottery all over this place of her sister 's . But the Black Forest had proved expensive to reach and too remote at the moment from publishers . Besides , the lake before the cottage had an amazing way of turning primitive on some mornings , particularly when it rained , and the shadows of the spruces were dull , black , and sinister . There were things that even rich relatives could not spoil . The greatest difficulty Miss Wade found with the source of her inspiration was the sudden descents of her sister 's children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called children . She had known them from birth , in every stage of growth , but they seemed utter strangers , immature , uncouth but not youthful . They were sometimes announced by telephone , but again a car drove up with a speed that seemed to indicate flight from the police , Bill and other young men got out , invaded the bathing house , plunged into the lake , shouted , smoked , made great wet tracks with male feet all over the sand and the wharf , spoke to her  --  but never said anything  --  and went away . They were annoying but they were on the whole less annoying and more transient than Becky 's invasions . Becky stayed longer and brought more people , usually both boys and girls . They , too , swam and shouted . They stayed for supper and danced . They played the victrola steadily , often concentrating on some one whining , melancholy record . And though Miss Wade was aware that she was officially in charge of such gatherings  --  even supposed to be a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impervious to her presence . Everyone spoke to her with complete courtesy but they always seemed waiting for her removal or exit . She went . She had the cook bring her supper to the farthest end of the farthest porch , most remote from the victrola and slow , metrical , . dancing feet . They also had a way of coming just at the wrong time . It was especially so to-day . All afternoon Miss Wade had been struggling with a difficult chapter in her forthcoming novel . She wanted to make it perfect , to write almost lyric prose . It was the chapter of young love and needed graciousness , naivety , delicacy . In six long hours she had written about twenty lines and was just at the point when fluency seemed about to come when she heard the rush of cars and remembered that her sister had telephoned that Becky was bringing some of her friends out for supper . The supper , of course , was the cook 's business . But Miss Wade dragged herself out of reverie and composition and meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new born , and went to greet herniece and the company of friends she had brought with her . Most of the occupants of the two cars she had seen before . They seemed particularly objectionable this afternoon . A ' rude , monosyllabic disagreement began between the girl called Sheila and the young Palmer boy the moment they got out of different automobiles . The Palmer boy had , Miss Wade had once noticed , a beautifully shaped head , but she could n't imagine what was in it . They all went swimming . From the porch which faced the lake Miss Wade saw them flip backwards and forwards off the high diving board . It was a remarkable procedure to one who swam twenty yards , breast stroke , with difficulty , but she did not admire it . It made her nervous and conscious that if they broke their necks someone might blame her . She was glad when they finally came out of the water . Miss Wade counted them again and , being sure they were all there , saw that the table was laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasturtiums in the middle to match the big , striped Basque napkins . Then she went off to a remote corner and had her own supper tray and tried to recapture the mood of Jennifer , even though a record soon began to scrape a tune on the victrola . Jennifer , who was the heroine of Miss Wade 's story , was an English girl and as natural as hedgerows or fields of heather . She must not be allowed to shrink from love  --  nor yet , of course , to seek it . It was difficult to know exactly what Jennifer would do while the victrola kept rasping that misbegotten music . Becky appeared . " Aunt Marian , " she said , " it 's all right , is n't it , if we drive around the lake a bit and get some air ? " To Miss Wade it was a comforting suggestion , but she had a feeling that she was expected to demur . She knew there were sets of rules for these , children , and often they were forbidden to do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple of hours ago , alone with Jennifer , Miss Wade had felt that she quite understood youth , but there was something incomprehensible about these young people . " How far do you want to go ? " she asked . " Oh , not farther than the Pavilion . We might stop there for a soda or something . " Sodas seemed revolting to Miss Wade . They had finished supper not more than an hour ago . " Do n't go off on untraveled country roads , will you ? " " Oh , heavens no ! Been too many stick-ups . " " And you should n't start back to town too late . " " Sheila 's got to be home at eleven . We 'll be back here for our coats long before that . " It seemed all right . Miss Wade heard them get into the cars , heard Sheila 's voice declaring rudely , " I 'll ride with you if you wo n't talk about your sweet self all the time , Johnny . " No graciousness , thought Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who could be counted upon to be gracious . Becky had told no lies . In her group , they were not accustomed to tell lies . Truth with one 's parents and chaperons was a matter both of principle and wisdom , but limitation of the truth sometimes did no harm . There might be an orchestra at the Pavilion to-night , but it would not be like attending a public dance to stumble on one , as it were , and dance around once or twice . In the meantime there were other things to settle . " Cling to your wheel , " said Sheila , " I do n't go in for things like that . " t " Oh , you do n't . Why not ? " " It does n't interest me . " That was n't true at all . It not only interested her but it worried her . They spoke in low voices . The people in the rumble seat could mind their own business . " You 're beginning to be pretty , " said John critically . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky dress . " Yes , I 'll give Greta Garbo a run all right , " she mocked herself . His arm made another gesture and returned to the steering wheel . " Do n't make any exceptions ? " " I have n't . " " Maybe you 're going to find things a little dull . " " Oh , I 'll worry along , " said Sheila . She tried to be casual but she felt rather stiff and priggish . " Have it your own way , " said John , " but if you 're really not going to neck any , Sheila , you 'll need an awfully good line . " " I 'm thinking of learning the names of the Kings of England , " she said derisively . It was a pretty miserable ride . They used only edged words . When he stopped the car and helped her out she was sure he would n't even dance with her . He did n't . He danced with Carol , cheek to cheek , and she bad Cub on her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would learn to dance . For one thing he ate too much . He was the sort of boy who still came to the house wondering what the refreshments were going to be and when . She was protecting her feet and wishing that Joan would be a little generous with Bob , which was not Joan 's way , when someone stopped them . " Finish it with me ? " he asked . " Hello , Mark , " said Cub . Sheila remembered . This was the boy who worked at the gasoline station , the one Carol had introduced to her that afternoon . She put her arm on his shoulder , and they picked up the thread of the music . Sheila had never danced with anyone who was quite so skillful . He did n't dance in John 's definitely formalized , expert prep-school way . This was a different type of dancing , very easy , very habitual , a little ornate . It seemed to fit the place they were in , she thought , and was excited . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think so ? " " I 've been wanting to meet you , " he said flatteringly . " Since when ? " " Ever since . " It was the technical slang of admiration , of starting something . The music stopped , and they went out on the board walk , down toward the public beach . She began to wonder what he 'd think when he found out that she did n't neck . Probably she was a fool . He was so very good-looking and he danced so well and he had picked her out of the whole crowd . Then she remembered what he had been quoted as saying about necking every girl he liked in High School and now beginning on the girls home from boarding school . Well , she 'd break his record for him . " Sorry , " she said , a minute later , " I do n't go in for that sort of thing at all . " " My mistake , " said Mark . She tried to laugh in an easy , worldly way , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . But it just does n't mean a thing to me , " she told him . He could go and find somebody else , old public-neck Joan , and have a good time , if he liked . But he did n't go . He said , " You know I kind of thought you 'd be like that . " " Do n't mind ? " " No , I like it . You know everybody thinks a boy 's always crazy about that sort of thing . " " Well , are n't they pretty much ? " " Oh , I do n't know . You get awfully disappointed in some girls . The way they act . " " It seems to me that you ought to be able to talk to each other  --  I do n't mean sit around making speeches all the time but  --  you know . " He claimed that he did . The night was soft and black , and the water lapped softly up on the public beach where Sheila had been forbidden to bathe , partly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might be there . " Nice here to-night , " said Sheila ; and if Miss Wade had only known , the evasive mood of the fictional Jennifer was in those three words . " Want to dance some more ? The music 's begun again . " They went back and had almost finished another dance when someone else cut in . " My turn , small one . " This time she was even more astonished . For it was Bill Spengler . It was Yale in person , showing her the most unusual favor . Of course she knew that those older boys went around to dances like this and left the girls their own age at home half the time , but still she was surprised to see him and still more surprised to be noticed . It must be the green-and-white dress . Or else it was chaperonage . " What are you and Beck doing here ? " he asked . " Should n't you kids be in bed ? " " It is n't quite time , is it ? " she inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 'd you pick up that fellow you were dancing with ? " " Mark ? " " He 's a pretty fast boy . " " Oh , nobody 's fast with me , " said Sheila . " Is that a fact ? " " Do you want witnesses ? " " No -- I 'll take your word for it . How about Becky ? Is she a necker ? " She was glad to be able to tell the truth about Becky to her brother . " Becky does n't have to neck . She gets them anyway . " He grinned . " That 's right , " he said . " She 'd better behave herself or she 'll hear from me by air mail . Your little red-haired chum Joan seems to be a hot number , though . " " Oh  --  well  --  Joan , " said Sheila , and was willing to let it go at that . " What about her ? " be persisted . " I do n't know . Joan 's the sort that can take the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That amused him . " Not bad , " be said . " You 're on the right track , too , if you do n't neck . You and Becky and the rest better watch your step because people have their eyes on you . You 'll get tried out one of these days . " Did he mean the Midsummer Cotillion , she wondered ? Were they really going to be asked to that ? " So you think it 's right not to neck ? " He was judicial . " It is at your age . You just keep on the way you are . And when you get old enough and want to know something about necking I 'll come around some night and show you how . " His glance was entirely patronizing but there was some appreciation in it . " Gives me something to live for , " she said . " You and Beck better dig out of here now , " Bill suggested . It was in its way a command . It carried authority . " O. K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others up . Mark Brett flagged her as they went toward the door . " When can I call you up ? " " When the line 's not busy , " she said . " Good-night . Nice dance . " She knew that Beck was looking at her curiously and Joan with a gleam of envy . In forty minutes she was home , interviewing her mother . " It 's only a quarter past eleven . And you do n't want us to speed . " " You know how I worry when you 're late . But it is n't just that . You were n't at the Spengler cottage all evening , for I telephoned to tell you which door would be open and you were n't there . " " We just drove around the lake and stopped at the Pavilion . Miss Wade ? Beck 's aunt  --  said it would be all right . " " But that 's no place for young sixteen-and seventeen-year-old girls , especially unchaperoned . What did you do there ? " " Just danced a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . We only stayed a little while . " Mrs. Farmer could not feel that it was really very reprehensible or that much harm had been done . " I do n't want you to go to a place like that again . " " All right , " said Sheila agreeably , " I wo n't . " " And how about that dress of mine ? " asked her mother . " I did n't have a thing to wear , " said Sheila . " It 's just wrinkled a little . I 'll press it in the morning . " Her mother was looking at her . Perhaps she saw that the dress was no good to her now and that she could n't expect to look as Sheila did in it , not just youngish but really young , glowing as if she 'd made the dress a success instead of being dependent on it . " You keep it . It looks quite well on you . " " Oh , Mother , you 're grand ! " said Sheila . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start she had put her mind on being a good mother and ever since Sheila 's birth she had been extravagantly praised for her results . It was only lately that there seemed to be so many problems and cross problems , what with chaperonage , proper diversion , development , clothes , thoughts , and manners . It was no longer just a matter of choosing the right camp and the right school and keeping the home charming and pleasant , or of setting the right activities in motion . The children set things in motion themselves and that could be confusing . But even more troubling were those times when Mrs. Farmer knew what her children were doing and where they were and yet had a strange feeling that something was evading her , not because it was sly or deceitful but because it had no relation to her experience . She did not know what the children were thinking even when they told her . There was a curious vein of irony in their attitude toward many things and a ruthlessness of approach . She could feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the matter of this boy called Mark Brett who kept calling Sheila up and coming to see her . Mrs. Farmer met him on the veranda one night and thought he was quite a nice-looking boy . But he seemed to be on the veranda rather often , and twice in one morning when Mrs. Farmer was trying to use the upstairs telephone she interrupted conversations between him and Sheila , who was using the library extension . She was n't foolish enough to begin with repressions . She tried liberalism . " I 'm sure that 's a nice boy , Sheila . " Sheila said something vague about his being all right . " But I wonder , with so many of the boys you 've known all your life home from school , if you would n't have a better time seeing more of them . " " I see them plenty , " said Sheila , " all I can stand . Whom do you mean ? " " Boys like John Palmer ? " " John 's gone to his own head , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Mark ? " asked Mrs. Farmer , forced to the point . " Oh , he 's a High School boy . Works in the gas station at Oak and Eleventh Streets . " " That 's fine , " said her mother , " but how about his family ? " " His father is a conductor on the railroad , " said Sheila . " They live in quite a pretty bungalow on the other side of town . I guess he does a little bootlegging on the side . At Ieast so I 've been told . " " But , Sheila , you ca n't know people whose families sell liquor ! " " How about Beck 's grandfather ? " asked Sheila . " Look at him . " No one could look at him . He was dead . But it was easy to remember what the Spenglers chose to forget , that large corner saloon which had so long been Spengler 's Chop House . " No one could be more democratic than I am , " said Mrs. Farmer , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a question of the people whom you 're going to meet later on . " " How do we know whom we 're going to meet later on ? " inquired Sheila . " What do you mean ? " " Oh , with the world changing and everything , " she answered , " maybe everybody 's ideas will be different a few years from now . Maybe we 'll all go bolshevik anyhow . " " It 's not so imminent , " said Mrs. Farmer , and was glad when Sheila turned the conversation until she saw where it was going . " I want to ask you something , Mother . Can I have a new formal ? " " You do n't need a new evening dress . You 've got the organdie and the flowered chiffon . And you 're going back to school and ca n't use one there . Perhaps for Christmas , if there are some parties ? " " I need one now , " said Sheila darkly . " For what ? " " Maybe we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midsummer Cotillion ! Why , you 're not old enough for that . That 's the dance Marcia Davis and her friends give . " " Just the same we may get asked . Bill Spengler 's on the committee . He 's considering it . " " I do n't think I 'd let you go anyway . They 're all nineteen and twenty and even older . It is n't suitable . " " But mother , if I should get the chance it would be crazy not to go . Any girl would jump at the chance . " " Well , do n't get your hopes up . " The telephone rang . With an air of custom the maid called Sheila . And , before Mrs. Farmer was through pondering , her daughter was back , radiant with excitement . " That was Becky . We are asked , mother . Beck says Bill 's arranged everything , even the boys who have to take us . He told John Palmer to take me . Rufe takes Becky . Now I 've got to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organdie . " " But I have n't decided to let you go . I 'll have to talk it over with your father anyway . " " Tell him I just could n't not go , " said Sheila , reckless with negatives . She turned back at the door . " Anything you want at the drugstore ? " " Yes . A box of bath soap . You can charge it . " That was luck . Sheila went out in a floating-on-air mood and drove down to the drugstore opposite the gas station , at Oak and Eleventh . She Eked to go there . If one went in and did n't hurry , the chances were that Mark could manage a few minutes off and come over to join her in a chocolate soda . It often happened that way . Never had they agreed to meet there . But her roadster was signal enough . He already knew about the dance . Carol , dropping in for gas , had spread the news . " Going ? " asked Mark . " I guess so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know I 'm not like that . " " I guess it makes a difference if a fellow does n't go away to school . " She was moved by an immense democracy , a mood starting from an-emotion and growing into what felt like great intellectual proportions . For the first time a free country meant more than a phrase . Liberty equality  --  opportunity all jangled in her head . " I do n't see what earthly difference going away makes , " she said . " Well , I 'm sorry I ca n't dance with you . " She was sorry too . She knew as they Ieft the drugstore that she would prefer him and his dancing to any she might have . But none the Less she would go to the Midsummer dance . She would get through the necessary family sessions , she would obtain the formal even if she had to give up a lot of stuff for her room at school , and go . Of course you had to go to the Midsummer Cotillion when you had the luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farmer knew in her debating mind what her ultimate decision would be . In a way it was a good thing . Probably this would distract Sheila from that Mark , and while there was nothing worth thinking of as even childishly serious , it was best to divert her . She would get Sheila the new dress  --  and make her own white chiffon do until September . Nothing important was happening . She was somewhat flattered that Sheila should he popular enough to be asked to the debutante party . The child must come home early , but after all it was just a little private dance at the Club all their friends belonged to . But she knew her task was not yet done . She certainly must have a talk with Sheila and explain things about democracy and the building up of affections . After all It was at that point in her meditations that she heard Jimmy going through the upstairs hall singing , off key . He had learned a number of ballads at camp , all of them jocular and bordering on the ribald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Listerine  --  sister wants a beau Oh , a girl 's best friend is her mother . " Mrs. Farmer shuddered . For that last line had been the very thought on the tip of her mind . Was nothing safe from their curious irony ? But Sheila was not ironic during the next few days . She was patient and explanatory with her parents , with her mother over the cut and length of the new formal , with her father over the time of coming home . " We ca n't come at eleven because it does n't start until then . " " Does n't start ! " " They 've engaged the orchestra from ten-thirty until four . But nothing much happens before twelve . " " Why do n't they wait and have their party the next day ? " asked her father sarcastically and said that he wanted her home by two o'clock at the latest . " And it 's not setting any precedent , " he added . " I think I 'll take you fishing next week . " Sheila smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think no farther than Thursday night . Even Jimmy , with his evil and much-to-the-point remarks that she 'd probably have a rotten time and nobody would cut in on her , could n't trouble her . Life was full and altogether successful . For she 'd done no necking , and yet the boy who had been the Big Shot at High School was crazy about her . It was better than that . She , along with Beck , the beauty , and Carol , the terribly rich , and Joan , the hot number , was asked to the Midsummer dance . Bill Spengler had singled her out . He had n't forgotten . Her formal was a lovely dress , pale , flesh-colored lace . She walked dreamily around the house looking for long mirrors . She looked unexpectedly grown up , even to herself . But eleven o'clock was so long in coming , and her parents had objected to any plan of dinner before the party as being over-sophisticated . The girls all telephoned one another , but there was an end to that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were to look in at the dance later as chaperons , had gone out for a game of bridge , and Sheila waited for the lagging hours to pass and wished that Mark could see her . Well , why not ? There was time enough . She was moved by a tender pity for him , out of all this . He had n't called her to-night and was probably hurt . She might try the drugstore . She really did need a toothbrush , and her car was in the garage . It took only the usual six minutes to reach the drugstore on the upper corner of Oak Street . She got out with an air of great sophistication and was about to open the door when she saw Mark already at the counter inside . He was not unaccompanied . With him there was a dark girl in a red jacket and beret . She had a pretty face , but Sheila knew that her mother would say it was bold . She looked like the kind of girl who never had to ask permission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a good time in the very seats where Mark and Sheila often sat , and it even seemed that they were drinking chocolate sodas . Sheila knew at sight that the girl was a necker . She turned . The world had become impossible and yet there it was , in her way . She drove home , put the car away carefully , and went into the house . She decided that she would stay home , send back the formal , explain nothing to anyone . She looked in the mirror and made another plan , usually made by women in such case . She would go to the dance and turn disillusion into cold , hard , worldly success . She 'd go in for older boys and perhaps for necking . Let Bill Spengler teach her . He probably wanted to . By some miracle of passing time it was at last eleven . The tall figure coming up the steps was John Palmer . It was twelve . The Country Club was at last crowded . Mrs. Farmer , looking on , saw dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , coming in , going out , being cut in on , being hung up . Sheila seemed to be having a good time . She was dancing with Cub Jones and smiling . How was her mother to know that Sheila 's smile felt like plaster of Paris ? For the four youngest couples at the dance , either by common agreement or careless accident , were being left to themselves . They were not even being snubbed . They were being ignored . Sheila felt helplessly young , up against the stone wall of her own youth . John danced with her . So did Cub , Bob , Rufe . The four she could have danced with anywhere . The four she would probably have to dance with all her life , she thought bitterly . Here we go , hopping around , and nobody dreams of cutting in . Once Bill Spengler caught her eye and waved casually as he waited for his chance to cut in on Marcia Davis . " Want to go outside ? " asked John . " Let 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What time is it ? " she asked . He said , " One o'clock . They 'll have supper soon . " " I have to be home by two , " she said . " I suppose that means only a couple of dances after supper . " He started to put his arm around her and she stiffened . Let the rest of them if they liked . She would n't . " Still bite ? " he asked . " I hate that stuff , " she said bitterly . " Oh , I guess you 're about right , " he agreed . " Believe it or not , I like a girl who does n't neck . " She did n't believe him . She did n't intend to believe anyone again who told her that . " I think this is kind of a bum dance , " he said . " They 're all so old . " She realized that John would not quite dare to cut in on those older girls . That was satisfying . There 'd be something left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stupid ? " she agreed . " We have a dance at St. Audrews every year , you know . " " So I 've heard . " " Why do n't you come up for it sometime ? " She looked at him with more interest . After all he was good-looking , and his photograph would be a success at school . " Will you teach me the Kings of England if I do ? " she asked . Mrs. Farmer heard her daughter come in . She lay very still and thought with comfort that Sheila was safe at home in her pretty room and that soon she would be safely back at school . The house , faintly stirred by Sheila 's coming , grew quickly quiet . Sheila lay awake for a few minutes too . The bruise that Mark had made on her emotions hurt . The bruise on her pride that Bill Spengler had made still hurt . But not so much . She thought of the St. Andrews dance . She also thought with comfort of school . There was really going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
