In the City , bustling citadel of London finance , " Leith-Ross of the Treasury " is an awe-inspiring name , but few Britons outside the pale of highest Empire finance have ever heard of him . Last New Year 's Day small notice was taken when the King-Emperor made Sir Frederick Leith-Ross a Knight Commander of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath . Soon afterwards the City heard that tall , cool , piercing-eyed Sir Frederick , Chief Economic Adviser to His Majesty 's Government , would be sent to the White House this autumn to negotiate a final settlement of the Empire 's War debt to the U. S. He sailed last week on the Majestic with genial , expansive , moose-tall British Ambassador to the U. S. Sir Ronald Lindsay . With elaborate understatement , Sir Frederick observed : " I am visiting America to observe the feeling toward the question of the War Debts . I expect I shall be presented with an opportunity of discussing the position with President Roosevelt . " <P> Correspondents learned from authoritative sources in the City and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 ) to settle Britain 's debt once &; for all by a lump sum payment in Roosevelt dollars ( worth 65 each last week ) ; 2 ) to raise this lump by selling British dollar bonds to U. S. investors . <P> Under the Empire 's present debt agreement Britain is scheduled to pay the U. S. roughly $11,000,000,000 in annuities running until 1984 . The lump sum Sir Frederick reputedly has in mind is $1,000,000,000 . If he finds that Wall Street can not float so large a bond issue , the lump may have to be smaller . " The best solution , of course , " correspondents were told by a candid Exchequer functionary , " would be cancellation of the entire debt . " <P> Since only Congress can swallow or reject the British lump , and since Congress is not to meet until January , Sir Frederick and President Roosevelt face the pressing issue of what to do on Dec. 15 , when a British annuity payment of $117,000,000 falls due . On the previous annuity date , last June 15 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu of the $76,000,000 then due . In London last week City financiers were confident that Sir Frederick will offer a " much larger token " on Dec. 15 , hoping thus to put Congress in a lenient frame of mind .
