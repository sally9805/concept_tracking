txt Homework Condemned . To the Editor of The New York Times : After reading Mrs. Dacie Harvey 's let .. ter on " Too Much Homework " in Tian TIMES I mentally cheered that lady and wished there were more like her . This homework mania on the part of our educators is a , curse to children and parents.e I have children going to high school , and If you saw their homework assignment you would begin to wonder what all this noise is about child-labor laws . If homework is n't labor , pray what is it ? And it 's absolutely true about them staying up to 10 and 11 o'clock doing their homework . No doubt you have read and heard plenty of lectures by these same educators on the importance of the child getting plenty of sleep and fresh air . Pray , when are they supposed to get it ? Even the week-ends are loaded with homework . MARGARET DEUTSCH . Brooklyn , April 4 , 1935.               @ @ @ @ @ @
