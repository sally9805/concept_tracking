THE EIGHT-DOLLAR PUP A STORY BY PHILIP CURTISS T HE Perriers had always given their dogs " real " names for , as Mrs. Perrier once pointed out , you would not call a child or even a faithful hired man " Spot " or " Dash . " There had been , for example , Titus , the old Gordon setter whose almost centenarian existence had practically covered the span of the Perriers ' own married life . Then , at various times , there had been Frank , the pointer , Emil , the dachshund , and Benjamin Cibber , a picturesque but not very responsive little Skye . There still was Charley , a big , mongrel police dog and , although the Perriers had never really gone in for the family idea , they had once had a broody little Airedale named Mrs. Harris . Names seemed to suggest themselves as a rule as soon as an animal walked on to the premises , but when the black cow dog appeared , there was a pained and uncomfortable silence . It was Andy Payson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town , who was really responsible for the cow dog craze in West Gosset ; for just as a man who has been dining for weeks in the smartest hotels will suddenly have a craving for a doughnut and a dill pickle , so did Andy break out one evening : You know , I 'm getting awfully sick of these German schnautzhounds and Popperdene terriers that are judged merely by the length of their ears or the number of wrinkles on their noses . What has become of what we used to call ordinary ' shepherd dogs ' twenty years ago ? I do n't mean collies , exactly , and I do n't mean those long-haired English sheepdogs . I mean the kind of dog that you used to see in every farmyard , asleep under a lumber wagon . When I was a boy we had a dog like that , and I swear that he could do everything except read and write . " " I think I know where you could get one , " replied August Perrier promptly . " There 's a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm papers . He calls them just what you do  --  old-fashioned shepherds for driving sheep and cows . He 'll sell you a male pup for eight dollars and a female for three . " The whole company burst into a laugh , headed by Molly Payson . " But ca n't you just imagine , " she hazarded , " what they would be like  --  at that price ? " " I 'll bet , " retorted her husband , " that they would be a lot better dogs than that little beast of an undersized Scotty for which you paid seventy-five last year . He did n't have a brain in his head and all he thought about was his own little self . " " Well , Scotties are like that sometimes , " confessed Molly . " It 's their temperament . " " But what I want , " exclaimed Andy , " is a dog that will look up and thump the floor with his tail when I come into the room . " " Yes , I have noticed that trait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm serious , " retorted her husband . " You telephone me that address , Gus , and I 'll risk eight dollars . " He was as good as his word , and so was August Perrier . Within a week there arrived at the West Gosset express office an ordinary wooden box which was labeled , " Superior Baked Beans , " but when the three crude slats were pried off the top , out stepped a dapper little gentleman whose composure and manners were so perfect that they brought tears even to Molly 's eyes . " Ah , yes , " his demeanor announced , " you are the people I have come to see . Now if you will kindly show me where I can wash my hands .. . " True to his boyhood memories , Andy named him " Shep , " and within a week he was the sensation of the village . Everybody seemed , long ago , to have known a dog just like him . He was black , in the main , but with a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His legs and his jaws were faintly tinged with light brown , like autumn foliage , and over each eye was a single tan spot . As he grew in size , his tail became a great curving plume , and when he stood on a rock to gaze over the landscape he looked like a dog in a steel engraving of the year 1873 . As Molly said , all he needed was three sheep , a sleeping child , and Melrose Abbey in the background and , underneath , the line " Man 's Faithful Friend . " And brains ? In the case of Shep it was libellous to say that he could do everything but talk . Given the key word and the right expression in your eye , you could make him wail up and down for minutes , like an old man complaining about his feet . Andy Payson , of course , was almost unbearable in his pride . Ile spent hours and hours teaching his prot  --  g ? to walk at heel , carry newspapers , and open doors with complicated latches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send him to Yale . The next spring August Perrier himself caught the fever and sent his own cheek to the same address . What he got was  --  well , just about what be couldexpect for eight dollars . This time when Mrs. Perrier saw the box opened all she said was , " Oh . " Inside was a crouching black creature that might have been a young Newfoundland and then again might have been a trained seal . If Shep , so to speak , had come off the train putting on his kid gloves , this little fellow gave the impression of having a lollipop in each hand . One could see in his coat and his attitude the whole history of his night 's travel , and the general effect was that of a very dirty baby with his spirit ruffled , his milk bottle gone sour , and his bib twisted under one ear . If it is true that intellect and untidiness go together , this little fellow was certainly an illustration of the rule , for within a week it was obvious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever seen . He was a thinker , a hobbyist , an isolated and eccentric soul . If he had been a child he would shortly have begun to collect stamps or display an interest in mechanical drawing hut , being what he was , he became that rather rare creature  --  a hermit dog . He seldom played with other dogs , and the attempts which he did make were always followed by disaster . If there was a hole within two hundred yards , he would always manage to fall into it , and even when running by himself , his big back legs would suddenly cave in and go flop . When chasing another dog he would never seem to see the bush behind which the other dog had dodged , or else his ungainly frame could not stop in time , and he would go crashing into it . When , in his slow , tardy way he would try to wrestle with neighboring pups , it would be like watching a fight in a dream . All his muscles seemed to be made of fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach home , and his barks would never detonate . But , strangest of all , no matter what happened to him , he never changed expression . Pushed down the cellar hole or rolled in the mud , his eyes would always remain thoughtful and acceptant . As to his exterior aspects , alas , Helen Perrier had seen the whole truth when she had opened the box . An exact catalogue of his features might possibly make him seem worse than he actually was , but in general his appearance was that of an ebony sheep . His body was large and round , his head was small and pointed , and his coat was a sort of curly chinchilla . He seldom trotted from place to place , like other dogs , but almost any time one could catch him on the sky-line , going somewhere at a slow walk . He may have been a little farsighted , or else some of his ancestors had had hair over their eyes , for when you spoke to him he would lift his head rather higher than usual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man with his reading glasses still on . To name such a dog was naturally a hit of a problem , that is if one wanted a name that would really probe the depths . For a week or two he was called simply " Pup " or " Bub , " but one day when Helen Perrier was watching him from the east terrace she suddenly called to her husband : " August ! August ! I know what I 'm going to call him . His name is Joel ! " Perrier appeared behind the screen door . " Why Joel ? " " I do n't know , " replied Helen , " but he looks Like Joel . " Strangely enough he did and , as if he had only been waiting for this to be settled , he seemed to calm down from then on and live the part . He did not at once , of course , abandon all attempts to wrestle with dogs of the neighborhood , but more and more he apparently realized his limitations and proceeded to carve out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great life , but then , as he would have been the first to admit , he was not much of a dog . Sitting on a little hilltop just behind the house seemed to be one of the major features of this new and permanent existence . Just what he found there to interest him one could not imagine . Possibly he was hoping that some day therewould appear over the horizon some other dog who was interested in stamps . He had no bones there , no rabbit thickets , yet there he would remain for hours at a time . Frequently the Perriers would leave him there when they went out in the car after luncheon and find him still there when they came hack late in the afternoon . At their appearance , to be sure , he would come galloping heavily to meet them at the garage door ; but that could not have been the whole purpose of his lookout for , as soon as he knew that they were safe in the house , back he would go to his hilltop . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural . For one thing he loved to watch anyone plant anything , such as beans or onions , where he could sit in contemplation at the head of the rows . When the worker came up to his end of the field he would give one short wag and then move over to the next row . In his relations to the Perriers themselves he could have been called neither affectionate nor unaffectionate and he did not seem to care a great deal about coming into the house . When patted on his coarse , curly head he would look grateful and would wag his tail , which meant in his case a slow , undulating movement of his whole hind quarters . On the other hand , he did not demand to be a part of everything , as when visitors came to tea . After such visitors had exclaimed and gushed over big Charley and put him through all his tricks , one of them might happen to glance out of the window and say , " Hullo ! What 's this ? " " Oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our other dog . " Thus life drifted on for a couple of years , and so unobtrusively had Joel sunk into the background that the world failed to notice the day when the hilltop no longer remained his chief point of attraction . The Perriers ' dining room was on the west side of the house , and one noon , at luncheon , Helen suddenly laid down her fork . Her eyes were fixed on the open window . " I do n't want to say anything , " she remarked , quietly , " but I do believe that a bit of scandal is developing in the neighborhood . That is the third time this week that Joel has been up to call on Miss Craggs . " With the liveliest interest August Perrier followed her look , since it was the most extraordinary thing for Joel even to leave the yard . Yet there he certainly was , coming slowly down the road , with his ? sheeplike body and his pensive walk . Unlike any other dog , he did not stop to sniff at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached the gateway , or make any violent pie-tenses that he had not really left the place . Instead he continued straight ahead , with his calm , old-man 's pace , and disappeared around the ell of the house . " I thought there was something in the wind , " continued Helen , " when I saw him walking up there the other day . At first I was going to call him back , but it was so unusual that I decided to watch him and see what would happen . And there 's where he went , straight as an arrow . He turned in at the arbor and went up the front path , just as if he 'd had a date . " " He probably had , " laughed Perrier . " You do n't suppose she has a Pekinese or something ? " " Not a thing , " replied Helen , promptly , " not even a cat . I believe it 's Miss Craggs herself that is the attraction . She came out to meet him yesterday as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perrier . " If they would n't be an ideal couple ! They 're positively made for each other . She 's got lots of money , and he 'd give her a certain intellectual tone . Ca n't you see them , in the winter , driving around in her limousine in New York ? " " To the life ! " agreed Helen . " Their habits would fit to a T. Every morning she could drop him at the dog department of the Metropolitan Museum or some place where he could fuss aroundwith a few old manuscripts on ' Dog Life Among the Assyrians . ' Or he could lunch with that new Russian dog who had just arrived from Mongolia where he had dug up the most fascinating prehistoric bones , proving that the gazelle hound was really descended from the zebra . " " And at night , " chuckled Perrier , " they could go back to that old house of hers in Fifty-Seventh Street where they could sit in front of a fire with nobody but themselves and the servants . She could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could correspond with a few famous savants or write up the notes that he had made during the day . " " Of course , " added Helen , " there would be a few old friends with whom they would dine occasionally . And two or three times a winter they would go out to some staid old opera like ' Tristan ' or ' Die Meistersinger . ' " " But never , " suggested Perrier , " to anything like ' The Follies ' or Eugene O'Neill . " " Oh , never ! " agreed Helen . " As nearly as I can see , " said Perrier , " Joel 's future is settled . What do you suppose we ought to do to bring them together ? Perhaps Charley ought to give them a tea . " " We 'd better do nothing , " said Helen emphatically , " if I lmow Miss Craggs ! " Having been a neighbor for at least twelve summers , it could fairly be accepted that Helen Perrier was an authority on Miss Craggs , but as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anyone 's part was needed to forward the budding romance . Every morning , without looking either to right or to left , Joe/ would go solemnly up the road and Miss Craggs , meeting Helen one afternoon , confessed , almost blushing , " You know , I 've never eared much for animals but I do rather like to have him around . " In a week the affair was flaunting and open and in another week , due to Perrier 's efforts , it was the talk of the town . Andy Payson , in particular , seized on the idea and spent whole hours laying out great plans for what he called " the love life of the Joel Perriers . " " I think I 'd like to have them married under the apple trees , " he commented , one evening , " but considering the age and dignity of both parties , we do n't want anything of a splurge  --  just , perhaps , a few of his colleagues from Harvard and the University of Michigan and a few of her oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , and I have no doubt that they 'll get a cablegram from the Duchess of Kent . " " And as they come out to their carriage , " suggested Perrier , " six handsome greyhounds should be lined up , forming an arch of crossed mutton bones . " None of these remarks , naturally , was allowed to come to the ears of Miss Craggs herself , for hitherto Miss Annie Craggs had not been an individual with whom West Gosset had taken many liberties . She was , as Perrier 's comments might have implied , a person now well in the autumn of life , and her career in the village had been marked by that peculiar combination of a soft heart and a cantankerous manner that seems to be the unfortunate handicap of many wealthy old ladies . In her appearance , certainly , there was nothing very redoubtable but , possibly because she had lived all her life in the fear of being imposed upon , there had grown up around her a tradition of causticity that had resulted in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be undeserved it had apparently remained for Joel to discover . How he had nosed out Miss Craggs 's front porch in the first place could never be learned but , having once formed a habit of going there , it was easy to see why it was a place exactly after his own heart . There was so much neatness at Miss Craggs 's house and such complete silence . There were no other dogs there to irritate him with their continual fighting and not even a cat to make anoccasional pass at his nose . It was so peaceful after breakfast to go up to that perfect piazza and sink down with a heavy thump . Or , in the long afternoons , there was no better place in West Gosset for a dog to sit , panting slightly and thinking of this and that . Even if Miss Craggs or one of the maids patted him occasionally or urged him to move , it was done with such timidity and hesitation that a dog had time to prepare his nerves . For a time August Perrier half expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which case he was prepared to toy with the idea of offering him as a gift . It was not that he did n't like the black pup but he could recognize destiny when he saw it and would never have been willing to stand in the way of a larger and finer career . Lacking , however , any such overtures from Miss Craggs , Perrier wisely refrained from taking the first step . Having sprung , himself , from much the same New Englandish atmosphere , perhaps he understood the old lady better than his wife did . Any definite or final suggestion might very easily have frightened her into an attitude of resistance that would have ended Joel 's summer then and there . So matters rested , with great tact on both sides , until one lazy afternoon when Helen Perrier lay reading in a steamer chair on the terrace . Suddenly she felt a shadow cross the bricks at her feet and , looking up , saw an elderly parlor maid with a light cape thrown over her uniform . " Please , Mrs. Perrier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliments and she wants to know whether anything has happened to Joel . " Helen hitched up in her chair with apprehension . " Joel ? Why , not that I know of . He was here for his dinner . I saw him not long ago . " " He was n't up at . the house yesterday , " explained the maid , " and he was n't to-day . Miss Craggs did n't know . . " If Joel was not at Miss Craggs 's there was only one other place where he could possibly he , and Helen rose hastily . Sure enough , there was Joel on his hilltop , his head on his paws and his back to the sun . Helen gave a shrill whistle , and Joel vaguely lifted his head . The signal was repeated and , realizing at last that it was really for him , Joel slowly rose , shook himself , and came down the hill . At sight of the maid he gave a guarded wiggle but that was as far as he went . " Take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quite eagerly the maid urged : " Come on , Joel . " Again Joel gave his little wiggle but he did not move from his tracks . " Go on , Joel , " added Helen . " Go see Miss Craggs . " For answer Joel turned his head and looked up at her eyes . " Is this an order ? " he seemed to be asking and , when Helen assured him that it was , he waddled off in the wake of the maid . Yet , half an hour later , when Helen looked up from her book , there was Joel again at the top of the hill . When Perrier came home his wife related the incident and , as a first guess , Perrier pulled up Joel 's forehead to look at the whites of his eyes . " Oh , he 's not sick , " broke in Helen , quickly . " I thought of that but he 's eaten all his meals . " " Perhaps the chauffeur kicked him or squirted the hose on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered Helen , " not that nice old Garrity . No , " she insisted , " for some reason or other he 's simply ' off Miss Craggs . In some way she must have hurt his feelings . " " Poor Miss Craggs ! " grinned Perrier . " Ca n't she even get on with the dogs ? " For about two days longer the mystery continued , then pne morning Perrier burst into his wife 's dressing room . " I believe I 've got it , " he exclaimed , " ? what 's wrong with Joel ! He 's got a rival . He 's simply jealous ! " Helen looked up with the fixed expression of one who at last hears the truth . " Not another dog ? " " Dog nothing ! " said Perrier . " Another man . I just saw Miss Craggs going by in her car , and on the seat beside her was the foppiest little old gentleman with a very red face and a snow-white mustache . " " George Dallingham Smith ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard that he 's been trying to marry her for thirty years . He is the kind of man who would kick a dog  --  not nastily , I mean , but if the dog tried to jump up on him or lick his spats . " " They ought to go out in a field , " suggested Perrier , " and shoot it out . " " But what a fool ! " laughed Helen . " I mean Joel  --  to go off and sulk . As nearly as I can see , he has made more progress in two months than George Dallingham Smith has made in thirty years . " " Why do n't you go and tell him that ? " suggested Perrier , but his wife gave him a wicked little look . " Is it ever any use , " she asked , " to try to tell anything to anyone who 's jealous ? " Nevertheless , between them they seemed to have arrived at a correct diagnosis as , from then on , the presence or non-presence of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions of Joel . It might very well have been that Joel never actually had tried to jump on George Dallingham 's trousers or lick his spats , but there were plenty of other minds in West Gosset that could state emphatically that no household was ever the same after George Dallingham Smith was once in it . If Miss Annie Craggs represented the chill and cautious side of old Victorian life , George Dallingham Smith represented the sprightly . He was the kind of man who would spring about like a grasshopper all his days and then , at the end of them , would write his memoirs . He was probably the most endless talker that Heaven ever created and he loved to joke at his friends with roars and chuckles . He was the kind of man who was always popping up to rearrange and suggest things and , if the truth were known , he had probably tried to show his appreciation of Joel by poking him with his walking stick or rolling him over by his ears . At any rate , whatever the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's piazza plus George Dallingham . Smith and his hilltop minus that gentleman , he for his part preferred the hilltop . If Joel had only been a little more intimate with George Dallingham Smith 's private affairs he might perhaps have been more tolerant ; for it was distinctly to the old gentleman 's credit that while , for many years , he had been very eager to marry Miss Annie Craggs , it was only recently that it had become at all necessary that he should marry her . It was not George Dallingham 's fault that he had been born with a sociable nature , a love for travel , and very little else , nor was it to his discredit that an income which thirty years before had been regarded as ample , not to say magnificent , had slowly shrunk into very ominous proportions . With his familiar world evaporating all about him , it was only natural that he should cling with greater and greater tenacity to the few friendly firesides which remained , and if he suddenly appeared three times in West Gosset in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been glad to do thirty-five years before when , in his way , he had been quite a dashing beau , and Miss Annie Craggs had been principally known as a gaunt , reserved , and not very popular girl . But all this Joel , naturally , had not quite the vision to see . All that he could grasp was the fact that George Dallingham Smith was a very noisy and trivial person , and that when he was present Miss Craggs 's piazza was gone all to pot . When G. D. was out of town , with the regularity of clockwork , Joelwould go up again and live with Miss Craggs ; when G. D. returned Joel would go back to his hilltop and , with that uncanny instinct which is one of the most mysterious facts of dog nature , he never mixed his dates . The Perriers , for their part , scarcely knew with which one to side , for while Joel 's point of view was obvious , yet , as the summer wore on , they found themselves falling into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craggs , George Dallingham could not spend a week in a given neighborhood without becoming on intimate terms with its principal families . He formed the habit of dropping in at all hours of the day and , seen thus at a closer view , his friendly , guileless little ways became most disarming . Underneath his pomposities and his affectations he really had a very kindly , simple nature and , as the tragedy of his situation became more apparent , the Perriers began to root openly for his suit . It was , in fact , this sociability of George Dallingham 's that in the end threw Joel completely of his stride and precipitated the climax . One afternoon , while Joel was napping lazily on his hilltop , Miss Annie 's open car came out of her driveway and down the road with two figures plainly visible , the chauffeur at the wheel and beside him George Dallingham Smith . Now , if there is one thing that a modern dog learns sooner than anything else , it is to distinguish the sound of a familiar car from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with interest . Then , seeing who occupied the front seat , the light in his eyes grew suddenly dull . Slowly turning his head , he watched the car until it had passed a , turn in the road and then he sank down again to his meditations . It is not actually on record that he said , " You little squirt ! " but it might just as well have been . Half an hour later the same familiar hum came back up the highway , and again Joel roused himself at the sound . This time , however , he did not merely remain in a sitting position but , with a glad , incredulous bound , he rose to his feet . " Can this really be true ? " he seemed to ask himself , for now the car contained but a single figure , that of old Garrity , the chauffeur . Previously this had meant only one thing and , still not believing his good luck , Joel watched the car in every inch of its progress , his ears drinking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up Miss Annie 's steep drive , and passed around the other side of her house . When finally he heard a rumbling crunch as the garage doors rolled shut , it seemed completely conclusive . With a leap that was almost kittenish , Joel galloped up the road . But George Dalling , ham Smith had not left town . He had merely gone to the railroad station to send a telegram , a telegram so exultant and so personal that he had sent it in French . Then , overcome by the splendor of the day and his own private happihes.s , he had been seized with the idea of walking home and , almost bursting with a boyish eagerness to confide in someone , he stopped in to chat with his new friends , the Perriers . One look at his face told Helen the whole story . The merest hint on her part caused the honest old gentleman to babble forth the great news and Perrier rushed to the house for champagne . The Paysons dropped in before it was properly iced and , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the afternoon was a thing that called for explanations , they also were shortly in possession of the truth . One good bottle called for another ; George Dallingham Smith was presently elected a member in full standing of the ancient and honorable community of West Gosset ; and even when , standing up with his glass in his hand , he made a speech beginning , " My dear , good friends . . . " and recited forty lines from " Lucille , " everybody cheered . Only when the party began to break up did Helen glance a little anxiously at theguest of honor and suggest tactfully to her husband : " August , you have n't had a hit of exercise all day . Why do n't you stroll up the road with Mr. Smith ? " The lift of her eyebrow was not lost on Perrier , and most genially he agreed ; but Helen 's precautions had been entirely unnecessary , for the two men had not walked a dozen steps when Perrier saw that George DaHingham 's flush and a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not to Sillery 1914 . At Miss Annie 's gate the younger man was quite ready to turn hack , but the blissful Romeo would not hear of this for an instant . " Oh , come on , come on , my dear boy , come up to the house , " he insisted , the note of the proprietor already in his voice . " My blessed Annie will be delighted to see you . I told her I was going to tell the whole universe and you must say a word . " Linking his arm boisterously into Perrier 's , he led the way up the path , then , suddenly overcome with natural confusion , he began to hesitate . On the piazza sat Miss Annie Craggs in her favorite straight-backed wicker chair and at her feet was Joel . " My dear ? " began George Da/lingham Smith , but at that moment Joel looked up . Before him he saw the human being he most despised on earth ? and not only that , but arm-in-arm with a man whom , up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust . " If it had only been any other dog , " as Perrier said afterwards , " you might have known what to expect . Old Titus , for instance , would have leaped at his throat and Charley . . . well , Charley would have ordered another bottle of champagne . " But this was not Titus , the crusty setter , nor was it Charley , the prince of mongrels and friend of the world . It was only Joel , the hermit shepherd , and , without a look , without a turn of his head . Joel rose to his feet and walked slowly away . Not many times in his life had Joel been called upon to ex-press emotion , but he was certainly a master of sheer , cold contempt . Half an hour later Perrier himself followed and at his own gate he found his wife waiting . She asked but a single word : " Well . . . ? " Perrier laughed in a confused , unsettled sort of fashion . " From somewhere out of a pious youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sermon I once heard on The Prodigal Son . And amidst all the feasting and rejoicing there was one who had no gladness in his heart , who did not approve of the festivities and had no intention of taking part . ' And you know , " concluded Perrier , " it has always been the elder brother for whom I myself have had a sneaking sympathy . " " You have the gift of tongues , " replied Helen , " but you still leave me hazy . " " It was Joel , " explained Perrier . " He was there on the piazza when we arrived , and you ought to have seen his expression . He looked , he sniffed , and he folded his tents . Honestly , I thought he was going to hand me back his collar and license . " " Oh , the poor darling ! " exclaimed Helen . " Where is he ? We must find him at once . " Rapidly she led the way around the house and , of course , there was Joel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his nose toward Miss Craggs 's house and the setting sun . As Helen came up the slope he turned one lusterless eye and gave his tail one thump in the dust , but , with a manner she had never yet used to this queer gallumux , Helen lifted his head and held it in her lap . " Poor Joel ! " she said , " I know how you feel . But do n't mind , old man . At any rate , we love you and you still have us . " " By Jove ! " exclaimed Perrier , looking down at them , " You know , I do n't believe that we really could have given him up . " Gently parting the big , woolly ears , Helen leaned over and kissed the flat , chinchilla spot on the top of Joel 's head . " There now , " she said , as she rose to her feet , " perhaps you 'd like to be left alone . " " At a time like this , " agreed Perrier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly want to chatter . " He slipped his arm through his wife 's and they started down the hill , but , when they were a dozen steps away , again Joel lifted his head and looked thoughtfully after them . Then , probably , he did the strangest thing that he had yet done in his life . Slowly he rose to his feet and followed them  --  straight into the house .
