THIRD ACT IN VENICE-Sylvia Thompson-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> Great novelists live with their characters ; lesser ones pay calls . Not a great novelist but a good one , Sylvia Thompson is an adept at taking her leave , never embarrasses her characters or her readers by staying with them too long at a stretch . Third Act in Venice , her latest ( and ninth ) novel , is a brilliant exhibition of her episodic power , her knowledge of how to be absolutely tactful though relatively true . <P> If Author Thompson had lingered long with any of the people in Third Act in Venice , readers might have found some ordinary , others downright unlikable. might have decided their story was a highly colored mess . Thanks to Author Thompson 's restless skill , however , it emerges from dubious beginnings into tragic romance , a moral tale to melt a worldling .

Unfortunately for herself , Adria fell in love with him . <P> Francis did what he could in a situation that frightened him . Summoning up all his gentleman 's blood , he kicked out the manicurist . Terrified but hopeful , he allowed himself to become engaged to Adria .

He continued to think of her as sacred , his manicurist as profane . When the manicurist , a determined creature , followed him to Venice , the rest was easy . Though Francis never knew for certain how it happened that Adria took an overdose of sleeping-powder , he felt the responsibility was his . Too late he knew that he had profaned Adria 's love by his vulgar idea of what was sacred .
