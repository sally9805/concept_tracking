txt The House approved by a viva voce vote today the resolution providing for a broad investigation of all phases of army procurement and the leasing of government buildings . It will apply particularly to airplane purchases during the last eight years . Representative , chair-man of the Military Affairs Committee , promised the House that the cost of the investigation would not be more than $10,000 and probably would be " much less . " He said the committee would utilize Department of Justice agents and officials of the inspector general 's office , and will have records from the office of the Controller General , thus holding down costs . For the first time today since a District of Columbia grand jury began investigation of alleged irregular practices in procurement of War Department materials the name of Harry H. Woodring , Assistant Secretary of War in charge of procurement , was brought before the House . In a plea for approval of the proposed inquiry Representative MeGugin of Kansas told the House that the people of his State as well as all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be pointing at this great Kansan " when the inquiry is concluded . Mr. Woodring is a former Governor of Kansas . Air-Mall Row Is Revived . No one in the House who discuss &; the resolution for investigation opposed its passage . But late in the day the air-mail squabble broke loose in partisan debate for the second time within a week . Charges of inadequate and unsafe flying equipment which resulted in disaster to army pilots engaged on mail runs were answered by Representative Mead of New York , chairman of the Postoffice and Post Roads Committee . Mr. Mead said he and all the army fliers he knew were " sick and tired of the ballyhoo and sob stuff " being circulated . Last Monday night , he added , not one commercial plane would have left the ground had they still been carrying the mails . " But when the chief of the air corps Instructed the army men to turn back in case of bad and dangerous weather , not a single one turned around , " Mr. Mead declared . " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of any danger . I say there is enough of this sob stuff ! " Mead Rebuffs Fish . Representative Fish of New York , who has taken a leading part in charging the administration with " legalized murder " in ordering the army to fly the mail , asked Mr. Mead to yield for a question . " No , I wo n't , " Mr. Mead . replied . " I have heard ten speeches made by you and I want to answer them . " As his anger rose Mr. Mead thundered his defense of the army across to the Republican side of the House . He said ' that the open military plane was the safest in the world for carrying the mails . " Stop talking about it if you do n't know what you are talking about ! " he declared , and the Democrats in the chamber applauded . Asserting that army . equipment was 100 per cent good , he con-tinued : " The record of the army when they first carried the mails is superior to the commercial lines . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who wish to discredit the army fliers . " If this sort of stuff continues I will stand out against returning the mail service to private companies until the army pilots , your army and my army , are given a thorough chance to demonstrate their ability . They must be vindicated and I will see they have the chance . " Representative Hill of Alabama said the investigation was not the result of collusion and fraud alone , but more because " the laws and intent of Congress have not been carried out . " He also charged the Republicans with obscuring the real issue of alleged corruption in the obtaining of air-mail contracts by circulating charges of " legalized murder . " Text of Resolution .
