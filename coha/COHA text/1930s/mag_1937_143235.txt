Commander-in-Chief of the U. S. Navy is Franklin D. Roosevelt but Commander-in-Chief of the U. S. Fleet , topranking sailor afloat , must be a truly professional seadog . Last week Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson recommended to Commander-in-Chief Roosevelt for approval before Feb. 1 a batch of Navy shifts and promotions , most important of which will give the Navy a new CINCUS . To replace 60-year-old Admiral Arthur Japy Hepburn , scheduled for commandant of the 12th Naval District with headquarters in San Francisco , Secretary Swanson named the present Commander of the Battle Force , 59-year-old Admiral Claude Charles Bloch . <P> CINCUS-designate Bloch , born to Czechoslovakian immigrant parents in Woodbury , Ky. , is a sombre tight-lipped officer who has been cited for meritorious service in two wars , for rescuing Spaniards from Admiral Cervera 's burning squadron off Santiago in 1898 and for commanding the naval transport Plattsburg 20 years later . Gobs who wondered whether CINCUS Bloch would be as stern a disciplinarian as CINCUS Hepburn were last week enlightened by his sister , Mrs. Stella Bloch of Bowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generous to a fault but always ready to fight when teased .
