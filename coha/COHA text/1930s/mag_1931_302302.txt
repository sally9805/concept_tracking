Lo ! - Charles Fort-Kendall ( $2.50 ) . <P> Why does it rain frogs ? <P> " do statues bleed ? " <P> do eels appear in landlocked water ? <P> Quite as arresting as such phenomena is phenomenal Charles Fort , who puts such questions with an accusing grin at Science . He is a world 's champion professional anti-scientist . For 23 years he has grubbed in museums and libraries for records of occurrences which scientists can explain ( thinks Fort ) only by ridiculous hypotheses or denial that the occurrences occurred . <P> Science , says Fort , makes insanely ambiguous pronouncements . Predicting the 1925 total eclipse of the sun , astronomers were four seconds and three-quarters of a mile off . Scientists have not decided ( thinks Fort ) whether stars are rushing away from or toward the earth ; have failed to note any connection between the discovery of a new star and volcanic activity on the earth . Fort regards Einstein as a mistaken but useful revolutionist : " a Girondist of the Scientific Revolution . . . who has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been worshipfully regarded as the Most High . " <P> Wishful of drawing no conclusions himself . Fort constantly trembles on the verge of dark sayings . When he can not contain himself , instead of putting the suggestion in his own mouth he says : " The expression is . . . . " The expression is , then , that a hitherto unnoticed swan was discovered in Manhattan 's Central Park near the place and time Dorothy Arnold ( famed lost girl ) disappeared ; that the stars , in stead of being inconceivably far away and wandering individually are probably within rocket-shot and set in a revolving shell ( Ptolemaic astronomy ; . Says Fort : ' ' Of course the stars are near . Who , but a few old fossils , ever thought otherwise ? . . . All these notions . . . were matters of common knowledge , away back in the times of ancient Greece . " Fort thinks that the earth is practically stationary , that it is an organism , and that scientifically unexplained phenomena like rain from a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflex actions . <P> The Significance . That such a convinced prophet of footless negation can find a publisher , even in Manhattan , may be a sign that the U. S. , like Pauline Athens , has an altar ready for the Unknown God . Or it may merely indicate that Anything Goes . But most curious is the fact that Fort has a following of some note , who have formed a Fortean Society to praise his name . Publisher Kendall 's jacket blurb is enthusiastically contributed to by Authors Theodore Dreiser , Booth Tarkington , Harry Elmer Barnes , John Cowper Powys , Ben Hecht ( who announced himself " the first disciple of Charles Fort " ) . Manhattan 's conservative Herald Tribune is quoted as calling Fort " that amazing genius . "
