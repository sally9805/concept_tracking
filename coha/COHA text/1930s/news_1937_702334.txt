txt A railway robber turned lawyer failed in defense of himself here today when an all-woman jury , the first to sit in Federal court , turned its collective thumb down on his tearful appeal for freedom . The amateur attorney was Peter Guarino , 38-year-old convict and exroadhouse operator , who was found guilty of being a principal in the $958 robbery of an Erie train in the Walnut Street Station , Nutley , on Good Friday , April 17 . Guarino , who is dark , forceful and able to talk dramatically when he wants to , was himself responsible for the absence of men in the jury box . Last Friday he challenged four prospects of his own sex , and contrived to have women selected even as to two alternates , who did not get anything to do . Mother and Wife Sob The defendant had put on a fiery show in his own behalf , letting his voice sink at times , then gathering momentum and bursting out in unexpected crescendoes . His mother and wife were there , and they sobbed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of experience at the bar drew a reminder from Judge Guy L. Fake to the effect that since he had not put himself upon the stand he had to base his argument on facts brought out in the testimony . The defendant , who had begun to narrate how on the day of the hold-up he had visited a pawnshop in downtown Newark , thus suffered . a slight setback in his style but continued undiscouraged . He had gone voluntarily to Newark headquarters when he heard he was ' wanted , he declared . He attacked the identification of himself by four government witnesses and referred to the statement of Dr. Rocco.J . Caruso , who had attended Guarino 's dying father on April 17 . " I am accused of committing a robbery as my father lay dying , " he went on , looking intently at the dozen jurors , whom he repeatedly addressed as " Ladies of the Jury . " " Would I not have wanted to be at his funeral ? Would I take a chance of not being able to be there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Rose Guarino , who ? had apparently suffered considerably over her son 's derelictions in the past . " My mother , " he said , pointing to her , ? my mother never in any court testified for me before . If she thought I was guilty she would never on God 's earth have taken the stand . " He was sure he would have no chance with a " narrow-minded " jury , he said . " But I have a real broad-minded jury , " he went on . " All I ask for is justice . I am innocent as God Is my judge . " " Now in the Balance " Guarino let his voice fall again , and announced that " I am now in the balance . " " If you ladies open your hands , " he went on , " I am lost . If you close your hands , I may be saved . Ladies , my whole fate is in your hands . " It was the final moment . Guarino 's head drooped and tears welled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buried his head in his hands and wept . His shoulders heaved ... as he sobbed , and the members of his family began to cry all over again . Hyman Halpern , the counsel as- ? signed , who had coached Guarino , was not allowed to add to the sum- ming up . For the prosecution Hubert J. Harrington , Assistant District Attorney , warned the jury not to be swayed by sympathy . " That is the entire basis of the case , " he added . William B. Reilly , deputy court clerk , waited to ask the decisive question when the jurors returned at 4:15 , thirty-two minutes after they had filed out . " Have you reached a verdict ? " he demanded , tonelessly . " We have , " replied Mrs. Nettie A. Tallman of Union Township , the foreman . " What is that verdict ? " pursued the clerk . " We find the defendant guilty as charged , " said Mrs. Tallman crisply . Mr. Halpern demanded a poll , and each juror , promptly and not the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the jury said they had found the experience " extremely interesting . " Guarino stared , tightened his lips and allowed ' his features to form a half grin , . half sneer . Already under a twelve-year sentence to State prison for A hold-up in Carlstadt last January , he is now liable to 6 , , maximum punishment of thirty years in prison and $15,000. fine . He will be sentenced tomorrow .
