It may have been merely a cloud passing across the sun . But more than one observer noted last week that a cool wind was blowing and a shadow had fallen on the President 's popularity-his popularity not with the public but with that circle of a few thousand men who constitute official Washington . To the people who voted for him last November , Franklin Roosevelt was Mr. Right , but to official Washington he has been , even more , Mr. Big . They might occasionally grumble at his tactics , but they had much the same practical faith and trust in Roosevelt the victor of 1932 , 1934 , 1936 that the officers of the Grand Army had in Napoleon the victor of Marengo , Austerlitz , Jena . <P> No particular incident last week caused discontent in the officers ' mess . Among Congressmen the growing suspicion that before summer 's end they would be called upon to vote more taxes was disquieting . Senator Pat Harrison and Representative Bob Doughton , the Administration 's Congressional tax champions , were in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the President 's Congressional followers had any real enthusiasm for the Supreme Court proposal which he had tossed to them to carry out . On that issue a whole division of Democratic Senators were kicking in the traces : Connally of Texas , Clark of Missouri , Bailey of North Carolina , Van Nuys of Indiana , not to mention old revolters such as Glass . Burke and Wheeler . And finally , on the other great issue of the day , the Sit-Down , they were irritated by his bland refusal to take any stand whatever . The President 's great &; good friend James F. Byrnes of South Carolina was responsible for the revolt in the Senate against his inaction , and not a Democratic Senator voted against his anti-Sit-Down resolution last fortnight . Where there was this kind of public smoke , issuing even from Administration leaders , there was no lack of private fire , its flames still hidden but its sparks feeding inwardly on a spirit of dissatisfaction and antagonism . Franklin Roosevelt may have sensed this the evening he attended the spring Gridiron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was caricatured as Don Quixote exclaiming to Sancho Panza Garner : " Seest thou not yon fortress of privilege , yon castle of finance ? " ( " Them 's windmills . Boss . " said Sancho . ) Next he was Pharaoh , telling ' ' Little Joseph " Wallace : " I had a dream last night . There were seven nice fat budgets all printed in black ink and along came seven scrawny budgets all printed in red ! ! ! " <P> Final thrust was a Supreme Court scene , with 15 Justices resembling Caspar Milquetoast chorusing <P> So if we 're pressed to state our view , <P> We 'll hold our noses and say to you , <P> " It 's deliberate , it 's deceptive , <P> " It 's deplorable , it 's delirious , <P> " It 's de novo , it 's de limit , <P> " It 's de bunk , it 's de-lousy ! " <P> The show reached its grand finale with the Justices rubber-stamping decisions and tossing them toward the President in time to the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Put on your coat and hat , <P> We do a job like that When we 're working for you . . . . <P> Nine , ten , stamp ' em again . <P> Gee , but we get a thrill ,
