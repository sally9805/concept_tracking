Of the 1,068 pages in the new Sears , Roebuck catalogue , only four advertise books . But Sears , Roebuck is a big factor in one branch of the book business . Since 1920 it has owned a controlling interest in the Encyclopdia Britannica ( total sales-1,000,000 sets ) . First published in Scotland in 1768 , the Britannica came under U. S. ownership 35 years ago , barely squeezed through its 12th , 13th and 14th editions , was often rescued by the late Julius Rosenwald when he headed Sears , Roebuck . For its 14th edition , it needed $2,500,000 to keep going . This month veteran Editor Franklin Henry Hooper resigns after 40 years with the Britannica , turning over the reins to aggressive Walter Yust , associate editor and ex-newspaperman . Now moving from its Manhattan offices to luxurious new quarters in Chicago 's Civic Opera Building , the staff is working on the encyclopdia 's new yearbook of 1,000 articles , scheduled for publication this month .                @ @ @ @ @
