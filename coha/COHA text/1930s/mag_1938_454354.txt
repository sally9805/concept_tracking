READING these articles has given me quite a turn . We have been married for the last eight and one-half years , and in life , as in her style of writing , Elsa is a sweet , unsophisticated , and even na ? ve person ; but suddenly , through an apparently chance but invariably carefullyworked-out remark which has probably taken weeks of thought , you feel somewhat as if you had been kicked by the hind leg of a giraffe . As I read through these articles , I said to myself , ' Dear Elsa ; bless her heart ; the little pet ' ; and suddenly I came across a lino which made my bones rattle inside their covering of fat . Mind you , in her relationship to me these blows would always be salutary and invariably thought out for my own good ? like castor oil in childhood . But the little brute does enjoy summing up relationships and situations in one shattering line . To keep her friendship you certainly have to be able to ' take it ' ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a friend . For the sake of my personal comfort I should have liked to blue-pencil a very great deal of these articles , but actually the only thing that disappeared was an elaborate exposition of her point of view on strip-tease , and this went only because it was dead news anyhow . To have edited these articles would only have given a false impression of her point of view of me , and it would have been a beastly shame considering all the cigarettes she has smoked and all the pencils she has bitten through . This is the nicest husband-and-wife story I know . I was cast in On the Spot , Edgar Wallace 's play , in which I had to wear smart clothes and go around the stage kissing the women . I came home one night in a state of despair , sullen and nasty , and said to Elsa : ' I know they wo n't stand for this . I have got a face like an elephant 's behind , and in this play I have got to do the big sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverbial tiger cat and whipped out : ' How dare you presume you are unattractive ! Hold your shoulders back , keep your head up and smile , so that I can hold my head up with other women . ' Can you beat that ? I owe her plenty . ? C. L. I HAD never met Charles before we played together in Arnold Bennett 's Mr. Prohack , though he had seen me many timaa before on the stage . I was introduced to him at the first rehearsal . The romantic aspect of our association was not , perhaps , immediately apparent . In Mr. Prohack I always looked upon Charles as a great actor ? automatically . I did not say , ' Is n't he wonderful ? ' I know , automatically , that he had this talent as well as I knew my own foot . If I had been full of a sort of respectful awe we should not have had any relationship at all . You know , in the theatre we tell each other the latest risqu6 stories ; one can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I never exchanged such stories with Charles , which may or may not have meant anything ? I do n't know . He may have exchanged them with other people , as I probably did . I remember we remarked about it afterwards ? that we did not do that . I do n't know why . It may have been my reticence with a man I admired . I should say we became engaged just before Charles went into The Man with Red Hair in 1928 , and Alibi . That ran a year . Then he did Mr. Pickwick at the Haymarket . We got married after that , and for our honeymoon went to Switzerland ? to Arosa ? in February . Our visit was in time for the winter sports . Charles had been before and was good on skis . I had never skied , but as I was a dancer everybody told me , ' You will do it in a minute ; it 's very simple , you know . You have the right balance and everything . ' So I traipsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles . People said , ' The skis are six feet long and the snow is very soft . If you fall you can not hurt yourself . You just fall . Put your arms out and drop in the snow . ' Actually I went down like a daddy longlegs , and , being double-jointed , I completely collapsed . When I fell I let myself go , and if you collapse sideways one ski cuts you right in the middle . That is what happened . I wont down heavily and also got one of the ski sticks right in my mouth and had to extract it like a tooth ! Altogether it was a very , very bad show . From Arosa we went on to Italy , and visited Naples . I was wildly excited about Vesuvius , but Charles was scared to death by it . Charles hates elemental displays of any sort , whereas if I could see a hailstone as big as a football I should be enchanted by it . I love thunderstorms , rough seas , volcanoes . Charles loathes them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Women are supposed to like sweets and men not , but it is absolutely the other way round . Women hate sweets , and men absolutely wallow in coconut cakes and horrible things like that . That 's true of Charles as well as of other men . The same applies to all those theories as to what women like and do not like ? I have never found them true . I think the dislike of rough seas , thunderstorms , and so on is hereditary . Charles 's mother is afraid of thunder . If a child is brought up to see people hide under blankets when a storm is on , the child naturally thinks it is dangerous . I was brought up to stand at the window and watch lightning , but not to hold a pair of scissors in my hand at the same time . That 's all . Vesuvius was in an average state when we were there ? which means the whole centre of the earth seems to rumble under your feet , then about every four minutes there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all red . Afterwards an enormous cauliflower of yellow smoke comes out , which becomes white as it goes into the sky . We both went up Vesuvius . I wanted to stay and watch , but Charles was not only frightened but worried by it . It disturbed his inside . One goes up with twenty or thirty people , and I noticed that a lot took one look and walked straight back to the funicular railway . That sort of thing does upset some people . It feels as if the rumbling were in your inside . Being the centre of the earth , it has some sort of direct action on one . I felt it myself , as well as Charles , but I liked it . Our best acting relationship was in The Tempest , when Charles was Prospero and I was Ariel , which worked very well as a stage relationship . I do not know why it is , but few people can stand up against Charles on the stage . I do not think I have attracted attention because I am married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against his acting . As a matter of fact , that point became very apparent in Rembrandt . We understand each other so well , being married , that we can do better teamwork do the stage or films . In an acting relationship like that in Rembrandt it is a hard thing to look at each other in that natural way for the camera that one has learned to do through living with a person for several years . It is rather shocking to have to do that in a show , but it works if you can . You do n't have to remember how you look at a person you live with . You just have to be yourself , but when you get home you feel as if you had given yourself away , and that your private life has been exposed . It is rather like going to bed in a shop window . It is dangerous for one 's real relationship . I have never felt that quite so strongly as in Rembrandt . Then there was Henry the Eighth , when I played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had with him was picked out as the best in the picture . It is true , we rehearse between ourselves a lot , but something happens when you know the person and his speed of talking and all his little habits . If you put your hand on the hand of that person you do n't feel you have got to act a reaction . There is a ' natural naturalness ' which we are not unconscious of when we are acting together . In Henry the Eighth , that scene with Henry 's dislike of Anne of Cloves also affected our real behavior . He really thought I was Anne of Cloves , and I thought he was somebody whom by various wiles I must try to avoid . When Charles was in The Barrette of Wimpole Street ? I did not play in that ? he would come home occasionally a little like the domineering father . When he revealed any tendency in the home to be like Mr. Barrett , I said , Ah-ah , ' and tried to show him that he was still acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage home like a dog bringing a bone into the house . II To give a true picture of Charles 's future I feel I ought to hark back a little to his past . In school he was not brilliant at any subject except mathematics . He hated games , which always gives a boy an uncomfortable time at school . He did not then know what he wanted to do , but at any rate ho acquired a capacity for concentrating on and carrying out any object he had in mind . I think he must have inherited this quality from his mother , who has the same determination and organizing ability . When she married Charles 's father they bought a small hotel , and it was her overwhelming determination that built up the Pavilion Hotel , Scarborough , the forerunner of the three hotels now carried on in Scarborough by Charles 's mother and his two brothers . The three boys were brought op in a hotel , which of course is not exactly a home . They had no permanent nursery , and were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or winter season . A hotel certainly does not provide an atmosphere conducive to inviting one 's friends to tea , and for this reason all three brothers now find the usual approaches to friendship a little difficult , Even now I have to apply friends to Charles like a poultice , but then they stick like clams ? he gradually takes them to him and they become permanent friends . In trying to tell you about Charles 's childhood I have been asking him for more detailed recollections that might show when ho first wanted to be an actor or thought of the stage . He said : I remember I was abnormally interested in pierrot troupes which I saw on the sands at Scarborough at a very early age when I was not allowed to go to the theatre . I , of course , always had to disappear when the velvet bag was handed round , as I had nothing to put in it . ' I remember some time later I even took great pains to build a model theatre . My brother , in a rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had made . But then I had a cousin who was even more given to theatricals than I was and he is now a partner in a steelworks in Sheffield ? so what ? ' Once when I was very small I was walking with my mother across the fashionable Spa Bridge in Scarborough , and I saw what I thought was a very lovely lady indeed . Probably I picked her out because she was a little more highly colored than the other lovely ladies . I asked my mother , " Who is the pretty lady ? " and she replied , " Hush , dear ! That 's a theatrical . " ' Later on my mother , to my great shame , sometimes used to introduce me as " My eldest son . He 's artistic . " ' At school I won some sort of prize for mathematics ? Heaven help me ! ? and I chose for my prize an edition of Shakespeare bound in tree calf . I thought to myself : One day this will become the most famous edition of Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was about twelve and I really honestly thought this . ' Charles 's family did not take kindly to the idea of his becoming an actor when he finally decided upon it . It was decreed instead that ho was to learn the hotel business from the bottom up , and , as he had no definite cause to object at that time , he allowed himself to be sent to Claridge 's . Besides , London was the big city with the big theatres . This was early in 1916 , lie had just left school , and he was then just sixteen . ' I was sent to Claridge 's in London , ' Charles says , ' and was in turn bill clerk , control clerk , ' and cashier 's clerk . I was paid ten shillings a week and my keep , and later on , I think , twelve and sixpence a week . It was when I was at Claridge 's that I got really hopelessly bitten by the stage . I spent every penny I made on the galleries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chow thirteen times , A Kiss for Cinderella about ten times , Razzle Dazzle , the revue at the Drury Lane , eight or nine times , and I became a rabid fan of both Sir Gerald Du Maurier and Miss Hilda Trovelyan , who appeared in A Kiss for Cinderella . If anybody had slurred their names in any way I would have fought him to the death . ' When I was at Claridge 's I naturally got to know a lot of the staff , a very large percentage of whom are still there to-day . One of the pleasantest things in my life is , if I go into Claridge 's restaurant , the way my old friends look after me . They pretend they do n't know me , but like to show inc off to any important people I may be dining with by taking special care of me . They have been known to whisper to me when taking my chair from me : " These are n't your kind of people , Charlie , are they ? " " No , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military age until the last year of the war , but nevertheless he saw a good deal of it . He got sent straight to the front and was badly gassed just before the Armistice . He had been at a public school and could have got a commission , but he said : ' Something told me I might not be the kind of fellow to take command of men under fire , and so I stubbornly stood out against having a commission and was conscripted into the ranks . Being a " softie " at the moment , I was naturally extremely frightened of what I was about to experience . However , it did not take me very long to learn to fight and to do what I was told . Sometimes it is a good thing for young people to have a complete change of environment at an impressionable age . The war was more of an upheaval than a change . One experience , which I would rather not talk about , took away my sleep intermittently for two years afterwards , though , looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on mo . ' III When he was demobilized , Charles went back to Scarborough and started work in the family hotel . He was good at the policy of the hotel , but apparently bad at looking after the detail . This job took up all his working hours , but ho turned to amateur theatricals as a recreation . At this time it could only be called a hobby . Charles loves to talk about these amateur days . ' I was asked to join a company of amateurs called the " Scarborough Players . " We did Trelawney of the Wells , and I played the part of Sir William Gower . I must have been exceedingly bad . We then did Hobson 's Choice , which was a real box-office success . You know the usual signs : opening without any ballyhoo , empty for the first day or so , and then the word going round that it is a good show and nobody being able to get a seat at the end of the run . That is real success : opening without ballyhoo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four one-act plays . We had a lot of fun in those amateur days , and we worked with a very great deal of enthusiasm . It must have been an unhappy experience for my parents to watch all my energies going into " theatricals " instead of being concentrated on the family business . ' This being the case , it became clearer and clearer that there was nothing for it but for Charles to go on the stage . He must have known it for many months before he decided to drop this bombshell on the family . In Charles 's case it was an enormous decision to make , for if ho had failed they certainly would have been within their rights in saying , ' What did we tell you ? ' for after all there were a life career and security waiting for him in the hotel business . On the face of it , he had nothing which might convince them that the stage held any opportunitise for him . Ho was not good-looking , lie could n't sing , he could n't dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice as yet , and he did n't look like an actor ? although I might add he actually has a typical ' actor 's mask . ' ( It is all very well to discover this after the event ! ) The shock must have been doubly great to the family , since he had not shown any visible signs of courage , but there is one thing that Charles has always had , and that is courage enough to gamble with his career . He will not gamble with anything else , ? money , friendship , or health , ? but every twist and turn in his career has been a daring choice of ways . Talking about this critical time , he said to me : ' What broke the ice was my brother coming home one day ( he was learning farming and auctioneering ) and complaining to me about my being the eldest son , and having the business . I told him that he could have the business as far as I was concerned , as I wanted to go on the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was a little doubtful . However , they made me an allowance , and I was allowed to go to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , where thinking about acting ceased to be a crime and became a cardinal virtue . ' Charles carried off the Gold Medal from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to where he was living ? a small bedroom in Long Acre ; and after the first job at the Barnes Theatre he started the search for work . It was not a hopeless search , since lie was often offered similar parts to the one in The Government Insvector at a comparatively largo salary , but he said to himself , ' I wo n't be typed ' ? which meant that he had to wait two or three months to get a different kind of part at less money . This happened time and time again . Heaven knows , he has reaped the benefit of it since . It meant an enormous amount of heartbreak to make a success in one part at three pounds a week and be offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' No , I would rather wait . ' Eventually ho got the part of Ficsur in Liliom , at the Duke of York 's Theatre , in December 1918 , with Ivor Novelle and Pay Compton . He made a great success in this part , and I think it was at this time that I first heard his name . I heard it off and on until I met him , and have a faint recollection that the name ' Charles Laughton ' belonged to a fat man who was going to be ' somebody . ' I was in a play at the Everyman Theatre called The Pool and we made every effort to get him for the part of my lover , but failed . After Lilimn he played General Mark-doff in The Greater Love with Sybil Thorn-dike and Basil Gill . I asked him what he felt like when playing with these famous names , and he said ' It was a great experience acting with such people as Sybil Thorndike , Fay Compton , and Basil Gill . I used to watch them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how they got their effects ? they always seemed to be so sure . I do n't know now any more than I did then . ' He next appeared as Mr. Pratt in The Happy Husband , and as Count Palilen in Paul the First in 1927 . Paul the First was one of the plays produced by Komisarjovsky in a season at the Court Theatre , so , while playing Count Pahlon in this play at night , he was rehearsing for Mr. Prohack during the day . The rehearsals were exciting and enjoyable , for it was an exceedingly good cast and we all were very happy in our work . Charles played the lead and I played his secretary , Mimi Winstock . It was n't a very large part , but I drew the same salary as Charles such were our relative positions at that time . Many people who have acted with Charles have stated that he is difficult to act with , as he has never developed any recognized stage technique . It is for this reason that perhaps one could call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and says ho is afraid he will remain so . Yet there is no one who is easier to work with , and no one who personally has taught me more about acting . Charles continued his stage career , but his health at this time was not good . He was in The Silver Tassie and one or two plays that did not run so well . His voice became very bad , and all the critics said , ' How long is this chap 's voice going to last ? ' He used to be constantly troubledby sore throats . For a whole year his voice grew steadily worse , and ho became worried about his career . It was like beating a dead horse to try to speak . The voice is a nervous thing . What with first-night nerves and bad throats , the future looked anything but rosy . It became exceedingly worrying . Charles used to have a dreadfully husky voice in all his early successes , a completely different voice from that of to-day . At first the press were kind . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurtful . They then lapsed into tolerance ? ' Oh , well , he 's a wonderful actor . It 's too bad about his voice . ' Finally Charles decided to go and have his tonsils out . It is clear that if he had not had that operation things might have been different . It was unpleasant during that period , because it was the only obstacle to fame that stood in his way . To a person who has clear-cut ideas as to what he wants to do and how to do it , such a trouble was nerve-racking . We went to Italy after the operation and when we came back Charles had a year 's run in On the Spot , a play specially written for him by Edgar Wallace . It is interesting how this play came to be written . Edgar Wallace sent for Charles one day , and so off he went to his flat in Portland Place . Edgar stalked round the room telling Charles a possible story about something like the Dilsseldorf murders taking place in St. John 's Wood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Charles , but he must have had a lacklustre look in his eye , for Charles did not catch any enthusiasm from him . I believe it must have been a copy of Time that was lying on Edgar Wallace 's desk , and it was open at a page which showed a photo of a most villainous-looking man , with a black bang of hair over his forehead and black bloodshot eyes . Charles asked who he was , and Edgar began describing the bloodthirsty horrors of this man 's life ? his cold-blooded shootings , his many mistresses , and the floral funerals he gave to people he bumped off . Charles said , ' Why not write a play about him ? ' Edgar said , ' Too vicious . ' Charles said , ' Notoriously box-office . ' Edgar said , Hm .. and Charles began to detect a gleam in his eye . Charles said , ' He would have a purple carpet and a golden organ . ' Edgar said , ' He would get rid of the bodies in the sofa . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sparks . Charles came home pale and tired , and said , ' I believe Edgar is going to write the play of his career . ' On the Spot was written in two days . The script was hardly changed during rehearsals . Edgar Wallace must have made a great deal out of the play ? but of course it was only one of his many side lines . After that we acted together at the St. Tames 's Theatre in Payment Deferred , in which I was Charles 's daughter , aged twelve . It was a grim play and rather a strain . It was a really frightening study of a murderer . All I can remember is that it seemed to be raining every day during the production ? there was a sort of thick fog over everything . Life became rather a drizzle outside our home . It was a dreary time because it was such a dreary play . It hit the bottom , you know . When the curtain went down we would have a stiff whiskey to pick us up a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant where there was a band playing . We did that more than we have ever done before or since , to offset the effect of the play . It is a fine play , but too near the bone . In theatres there is always a little peephole through which you can look at the audience . You often see people get their handkerchiefs out , and put their heads down during a play , but in Payment Deferred I saw people throw their heads right up and cry , which is very extraordinary ? there were tears running down their upturned faces . People are usually ashamed of crying in a theatre , and try to hide it . In Payment Deferredthey cried openly . In that , as in all his performances , Charles more or less showed people that it might be themselves they were seeing . Charles tries to portray a character so that everybody in the world can identify himself with it . He wants people to see themselves , to imagine that in certain circumstances the character portrayed might be themselves . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , however slightly , it is a very important asset . I think Charles 's work is essentially an effort to show different men in an absolutely universal light ; to show Englishmen as the whole world will understand them ? not Englishmen for Englishmen , but Englishmen for Spaniards and Englishmen for Italians , so that they say , Yes , that 's an Englishman . ' I think that is why all Charles 's performances seem as if they were on a larger canvas than the other performances . When seeing Mutiny on the Bounty people all over the world have been inclined to say ' That 's Captain Bligh ' rather than ' That 's Charles Laughton . ' We went to New York in Payment Deferred . Mr. Gilbert Miller wanted to present Charles in New York , so it was a Gilbert Miller production . The London success was repeated . But the New York success was something now for Charles . Neither of us had ever been there before . Although we did not realize it at the time , this trip to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , er as a film actor . Charles had not thought of being a film actor . He was interested in the cinema , and had done one or two bits in England , but nothing of any consequence . When film offers came in , Charles was offered more money for signing a long contract for stories over which he had no choice than he is now getting for single films , but he would never sign for a long contract or for a story he did not know . With all this going about and being taxed in two countries and so on , we should have liked the money . But Charles has never put that first . He has always tramped the world for stories . After all , if you get paid a hundred pounds a week , and have ten failures , you do not keep on getting a hundred pounds a week . Better to have ten pounds a week for the rest of your life and good work . IV We returned to England , and three days afterward Paramount offered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract ? that is , two films a year for three years , which was not a long contract and not a very big tie . Anyway it was the smallest tie that had been offered him , but also less money . Our friend Benn Levy was on the script . Charles cabled Benn Levy , and asked , ' What 's the story like ? ' Benn advised him to do it . A few quickly exchanged cables , and we had only been in England three days when we left again , this time for Hollywood and The Devil and the Deep . As to Charles 's reaction ? he was not oven happy at that time . It is very disturbing suddenly to be offered a fortune and to keep your head . It was a great strain , and we used to sit around and say , ' Well , after all , we can go on living in a little flat . It wo n't hurt us . ' He was not fighting against a film career ; he wanted to do films , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to kill his possihlo future . Tho executives in New York did not understand him . They had never met anything like that before . I was not present at any of the interviews , but I think they were talking a completely different language . They knew this man had made a success and they wanted to buy him . That was their usual method . I do not think they were annoyed ; rather they were completely puzzled by Charles ; they just had no point of contact . Once in Hollywood , everything was different . Nobody had ever heard of him or his New York success . When we actually arrived there , he just had his contract and a part in The Devil and the Deep . Film hours everybody knows , of course . Charles left the house about six or seven in the morning , and usually returned about half-past seven or eight at night for dinner . I occasionally went and had lunch with him at the Paramount studio , where we first met Josef von Sternberg , whom we both became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in the evening he would be very tired , and wo were just obliged to go to bed . There is one thing in Hollywood : if you do go out to a dinner or party while you are working you hardly ever have to say Good-bye ' to your hostess , and you certainly do n't have to apologize for leaving early . I wish people would get into that habit in England . Of camera experience , and by this I mean a very , very long step from stage technique , ? a giant stride , in fact , ? Charles knew there was a lot to learn , but he was at that time innocent of how much . On the stage you have to enlarge everything a dozen times , so that it will reach the back of the gallery and at the same time not lead the front row of the stalls to think that you are a ham . But on the screen you always have to understate , and bear in mind that you are playing right up against the audience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalls . The public is as near to you in a close-up as your own image in a shaving mirror , so that batting an eyelid is batting an eyelid and you dare not exaggerate by one hair 's breadth . Charles was quick to grasp this difference , but suffered agonies in controlling his gestures , although he found little difficulty in projecting his thoughts through his eyes in a close shot ; for he is , I think , in stage acting , one of the few actors who always feel things emotionally before interpreting them physically . Charles , among other actors for the films , eventually learned which was a good take and which a bad one , because if you truly feel something under the eye of the camera it is as if you had suddenly found a pearl for which you had been searching a very long time . Charles has always liked Hollywood . From the first he loved the sunlight . He , of course , knew that he was a beginner and was very humble . He used to watch Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people say that Gary Cooper is just a good-looking man and acts unconsciously , but the moment Charles saw him he said , ' This man is a terrific actor . ' Gary can flick a cigarette , and the timing is so perfect that you could watch him do it a hundred times and never got quite the way he does it . He likes to pretend he is just a good fellow , but he is really aware of what he is doing , which means he is a conscious actor , not just a consciously good-looking man . Gary Cooper was in The Devil and the Deep , and Tallulah Bankhead also . They used to work at night a lot because it was a submarine picture , with many exteriors , and complete silence was needed . The longest working hours Charlui has ever done were on that picture . There was one twenty-three-hour effort . I was with him then . We got up in the morning at seven , and it was light when we went home the next morning . This was a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on himself , and then sitting in a chair until the water rose up over him ; he had actually to let the water rise up over his face for the close-up camera . It was a wonderful shot , and , since it was rather dangerous , they had an oxygen apparatus and everything necessary in reserve . Charles got so into the mood of this shot that I became scared and started to think he was seriously contemplating suicide , because he always adjusts himself to what he is doing and really feels it . When the water was over his head the camera had to continue to shoot on the water for some time , giving the impression that the body was still underneath . I feared that , not wanting to bob up , he might take some mouthfuls of water . In one ' take ' the fireman thought he was not coining up , but Charles was actually swimming underneath . The fireman plunged in , fully clothed , to rescue him from drowning ! The ten takes that were necessary were all made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing room on wheels in which Charles could change . He had two suits , and as he got one wet , he took it off and they rushed it in and ironed it out again while he put on another . I think he drank quite a lot of whiskey in the intervals to keep out the cold . Of course , when you are working on your nerves and getting cold under water , whiskey does not make you drunk . You know , when you have a fever you can drink alcohol and it does not affect you at all . He drank whiskey and did not get a cold , but he got very morose . I put that down to the suicidal scene in which lie had to play . All the others were feeling grim , too . They said to me , ' Charles is in a pretty bad way , is n't he ? ' We all got into a bad state of nerves . After The Devil and the Deep there was a rest for a week or so . Charles wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time a De Mille picture attracted world-wide attention , and that it is bettor to show your little finger in a box-office picture than to play the lead in a non-box-office one . Although he had made an enormous impression in The Devil and the Deep round the Hollywood studios , it was not yet released , and so it was a good thing to got into a big picture . The Cecil B. De Mille film was his second one for Paramount . It was The Sign of the Cross and Charles took the part of Nero . Charles enjoyed playing this part . He thought Nero 's love of jewels and resplendent garb and all his petty foibles silly and comical . He said of Nero : ' If you actually saw him in real life you would want to laugh . The only thing that made him a sinister figure was the power he possessed . Anyone who can have a man thrown to the lions is bound to be sinister . ' It was very funny in the restaurant or anywhere about the Paramount lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you saw a bunch of clean-shaven brutal mon with hair on their chests you could be sure they were barbarians , but if you saw a lot of weak , kindly old gentlemen with staffs and long white beards you were quite safe in saying , ' Those are Christians . ' Cecil B. De Mille made the difference very marked ? perhaps to make sure that the lions did not cat the wrong people . During that first visit to Hollywood , Charles also did Payment Deferred for Thalberg and M-G-M , and that is what sent me home . I had played the part of his daughter when the play was produced in London and New York , but of course Charles was not yet ' box-office ' in Hollywood ; they had to surround him with names , so they put Maureen O'Sullivan into the part of his daughter , which was hurtful to me . If someone had then said ' Box-office ' to me I should have said ' Why ? ' ? I did not understand . Now I know that the bigger the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do is to get my name bigger and not question other people 's names . Before I came home I went to see Irving Thalberg . It was the first time I had met him . I think if he had seen me earlier I should have got the part of the adolescent in the film , but ho had thought , ' Oh , Charles Laughton 's wife ? what the hell does she look like , I wonder . ' I was sitting in his office , I remember , when Thalberg walked in . He looked at me , went to the door , and shouted to someone outside , ' I told you to send Mrs. Laughton in , ' and they replied , ' We have sent Mrs. Laughton in . ' Then he looked at me again and said , ' Are you Mrs. Laughton ? ' Of course Iwent in a simple hat and frock and looked as adolescent as I could . That was after Maureen O'Sullivan had been cast , but I had thought to myself that when I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . On my return to England I was introduced to Alexander Korda . I met him for the first time in the Grosvenor Street office . Korda knew I was married to Charles , and possibly that added a little to his charm of manner . He immediately suggested a film for both of us that was never made and has been completely forgotten . Anyway , he told me the story : it was called A Gust of Wind ? quite a lovely French story . He wanted Charles to do the leading part and thought I could play opposite him . Charles had worked in England with Komisarjevsky , the Russian stage director , and with Dupont , a film director . My first impression of Korda was that he was like these two people : his intelligence , manner , and culture were similar . It was a quick first impression . I thought , ' Charles will like this man , ' and I wrote to that effect to Charles : that here was a man I thought he could really work with . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I may write to him once a week , maybe once a fortnight , but I do n't get any answer . Charles hates writing letters , but he cables night letters about twice a week . You can send quite a lot for ten shillings in this way , and if there is any very important news , or if you feel desperately lonely , you can telephone . That costs two or three pounds . When you are separated there is not really much point in writing letters when you know a person well . Nowadays I am not likely to sit down and write some pseudo-literary splurge to Charles . I might give myself pleasure , but not him . V For many years people have taken one look at Charles and said , ' You know , you ought to do Henry the Eighth . ' It is an obvious remark ? rather like saying , when there is a blue sky , ' Is n't it a lovely blue sky ? ' To tell the truth , I believe the first person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , John Armstrong the painter . He was introduced to Korda , and eventually designed the costumes for Henry the Eighth . At first the film was to be called Henry V LIT s Fourth Wife , which was I , Anne of Cleves , because it was to be a film about us two , and because all the comedy that was , I suppose , to be got out of the picture appeared to be in relation to that queen . However , another wife came in , then another , as it became obvious that what the public knew about Henry the Eighth was that he had a lot of wives , and that 's what they wanted to see . Korda was right . The revised version developed into a much better picture . Those were the days when one did the best one could with a piece of string and a drawing pin . Henry the Eighth was produced for , I think , about 50,000 pounds , which is little money for a comparatively big film . If the same film were now made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might bo asked , ' Why not go on with the drawing pin and string ? ' I think the answer is because the odds are against getting the same good results twice . A film company thrives on its high average , not on its flashes in the pan . Three or four months passed during the making of that picture ? it took such a long time to prepare . Charles himself took a great deal of trouble to probe the character and period of Henry the Eighth before starting the picture , and while doing this he persuaded anyone connected with the film that he had any contact with to do the same . I remember his insisting on taking Korda to Hampton Court to see the architecture and pictures ; also Vincent Korda , Alex 's brother , who made such a marvelous job of the sets . As far as I know , neither of them had been there , before . Charles read every possible book he could get on the subject , and saw numerous Holbein pictures of Henry the Eighth . Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think he had got the walk , the next day he would lose it . And then he would get a look in the eye for one scene and let that set for a few days . Eventually I should say he found himself living in the part . I myself was , of course , soaking up Anne of Cleves in my little way on the side . I suppose Charles and I are like a couple of sponges when studying a part . We absorb every bit of information that comes in useful , even to snatching at characteristics in our closest friends if they fit . There were such a lot of alterations and holdups that in the end Charles was called back to Hollywood before Henry the Eighth was finished . They shot Charles in his scenes , and we did the rest after he left . Ile was about six weeks actually shooting the picture . He saw the cut version of it for the first time in America , and was as surprised as everyone to see what a good picture it proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and joined the Old Vie ? Sadler 's Wells Company . We were both in that . It was a nine-months season , but Charles missed the first play because he could not get back in time . The first production was Twelfth Night . He only got back in time to rehearse for one week as Lopakhin in Chekhov 's Cherry Orchard . During those days we had no flat in London because of all the going back and forth , and wo lived in a modern apartment house at Bury Court , Jermyn Street ? really service flats , and convenient for the Old Vic , since we did not have to go through traffic . We could go through St. James 's Park and over Westminster Bridge . Although it was a poky sort of existence , studying our parts in a couple of rooms and a bathroom , we had a marvelous time . At the beginning of the Old Vic season I had taken the flat in which we are now living . It required , however , the whole of the nine months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enlarged and two of the rooms made into one . It was a very Victorian flat when we took it , and had to be completely gutted and modernized . My search for it during the early days of the Old Vic season led me to the conclusion that , instead of going to house agents when you need a new home , it is better to go to doctors and ask them which of their patients is dying . When I first saw this flat it was so full of Victorian furniture that it looked ready to suffocate anybody . After it had been altered , we lived in it for only two weeks at the end of the Old Vic season , and then we had to pack up and leave . We were away for a whole year , which was very sad , since we had just got the flat all ready . Still , it was nice to come back to it . At the Old Vic we rehearsed every day for the following production , starting at half-past ten in the morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The curtain rose for the nightly performances at eight o'clock . There was just time to dash back to Jermyn Street for dinner and back again to the theatre . When the curtain comes down , one is always in a nervy state and wanting to talk to someone . One hears such things as ' I nearly tripped up on the carpet ? God , I sweated ! ' and ' Did you see me try to open the door the wrong way and it hit me in the face ? ' You must sit round afterwards and have it all out , and so we practically lived with the actors ? at least with many of them Roger Livesey , Ursula Jeans , Flora Robson , Athene Seyler , and others . They would come back to our small rooms , and we would sit shoulder to shoulder drinking beer and eating cold tongue and salad ? which was all we could get in a service flat ? and talk about the theatre until about two in the morning . Then up again at half-past nine and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a lot of success , but was so bad in The Importance of Being Earnest that I dried up at every performance and used to appeal to the prompter , not caring a hoot what the audience thought of me . I just stood and said ' What ? ' and got practically my whole part from the prompter in a sort of despairing condition . I was not suited to the part , but there seemed to be no one else to play it . In a repertory company you have to take what comes . I had successes , but that was my star failure . Charles was at that time studying Macbeth and was rather worried because , although he took large and small parts with the rest , he had to bear the brunt of the press criticism . He did not go to the Old Vic for publicity , but to work and study , and yet he drew all the attention . Charles thought he could go back on his career and learn the classics by going to the Old Vic and working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down there to hide , and found himself more in the spotlight than ever because of newspapers making headlines of what they called his ' spectacular sacrifice . ' Others could give good and bad performances with him , and not be nearly so noticeable as when he gave a bad performance . If you want to hide from the public when you are already in the public eye , you can't.
