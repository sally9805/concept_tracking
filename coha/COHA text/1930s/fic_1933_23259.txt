SACKCLOTH IN THE MORNING A STORY BY MARGARET CULKIN BANNING HAD been one of those occasions so ing for the customary potato chips and gay and untrammeled that everyone woke up the next morning with an apology in the throat . Unexpected things had happened , knocking the usual order of events about , and such slapstick had seemed uproariously funny at the time . But there were bruises . Cynthia Glendenning got up as early as usual . She had had only two hours of sleep , but she always thought that the best thing to do with a certain kind of fatigue was to put it to work . She was due at the bookshop at nine , though with the temperature well below zero , there was little chance that anyone would come in to buy books or prints this morning . Closing her window seemed merely to pen in the stiff , cold air . She put her hand on a radiator and found it lukewarm . The older the house got the colder it seemed to become , as if the veins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of wool stockings . The chiffon ones on the chair made her shiver to look at them . No wonder she had been half-frozen on that street corner last night , waiting for a taxi . She put the scattered parts of the night before together in her mind . They had begun at Fritz Kane 's apartment , picking him up there on the way to the Caf ? Noir  --  where they were chasing a favorite orchestra  --  and linger-cocktails . In his little bachelor sitting room , all blocked up with the piano , they had begun to realize that the evening hail the makings of hilarity . It must have been ten o'clock when they left there . Fritz did that sort of entertaining very well , mixing it with music as no one else could . But of course it was all he did do for people in return for the generous hospitality and backing that Millicent Hancock and her friends gave him . Milly had certainly enjoyed herself last night . She always liked a little Bohemia , though preferably not in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a bad example for the children . She liked , once in a while , to leave her house of many servants and help Fritz to put his potato chips in a pottery bowl . Of course she always took Dave along . She was n't the sort of person to run round without her husband . And last night Dave himself had loosened up for once , paying a great deal of attention to Rose Bowen and finally driving her off in his car when they left the caf ? . If he had n't done that and so left the other four of them , Fritz , Milly , Harold Bowen , and Cynthia stranded , they would n't have done anything so preposterous as to pick up a strange man . Harold Bowen had n't liked that at all . That was one reason Cynthia had yielded to impulse , because Har-old never would let an impulse came within a mile of him . There they had stood in the doorway of the Caf ? Noir , where the lights were being turned out and the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes waiting for a taxi and abusing Dave for running off with Rose and without them . Naturally Dave had blundered unconsciously . He was unaware that Harold did n't have his car down town . But Harold had n't wanted to keep his chauffeur up for this elongated party and have him gossiping in city garages about the company . So he had sent him home . Harold thought of things like that . He was like a cloak thrown round the indiscretions of Rose . He had assumed that they would all either go home in Dave 's car or pick up a cab . There were always cabs . Or there had been until last night , when the earth seemed to have swallowed them up . So Fritz ran up and down the street looking for taxis and could n't find one in sight . Someone said that a big public dance at the other end of the city was draining them off . Fritz finally thought he recognized a man driving by in a private car and signalled that , and it had stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver . It was a fairly good car  --  nothing custom-made  --  and there was a radio going in it , which was amusing . It was queer to hear the dance music going on in that heated car which was driving along in twenty-five below zero weather , when people 's breath froze on their lips and the black corners were bitten savagely by the wind and frost crept up thickly on the plate-glass windows along the street . The car stopped and Fritz had to say something . " Sorry . I thought you were someone else , " he began . " Beg your pardon for stopping you . " " Anything I can do ? " " How far north are you going ? " asked Fritz . " Only to Wilson Street . " Harold was frowning slightly and looking the part of a reserved , distinguished citizen . He was always conscious that he might be recognized . Cynthia remembered that she thought at that minute that he would let her freeze rather than do anything that might be misconstrued by strangers , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his mental refuge from Rose for two years . He made her furious . That was why she did it . She stepped forward beside Fritz and said to the man , " Please take us out to Highbridge . There are n't any cabs left in the world and we 're so co/d1 " He looked embarrassed and rather bored . They must have seemed overdressed for the street , the two men in evening dress , Milly in her usual sables , and Cynthia herself in the old red-velvet coat with its ermine sleeves . A good evening coat lasted through lean years . The man driving the car had on a soft felt hat and his coat collar was turned up about his ears . He was looking at her , Cynthia knew , when he said , " Certainly  --  get in . " Like that . He was a little contemptuous and deliberately indifferent , as if he would n't put himself out , as if it were all right to be driving about the town to radio music , but silly to be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and a marvellous orchestra . But he had n't been so indifferent later on in the evening . That was what made Cynthia resolve now that she was positively never going to do anything crazy again . He would n't have got out of the car and come into the house unless she had insisted . They 'd all planned to go back to Cynthia 's house before they left the caf ? . Nobody wanted the party to stop , and they could dance to the radio and later on have some scrambled eggs . They went to Cynthia 's house because she never minded impromptu parties and her mother was deaf and slept in the north wing . And when they got there Cynthia felt very hospitable as well as curious . She said to the young man , " Come in and get warm before you go back . You can run your car right into an empty stall in the garage and keep it cosy . There 's nothing but a feeble old electric coupe in there . " " I must n't come in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frontier ways , " she said . She wanted to have him , with the stubbornness of three-o'clock excitement . She had a party fever in her blood . And he had come . It had been fun at the time , having a new man like that . When you knew every man you ever saw at parties , and there were only five bachelors among them , a stranger of your own age was more than a diversion . Two of the bachelors Cynthia would not marry and three she could not . The stranger had really made the rest of the evening a success . He had given them an incident to harp on , an audience to play to . He turned out to be a young doctor . But he was n't connected with either of the two leading clinics , and his offices were in an undistinguished section of the city . He stood and smiled , no doubt full to the neck with psychological theories about them all , and watched what was going on . Cynthia finally took him out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " You want to get into the spirit of this . " " How do I go about that ? " " You just decide what you want to do and proceed to do it . " Then he had kissed her . She had acted as if she did n't mind , as if she enjoyed it . She Iet herself go , slipping fully into the minute as if she would never have to be responsible for it again . What made a person such a fool at four o'clock in the morning ? He was a totally strange man , who probably went away thinking she was some sort of degenerate . He would catalogue her as the kind of rich , spoiled society person who is morally rotten . He would n't know that she was living on practically no money at all , that some months it was a battle even to pay the rent of the bookshop , that she had bought the dress she wore from Milly for five dollars . She had to keep up with her crowd because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And besides she had to conquer that feeling of being stuck in a rut , with nobody except Harold to care what happened to her . And he was too cautious to let caring make any real difference . Cynthia went to say good-morning to her mother and told her to stay in bed until the house warmed up . She wished that any doctor who had ideas about her as one of the leisure class knew how she was worried about buying more coal . Downstairs Kitty was puttering about , cleaning up the scrambled egg plates and grumbling as she grumbled every morning . But Kitty worked for practically no wages ? if you could call it work . Even her cup of coffee could not get last night 's events out of Cynthia 's head or make them any less regrettable . The false idea that doctor must have of her still rankled . Just before she went to catch the eight-thirty street car she stopped by the telephone and picked up the directory . She might call him . She would very much like him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cherishing any romantic delusions about a silly kiss . Cameron , Alec , physician and surgeon . That would be the one . " Hello , Doctor Cameron ? This is Cynthia Glendenning speaking . I wanted to thank you again for picking us up last night . It was certainly a kindness in this fearful weather . We all appreciated it so much . Oh , yes , I 'm always up early . Just going out but I wanted to tell you how decent it was . Good-by . " That ought to clear things up . She had n't given him any openings for conversation or suggested that she expected or would allow further meetings . A chance episode  --  a courtesy  --  her tone certainly showed how casual the whole thing had been . He ca n't think I 'm so cheap now , thought Cynthia . Fritz Kane could not stay in bed either that morning . He had to give a piano lesson to one of his master class at ten o'clock . And after that , at eleven , there was a cappella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't feel himself this morning . He was tired of course but , more than that , he was distressed . He had said the wrong thing last night . He had blundered . It had been a mistake to go back to Cynthia 's house at that hour . Two o'clock was late enough for any party . After two o'clock you went ahead on excited nerves , not real energy . What he should have done was to have them drop him at the apartment here and then it never would have happened . Sometimes in cruel flashes , like the one he 'd had last night , Fritz Kane saw himself and what he had become , a musical dependent . Of course one could argue  --  as his more comforting moods did  --  that great musicians had always needed patronage . Look at the biographies . But Fritz knew that the catch was that he was not great . Sometimes he pretended that he thought theconcert stage was n't worth the trouble it took to attain it , but secretly he knew that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music but he lacked those noble proportions of genius and industry which the great must have . Now he gave lessons and acted as impresario , bringing great pianists and violinists to the city on commission . He could match them in conversation . He could take them into the beautiful and cultured surroundings of his friends and be more at ease there than they sometimes were . But when the great ones took command of their instruments they always left him , only a small , blond man who would never get any farther , standing in the wings . Occasionally lie had thought of going to Paris or Vienna , not for trips but to stay . This morning he felt that he wanted to be anywhere rather than in this city , where Millicent Hancock thought she owned him . Not bodily ? she did n't want him that way  --  but as the butler in her musical life , he thought bitterly . She had been a friend , of course . She had backed his ventures . She sent him pupils . But that should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . That was no reason why he should have to endure that flare of temper she had shown last night because her husband had become interested in Rose Bowen . She had been angry and wanted Fritz to sympathize with her fury . And he , suddenly disgusted with the obviousness of the whole crowd , with Milly and David and Rose 's husband , had not been sympathetic . He had been deliberately cruel . " Rose , " he said , " is the desire theme , you know . Men always want to hear it . They listen for it . " " And what am I ? " Milly asked hotly . " You 're the possession motif . " Milly would n't talk to him after that . She had ignored him , stayed wrapped in her hauteur while they said good-night . It was a horrid thing to say because it was so true . He would n't have said it if he had n't been utterly tired of them all at the moment , of their pretences at defiance when they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that tempted him , drop out of their lives , call up a steamship office , turn the key on this apartment , sail for Europe and never see another potato chip . The pupil , playing Bach abominably , got on Fritz 's nerves . Here was another fellow who would never get anywhere . He said to the pupil that was enough for this morning . Yes , the thing to do was to shake it all off . He had lived here long enough . But what could he do in some foreign country that did n't want or need him ? A chair on a boulevard  --  perhaps a piano in a cafe before he was through ? rebuffs from people who did n't know or care that he had attained a position as a musical critic in an American city . The musicians whom he had brought here would not help . They probably would n't even remember him . He 'd be a nobody . And here he was somebody . He appreciated that . No musical venture in the city was safe without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on intimate terms with people of wealth and influence , partly because he was a good critic . When he went to a concert students pointed him out . Fritz Kane knew that . He ignored and laughed at his local celebrity but he cherished it . Of course if Milly were not back of him , with Dave 's enormous fortune in her hands , it might be different . If he dropped out of that group where would he be ? Would Milly ever be hack of him again after last night ? Had he ruined that friendship ? Itwas one of years ' growth , but sometimes a phrase , especially one about another woman , could spoil everything . He should n't have said that . And he would not have said it if he had n't been tired of Milly 's ownership and amused at her husband 's truancy . But with the greatest pianist in the world coming next month on his concert tour , he needed Milly and her friends now . He was counting on Milly to he hostess of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her huge music-room . They were magnificent instruments . He had selected them and Milly had bought them . They had planned a delightful reception after the concert and some informal music . It was to be one of those occasions for which he was famous . Let someone else handle it . Fritz picked up the telephone book . He would reserve passage for Europe on the first boat . Of course it would take all the cash he had , and also he had a lease on this place for another year ; his few securities would have to be sold  --  he hesitated among those thoughts and then called a familiar number . " Mrs. Hancock please , Emma . No , do n't disturb her if she 's still sleeping . Just tell her Mr. Kane called . " An extension telephone clicked off its stand and a voice asked if it was Fritz . " Oh , hello , Milly . I just called up to find out how you are this morning ? Very amusing party , was n't it ? Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bored now and then with Rose and her amorous antics . Harmless but obvious , should n't you say so ? I always like to look at Rose . The desire theme ? ? Did I say that ? That 's not bad . I did n't say desirability anyway . No , I guess not . I do n't know  --  you own me anyway , Milly  --  if that 's possession ? " Five minutes later Mrs. David Hancock hung up the telephone with some satisfaction . She felt better now that she had talked to Fritz . She had just been lifting the telephone to call up Rose Bowen when she had heard him asking about her . How silly to take anything Fritz said seriously when he was just talking at random and did not even remember what he 'd said . Probably it would be just as well not to talk to Rose in the way she had intended . The thing that had spoiled Milly 's breakfast  --  and the tray still rested on her white satin comforter , with egg unbroken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown such jealousy of Rose . That was not the way to handle the matter . The way to manage it was to pretend that it did not exist , even as you destroyed it , tore it to ribbons . David had been simply astonishing last night . What had got into him ? He had been completely absorbed in Rose and yet if anyone disliked a stray flirtation it was David . That was what scared Milly even now . If David really fell in love with anyone else , he would be capable of anything . But he hated tawdry things . He wanted women to have dignity . Of course she should not have shown Fritz that she took it seriously for a minute . Fortunately she had destroyed that impression now . And she should not have shown Rose that she was annoyed . She would telephone Rose now and ignore the whole thing . " Hello , Rose dear ? Still in bed ? So am I , my dear , and I do n't know that I 'll ever get up . Was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think everyone had a simply marvellous time , do n't you ? Cynnie is such a lamb , poor dear , and she works so hard . I do hope she does n't go down to her little shop this morning . Was n't she funny with her young doctor ? I guess we were all pretty funny . I thought I 'd die watching my Dave and you . Honestly there were minutes when I thought I 'd lost him for good . He 's never learned how to be light about some things . Do n't you think he 's the grandest man in the world  --  no , I suppose I ca n't get you to admit that with Harold in the offing . " Rose Bowen listened without believing . Now and then she put in a word without saying what she thought . She too was in bed and not asleep . For the last hour she had been waiting for the telephone to ring , but it was Milly 's husband , not Milly , whom she expected to call her . A glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray beside her bed , her usual ascetic breakfast . The dark hair fell back to rest on the pillows , exposing the loveliness of features that captivated so many men . She knew that Millicent was making no concession . She was on guard . David had been exciting last night because flirtation was so new for him and a caress so bewildering . Rose was sorry she had not held him off , been more reserved . She should not have let him plunge into devotion all at once . That had been her blunder . " David 's too crazy about his wife to be any use to the rest of us , " said Rose lazily to Miliy . " And was n't your Fritz too cute , running around from piano to potato chips ? " Mill ) , never will do better than little Fritz , thought Rose . She probably wo n't even keep David . He 'll call me when his office is empty , when he has a chance . His office was empty but David did n't call . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen letters in answer to his morning correspondence and was alone at his big , polished desk , with the problems of an executive before him . They were big problems but the little one of last night constantly bit at their heels . He was ashamed of last night . Always he had set his face against these love affairs that ran round among their group of friends , disturbing them . He thought they were cheap , humiliating things . They got nowhere . A man came away disturbed , ludicrous . There was no end for them except in confusion and trouble . He had a strong sense of social order , and Milly had supported him very well in it . Of course he did n't take the dangling of Fritz Kane seriously because obviously Fritz had to dangle financially ; and if music amused Milly , it was a very decent thing to he interested in . No doubt Fritz could play very well though he 'd never made very much of a success of it . But he was glad Milly never overstepped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself through the paces of memory again . Of course he should n't have gone off alone with Rose but he thought the others would follow right along . Instead , they were held up . He and Rose had not only been rude but had also been left for nearly twenty minutes parked in front of Cynflies house , waiting for the rest of the company to come . They were in a heated car but it was so cold outside that it made an excuse for her closeness . That perfume He 'd known Rose for years . The Hancocks were close friends of the Bowens . David knew Rose was a beauty but he thought her usually too free . He had decided that long ago . He did n't quite admit  --  but his senses had it on record  --  that long ago , even when he was criticizing her , he was always a little more excited when Rose Bowen came into any room where he was . For years he had known how beautiful her hands were and how her lovely , passionate mouth seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . She had been in their group ever since she was married . One did not give up a wife and children , a home and position for Rose . One should n't give Rose opportunity to think that he would , or tempt oneself too far . Also , Harold Bowen was not only a friend , but their interests were tied up together . He must have been crazy last night . He had begun to be crazy when he had sat beside her at the restaurant . Milly had n't liked it at all . She had been very cool when they got home last night . He must make it up to her . Nothing had really happened . Yet for the hour last night anything might have happened . A man ought to keep a tighter rein on himself . Rose was so beautiful . She had found him exciting too . She was within reach on the telephone this minute . He deliberately pressed a buzzer . " Call up Deman 's and have them send a cluster of green orchids to my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Bowen on the telephone . " Harold Bowen was also in his office . He said to David Hancock , after they had spoken of the morning news about government loans to some railroads which affected both their holdings , " Quite a party we had last night , was n't it ? " " Yes , " said Hancock , " quite a party . " " Milly feeling fine this morning ? " " She 's still in bed . Those girls can stay there until noon . I tell you , Harry , those parties ought to come on Saturday night or on the eve of a legal holiday . That would give us a break . We have to work the next day . " " Ought to clip them off earlier . " " Tell that to the girls , " said Hancock , " and see how far you get . Well , I suppose it does n't do any harm to loosen up a little once in a while . Everybody settles down to normal next day : ' He wanted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps Bowen would say something himself , show some irritation . No , he did not . " Yes . Back to the old grind , " said Harold . " I was sorry about going off and leaving you on the street corner . I did n't realize you had let your driver go home . " " It does n't do any good to let those boys spend five or six hours at public garages , " said Bowen . " They talk too much . I thought of course that we could get taxis . " " It 's this cold weather . " " Cynnie certainly had her nerve asking that fellow to drive the crowd out . " " You ca n't stop Cynnie when she 's started . I guess that girl 's having quite a tough pull . " Bowen 's voice said , with something sharper in it , " Quite a pull . Who was that young doctor ? " " One more prescription-seller , I suppose . The city 's full of them , all hoping for epidemics . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess Cynnie did that . " " Well , " said Bowen , " it was quite a night . I think I 'll knock off and play some squash before lunch . Glad you agree with me about the disposition of those bonds , Dave . " Bowen knew that he might just as well knock off and play squash . For his mind had not been on his work this morning . He had not slept , even for the two or three hours when he might have . It had got under his skin to see that fellow kissing Cynthia . He had gone out in the kitchen to get something and hoped to find Cynthia alone out there . This doctor had been kissing her and Cynthia had not been struggling . She was softly there in his arms as if she was glad to bethere . A fellow she had never seen before . A pick-up ! It was n't his business . Cynthia was free and white and twenty-five . But she never did that sort of thing . Cynthia had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she must know what he thought of her . Of course there was Rose to consider , so he had had to be careful not to do anything that might excite comment . And Rose being as she was , indiscreet , over-emotional , and only too apt to play the fool , he had to be careful for the two of them . A scandal would hurt him tremendously . Bowen had ambitions which stretched beyond business into the higher reaches of politics . He wanted to put his mark on the world sooner or later . To do that you had to preserve a clear personal record . Also it was necessary to guard Rose , who would do preposterous things that must never be admitted . He had to guard Rose and her money . She was beautiful . But Harold Bowen was rather tired of that . He knew all her tricks of beauty , her soft seductions . He had come to prefer greatly the crisp firmness of Cynthia 's mind , the friendly touch of her arm on his , to the fascinations Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where he could go and spend half an hour talking over new books and often straying pleasantly into the ideas between their covers . Cynthia , at a dinner party , in the country , was always the one Bowen wanted . But he had been a good friend , never letting their friendship become matter for gossip , keeping it clean and safe . Often he prided himself on the fact that it had n't done Cynthia any harm . Sometimes he had been useful to her as an escort , for Rose was often taken up with someone else , and there were few attractive unmarried men in their set . There were not so many for a girl past twenty-five to choose from , espe-cially when , like Cynthia , she had no money at all left . She had let that fellow kiss her . She had picked him up deliberately on the street . For three years , thought Bowen , I 've been wanting to kiss Cynthia like that and have n't . I 've protected her . And she lets herself go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed stung him . She had looked so passionate , so utterly desirable in that fellow 's arms . He wanted to knock the man down . But that would have made a scene and he had no right to interfere anyway . So he had gone out before Cynthia and the doctor had known he was there . He saw Cynthia stir and turn , as he disappeared in the shadows of the gaunt dining room of the old house . With Rose one might expect things like that to happen , though he would never admit to the public that they did . But Cynthia had never been like that . Was she just tired of the feeling between them which he had been guarding ? She had looked at him queerly before she asked that fellow to drive them out to Highbridge . She looked as if she expected him to do something about it . But what could he do ? He had telephoned every place in the city for a cab . Under the circumstances he would have been a fool to keep his car downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered how Cynthia felt about it all to-day . Surely she could n't be in love with that man Cameron . It must have been just a crazy moment , built up by what she had had to drink . But Cynthia did n't drink very much and she never had lost her head like that before . What had the fellow said to her and what did she see in him ? He was just a nobody and probably did n't have any practice . Bowen was wrong about the doctor . To be sure , Doctor Cameron had opened his office in a rather thickly settled section of the city , but he had plenty of patients . One brought another , because the young doctor , fresh from training in one of the best hospitals in the country , seemed to get results . He had patients enough but so far they did n't bring in much money . Part of that was his own fault . He could n't ask for the money due him from some of the people he attended . They needed it far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had a warm office , a car , a couple of inexpensive rooms to live in , and he could get along . Most of the people he saw had far less comfort and far more responsibility . But Doctor Cameron was often lonely , or at least alone . That was why he liked the radio in his car . He had not met many people in the city who were interesting . A few doctors with dull wives had asked him to their homes . He knew a nurse or two who could be companions at movies , but that was about all . He was shy for one thing , and critical of women for another . He was very critical of them this morning after the party of the night before . When those people had flagged his car last night , naturally he had had to stop . At first he thought someone was ill . When he saw that they were just a gang of society people coming from the Cafe Noir his impulse had been to leave them and say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had put him off the track . He liked her voice . There was a laugh in it . It was gracious and sweet and daring too . It was all right to take them out to her house . He did n't blame himself for that . That was really only decent under the circumstances on such a night . But his mistake was to go in , he thought , as he sat by Mrs. Smith 's bcd in the hospital and half listened to her tell him the things he already knew about her sufferings . He should have taken the party to that girl 's house and left them at the door . He should not have gone in where he did n't belong and where he did n't know any of them . He could not afford to run with that sort of people , not possibly . That was why he had not used some of the introductions he had been given in New York to people in town here . He did n't have the money and he could n't do his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties that went with leisure and money . All that had been out of his life and unregretted too , until last night he had accepted that girl 's invitation to go into her house . She probably had not wanted him . She had just been making a good invitation out of it . He had fallen for it , and for her . She was a pretty thing and there was plenty of life going to waste in her . How she stood out against that neurotic Mrs. Bowen and the other woman , the one they called Milly , who seemed to be so possessive and rich from the way she talked . Cynthia Glendenning was the only reasonably normal one of the lot . The Milly one was repressed and Mrs. Bowen on the loose . He could see Cynthia now , right over the head of the complaining Mrs. Smith , as she had stood by the kitchen table , in that blue , low-necked dress , slicing bread and beating eggs and crazy to be in a man 's arms . That lot were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he evidently had his eye on Cynthia . She should n't let herself get into an emotional situation with a fellow like that . Bowen was handsome and well behaved but he lacked something . The Kane fellow was musical as well as social . They all must have thought him a cheap sort of crasher . However , it did n't matter what theythought , except the Cynthia one . He hoped that she at least did n't believe that he had taken advantage of the situation to get into a big house with a lot of rich people . Maybe she did . Perhaps that was why she had called him up this morning . He wished he could talk to her today and tell her that there was no reason why what happened last night should trouble or embarrass her . Of course it might be just a little way of hers , kissing strange men like that . But Alec Cameron did n't think so . It had not felt like that . She was not quite normal but she had not been drinking much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To-day she was probably having a bad reaction . Well , he was n't feeling so top-notch himself . He had had a good time while he was there . But there was a Iet-down . He said good-by to Mrs. Smith and told her he would leave directions for her relief . In the corridor he wrote a prescription and told the nurse what to do . " A grain and a half , " he said . " How does she respond ? " " It helps . For a few hours . But the reaction is bad when the effect wears off . " He nodded . " It 's that kind of drug . But I think she 'll have to have it . " He finished his round of hospital visits and went back to his office and the patients there . Work cleared Doctor Cameron 's mind of many things . But at noon he could still feel in it a slight smart of humiliation for having intruded last night and a genuine desire to know how Cynthia Glendenning felt to-day . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this morning . But there was the book and print shop that she 'd told him about last night . He might drop in there and see if she was there . It would be all right . The place was public . There were two cars in front of the shop , a small , neat coupe and a long , chauffeured car . Doctor Cameron , opening the door , wished at once that he had not come , He recognized Mrs. Hancock , up to the eyes in mink . And there was little Fritz Kane too . They were both talking to the tall girl who was better looking than he remembered . Even her fatigue was beautiful . " Why , hello , " she said , " I 'm having lots of customers . " Fritz nodded cordially . Mrs. Hancock smiled . " How are you this morning ? " they asked the doctor . He answered that he was fine . Mrs. Hancock said , " Why not Doctor Cameron , Cynnie ? " Cynthia lifted a shoulder and then smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning  --  that is , Milly was ? a little round-up for to-night . " " it 's terribly informal , " explained Millicent . " Just talking it over , " added Fritz . Another party , thought Doctor Cameron . They ca n't stop amusing themselves . He thought suddenly of Mrs. Smith in the hospital , of the way the effect wore off , the depression afterwards . " Could n't you come ? " asked Cynthia , with a gleam of excitement . He wondered if he would .
