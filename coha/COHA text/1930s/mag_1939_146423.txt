Last week found Europe 's peasants repairing machines , mending carts , sharpening scythes . In southern France , Italy , Russia , a decisive harvest began . A peasant army hundreds of thousands strong , strung out on a vast peaceful front from Siberia through France , was advancing by successive mobilizations as yellowing grainfields quickly ripened northward . To war-anxious Europe this peaceful mobilization meant a kind of armistice . For while peasants in uniform fight Europe 's wars , they could hardly be set to fighting until they had got in the grain . And since even modern mechanized armies still travel on their stomachs , no nation could well afford to risk losing its grain supply by attacking another nation during harvest . Though Nazis defied this law of Europe 's military history by keeping close to 2,000,000 men under arms as the harvest began , few Believed even Germany would risk a crisis until September when its own essential crops are in . <P> &gt;Sturdy French Algerian and Tunisian farmer in one of Rome 's old granaries had their crops gathered , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France . There it was three weeks late because last autumn 's freezes killed out 25% of the winter wheat which then had to be resown . Adequate snowfalls and spring rains helped , but the French wheat crop will be well under last year 's , though ample for French needs even had 268,000,000 bushels not been carried over . The great French need was not wheat but field-hands to reap it . France , which relies on about 500,000 migratory laborers and their families from Belgium , Poland and Czecho-Slovakia to gather its crops , this year expected Germany to hire away the Belgians while Czechs and Poles would be kept at home . <P> &gt; In Italy all last week Benito Mussolini 's self-flown , trimotored airplane zoomed down from the sky into the busy countryside as II Duce kept a weather eye on the vital 5,400,000-hectare wheat harvest now in full swing . High winds , heavy rains and floods in May kept the wheat crop close to last year 's figure of 293,600,000 bushels though 4% more land was seeded . Quality was poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal official forecasts . Though in southern Italy recovery from rain and rust was quick , around Bologna 75% of the wheat was so dashed that machines could not be used and peasants were bringing out their sickles for a slow , back-breaking harvest by hand . <P> Once more Italian peasants seemed to be out of luck . Last year the Government mixed wheat flour with so much corn there was not enough left for polenta ( corn meal mush ) without which life for an Italian peasant is not worth living . Polenta-less peasants raised such a howl that this year Il Duce ordered mixing to stop . But cold wet weather reduced the Italian corn crop to less than last year 's 121,110,000 bushels . The fruit crop too ( which in orange-and-olive-growing Italy is important ) is poor and late . <P> &gt;Very different were crops in Hungary where peasants were waiting to declare Peter-Paul Day , their traditional day of harvest . They expected to cut 96,000,000 bushels of wheat , 35,000,000 bushels of rye from Hungary 's immensely fertile Alfld ( plains ) . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exported wheat , look pleased .
