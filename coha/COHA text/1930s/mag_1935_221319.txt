No matter how calm he may appear , when a stutterer has difficulty getting a word out he is really suffering from a spasm . The spasm is a disturbance of the motor nerves that control speech . It may possibly be set off by expansion of the tiny blood vessels in the cerebral cortex where the speech control centres are located . Last summer experimenters at University of Michigan 's laboratory of biolinguistics made 24 stutterers get down on their hands &; knees , talk while crawling . In every case the stuttering was notably diminished , in some cases eliminated entirely-so long as the crawling posture was maintained . Reporting this last week in Science , Experimenter Hazle Geniesse ventured a guess that such a posture might alter the cerebral blood pressure , remove the spasmodic stimulus . Dr. Donald Anderson Laird , Colgate 's well-publicized authority on sleep , also had a report to make last week on the effect of posture on blood distribution . Dr. Laird thought that , although mankind was benefited by acquiring the upright position , there were some disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abdominal pool , which may cause a slight blood deficiency in the brain . Dr. Laird tested , for proficiency in mental arithmetic , six students with their heads a foot lower than their feet . In this position they were 14% more accurate , 7% faster than they were with their heads one foot higher than their feet , presumably because of blood coursing by gravity from the abdominal pool toward the brain . Dr. Laird holds it not impossible that man may once again assume the quadrupedal position , in order to think better .
