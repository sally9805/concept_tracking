The Indianapolis classic of U. S. auto racing was eight months away last week . But on a ramshackle half-mile dirt track on the outskirts of Detroit 33 chugging , sputtering little cars lined up before 10,000 spectators to run what the track 's owner Don Zeiter , at least , regarded as Indianapolis in miniature . Its qualifying races had already been run off exactly like those at Indianapolis . Chief differences were the length of the race ( 150 miles instead of 500 ) , the size of the track ( mile instead of 2 ) , the size of the prizes ( $5,000 instead of $20,000 ) , the length of the cars ( 6 ft. instead of 12 ) . But to the midget racers , who call their cars " doodlebugs , " last week 's race was the longest and most important so far run in the U. S. <P> No sooner had the doodlebugs rolled out of their pits and roared across the starting line than the spectators were dramatically reminded of Indianapolis . Rounding the first of the 300 laps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis scrambled out unhurt . Later Johnny Ritter , smallest but reputedly most " heavy-footed " of doodlebug racers , did the same thing . After 2 hr. 18 min. of noise , flying dirt and squirting oil , Los Angeles ' Ronney Householder flashed across the finish line , followed by Detroit 's Glenn Meyers and Indiana 's Ted Hartley . Winner House-holder 's average speed was 65.2 m.p.h . To dapper , mustached 29-year-old Ronney Householder , who grew up with the sport and has been carrying his doodlebug around to races in a specially built truck for four years , his $1,500 share of the prize money was the biggest he had ever won . To his colleagues it was conclusive proof that their diminutive sport was rapidly coming of age . <P> Doodlebugs first appeared in the U. S. in Los Angeles in 1919 when a group of rich youngsters built midget cars to race around the Junior College Stadium , but midget racing as a recognized U. S. sport is less than five years old . In 1932 a field of eight midgets raced 20 laps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School . In 1934 Oilman Earl Gilmore built a stadium for midgets at a cost of $134,000 . The Gilmore track was soon drawing crowds as large as 9,000 , and shortly thereafter a onetime Hearst cameraman named Norman Alley opened a track in Chicago . Although Promoter Alley at first claimed that there was no money in the sport , the following year he proceeded to sign up on long-term contracts most of the leading drivers appearing on a mushrooming series of Midwest tracks . Madison Square Garden , prime barometer for new U. S. sporting crazes , held its first doodlebug race in its outdoor bowl last year . A midget race in Philadelphia 's Municipal Stadium last summer drew 53,000 customers , largest professional sport gate that city had enjoyed since the Dempsey-Tunney fight of 1926 . Today there are profitable tracks in scores of U. S. cities , fly-by-night ventures in a hundred more . The sport has been roughly organized into Midwest , Pacific and Atlantic associations , but as yet has no national championship .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
