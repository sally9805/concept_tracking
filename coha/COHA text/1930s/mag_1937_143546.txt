Nobody expects jazz musicians to play symphonies . But some high-brow concert audiences still think that symphonic musicians can play jazz . Symphonies are made to be played in concert halls for people who buy tickets to listen to them ; the best jazz is made up on the spur of the moment , belongs in the jam session or the dance hall . Last week in Philadelphia 's mid-Victorian Academy of Music , members of the Philadelphia Orchestra , under platinum-blond Maestro Leopold Stokowski , jiggled and swayed , did their best to lose their educated musician 's sense of discipline , tried embarrassingly to get hot . The result was pretty tepid , but not their fault . William Grant Still , Negro composer of the Afro-American Symphony , had asked for it by writing a new Symphony in G Minor based on jazz , blues and other American musical idioms . <P> Subtitled Song of a New Race , Composer Still 's newest work purports to " point musically to changes wrought in a people through the progressive and transmuting spirit of America . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorrow , " " Humor " and " Aspiration . " Pleasantly sentimental in the moments when it was not jazzy , the score was more impressive in its clear professional instrumentation ( Composer Still once orchestrated for Paul Whiteman ) than through its intrinsic musical qualities . Minus its jazz content it might possibly have been a better symphony ; minus its symphonic pretensions , its jazz moments would certainly have been better jazz . <P> U. S. " nationalist " composers have long sought to combine these two musical styles , to create a type of symphony that is peculiarly a U. S. product . Jazz , or " Afro-American " symphonists prominent in recent seasons have included : Negro Composer William L. Dawson , who conducts the Tuskegee Choir , and whose Negro Folk Symphony No. 1 was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Conductor Stokowski three years ago ; Otto Cesana , onetime staff composer at Manhattan 's Radio City , whose two jazz-inspired symphonies have been broadcast by Radio Maestro Erno Rapee ; 23-year-old Radio Arranger Morton Gould , whose Swing Symphonette is scheduled for performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Alden Carpenter , most famous of U. S. nationalist composers , have avoided jazz symphonies , contenting themselves with writing rhapsodies , operas , ballets , tone-poems . Loudest pooh-poohing of their efforts has come , not from high-brow critics and musicians , but from swing and hot jazz fans who find this symphonic jazz stiff and imitative.
