The late Russell Sage paid Western Union the compliment of observing that only once in a lifetime might a man hope to buy its stock below $50 a share . Until 1931 Western Union bulls used to make great play with this remark , which indeed held true for many a lifetime ended before that year . Since then there have been frequent opportunities to buy Western Union at prices well below $50 . Its first 1937 dip below that price occurred fortnight ago , when , after dropping steadily from a year 's high of $83.50 , Western Union slid to $49.50 . Last week it broke to $43.50 . <P> In the background of this not very alarming slump were a number of developments highly important to Western Union Telegraph Co . One was the process of recovery within the company itself . In 1935 Western Union made $5,258,000 against $2,243,000 in 1934 . Last year it made $7,199,120 . But whereas operating expenses in 1935 were actually less than the year before , last year they increased $6,706,000 , including taxes and interest . Reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union employes received an additional $1,300,000 in 1936 ; 2 ) higher costs of materials used in repairs and replacements , the most obvious example being copper wire ; 3 ) $767,000 additional taxes ; 4 ) higher rentals for the 20,968 Western Union offices . <P> Western Union 's 1,872,461 miles of wire carry four-fifths of all U. S. telegrams and Western Union has no worries about getting its share of the U. S. telegraph business . But with costs piling up in 1936 and 1937 Western Union is more than ever concerned that there shall be more &; more use of telegrams . This is where the Federal Communications Commission comes in . Fortnight ago when the Commission renewed its inquiry into American Telephone &; Telegraph it had the satisfaction of knowing that A. T. &; T. had made no less than three reductions in long distance rates since January 1936 . Each reduction has encouraged sons , lovers and businessmen to use . the telephone between cities . <P> Already bothered by the growing ability of air mail to do for 6 what a night letter does for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance telephone rates now halved , for example , between Chicago and New York . Their response was to work out with the delighted FCC a new scale of night rates embodying the principle of graduated volume discounts which Western Union 's dour Vice President John Calvin Willever ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) has long yearned to extend to every type of telegram . Effective June i , the ten-word night message and 50-word night letter were abolished , a new , 25-word minimum night message introduced which could be sent anywhere in the U. S. for a maximum of 50.
