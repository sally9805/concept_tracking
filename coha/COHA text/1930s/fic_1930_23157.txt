THE FALSE TALISMAN A STORY BY CHARLES CALDWELL DOBIE F4 VERY morning on San Francisco Bay a fleet of ferry boats de- posits fifty thousand workers in San Francisco . And every evening the same ferry boats carry these fifty thousand workers home again . Eddie Schott was one of the fifty thousand . He had a linen-collar job in an insurance office on California Street and he lived with his mother and two sisters in a two-story house in East Oakland . The elder sister , Lena , worked in a notion store just around the corner from the ancestral home , but Elsie , the younger , stayed home and helped mama with the housework . Eddie Schott was the pride and envy of his neighbors . His genteel occupation , for one thing , set him apart in a neighborhood of males who went to work in overalls , and , secondly , he had a mysterious entree into exalted circles . On Friday nights , particularly , when they saw him hurrying back to town with a huge bass horn under his arm they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mood , " Weil , there goes Eddie to his club . . . . Pretty soft for some guys ! " If they were feeling genial they thought , " Nice boy , Eddie ! " If they were in a bitter frame of mind they muttered , " I wonder how he gets that way ! " But in either case they speculated on how Eddie had made the grade . Eddie Schott used to wonder himself . He knew as well as anyone that he had got into the Gaiety Club more or less on a fluke . It was a distinction to belong to the Gaiety Club . You had either to be a man of talent in the arts or a millionaire . If you were in one of the arts you made yourself entertaining . If you were a millionaire you paid the assessments . It was a capital arrangement . Three or four times during the winter the Gaiety Club put on a show for its members and in the summer they went to their camp in a forest and held high carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men who could provide entertainment . There was a club chorus , a club orchestra , actors , dancers , even a club band . Eddie Schott played the bass horn in the band . It was so large that when he fitted it around his narrow shoulders it completely swamped his personality . This horn was a legacy from his father . Anton Schott had driven a brewer 's wagon  --  a mountain of a man with a wide chest and an even wider girth . He had belonged in his day to a Schiitzenverein . Every Sunday this shooting club dressed up in Bavarian huntsman garb and went down to a private park for target practice . An amateur band , recruited from the ranks of the members , always walked at the head of these excursions . And in that band was Anton Schott , puffing lustily on his bass horn . Eddie 's spine used to tingle every time he thought of his father swinging down the street with a flame of brass slung over his shoulders . The elder Schott towered above every other man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giants in " Rhein-gold . " Eddie 's first remembrance was sitting in a little summer-house in the back yard at twilight , listening to his father running up and down the scales on his horn . He had held his breath in taut wonder at a father who could shake the sound out of anything so monstrous and gleaming . Night after night he used to sit thus beside his father , listening , until his mother would come and lead him away to bed . At that moment Anton Schott would cease his pulling for an instant . He would cease his puffing and put a caressing hand on his son 's head and say : " When you grow up big , like poppa ? you play a horn , too ! Yes ? " It was a daring prophecy , and Eddie thrilled to it . He thought about it as he climbed the stairs to his bedroom ; he thought about it as he said his prayers ; he was still thinking about it as he dropped off to sleep , the sound of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as Eddie was big enough his father held the horn to his son 's lips , laughing at the feeble notes like the faintly raucous chirp of a raven 's fledgling , that it emitted . " See , mama , how he makes a sound ! " Anton would call to his wife . But Mrs. Schott would shake her head and say : " He is too little yet . " " Now , maybe , he is too little . But wait until lie grows up big like poppa ! " Eddie grew up , but not " big like poppa . " The forebears of Mrs. Schott , who had been tailors , had had a hand in shaping the destiny of Anton Schott 's son . But Anton never for a moment acknowledged it . He insisted on pretending that some day his son wouldcome into a deferred physical heritage . He never for a moment admitted that the blood of tailors could thwart a long line of brewers and produce a Schott who would be anything short of six feet , with appropriate girth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brewery wagon , in the ranks of sharpshooters marching to weekly practice ; and not only marching to practice , but , like himself , overtopping everybody by virtue of height and bulk and a gigantic horn . It was to this end that he at first held the horn to Eddie 's lips and later let the weight of it almost crush the narrow shoulders , until Mrs. Schott would protest and say : " Poppa ! for shame ! He is too little , yet ! " Anton Schott 's reply was always the same . " Now , maybe ! . . . But wait until he grows up big like poppa ! " Anton Schott died when Eddie was nineteen . Even in the face of his son 's scant hundred and twenty-five pounds and a job in an insurance office , the head of the Schott family went to his reward in the hope that some day Eddie would grow up big . His only legacy to Eddie was his horn . The ranks of the sharpshooters were dwindling . They sent a delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the band ? There could be only one answer to such a question . A family with a tradition to maintain must strain every nerve to keep its pennant flying . Eddie accepted . He managed , somehow , to stagger under the weight of his father 's horn to the weekly shooting fests ; he managed , somehow , to make the horn heard above the blare of trumpets and the clashing of cymbals . But he knew in his heart that he was a feeble artist . There was nothing grand about his performance . Then , one day , a surprise came . A business associate for whom Eddie had done a rare turn said to him one day over a plate of shrimps in the California Market , " I hear you play the bass horn . Would you like to join the Gaiety Club 's band ? " The Gaiety Club 's band ! The Gaiety Club that had dinners for John Barry-more and luncheons for President Hoover and suppers for Maurice Chevalier ! The Gaiety Club that in its day had entertained Rudyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would he join the Gaiety Club 's band ? Would he ! .. . His heart pounded until he thought the nonchalant friend sitting across the table would hear it . That night when he told the family his voice shook a little . Mama said : " The Gaiety Club . . no , I have never heard of it ! " But Lena , the elder sister , knew . " Of course you know about the Gaiety Club , mama . Do n't you remember , where Tillie Edelman 's husband used to wait on table ? " " Oh , " cried Mrs. Schott , " but that is a grand place ! Only millionaires belong to that club . " Eddie explained : if you were an artist it cost you little or nothing . It cost you even less than it did to belong to the Sehtitzenverein . An artist ? Mama thought only in terms of paint brush and palette in connection with that word . Eddie explained again : if you played a horn you were likewise an artist . " So ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart . And would he continue to play the horn for the Schiitzenverein ? Mama , do n't be silly ! " cried Lena . Later he heard Lena and Elsie talking it over in the kitchen as they washed the dishes . " They 'll have ladies ' nights , " said Lena . " How do you know ? " asked Elsie . " Because clubs like that always do . " " You mean we can go ? " " Why not ? We 're ladies , I hope ! " " They 'll be a lot of swell fellows there , " said Elsie . " Sure ! " replied Lena . There was a note of confidence , of hope in their voices . Eddie smiled to himself . It was some time before Eddie Schott became a member of the Gaiety Club . There were tiresome preliminaries : his name to be proposed , sponsors to be rounded up , the intent posted on the club bulletin board . Eddie continued to walk in his father 's footsteps to target practice and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had lost interest and he could see they had , too . Assuming a bored air , Lena and Elsie sat out most of the dances . " There 's an awful common crowd getting in here , " Lena used to say scornfully . Eddie knew better . He knew that it was n't the crowd that had changed . He had moments of fear during these weeks of waiting . Suppose somebody at the Gaiety Club blackballed him ? Suppose they found somebody more prominent who could play the horn ? He dreamed one night that this had happened He dreamed that the man chosen in his stead to play the bass horn was Lindbergh . The dream was so ridiculous that it reassured him . But he was still nervous . Not so much on his own account , but because he could see what store his sisters were setting on the hope of an enlarged horizon . As a matter of fact , he was not far behind them in this . He used to find himself building up a bright and shining new world on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making valuable connections , rising materially , artistically , socially . But these moments of elation were often succeeded by a blue funk . Meanwhile the business associate who had proposed his name moved to New York . Eddie Schott was in despair . But he said nothing of this to his sisters . And then one day a letter came telling him that he had been elected to the Gaiety Club and would he report the next Friday evening for band practice ? Without waiting another moment he sat down and wrote his resignation to the Schtitzenverein . There began now for Eddie Schott a life of swaggering deception . Outwardly he clothed his humor in a scarlet cloak , but his heart was leaden . Every Friday night he went diligently to rehearsal , bearing his slight shoulders erect as he passed the front porches of his neighbors . " There goes Eddie to the Gaiety Club ! " he knew they were saying as he went by . The thought of his importance in their eyes thrilled him past the boundary line of the neighborhood . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For only he knew what an empty honor this membership in the Gaiety Club had proved to be . What he hated most was to encounter a friend going citywards who would say : " The big night , eh , Eddie ? .. . Gee , I 'll bet you have a swell time . Gee , bet there 's a swell bunch belong to that club ! . . . Were you there the night they had Charlie Chaplin up from Hollywood ? " Sure , he had a swell time . Sure , there was a swell bunch belonged . Sure , he had been there the night they had had Charlie Chaplin up from Hollywood . Had n't the band played that night ? Whenever the band played Eddie was all right . He could hide under his flaming horn . But when rehearsal or the band 's part in a program were over his agony began . He would stand watching the company break up into groups , drifting toward the smoking room , into the bar , clustering around the supper table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as theypassed . Not " Hello , old scout ! " Not " Hello , you big stiff ! " Not " Hello , Eddie ! " but just " Hello , Schott , " leaving him staring wistfully after them . He would stand in the reception hall watching them , until the last group had settled upon their diversion . Then he would turn away , hesitating between a quick departure or a forlorn extension of his torment . At this point the hat boy usually settled the issue for him by saying , " Going out , Mr. Schott ? " bustling toward his hat without even waiting for a reply . The hat boy knew ! And that was an added humiliation . One night lie found himself blurting out to the hat hoy , " Sure I 'm going ! Nothing to do around this dump if you do n't know the bunch . " " Oh , well , Mr. Schott , it takes time ! " the boy had said soothingly . " Wait till you go up to the summer encampment . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hope . Naturally , he 'd get to know the bunch better then , sleeping and eating and drinking with them . He had n't thought much about the summer encampment before . Now his mind was filled with it . As the time drew near items began to appear in the daily papers . A Chief Justice was coming way from Washington to camp out with the Gaiety Club ; Paderewski would be among those present ; there was a rumor that Commander Byrd might attend . Lena and Elsie read these accounts aloud to mama . " Just think , " said mama , " all those swell people ! My , but Eddie is lucky ! " " He 's lucky , sure ! But what about us ? We have n't been to a dance since Eddie resigned from the Schtitzenverein , " said Lena . " Yes , how about that , Eddie ? " asked Elsie . " Ai n't they ever going to have a ladies ' night ? " " Sure . . . some day . " THE FALSE TALISMAN 529 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I read about it in the paper . " " That was n't much , " replied Eddie . " It was just a string quartet . You would n't have liked it . " " You might have asked us ! " snapped Lena . " I guess Eddie 's ashamed of his sisters . I guess we 're not swell enough , " threw out Elsie . " For shame ! " cried mama . " Is that nice ? " " Ca n't you wait ? " bellowed Eddie . " Do n't you understand ? You ca n't rush things like that . . . . I ai n't been inviting anybody to a ladies ' night until 1 get better acquainted . " " You 've belonged for six months now ! " observed Lena . " Six months ! Six ' months ! " repeated Eddie with biting sarcasm . " What of it . Do you think a fellow gets to know over a thousand members in six months ? Besides , it ai n't a place where you kick in overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've just been making myself solid . I 've just been attending to my business . It ai n't a place for fresh guys ! " " Sure , " soothed mama . " Eddie 's right ! " The girls shamefacedly dropped their glances . " I know what I 'm about , " went on Eddie , following up his advantage . " I 'm waiting until I go up to the encampment . That 's where you get to know , the members . After I get back from that I 'll invite you over to every ladies ' night on the calendar . You 'll get sick of ' ern ! " " Do you suppose , " asked Elsie humbly , " that you 'll meet Paderewski or Byrd up there ? " " I do n't know why not ! " Eddie tossed back valiantly . " My ! My ! " said mama . " Your father was right , Eddie . Many a time when you were little I used to say , Eddie ai n't for the horn , poppa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . . Where would you have been , now , if it had n't been for that horn ? See what it did for you ? Poppa was always right , Eddie . " " Will you invite us to the first ladies ' night after the encampment ? " demanded Lena . " Sure ! " " Now , remember , that 's a promise ! " " I wo n't forget , " said Eddie . But already he felt a misgiving . A week before the encampment the females of the Schott household were in a flutter , getting Eddie 's things together . Lena skillfully mended a hole in his white sweater and knitted him some socks to wear with his hiking boots . Elsie made a new case out of bright green flannel for the horn . Mama washed out two pairs of blankets with her own hands . " Mama , you 're a card ! " said Eddie . " Washing blankets to go camping with ! " " Well , ai n't you in a tent with somebody ? " countered mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came from with dirty blankets ? " " Who do you think you 'll be with ? " asked Lena . Eddie shrugged his shoulders . " Would n't it be swell if you were in the same tent with Lindbergh ? " " Lindbergh ai n't going . It 's Byrd . " " Well , an aviator  --  it 's all the same . " " I 'd rather be in the tent with Paderewski ! " said Elsie . Even mania laughed at this . Elsie blushed . " I do n't care , I would ! " Eddie let the subject drop . It was n't necessary to tell these women of his modest hopes for tent companions . He gathered that the band had an enclosure of its own at the camping grounds . This meant that his tent mates would be members of the band . Sometimes he speculated vaguely just who they would be . But , for the most part , he was content in the mere thought of close companionship with any of them . You could n't be a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shaving cream , lending them your roll of adhesive tape , throwing a pillow at them when they snored , without achieving friendship . It was this hope that buoyed him up past even the chill of the morning of departure . At the train the usual groups were forming when he arrived upon the scene , his horn done up in its new green case . " Hello , Schott . " They nodded at him and passed on . He swung aboard the first coach and seated himself , holding his horn awkwardly between his knees . Perhaps if there were a crowd he 'd have a companion sharing the vacant seat beside him . But there was no such luck . Ah , well , it would n't be long now ! Laughter , conviviality , wisecracking . Cries of " Hello Bill ! " " Hello Charlie ! " " Look who 's here ! " " How about a little game ? " The differentiation among males , especially en masse , is slight if Eddie had closed his eyes he might have fancied himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men about him was as thin as the tissue panels of a Japanese house . With one bold gesture he might have smashed through to them . But Eddie Schott had no bold gestures . He put the horn , finally , on the seat beside him . It towered magnificently in its bright green flannel case like a green dragon guarding its prey . The engine started up , the crackle of explosive conversation fell to the level of the train 's rhythmic hum . Eddie Schott looked out the window . Brown hills flecked with the green of canyons flew by . Rose-covered cottages . Trim back yards . A marsh . The mill country again . Vineyards climbing up the hillsides . The flash of a river . Evergreens . The smell of a forest . This must be like the Rhine country that his father had always talked of . A curious nostalgia seized Eddie , something that had nothing to do with the present . He used to feel it sometimes walking the paved streets to the shooting park , as the trumpets blared out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar landscape through a mist . A longing that was half pain , half sweetness , enveloped him . . . . There was a scraping sound and a bump . Men were collecting their traps . They had arrived ! Eddie , struggling under the weight of his horn , dropped off the coach on to the redwood platform . An early morning mist from the sea had cleared , leaving a noontime blueness in the sky . Contagious happiness was in the air . Eddie suddenly felt light-hearted . " Hey , there , fellows ! Get out your horns and give us a tune ! " The band boys slipped their instruments out of their cases , the bass drum began to pound , the leader lifted his walking stick . " Forward ! March ! " Down the dusty road they went , toward the beckoning green of the forest . Behind , trailed stock brokers , captains of industry , millionaires , painters , sculptors , singers , actors , writers with all the abandon of ragamuffins following a circus . " Do , oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm your man and I love you best of all ! " they chanted . Eddie puffed and blew with the vigor of a recaptured happiness . What ever had made him think that these men were different from others ? Already his heart had warmed to them . The hat boy had been right : the summer encampment ! That 's where you made friends ! The cool shadows of darkly green trees fell upon them , the smell of willows blew from the river , the incense from the dying embers of a camp-fire floated up to heaven . The band came to a stop in a circular clearing . " How dry I am ! How dry I am ! " the band wailed . Cheers . Laughter . This was the life ! " Now , then , fellows , let 's get set ! " Away marched the band between rows of gay tents to its own stockade . A huddle of tents surrounded an open space piled high with dunnage bags that had come up the previous day . Eddie pulled out his bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speculations did not continue for long . It was plain to be seen that there was no procedure . Apparently everyone just picked out his own quarters and settled himself . Eddie dragged his bag about , the circle in a search for a place to light . He found a tent finally that had not yet been appropriated with four cots in it . This struck him as just right . He liked the idea of three companions : friendship might not strike fire with a single tent-mate . He opened his dunnage bag , took out his clean blankets , made up one of the cots . Then he distributed his toilet articles on the little pine table by his bed . Lena had bought him a fresh tube of shaving cream , and Elsie had provided tooth paste and a new tooth brush . He was whistling softly . He felt himself standing on the threshold of a profound happiness . Suddenly a puff of cloud blew across his content : Where were his tent-mates ? Was n't anybody going to join him ? . . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chow ! " yelled everybody in chorus . He joined the hungry throng as they ran down a shaded road to the dining tables . He ate hurriedly . He wanted to return to camp and finish unpacking ! Eddie had a trim mind . A group of band boys were standing before his tent when he got back . His heart quickened . It looked as if he were going to have companions , after all . " Hello , Schott ! " they said warmly as he came up to them . " Hello , " he answered . He stepped jauntily into the tent , heartened by the note of cordiality in their greeting . It was extraordinary what a sense of assurance he felt in just the fact of having his quarters secured . He turned to them . " Did n't see you on the train . " The group glanced at one another uneasily . " We drove up , " said one of them . " Looking for a place to park yourself ? " Eddie threw out brightly with the air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we were at that . " The speaker hesitated . " You see , we always have had this tent  --  just the four of us . We have it every year . " Eddie looked at them . " You mean ? " " You know how it is . It 's just kind of been ours . We 're  --  we 're just kind of used to it . " Eddie gulped . " Sure , I understand ! " He turned away and began gathering up his shaving implements . " Here , there , we 'll give you a hand . " " Oh  --  oh , that 's all right ! . . . I guess perhaps I better find another place before I " " No hurry ! lust take your time . .. . You understand , old man . We would n't put you out for the world . I mean , if it makes any difference ? " " No , it does n't make any difference . One place is as good as another , I guess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every cot seemed taken . He was returning to pack up his dunnage bag and await developments when he met the band-leader coming back from lunch . " Hello , Schott . All set ? " Eddie explained . The band-leader went over the ground with him . " Everything 's taken , " said the bandleader as they peered into the last tent . " Well , that 's too bad . We 've been overcrowded for two or three years . Guess we 'll have to find you a place down by the gate . The Club has some tents down there to take care of the overflows . help you carry your things . " " Oh , that 's all right ! " " Hell , no ! Here , I 'll carry the bag . You bring the blankets . " The band-leader led the way , Eddie followed . They came to a dozen tents strung out in a row , near a clump of young firs down by the entrance to the encampment . " Take your pick , " said the bandmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's two cots in every tent , " went on the other . " But these do n't fill up much , except for the last night maybe . You 'll probably be in luck . You 'll probably have it all to yourself . Looks comfortable , does n't it ? " " Sure , ? said Eddie . " It looks swell . " " So long . Hope everything 's O.K. If you want anything , holler ! " " Thanks , " said Eddie . He heard the band-master whistling a gay tune . He sat down on one of the cots . An afternoon breeze was moving sadly through the trees . Eddie buried his face in a pillow . The band-master was right : Eddie had the tent to himself . For the most part , he had the entire section to himself . Occasionally a stray member , arriving late , set himself up in one of the tents for the night , but by morning he would discover friends who carried him away to their enclosure . Sometimes Eddie wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Go home and face Lena and Elsie and mama and the neighbors ? No , that was inconceivable ! There were moments of elation between miseries . Whenever the band swung down to greet an incomingtrain Eddie 's heart grew light . At evening around the crackling campfire , listening to songs and stories , he forgot his loneliness . The men who sang and told tales were a distinguished breed , the listeners not far behind . Eddie used to feel a thrill in these contacts . Just imagine the son of Anton Schott who used to drive a brewery wagon sitting at the feet of the mighty ! No wonder the family and the neighbors were proud of him ! At the mess table he basked in the transient friendliness of males growling out good nature under the spell of repletion . " Hey , Schott , throw me a biscuit ! " " What 's the matter there , Bass Horn , got a mortgage on the canned cow ? " " Come on , Dutch , give a guy a chance at the maple syrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadvertent intimacies raised ! Once a distinguished tenor from the Metropolitan asked him for a cigarette . " Thanks , old man ! " the singer purred , bending over to take Eddie 's proffered light . Eddie glowed for an hour . But when the procession to and from the train was over , when the camp-fire was ended , when the mess table broke up  --  profound despairs unrolled themselves . In twos , in threes , in knots of a half dozen the Gaiety Club strolled away to the devices of fellowship . In his secret soul Eddie Schott knew that he might join them if he but had the courage . One step over the borderline of his diffidence and he might achieve paradise . But a thread of cowardice held him back . In the mornings he strolled down to the river 's brim and talked a while with the attendant at the diving float ; in the afternoon he wandered in solitary aimlessness over the trails , listening to the laughter from the gay enclosures , at night be went back to his tent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose letters of resignation from the Gaiety Club band . Whom should he address ? the secretary of the Club , or the bandmaster ? Should he be brief or write at length , with a flourish ? How would they answer him ? When despair reached its lowest ebb a rising tide of hope would set in . They might insist on his staying ! They might pass resolutions , telling how invaluable he had been to them . . . . If this mood persisted long enough he would fall asleep . But when he awoke at daybreak to the raucous clamor of bluejays he was filled with despair again . How was he to get through the day ? And once more a circle of thorned thoughts would press down upon him . Resign ! Resign ! No . He knew that he could n't . He knew that he lacked the courage . He felt himself caught in a net from which there was no escape . Suddenly it was all over . Eddie found himself rolling up his blankets , rushing back through forest and vineyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward home . It was early evening and the neighbors were taking their Sunday ease out of doors . " Hello , Eddie ! " " Well , look who 's here ! " " How 's it feel to hobnob with the big guys ? " " I 'll bet you had a swell time ! " Lena and Elsie and mama running out to meet him . " Say , but you look great ! All tanned up and everything ! " " Why did n't you write ? We were kinda worried ! " " Hush , Elsie ! Did n't he send a postcard ? Poppa never did any writing when he was having a swell time ! " " Was Paderewski there ? " " Or Byrd ? " " Gee , I 'll bet you met a Iot of swell fellows ! " " Come on , tell us all about it ! " " Hush , Lena ! Ca n't you see he 's tired ? Wait till he has something to eat ! " Roast duckling , noodles , red cabbage , applecake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table was cleared away . " Now , tell us  --  give us all the news ! " " Not now , Elsie ! Ca n't you see he 's sleepy ? You girls got all next week to hear about it . " In his own room again , before the open window . In the dusk the summer house where Anton Schott had held the horn to Eddie 's lips in the long summer evenings . " Wait until you grow up big like poppa ! " Lena knocking at his door . " Eddie ! Eddie ! How soon before the next ladies ' night ? " " How should I know ? " " Well , you better find out . Elsie and I want to know . We want to make ourselves some new dresses . " " New dresses ? What for ? " " Do n't you think we want to look nice before your swell friends ? " A door opening  --  mama 's voice drifting down the hall . " What 's the matter with you , girls ? Ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about ladies ' night . " Ladies ' night ! . . . He had forgotten all about ladies ' night . He 'd better resign . He 'd write his resignation to-morrow ! The resignation , like the to-morrow for which it was scheduled , never was achieved . But the ladies ' night was accomplished . Eddie had hoped he might postpone this agony , too , but Lena read a preliminary announcement of it in the society columns of the newspaper : The members of the Gaiety Club will entertain their women friends at an informal concert next Tuesday evening . Moving pictures of the last encampment will be shown . " Women friends ! " echoed Lena . " What a funny way to put it ! " " What 's funny about it ? " snapped Eddie . " Women ? . . . They 're ladies , ai n't they ? " " Are you in any of the moving pictures ? " asked Elsie . " I du n no . I guess so ! " " Tuesday night . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , " said mama . " You go down to-morrow and get the goods . It wo n't take long . " The blood of tailors flowed in mama 's veins . There was nothing she liked to do better than cut out a dress . And her sewing ! Nobody could beat her sewing . Eddie saw that he was in for it . " Maybe mama would like to go , too . " Mama shook her head . " No , it ai n't for old people . You take Lena and Elsie . Your friends do n't want to meet mama . You take the girls and have a good time . " " Will they serve refreshments ? " asked Elsie . " I suppose so , " answered Eddie . " I wonder will the names of those who go be in the paper , " speculated Lena . " Five or six hundred names ! " scoffed Eddie . " Just the prominent ones , I guess , " sighed Elsie . But Eddie could see the gleam of hope in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , speculation . Should the dresses touch , the ground or just escape the ankle ? Should they wear gloves ? And what about hats ? Eddie could tell his sisters nothing . He had never been so exasperating . " Do n't bother Eddie ! " finally cried mama . " Ca n't you read what to wear in the Sunday paper ? " When Tuesday night arrived and the girls were dressed and ready , Eddie felt a surge of pride . They did look pretty in their flowered frocks ! Would n't it be funny if these sisters ofhis broke the ice for him ? He began to go over in his mind to whom he 'd introduce them . The bandmaster , of course , and maybe the president of the Club , and most of the band boys . He 'd have an excuse for approaching them , now . " Like to have you meet my sisters . " He could see the possibilities . The band was n't playing to-night . It was to be an orchestral concert . But in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn . Eddie had been pressed into service . He was glad of this . It made him feel important . He went down the neighborhood street carrying his horn with a feeling of real elation . In the twilight came the usual calls of recognition . " Well , the whole Schott family stepping out to-night , eh ? " " Sure ! " called back the girls . " We 're going to the Gaiety Club . Ladies ' night ! " " You do n't say ! .. . Some people have all the luck ! " The phrase off-stage for the bass horn was in the last nurnher . Eddie stood in the wings and heard the polite handclapping of the audience . The leader of the orchestra took a bow and made an announcement : as the audience passed out they would find refreshments being served in the Founders ' Room . He hoped the ladies would honor the Club by staying for a social hour . Eddie went down some back stairs to the hat room and left his horn . Then he ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lena and Elsie . The concert hall was on the second floor , and a broad staircase led down from it . Eddie saw a dense mass of people moving slowly . Smart women bare of shoulder and barer of back , heads immaculately coiffured , lips rouged , eyebrows plucked to significant curves . His heart beat a little uneasily . He felt instinctively that his sisters were no match for this assembly . He had found them seats for the concert up in front , which meant that now their chances for a swift exit were blocked . The Founders ' Room was filling up . It was completely packed before Lena and Elsie hove in sight . They looked a little pathetic in their cheap homemade dresses that had seemed so grand only a few hours before . " You 'll have to wait , " warned Eddie , as they came up to him . " Maybe we 'd better go right home , " suggested Elsie . It was just what Eddie would have liked to do , but he scoffed bravely : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute ! " " You was n't in any of the moving pictures , " said Lena , a little accusingly . Eddie made no reply . " You heard what that man back of us was saying , " put in Elsie . She turned to Eddie . " He said that a lot of the pictures got spoiled . The heat or something . " " Yes , so I heard , " lied Eddie . " I told mama we should have had our dresses longer , " said Lena , as a hipless lady trailed a billow of cream colored lace across the thick carpets . " They 're all wearing corsets , " said Elsie . " I guess we made a mistake getting figured goods , " sighed Lena . " You see , " said Elsie , " the Sunday paper was all wrong . " Eddie felt that he must say something . " What 's the matter with your dresses ? They look swell to me . " " Men do n't know anything about such things ! " threw back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Founders ' Room and calling for cabs or their limousines . " They could n't have been very hungry , " exclaimed Elsie . " Sh-h-h ! " warned Lena . " It ai n't polite to eat much at a place like this . " " I guess we 'd better go in now , " suggested Eddie . They pushed their way into the crowded room . " You wait here . I 'll go get you some punch . " Eddie fought his way toward the refreshment table . It took him fully ten minutes to return with a tray of half-filled punch glasses . Lena and Elsie sipped their punch with devastating gentility . A waiter passed with sandwiches and small cakes . The girls each took a lady finger . Eddie drank a gulp or two of punch , craning his neck in a pretense of looking for his friends . " It 's awful hard to find anybody in a crowd like this , " he apologized . " Either that or the band boys have beat it . " Elsie gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be going . " " It 's only ten-thirty , " responded Eddie weakly . " It will he twelve before we get home , " said Lena . Well , whatever you girls say . " He went to the hat room and got his horn ; it had never seemed so heavy . They rode down on a street car to the Ferry . " I 'm afraid , " said Eddie , " you girls did n't have a very good time ! " " Oh , " cried Elsie , " we had a swell time " That was awful good punch ! " said Lena . " And the music was grand ! We could hear your horn in that last number so plain ! " It was sweet to have them lie like that but it hurt , too . He almost wished that they had crabbed . " Well , another time maybe it wo n't be so crowded . . . . I mean , there may be a better chance to meet the boys . Next time I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out and downstairs quicker . " An ominous silence met this observation , and then Lena spoke . " It was swell and all that but I guess you 've got to know the crowd . I mean , you ca n't just meet them two or three times a year and get anywhere . " " You 've got to sort of belong , I guess , " nodded Elsie . By this time they had reached the Ferry . They walked leisurely aboard the boat . " You girls better sit upstairs , " said Eddie . " I want to stay down on the lower deck and smoke . " There was a moment of hesitation . Then the girls exchanged significant glances . " All right , " said Lena . Somehow they knew that he wanted to be alone . And that hurt , too . Eddie walked through the lower cabin to the forward deck . A biting wind had sprung up and the waters of the bay were dancing about in a sable frenzy . Eddie laid his horn down upon the starboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words kept ringing in his ears : You 've got to sort of belong . He 'd known this , of course , but he 'd never put it into words . He 'd been afraid to put it into words . Had he ever belonged to anything ? He wondered . The Schutzenverein had accepted him because he was the son of his father . Besides , he had played the bass horn . The Gaiety Club had not even known his father but they knew the legacy that his father had bequeathed him . . . . " Where would you have been , now , if it had n't been for that horn ? " mama was always saying . She saidthat , now . But the remonstrance she made in those dim days when poppa used to Jet the weight of the horn crush him was nearer to the point : " Eddie ai n't for the horn , poppa ! . . He ai n't big enough ! " Mama had been a prophet , in those days , had she but known it . Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to sort of belong . . . . Women knew . You could n't fool women ! A sudden lurch of the boat sent the horn skidding close to the rail 's edge . Eddie clutched it in panic . A deck hand who had been mopping up came over and trailed his soiled mop on a length of rope into the cleansing waters . The boat lurched again . " Better look out ! " said the deck hand . " You 'll be losing that horn of yours overboard if you 're not careful ! " A chill shook Eddie . His heart beat violently ! Did he dare ? " Look out ! " cried the deck hand . " There she comes again ! " A wave broke over the bow and slapped Eddie 's cheek ; the boat shivered and dipped . " There ! I told you you 'd lose that horn ! " Eddie turned and faced the deck hand . He was smiling . " It does n't matter , " he said coolly . " I was through with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper cabin . A weight had been lifted from his shoulders . He felt like a man in a tale who had forever cast away a false talisman.
