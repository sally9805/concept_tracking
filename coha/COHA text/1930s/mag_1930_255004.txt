Last week , after 19 years of distinguished service , Contralto Margarete Matzenauer let it be known that she was through at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House . Wanting no floral wreaths , no testimonial speeches , she saved her farewell announcement until after her last performance , gave then as a cause the fact that in recent years she had been allotted only secondary roles. + Unlike Sopranos Frances Alda and Amelita Galli-Curci who have also retired this season from the Metropolitan ( TIME , Nov. 25 , Jan. 27 ) , Contralto Matzenauer made no valedictory statement on the decadence of opera . Instead she referred to it as an art which " with variations will remain for all time . " <P> +Most contralto roles are secondary . Contralto Matzenauer was perturbed because the Metropolitan management would not revive for her Samson et Dalila and Le Prophte , two of the few operas with contralto leads .
