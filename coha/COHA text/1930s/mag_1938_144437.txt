If the Democrats re-elect a Governor in Pennsylvania this fall he will probably control 72 votes at the next Democratic National Convention , might easily have the deciding say on who got the Presidential nomination . That is the biggest piece of the political booty over which Keystone State Democrats , having despoiled the Republicans in 1934 , continued to gouge , rabbit-punch and foul each other last week , with the May 17 primary just 20 days away . <P> Attorney General Charles Joseph Margiotti is running independently for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and , feeling a bit like a wall flower with no one slinging any dirt in his direction , he started slinging on his own . Candidate Margiotti charged that Philadelphia 's Contractor-Boss Matthew H. McCloskey and Secretary of State David Lawrence in 1935 obtained a $20,000 bribe for supporting legislation favorable to Pennsylvania brewers . Although Mr. Margiotti solemnly declared that the voters should not think for a moment that his old friend Governor George Howard Earle III had anything to do with the matter , the Governor could hardly overlook the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Senatorial nomination . Whereupon he summoned the accuser to the brownstone executive mansion in Harrisburg , ordered Mr. Margiotti to shortcut his projected grand jury investigation and dump all the evidence in the Governor 's ample lap . When the indignant Attorney General declined to do so , only naming the man supposed to have passed the bribe , Candidate Earle fired Candidate Margiotti . Out with him , by discharge or resignation , went two of his deputies , his publicity man , and his secretary , Miss Mary Jane Peach .
