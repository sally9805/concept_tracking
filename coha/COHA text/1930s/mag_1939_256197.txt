Most publicized jockey of the year is cocky little Don Meade . Reinstated last December by the Florida Racing Commission after a three-year suspension for betting against his own mounts , Jockey Meade , 1933 Kentucky Derby winner , made a sensational comeback this winter , booted home 91 winners at Hialeah and Tropical Park . Last week , while penitent Mr. Meade made headlines because of his successful plea for a riding license on the " big apple " ( New York tracks ) , an obscure fellow-peewee named Johnny Oros quietly displaced him as the leading jockey of 1939 . <P> Considered by some turf experts the most promising young rider since Earl Sande hung up his tack , 17-year-old Johnny Oros did not grow up on horseback , like most jockeys . Until four years ago the nearest he came to a horse was the shanks ' mare on which he used to deliver groceries for his father 's little emporium in Aurora , Ill . When Father Oros decided to trade his grocery store for a stable of third-rate thoroughbreds , Johnny learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first winner-at the Aurora race track . This winter , still an " apprentice , " he outrode his most experienced rivals at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans , then moved on to Bowie to lead the field there as well . Last week , on closing day at Bowie , Jockey Oros put on as exciting a show for Maryland racegoers as Don Meade had ever given Hialeah patrons . With a leg up on six mounts , he won three races ( including the Daily Double ) , finished in the money with the other three . His triple brought lis string of victories to 105 since January 1-14 more than Meade , his nearest competitor . <P> Hailed last week as the " Aurora Flash " and sought as a contract rider , baby-faced Johnny Oros , as bashful and unsophisticated as Don Meade is arrogant and wise , rebelled at his first interview . " Aw shucks , " said he . " There ai n't any mystery about me or my riding . I do n't use no special tricks . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just sit up there and hang on . "
