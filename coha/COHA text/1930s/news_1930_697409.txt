txt On his statement to the special Grand Jury of the law governing its investigations Governor ROOSEVELT is in full accord with Justice McCOOK and the Attorney General 's office . Having " obviously concluded " its labors in connection with the " Ewald case " by bringing indictments against those alleged to have been concerned in the purchase of a particular magisterial office , the extraordinary Grand Jury may not : 1 . Go afield on District Leader HEALY 'S trail in cosec ion with the American Book Company . 2 . Proceed with an inquiry into the alleged Ewald-April-Badger transaction . 3 . Cross the path of Judge SEABURY 'S investigation on behalf of the Appellate Division into conditions in the magistrates ' courts . 4 . Obtain a general extension of its scope of inquiry ( thus blotting out the regular , county Grand Jury ) without presenting evidence to the Governor to support its request . Yet the Grand Jury may , and this could be of real importance , look into violations of the statutes concerning the elective franchise , especially those dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Attorney General must find the money for this inquiry , if it is to be pursued , " but that is a matter between " himself and the legislative and " executive authorities of New York " City . " Also , if the Grand Jury has evidence to sustain its belief that its powers should be extended , the Governor expresses willingness to receive and consider it . Thus the door is left partly open . The Chief Executive of New York , who writes that " corruption in any " form is intolerable and corruption " in public office is especially ab " horrent , " has a reputation which gives his words the ring of truth . His declaration that " corrupt officials must be driven from office " also is the echo of a sincere personal feeling . But he has no legal doubt that the special Grand Jury should not trench upon the work of the regular county Grand Jury or the Seabury inquiry . The ? latter is broad enough to cover all judicial misfeasance , and , as Counsel KRESEL has said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial proceeding and no immunity is provided . The Governor 's political situation and his personal instincts preclude giving , against legal precedents , more power to an Attorney General of the other party who has countenanced a continued repetition in the press of the general vague rumor affecting the integrity of our Supreme Court bench , but has not sent me one single scrap of evidence or even an official communication , nor has he at any time made any request for the extension of his powers . It is clear that Governor ROOSEVELT believes that a well-meaning Grand Jury has been made use of by politicians plotting his defeat . It is also clear that he expects criticism for his refusal to extend its powers , for he writes : " The fact " that a Governor may be a target " of those seeking political office at any price does not alter the situa " tion . " The next move is for the Attorney General and the Grand Jury , with the Governor pledged to act decisively and affirmatively on presentation of real evidence . Mean- while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRAIN has his regular Grand Jury to deal with charges and complaints .
