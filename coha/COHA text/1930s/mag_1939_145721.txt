Jones trip 6 to Seattle : Plane 66 testing on frequencies 3147.5 . . . . <P> Seattle to Jones trip 6 : OK , the correct time is 8:25 p. m . Seattle barometer 29.83 . United proceeds only with safety . <P> Thus began the radio log of United Air Lines ' Trip 6-Seattle to San Diego , Calif. - on the rainy night of November 28 , 1938 . Nine hours later Co-Pilot Lloyd E. Jones was dead , drowned in the surf off Point Reyes , near Oakland . So were the stewardess and three of the four passengers . The ship , a Douglas DC-3 , out of gas , off its course and miserably mismanaged by its First Pilot Charles B. Stead , was a wave-washed wreck . <P> Last week crash experts of the Air Safety Board turned over to the Civil Aeronautics Authority their official report of the loss of U. A. L. 's Trip 6 . It was the most damning official criticism of plane and ground crews in U. S. airline history . It also recommended unprecedented penal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's explanation was that he got lost because sunspot activity caused radio " long skip . " made remote radio stations drown out ranges on his course ( TIME , Dec. 12 ) . The hard-headed experts of the Air Safety Board summarily laid the crash down to a mounting series of fantastic bungles , found no support for his explanation . <P> Trip 6 got away safely from Medford , Ore . after midnight , with seven radio ranges , their beams running in four quadrants , to guide him to Oakland . But at Medford , Stead had already made his first blunder . He failed to fill his gasoline tanks . From Medford , on instruments , against a heavy headwind and an hour behind schedule , he went down the south leg of the Fort Jones range , passed the Red Bluff localizer , reported that the Sacramento range was drowning out the Williams beam ( which ground stations reported was operating without interference ) . Then , for almost an hour , Trip 6 was silent . <P> Oakland to Stead-Trip 6 not heard . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . <P> Elko to Stead-not heard . <P> Oakland East and North-SUSPEND ALL TRAFFIC EXCEPT SHIP TO GROUND . <P> Finally , at 3:03 a. m . Stead called Oakland , asked to be told where the north leg of the Fresno range intersected the northeast leg of the Oakland range . <P> Oakland to Stead : One minute . . . vicinity of Fairfield ( about 35 miles northeast of Oakland ) . <P> Stead to Oakland : Definitely on northeast leg . <P> The Oakland dispatcher breathed easier . If Stead was where he said he was , he should be landing in 15 minutes . But troubles were piling up for the husky oldtime ( 8,650 hours ) pilot like ice on a wing in a freezing rain . On he flew , but heard no cone of silence from the radio range which would have told him he was over Oakland , and Oakland heard nothing from him . Oakland waited . <P> Oakland to Stead : Oakland ceiling 2200 . . . visibility 20 miles . <P> Oakland to Medford : How much fuel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oakland : No fuel on at Medford . <P> Then Oakland , thoroughly alarmed , heard from Stead . " Something must be wrong with the Oakland range , " he said . With only 60 gallons of gas left , he reported : " Do n't know exactly where I am. "
