Out from Charleston Harbor this week chugged the sleek 72-ft. auxiliary schooner Indra , bound down the Atlantic coast to the Caribbean . Each of the crew of six boys who manned the Indra had paid $1,500 for the privilege of rigging her sails , holystoning her decks , polishing her brass every morning until June . When they return they will be examined , not as Able Seamen but by the College Entrance Examination Board . <P> At the wheel of this unique U. S. preparatory school was its Headmaster William McDonnell Pond . A blond , sturdy , fortyish Harvardman , until three years ago Headmaster Pond ran the Pond School in Cambridge , Mass , to tutor boys for Harvard . He and his wife Augusta May both liked to sail , used to take Pond pupils for weekend cruises aboard their small schooner , Gulmare , once asked a boatload of them if they would like to work aboard for a full week . They did , liked it so well that they asked their parents for enough money to sail down the Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their College Boards with flying colors Headmaster Pond bought the Indra , soon set his school afloat for good . <P> This year the Indra will cruise comfortably about the West Indies , drop anchor off Yucatan and Venezuela for shore trips . Last year Headmaster Pond and pupils landed in Haiti , were promptly invited to a Governor 's Ball . On board Mrs. Pond watches over the health of her charges , supervises the cook , only professional member of the crew . The Indra stays at anchor every morning until the pupils have finished their reading and recitations . Seaman Pond does not stand in awe of College Boards . Says he : " Any boy this side of imbecility can be prepared to enter college . " <P> Although no other U. S. preparatory school was afloat this week , many of them will not stay in the same place all term . <P> Most famed educational wanderer is Adirondack-Florida School , which opened last fortnight in cabins on the shore of Clear Pond near Onchiota , N.
