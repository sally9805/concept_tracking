Prologue to Glory ( by E. P. Conkle ; produced by the Federal Theatre ) is Lincoln in the days before he grew a beard ; a very youthful Lincoln ( Stephen Courtleigh ) keeping store at New Salem , Ill. , launching himself in politics , courting the half-legendary Ann Rutledge ( Ann Rutledge* ) ; a half-legendary Lincoln , licking the leader of the Clary Grove gang in a wrestling match , debating ( " Resolved , that the bee is more valuable to society than the ant " ) , joking , yarn-spinning , walking through a snowstorm to pay back a customer he had accidentally shortchanged ; a shy , gangling Lincoln confessing his love for the girl <P> Wedded to him not through union , <P> But through separation <P> who died at 19 of the " milk-sick " ( malarial fever ) . <P> In moments of engaging freshness , Prologue to Glory at times lays bare Midwestern pioneer life . As Abe , Stephen Courtleigh gives a winning performance . The weakness of the play is that the story of Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentalized and a trifle Boy Scoutish , without a trace of oldster Lincoln 's gnarled , life-roughened , racy side . Prologue to Glory is all clean backwoods fun and quiet pathos . Long after its current Federal Theatre production has subsided , it should bob up in many a high school as an irreproachable senior class play . Playwright Ellworth Prouty Conkle is 38 , teaches speech at the University of Iowa . He has destroyed a " bushel basketful " of plays , had one other ( 200 Were Chosen ) produced in Manhattan . In 1936 he made academic history when he obtained his Ph.D. , not for academic work , but for writing plays . <P> <P> *A great-grandniece of the character she por-trays.
