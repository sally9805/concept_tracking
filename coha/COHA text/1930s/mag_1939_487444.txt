REFUGEES who arrive fresh from Austria , on Dutch and Italian boats , are very circumspect and cautious when asked about conditions in the Ostmark . The fate of hundreds of thousands of fellow-sufferers who were left behind under Hitler 's whip imposes discretion upon them . Other passengers with whom I have talked , however , neutrals who have managed to slip in and out of the Reich , are less reticent . Whether their observations and comments on Vienna give a picture that is true for other sections of Germany is difficult to determine at this distance , but they are important in themselves , and their authenticity is apparent to one who knows Vienna and the Viennese as intimately as I do . History has hit the Austrian in a particularly sensitive December 16 , 1939 spot , his stomach . Many of the rich foods of which he was so fond had practically disappeared from the market before the war broke out . Now coffee , tea , and chocolate can not be bought , cards or no cards . Butter is rationed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per person , but for a medium-sized family . Sugar can be obtained only in minimal quantities . As for bread , two rolls are allowed per day , per person . The weekly ration of meat at the beginning of the war was fixed at about a pound and a half per person , fat and bones not included . Early last October it was reduced to a fraction over a pound ; today it still weighs the same but with a qualification  --  bones are now included . Single persons who must take their meals in restaurants are even worse off . For weeks the menus of the Viennese restaurants , at one time famous for presenting a vast selection of savory items , have offered only one dish  --  stewed sauerkraut and Kn5del , or Viennese dumpling . This most native of Austria 's national dishes has always been popular , and its preservation as the universal ration may have indicated deference to the culinary sentiments of the Viennese if not to their bodily needs . But some Viennese wits have suggested that it is more probably an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KnMein are not made of flour and generous quantities of fat but of a sticky mess of potatoes , and sugar can no longer be used to sweeten the sauerkraut . With respect to other household essentials the people do not fare any better . Nobody dares even think about dust-cloths and mops . Soap is obtainable only by card , one cake a week for a whole family . It is of the coarsest quality and must serve for both toilet and laundering purposes . As to wearing apparel , the rule is two suits , two shirts , and one pair of shoes a year . Replacements can not be bought - without a certificate of need . And how is such a certificate obtained ? Again Hitler observes the traditions of his Viennese with a vengeance In the Vienna of Emperor Francis Joseph , just as in Paris , the concierge was . the all-powerful genie of daily life . His hands held the reins of the entire apartment house , and he certified births , deaths , marriages , political reliability , morality , and voting qualification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past , the Hausbesotger , and enhanced his importance by making him a trusted party member , with the duty to watch over the bodies and minds of his tenants . He is the person to be seen when the suit has fallen to pieces , and his is the power to obtain a new shirt when the old one will not stand another washing . It is up to him to decide whether a new garment may be bought or whether a stitch here and a patch there will prolong the usefulness of the old one . He inspects the worn heels of his clients and sits in judgment when he believes that the precious cake of soap is not properly used . ( Only women 's stockings are outside the concierge 's sphere . In order to buy a679 new pair one has only to hand over the old stockings to the salesgirl , who turns them in for reprocessing . ) The records in the concierge 's lodge have become an integral part of life in Vienna . His files contain everything from political dossiers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued to shopkeepers instructions calculated to maintain a , Potemkin 's illusion of abundance . The magnificent plate-glass windows of the stores in the KErntnerstrasse are filled with the costly articles which have always formed the attraction of that thoroughfare . But amid the smart dresses , silk scarves , leather bags , hats , and furs is a little placard , replacing the sign " Jewish store " of a year ago , with the inscription " Schauware " ( display stock ) ; sometimes this novel sign bears as explanation the legend " Must not be sold . " Inside , the store suggests the palaces on movie lots ? a magnificent front and nothing behind it . The shelves are empty . In times of need the spirit of rebellion rises in the women of the people rather than in the men . The housewives are the first to clench their fists and grumble against the harsh authorities . The Hitler regime is well aware of this and has formed an auxiliary police force , consisting of several hundred middle-class women and servant girls , whose function it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in restaurants , in the markets , or in homes , and to denounce those who sneer at the Opfergeist , the spirit of sacrifice , which should rule the home front . These women receive regular pay , enjoy favors which the Gestapo alone is able to confer , and consequently perform their tasks conscientiously . But treachery in their own ranks does not paralyze women as it does men . It did not prevent Viennese women last month from organizing a mock demonstration of loyalty to their Fiihrer . Several hundred strong , they marched through the streets carrying empty shopping bags in their right hands and chanting , as they raised them to the Hitler salute , " ' Fir danken unserern Fiibrer " ( we thank our Fiihrer ) . Resentment and dejection have for some time reigned among Austrian women . An official decree forbids public mourning for sons , fathers , brothers , husbands , killed in the war . A woman who should forget herself in the street to the extent of shedding a tear for a loved one is liable to be picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boys between fifteen and twenty , and conducted to the nearest police station . The Gestapo knows how to nip a revolution in the bud ; it simply clears the streets of all surface signs of discontent . Mobilization orders have not been posted as formerly but , mailed to each individual , so as to prevent any public gathering where silent but eloquent looks might be exchanged . But the truth is too conspicuous to be covered up . Two capital facts in particular can no longer be concealed . The first is that from the early days of the war a dis- ' proportionately large number of Austrian soldiers were sent to the Polish battlefields , where they suffered enormous casualties . ( The Nazis issued orders prohibiting the appearance of wounded soldiers in the streets of Vienna . ) In the light of this fact the reports of mutinies in garrisons in Styria , Carinthia , and Upper Austria , so often denied by the Germans , become entirely credible . The Austrians are gradually beginning to see Hitler 's true relationship to them . For him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the acid test proved to be poor material for totalitarianism . The best place for them is at the front , in Prussian army formations , under Prussian officers ! The second , more far-reaching in that it affects not only Austria but the entire Reich , is the discovery that the men who have been specially trained and been in ; stilled with enthusiasm for the war to come , the elite Hitler guards , are now stationed in the rear . Their job in this war is apparently to dry , in their more or less subtle way , the tears shed in Vienna , Warsaw , Katowice , Bromberg , Mahrisch-Ostrau . At the front are only the regular army corps made up of young farmer boys and career officers reinforced by contingents of middle-aged men . Inquiries among families who have sons of military age almost invariably bring out the remarkable fact that the flower of the Nazi regime , the S. S. , S. A. , and H. J. lads , busy themselves with the cultivation of the proper attitude at home and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers who saw service at the front in the last war , man the fortifications . The quick wit of the Viennese has seized upon this fact and has already Compressed it in a bon mot , which was repeated by a former high official of the Schuschnigg regime upon his arrival in New York a few days ago : " Hitler exterminated his opponents in three stages=first Socialists , then Jews , then Catholics . Now he is at the fourth stage  --  all male Germans over thirty-five . " This bitter joke springs from the realization that Hitler intends to keep intact and unharmed his own army of German youth , regardless of what may happen to the people 's army . His young followers must not be allowed to experience the horrors of war on the battlefield . Their heroism is given an outlet in taming a disarmed foe . ( The Czechs were no doubt driven to make their recent hopeless outbreak by the humiliation of having to submit to schoolboys playing police . ) Before Schuschnigg 's fall the board fences in Vienna and . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now they are covered with a bit of doggerel . It is a simple couplet , hardly refined in tone but typically Viennese in its laconic irony : Die Juden rind weg Und wir haben em ' Dreck . To what or whom the Viennese refer will be the business of future historians to unravel .
