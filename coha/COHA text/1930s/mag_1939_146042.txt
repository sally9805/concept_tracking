Last week Franklin Roosevelt , as empowered last month by act of Congress , started in a small way to reorganize the U. S. Government . <P> During the Presidency of Herbert Hoover , the able engineer and organizer under whose secretaryship the Department of Commerce grew from small acorn to many-branched oak , an element of U. S. Government unknown to the Founding Fathers really got going : government-by-agency . Reconstruction Finance Corp . was the Hoover era 's modest prototype for what , after 1933 , became known as Franklin Roosevelt 's billionaire " alphabet soup . " <P> Without calling for any new Departments , the President last week proposed bringing together out of the New Deal 's limbo and out of old administrative nooks &; crannies , 21 various Government units devoted mainly to Security , Lending and Works , and grouping them into three Agencies with a $12,000 Administrator at the head of each . <P> A Security Agency would take in the now independent Social Security Board , National Youth Administration ( now part of WPA ) , Civilian Conservation Corps ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Office of Education ( now in the Departments of Labor and Interior , respectively ) and the Public Health Service ( from the Treasury ) . <P> A Lending Agency would consolidate ten independents : RFC , Disaster Loan Corp , RFC Mortgage Co. , Federal National Mortgage Association , Electric Home &; Farm Authority , Federal Home Loan Bank Board , Home Owners ' Loan Corp. , Federal Savings &; Loan Insurance Corp. , Federal Housing Administration , Export-Import Bank of Washington . <P> A Works Agency would merge Works Progress Administration and Public Works Administration ( both independent ) , the Agriculture Department 's Bureau of Public Roads , the public buildings branches of the Treasury 's Procurement Division and of the National Park Service ( now Interior ) ; also the U. S. Housing Authority ( Interior ) . <P> The President also proposed merging eight other units under two old executive headings . <P> To the Department of Agriculture would go the Farm Credit Administration , Federal Farm Mortgage Corp . and Commodity Credit Corp . ( all now independent ) . <P> To the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup , would go the Budget Bureau ( now in the Treasury Department ) , the Central Statistical Committee and Board ( independent ) , National Resources Committee ( independent ) and Federal Employment Stabilization Office ( since 1935 a name only in Commerce ) . <P> One of the President 's six new assistants authorized by the Reorganization Act would be assigned to personnel work throughout the Administration . <P> Ideally the President 's plan would shuffle his agencies physically as well as functionally into streamlined new quarters , not only in Washington but out through the land where their scattered regional offices now cost citizens dear in time to find them , deal separately with them . Affected by the altered grouping will be 90,400 Federal employes in all , only 24,982 of them in Washington . The President in this plan did not dwell on the unpopular subject of how many of these jobs would be telescoped.
