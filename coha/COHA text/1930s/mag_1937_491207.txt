THE manager of a suave New York hotel recently got a letter postmarked " Paris " from a prosperous and frequent patron . She wrote that . Johnny and Sarah , her two children , were sailing for New York on the Megalomania the following week , in charge of the first-class-section purser ; kindly see them through the customs , take them to the hotel for lunch  --  three sandwiches apiece , one of chicken , one of currant jelly , one of chopped egg  --  then to the Empire State Building and the Museum of Natural History , feed them dinner  --  thick soup , roast beef , baked potato and salad , and make sure they eat the salad  --  treat them to an early movie of a suitable character , put them on a train at ten o'clock and have them delivered the next morning , with noses blown and necks clean , to their respective schools in the Massachusetts hack country . Anybody but a hotel manager would have been equally delighted to hear that a mixed consignment of anacondas and wildcats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , know how to do such things in stride where good customers are concerned . Just the week before , this particular manager had not only persuaded another good eustomer 's son and heir not to commit suicide but had also found him a good sanitarium to brace up in . This new emergency was comparatively simple ; a mere busy ten minutes on the telephone had everything set to do right by Johnny and Sarah , all the way from the hotel 's representative on the pier to the hotel 's Boston representative who would meet them at the South Station . The bill sent to the absentee parent included only meals , cash expenses and porter service . No charge for extra grief . If extra grief were charged for , hotel accounting departments , already badly overdeveloped , would have to double their staffs . The Other Side of the Desk T HAT 'S one side of the modern hotel 's relation to the patron . The other side is succinctly illustrated by the old hotel man 's gag about the guest at the small-town hotel who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many strangers settle here , friend ? " " They all settles , " says the manager , and them with no more baggage than you got settles in advance . " When the President pushes an ivory button on his desk to open the sluices of Hoover Dam or light up the symbolic Tower of Something or Other at a world 's fair , reporters , newsreel cameras and microphones are always there to trumpet abroad the drama of the occasion . When John Smith registers at a metropolitan hotel in the modern tradition , that is another simple act which sets in motion a machine as impressive as any 10,000-ton gadget in a powerhouse . But this huge , part-human , part-mechanical organization is out of sight and silent , all the more so the better it works . If he realized the amount of smoothly oiled routine called for by the mere fact of his arrival , John Smith might get a swelled head . Which would be unfortunate , because , as the above parable indicates , this machine has a double function : It is tooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much speed and so little inconvenience to himself as to convince him that the whole place is his private palace . But it is also geared to protect the hotel and the other guests against him , if he chooses to try any funny business , Luckily for everybody concerned , the two jobs interlock with consummate neatness . If the maid reports that you have packed away a couple of sheets and a blanket as souvenirs of your stay , the house detective enters your room in your absence and frisks your suitcase , But it is also the house detective who hunts all over the house with a microscope to locate that pair of glasses you think you left in the lobby . The cashier obligingly gets your bill completely made up on ninety seconds ' notice , down to the breakfast you signed for twenty minutes before . But a good half of the purpose of this split-second bookkeeping is to make sure that you do n't sign more and fatter checks than your credit rating or the amount and quality of your baggage justify . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute of your registration , so - that , if a telephone call comes in while you are in the elevator , you will find the phone ringing in your room when you get there . Another display of hair-trigger service which also has its crasser aspect  --  fur your name may already he filed on the information board with a little warning signal attached , and in ten minutes the credit manager will be knocking on your door to inquire urbanely about the little bill you left behind or the check that bounced back six months ago , Running the Credit Gantlet rilHIS teamwork between service and protection 1 begins even before you register . In one system , as the bellboy takes your suitcase , he unobtrusively hefts it and , if it . is illogically light or rattles unduly , he lays a small colored cardboard check on the desk as you are signing the register . The cheek means nothing to you ; even if you do see it , but to the room clerk it means : " Light bag ; look out . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks you up , which he can do in a quarter of a minute , and finds you have a credit rating in the cashier 's files , he ignores this warning . The cut of your jib and the hang of your clothes may get you a tacit extension of credit anyway . But if you do n't look just right to his expertly appraising eye , he hands you a slip of paper and says softly : " Just get this bill receipted at the cashier 's window , Mr. Smith , and she will give you your key . " Which , being translated , means you pay in advance , mister . Putting up a holler will get you only a polite invitation to interview the credit manager , give him the proper references and an opportunity to check them , and the hotel will be glad to open a credit for you . Meanwhile , no cash , no key , all prettied up in fifty-cent words and the most affable manners . The same thing goes , of course , when you have no baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored paper marked " Insufficient Funds " or " Signature Unknown . " But , generally speaking , your chances are about as good with a bank teller as with a hotel , and for the same reasons . Machinery for suppressing petty chiselers is equally efficient . The old gag of sending a ragged shirt to the hotel laundry and then demanding a new shirt on the pretext that the laundry ruined it is spoiled by laundry inspectors who report on all damaged articles before washing . The good old custom of pressing clothes in the room with your own iron , to the detriment of the hotel 's cleaning and pressing department , is discouraged in some theatrical hottls by a device which automatically locks the plug of the iron into the wall outlet . When the patron has finished her bootleg chore , she ca n't disconnect the iron and has to call for an electrician , who arrives promptly , along with a hill for fifty cents for the use of the hotel current . There is an answer to everything , ranging in 56 ) Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management may get worried about you for some reason , whereupon the credit manager takes the liberty of paying your room a call while you 're out and makes a thoughtful tour of your personal effects to figure out how good a risk you are . Although the house can legally hold your baggage as security for an unpaid bill , he is n't so much interested in the resale value of your effects as in the quality of your shirts and socks , the return addresses on any letters lying about and such other mute but ordinarily accurate witnesses as to the kind of citizen you are in your home town . You find queer things in the guests ' luggage sometimes , they say , all the way from bird seed to six-guns , and you conduct yourself accord , ingly . In some houses , names and room numbers of guests on a cash basis are sent in red ink to all dining rooms and bars as a warning not to let them sign checks . Elsewhere there is nothing to stop such a guest from signing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roost in the cashier 's office with uncanny speed and , within half an hour of signing , a bellboy is at the cash customer 's door with a polite request for immediate payment . Since that happens every time he puts in a ten-cent phone call , the dead beat is soon discouraged and the honest man begins to see the point in the management 's suggestion that he 'll save a lot of nuisance and a lot of dimes for bellboys if he makes a deposit of twenty-five dollars against charges . If you try to keep out of sight when there 's a check to be paid , the credit manager may resort to a French key  --  a master key with a neck of soft metal between wards and handle which twists off in the lock and effectively jams your door shut . Your complaint to the floor clerk that you ca n't get your key into the lock summons not only the locksmith but also your unpaid check with , no doubt , the omnipresent credit manager in attendance . An extreme measure , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hag of suave tricks . The point is that a hotel is the one place in the world where , other things being equal , anybody is entitled to expect credit without proving his right to it . It is n't so much the four or five dollars for a night 's lodging that is lost when a patron walks out without paying his bill , since a hotel is seldom absolutely full . That puts the house out of pocket only the cost of washing the run-out 's sheets and towels . But meals and drinks are another matter , and , besides , a public impression that you can get away with anything at the Hotel Thus-and-such will lead to wholesale invasions of professional dead beats . Hitches in Hospitality B ESIDES , hotels are legally obligated to supply all comers with food and lodging up to the capacity of the house . A department store does n't have to sell you so much as a collar button unless it feels so inclined , but the hotel must show good reason why it wo n't sell you the temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . All of which adds up to a necessity for extreme caution to keep the situation in hand , whatever the law says . No important hotel in the United States could honestly say that its room clerk had never looked a scaly customer candidly in the eye and told him that there was n't a room available in the house when , as a matter of sober fact , the place was two-thirds empty . There 's seldom any kickback . The rejected customer has no way of successfully calling the clerk a liar , so he either tries his luck elsewhere or sees what he gets out of the clerk 's solicitous offer to telephone another hotel for accommodations. . flutograph Skeptics NYBODY , no matter how A honest , who ever tried to cash a cheek in a hotel without adequately impressive identification already knows that you have to be a pretty talented putter-up of a good story to swing the deal . The bouncing check is too well known a hazard . Assistant managers and cashiers are encouraged to an extremely suspicious habit of mind by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cashes or O.K. 's a check is personally liable for the amount if it does bounce . Here also the credit manager , who seldom comes into contact with the guest. , except on crude financial matters , draws the dirty work . The urbane front manager in dark jacket , stiff collar and striped pants who has just welcomed you so cordially to the hotel can hardly afford to go upstage on you and say , " Sorry , we 'd rather not collect your autograph . " So he says that , unfortunately , he has n't the authority to O.K. a check  --  a statement which comes under the head of diplomatic lying  --  but the credit manager , first door on the left , is your man . Then , if the initials on your belt buckle do n't match the initials of your signature , or if you do n't put up a far better story than most strangers can manage under these circumstances , it will turn into a matter of a great many elaborate synonyms for the word " no . " Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that ever huge hands for piano playing . So I knew he Was not the one for me , and the quest still went on . On the other side , my teachers in theory were extremely enthusiastic from the start . They said that I was to be a composer , not a pianist . The second piano teacher I went to was a very emotional man ; the first was simply a teacher , a pedagogue , and technique was the thing for him ; though he himself had not so very much technique . But the other was an artist , and he said that I had something to say with my fingers , and said , " Oh , you are talented . There is no doubt about that . " But his piano playing must have been , in his youth , very much like my own , because he did not pay the necessary attention to the technical difficulties . Such cruelty of fate ! I came across such teachers all the time . I made some little progress , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there were certain things which must he played correctly , but I could not play correctly myself , and my teacher did not give me the key to learn with . But in spite of this , I developed a certain repertoire . After two years I could play quite acceptably ; not perfectly , of course  --  very incorrectly  --  but st ill with certain accents that betrayed a natural tal en t . Then it occurred to the director of f he ronservaloirr that something must be done in order to attract public attention to the rorwrvalnirr . There were no orchestras outside the opera , no orchestral concerts in Warsaw ; only an orchestra from Berlin that came every summer . Well , the director of the omNcrrilloire felt that it was not right In let foreigners give those concerts , and he conceived the idea that there should be a Polish orchestra comprised .1f the ron  --  rrvainm. students . Now , while studying harmony and nterpoint , I was very much at-trailed by various instruments . I wanted to know them well . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en-couraged  --  to join a class of brass in-struments , wood and wind instruments , I went . first to the teacher of the flute , and I started my career as a flutist . But there I met again with great discouragement . I could never become a flute player because my lips were too thick for the flute . So , after a few weeks of hard study , when I had acquired a knowledge of the instrument , its actions and its limitations as well , I had to go away because the teacher insisted upon my leaving his class . Fate again ! So , not at all discouraged , I went to the oboe-and-clarinet class . There was a very nice teacher there , and lie liked me , personally , very much . He gave me the elements of oboe and clarinet playing , because he played both instruments himself extremely well . But he said that I had no future with the clarinet and oboe . I should take up something else . So I moved on again . To the bassoon next .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument . From the bassoon I went to the horn , and for a few months I really played the horn . Well , after having already tried to learn so many instruments , and after having got a real knowledge  --  at least theoretically  --  of their possibilities , I found that it was necessary to study all the others . So I went to the class of trumpets and of the trombone . Both instruments were under the same teacher , who immediately saw my remarkable talent for both the tnimpet and the trombone  --  especially the trombone . One day while giving the lessons  --  he was a very good man , kind , affectionate  --  he said , " Now , my dear boy , listen to me . You are always trying to play piano . Piano is useless for you ; your future is here , playing the trombone ! You are really remarkably gifted for it , and you will earn your livelihood with trombone , not with the piano . " He was terribly serious about this . " Yes . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naturally , his words impressed me very much , and although I still held firmly to my faith in my piano playing , I accepted his verdict and worked very hard , and soon acquired some reputation with the trombone , to his great delight . In fact , when that idea of the symphonic orchestra in the conseruatoire matured , I was immediately appointed first trombone player of that orchestra . A great honor ! There were many rehearsals for that orchestra . I am telling this because it was a very dramatic incident in my life , which gave much concern and sorrow to my poor father . These rehearsals began toward the end of June , and the examinations were also taking place in the conservatoire in that month , and I had to pass my examination in counterpoint and some other subject which I had studied . So I was not so very comfortable in my appearances at the rehearsals , and several times I was sharply reproached by the director for not attending them . " But I can not ! " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my examinations . " " No , no , " he said , " there is nothing so important as these rehearsals , " because that was his hobby , you know . At that moment he was only interested in the orchestra . On one occasion I came too late for the rehearsals . I was told that I should be detained  --  kept after school . I said , " No . I shall not be detained . It is impossible . " And I was right , because the principal thing was studying , not rehearsing for concerts . I refused to remain . So they used some violence ; they actually tried to keep me by force . Then I fought . We had a real encounter , a fight. , and even some students took my part . There was a serious riot , in the conservatory . The director then asked me whether I would at once submit myself to the discipline , or leave the conservaloire altogether . And I said , " I do not acknowledge that the conservatory has any right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not accept that verdict , sir . I shall leave at once  --  please let the door be opened ! " And so , in great bitterness and excitement , I was expelled from the conservatory . Editor 's Note  --  This is the first of a sent- , of articles by Mr. Paderewski and Mary Lawton . The next will appear next week . pure poison . It would be inaccurate to say that hotels purposely neglect to cooperate with the police or that the management helps such unwelcome guests to make a getaway . But the hotel has no desire to obstruct their departure and if , in understandable hurry , they neglect to pay their bill , nobody is going to run after them . The protective machinery , however . is aimed solely at the one crooked or badly behaved patron and never touches the nine hundred and ninety-nine who are honestly paying their way and behaving themselves .

The art of patron pleasing , as now practiced in those big New York hotels which are models for the whole country , is as refined and complex as organic chemistry .

( Continfis  --  d from Pag ? 56 ) form , the heart of it is the " patrons ' history " file , which contains every registration since the house was opened , with notations of each patron 's little crotchets and preferences .

The telegraph company 's practice of sending birthday wires in specially marked envelopes is what usually tips the hotel off . One establishment goes so far as to issue standing orders to all employees to catch any children stopping at the hotel and ask , When is your birthday , little girl ? " on which date the kid will receive a present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capetown . That sort of thing goes over great with patrons . So do names , a liberal use of which is guaranteed to make the guest feel that this great bed-and-breakfast factory has turned into his own town mansion . The moment Mr. Robinson registers , the teletype sends his name and room number up to the floor clerk , and , as he steps out of the elevator , she hails him by name . The elevator boy and the bellhop are supposed to note down the name in their memories , and when the guest next enters the car , Lhe boy should say : " Good evening , Mr. Robinson . " Mystifying , but thoroughly flattering . So is the doorman 's saying : " Good-by , Mr. Robinson , " as Mr. Robinson gets into his taxi  --  the explanation being that the desk has just shot it to the doorman by telautograph that the tall fellow checking out with two suitcases and a golf bag is named Robinson . A lady guest gets special treatment in this connection . The whole staff may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it only when nobody else is within earshot ? " Good morning , Mrs. Robinson , " if she gets into an empty elevator , but merely , " Good morning , madam , " if there is anybody in the car . The hotel leans over backward to respect the lady guest 's privacy . A guest registering for the first time in an elaborately systematized house has " First Stay " stamped on his or her registration card  --  which summons an assistant manager to rally round and give the new arrival a personal welcome . If it 's a man , the manager goes up to the room to do his stuff , whereupon the guest usually inquires in flattered wonder : " How on earth did you know this is the first time I 've been here ? " If it 's a woman , however , ho merely makes a solicitous and mellifluous call on the house phone . Similarly , if a man guest is laid up with a cold , the assistant manager visits him to ask if he 's got everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it 's a lady , the ministering angel is a personable and tactful young woman from the housekeeper 's department . To radio a reservation at a topnotch house in advance of landing from a ship in New York means that the house sends you a telegram at quarantine , welcoming you to these shores in a few well-chosen words . Similarly , if you sail from the hotel , the pilot boat brings you a telegram of bon voyage . Anybody who takes a suite , or any of those people fashionable enough or good customers to rate a pink slip  --  meaning " Special Attention " ? on the information and desk boards , gets his rooms decorated with fresh flowers throughout his stay . Newlyweds rate flowers in any case . The hotel seldom fails to identify them . The confetti may be out of their hair and the new husband may sign the register with complete sang-froid , but newlyweds are always betrayed by the fact that they both are wearing brand-new shoes . A wrong guess , involving flowers and congratulations from the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's money well invested anyway . Naturally , the patron is likely to come back to a place where the management is so solicitous about him as an individual . If he fails to turn up again within a reasonable time , however , the hotel goes gunning for him . The manager writes him a form letter , saying that the Biltodore is worried about him . Would n't he like to renew the acquaintance on his next trip to New York ? And , if anything was wrong , please let them know , because that 's the only way they can fix things to suit . Many hotels send a regular form letter to all first-stayers at their home addresses , saying , " It was very nice to have you and do come back . " Some hotel men , however , consider that dangerous ; perhaps the patron was n't supposed to be in New York that trip and it might be embarrassing if this letter strayed into the hands of other members of the family . Farthest north in mail follow-ups appears in the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasions of their twenty-fifth and fiftieth stays . The fiftieth time , the hotel invites you to luxuriate in a free suite on your next visit ; the hundredth time you get a leather memorandum book decorated with your signature embossed in gold . On the Trail of Goodwill There is practically no limit to which the management will not go in the following-up process . A well-known New York manager , for instance , in charge of a quietish and swankish house , is at present touring the Middle West and New England to make personal calls on some seventy-five conspicuously good customers and find out why they have n't been back during the last year . If you want to start the machine at full speed ahead from a standstill , just mention , as you pay your bill , that this is a terrible joint and you are n't coming back . By the time you and your bag are halfway to the door , an assistant manager will be at your elbow , asking for details and solicitously murmuring regrets , apologies and heartfelt thanks for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omission and commission . If you get away before anybody can rally round , you are certain to receive a letter to the same effect as soon as you get home . If this house is part of a chain which maintains branch offices in key cities , the local representative will probably // come round and see you . For a modern hotel is right in the same class as Sweet Alice when it comes to trembling in fear at a frown . The study departing guest may well admit that there was n't anything wrong to mention  --  he 'd just had a long and damp evening with the boys and was taking it out on the world in general  --  but the flattery implicit in having his lightest word taken so seriously will probably make him a steady patron of the house for life . The Personal Touch It pays to get patron pleasing down to so elaborate a science , because the hotel has so few other ways to distinguish itself in the patron 's mind . Fundamentally , says the hotel man , all hotels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within limits , beds , food and drink are more or less alike and , down to a certain surprisingly low price range , most modern hotels are clean and supply plenty of hot water . The personal touch and the painstaking follow-up not only earn their way at the moment , they also stimulate invaluable word-of-mouth advertising . One traveling man casually and spontaneously mentioning in Pullman washrooms that the Biltodore is a first-rate place with swell service in spite of its moderate rates is paying the Biltodore huge dividends in return for its elaborate efforts to make him remember it kindly . They say one of the most valuable employees in the New York hotel world is a certain genial house detective who has a private Christmas-card mailing list of 1.500 old pals of his who also happen to be steady patrons of the house . When he sends out those cards every Christmas , the hotel has its own good reasons for paying for printing , addressing and postage . Anything to make the patron associate the place with being treated right is an assignment requiring a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons arriving without luggage , for instance , some hotels soften the blow of paying in advance by an offer to supply nightgowns for ladies , pajamas for gentlemen , toothbrushes , shaving cream , razor blades , tooth powder , combs and brushes  --  all on the house . Another has a free lending library for guests , whether insomniacs or not . Many houses have children 's playrooms ; which are not only handy for busy parents but servo the additional purpose of squelching kids ' fascinated desire to ride up and down in the elevators all day . Now and again , a guess goes wrong , as when a famous New York hotel spent V000 on a luxurious dog kennel on the roof , only to find that the guests always preferred to keep their dogs in their rooms . " No dogs allowed " pretty well broke down during the depression . Another Famous new establishment which gets a great many foreign patrons has a special foreign department with a staff who , among them , can speak nine languages . A guest from a non-English-speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from a courteous young man offering , in his own language , to be of any and all possible service , and making good on the offer . Foreigners in American hotels often badly need that kind of help . It takes a good deal of tactful education to make them understand that the telephone , instead of a nonexistent push button , is the proper instrument for summoning service . The foreign department is also a blessing for the telephone operators . A voice excitedly babbling an unknown tongue is automatically plugged into the foreign desk to let an expert figure out whether the language is Swedish or Hindustani , and what it is the guy wants anyway . The art of drumming up business has developed various minor dodges involving special rates , some of them as original as the offer of a New York hotel to swap accommodations for hard-to-come-by farm products . You ca n't , as some farmers wrote in to suggest , pay your bill with a carload of potatoes , but a consignment of genuine maple sirup or real country sausage is readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy with a wide and well-heeled acquaintance among fellow students free lodging when he comes to New York , on condition that he tell his Friends that the Biltodore will take 20 per cent off their bills if they mention his name . The boys seldom spend much in the house , but they fill the rooms and talk about the place . Professional rates for actors still flourish in Broadway hotels . The discount may be real or fictitious , with a charge of say five dollars at 20 per cent off for a four-dollar room . The big-time actor naturally finds it beneath his dignity to ask For a professional rate in the swankier hotels of the theatrical district , but he knows and the management knows that he gets it anyway . It 's well worth while . People talk about seeing him in the lobby , even if he does ask the manager to keep him out of the papers , and he probably has a whole troupe of hangers-on and admirers who put up at the same hotel to be near him . Fighters are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , long way to snare a celebrity . Not that fighters are n't usually well behaved , but the small mob of flet-nosed and cauliflowered admirers waiting For the champ in the lobby is likely to dismay other guests . Army and Navy officers in active service often receive a discount , and one New York hotel , built by a graduate of West Point , extends it to anybody who can show an Army ring . Practically any convention , whether of public librarians or casket salesmen , means a special deal with certain hotels and a piece bitten off the bill . Male conventioneers , by definition out for the noisier kind of good time , are usually assigned in batches to special floors , well out of hearing of nervous old ladies . Paper Comes Home to Roost Many lesser newspapers and magazines take due bills in payment for hotel advertising , say a hundred dollars ' worth of due bill for fifty dollars ' worth of space , and then , when one of the editors wants to put up self or subordinate at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value . Only the cash commission for the ad. vertising agency which handles the account distinguishes the deal From pure barter . Due bills from better-class hotels are usually nonnegotiable and can be used only by well-accredited representatives of the publications to which they were issued . That discourages the old custom of selling off due bills at a 50 per cent discount to brokers , who peddle them at something like 80 per cent of face value  --  a practice which is likely to embarrass the hotel with the presence of some very queer customers indeed . There are still enough negotiable due bills floating about , usually from small-time hotels , to make the situation a sore subject with hotel men .

That sort of situation often results from the dodge of paying for redecoration or repairs with due bills at a huge discount when the house is in financial difficulties . When authors succumb to the practically irresistible temptation to write a novel about a big hotel , they usually cram in a choice assortment. of thefts , suicides , murders and smuggling rings to keep the pot boiling . The incidence of such conveniently melodramatic happenings in any given hotel is , of course , small  --  no hotel could stay in business if many of its patrons cut up so rough . When something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may haunts the manager day and night  --  surface ripples are sternly suppressed , just as in the books . The suicide 's room gets a change of furniture and a thorough scrubbing , and is rented again next week to a patron who would probably have a very bad night 's rest indeed if he knew the place 's history . Rooms where patrons have been taken i11 get the same treatment plus fumigation , whether or not the disease was contagious . Fooling the Thirteen Jinx It was probably a hotel mau who first laid down the principle that what you do n't know wo n't hurt you . Since the thirteenth floor is a very serious matter for many people , most hotels number it " 14 , " which does not rouse the customer 's suspicions , as " 12a " might . For this purpose , one New York hotel , built on two different street levels , is in a perfect position  --  which floor is the thirteenth depends altogether on which facade of the building you count by , and the superstitious patron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting . Foolish as it sounds , this is a real problem . The exterminator is always on the prowl from one floor to another to keep small wild life discouraged . It is a hotel proverb that two things never fail to ruin a hotel  --  criminals and bugs . Similarly , the whole staff are always on the prowl for sneak-thievery . With vigilance , wild life can be absolutely suppressed . But it is impossible absolutely to eliminate light-fingeredness , because no house can ever guarantee the honesty of every member of its staff and it is necessarily too easy for outsiders to gain access to the upper floors . If odd things start disappearing from guests ' rooms  --  in 1214 this week , in 1202 three weeks later , in 1219 two weeks later  --  the staff on that particular floor get shifted to different floors ; and then , when the same trouble crops up in 1508 and then in 1515 , the maid who was shifted to the fifteenth floor is going to have to answer a lot of questions . Day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening for and investigating undue noises , whether arising from jollification or larceny , unobtrusively inspecting people they encounter , trying doors to discourage the patrons ' lunatic habit of leaving doors unlocked and forty dollars in the pocket of the pants on the chair . One really conscientious manager has a standing call left for himself at five A.M. , just so he can make a special round of inspection at the deadest period of the twenty-four hours . The evanescent nature of hotel-room keys complicates matters a good deal . EVENING POST No way has yet been discovered of cutting down the number of guests who march out of hotels with keys in their pockets , and few ever bother to drop them into mail boxes . Although not one in ten thousand of these A. W. 0 . L. keys is kidnaped for larcenous purposes , it is easy to make out how , by investing forty or fifty dollars in accommodations at large hotels , a sneak thief can acquire a set of keys and make them a well-paying investment , An eminent member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York hotel not long ago had better than a dozen such investments tucked away in his socks and among the tails of his shirts . The notice on the back of the door says the house is not responsible for anything not deposited in the office safe deposit , but , as a matter of goodwill , the hotel often makes good on its guests ' losses up to considerable amounts . It is certainly demonstrable that neither hotel help nor professional criminals are a tenth as light-fingered as the guests themselves . Chances are pretty good that a lady who absentmindedly leaves her gold-brocaded evening purse in a lobby chair will get it baek unopened . In one year , the valet 's department of one of New York 's conspicuous new hotels returned to patrons more than 5S000 in cash found in the pockets of suits sent to be cleaned or pressed , as well as a whole hock-shop winclowful of watches and jewelry . In cleaning up after the guest , the maid is likely to find not only false teeth , eyeglasses , razor strops , pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed to the old bomesread , but also , under the pillow or tucked for safekeeping into the bed springs , the guest 's wallet plump with cash . It all goes to the lost-and-found department to be shipped after the patron , often getting to his residence before he does . Abusing Hospitality The guest , on the other hand , has a definite touch of the cheerful kind of kleptomania . It is just a good joke to pinch a couple of silver spoons as souvenirs  --  since unmarked silver makes a pointless souvenir , many hotels have stopped putting monograms on more expensive stuff . There is a famous story about the hotel proprietor who attended a celebration at his fraternity house in his old college and discovered that the silver centerpiece on the table bore the name of his own hotel . Celebrants at banquets have a habit of filling a drunk 's pockets with knives and forks , just for the fun of it , and when he discovers them in the taxicab going home , he is as likely as not to throw them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Towels , sheets , blankets , ash trays , bathroom fixtures , anything which can be crammed into a piece of hand baggage will grow legs and walk out . An electric fan , a small table lamp and a radio loudspeaker were among the loot missing from one hotel room recently after the guest 's departure . Shortly before , a group of gay young women had stolen all the metal numbers from the doors in their corridor , to be used in their sorority house at college . As for vandalism , the hotel manager can not avoid thinking of his guests as so many wantonly destructive apes . A first-class modern hotel has to install ? the finest in the way of furniture and fittings , and then shrug its shoulders and take it as an ever-shifting mob of irresponsible patrons proceeds to ruin January 23 , 1537 hand-woven rugs and imported draperies and delicately polished tables . In the space of one hour , a slightly exhilarated salesman will have banged a bottle down on a glass-topped table hard enough to shatter the glass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damask tablecloth with a soft lead pencil to such effect that no laundry can ever efface his calculations of the millions there are in it . The tablecloth menace is so serious that at least one New York hotel has the waiter rush a memorandum pad to the diner as soon as he is observed to pull out a pencil . The cigarette does more damage than the tobacco concession down in the lobby will ever pay for . One New York hotel reports monthly destruction of 450 tablecloths , 200 napkins , 150 felt table pads and 00 blankets , sheets and pillowcases . People will and do actually drop burning cigarettes on obviously costly lobby carypets and not even bother to step on them . When peculiarly wanton damage can he put square up to the customer  --  if a member of a stag dinner pulls down a chandelier while using it as a trapeze or amuses himself by slitting the curtains with a carving knife  --  he pays for it , or else . But most of it has to he grinned over and borne . Guests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one to get checked up on . A certain national organization supplies many and many a hotel with inside dope on how well its staff can dish it out and take it by sending operatives round at stated periods to register in the place and ask for trouble . So far as the staff are aware , he is just another guest  --  and a tough one . All the while he is getting messages and packages delivered , ordering meals , asking for maid service , bellboys , and special information , he is making himself as unpleasant and overdemanding as possible , to see if the staff will stay polite and efficient under the most annoying kind of pressure . In his role of agent provocateur , he puts every department with which the hotel patron can conceivably come in contact through its paces , down to loafing suspiciously in the lobby to see if the house detective is on the job . On the basis of his report , the hotel jacks up weak spots and then , say , six months later , back comes another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost always a man , by the way , because it 's the lone male traveling on business who is the backbone of the metropolitan-hotel industry . There is the road test for the whole elaborate machine , carried out by an expert who not only knows bow to make it break down , if possible , but has had much more experience than the ordinary patron with all the various things it ought to do . Very definitely a job for professionals  --  as the hotel manager found out when he asked his wife to test out the doorman , who was , like the rest of the staff , under orders to plug the hotel 's restaurants whenever possible and curb the guests ' unfortunate tendency to go round the corner for meals . Mrs. Manager asked the doorman to recommend a good restaurant , and he sent her across the street . to a bash house . When she reported that to her husband , he called the doorman on the carpet and asked what he meant by suggesting an outside restaurant . " But , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , " if you 'd seen that lady , you 'd have known why . She wea n't at all the type we want seen about in this hotel . "
