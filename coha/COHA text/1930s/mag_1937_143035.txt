ASTROPHEL-Alfred H. Bill-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $3.50 ) . <P> I shall not want Honour in Heaven <P> For I shall meet Sir Philip Sidney And have talk with Coriolanus And other heroes of that kidney . <P> -T . S. Eliot Permitted to meet the 350-year-old ghost of Sir Philip Sidney , most moderns would aim chiefly at finding out : 1 ) how in his own lifetime that Elizabethan poet-statesman-soldier acquired his extraordinary fame , and 2 ) why . despite the fact that his prose ( Arcadia , Defence of Poesie ) and poetry ( Astrophel and Stella ) are today practically unread and unreadable , and his career no more interesting than that of half a dozen forgotten contemporaries , the aura of that fame has clung intact to his name ever since . Biographers have carefully recorded the facts of his career ( better documented , less clouded by legend than most Elizabethans ) , have noted that his death inspired more than 200 elegies exhausting the superlatives of friends and enemies alike . W ? here biographers have struck a snag has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tributes . Latest try is Alfred H. Bill 's Astrophel . Written in a half-scholarly , half-popular vein , it adds only the most cautious speculation to the known facts ; its main contribution is a closely-woven background of the times , the author 's enthusiasm for his subject . <P> Grandson of the powerful Duke of Northumberland ( beheaded 15 months before Philip 's birth ) , nephew of the Earl of Leicester ( rumored lover of Queen Elizabeth ) , godson of Philip of Spain , Sir Philip Sidney minimized his royal connections by taking as motto : Hardly do I call these things ours . A frail , handsome , serious child , he was early accustomed to " plots , conspiracies , attempted assassinations , rebellions , mutilations , headings and hangings . . . burnings at the stake . " As Queen Elizabeth 's Lord Deputy in Ireland and Lord President of Wales , his own father , a Polonius-like stalwart who advised Philip to " pray and wash with regularity , " duplicated for the Irish and Welsh the dirty deals his family had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to make a brilliant showing . Possessed of great personal grace , gentle , straightforward , courageous , scholarly , witty , accomplished at tennis , dancing , horsemanship , his only imperfection appears not yet to have been discovered . Traveling abroad between the ages of 17 and 20 , young Sidney captivated royalty , diplomats , scholars ; the only criticism voiced was that he drank too much water , ate too much fresh fruit . In Paris , as guest of Francis Walsingham ( later head of England 's unexampled secret service , and Philip 's future father-in-law ) Philip witnessed the slaughter of St. Bartholomew 's Day , conceived for Spain and the Papacy the only ungentle attitude in his makeup . <P> Although the love sonnets of Astrophel and Stella were addressed to a beautiful , blonde , black-eyed married woman ( daughter of the Earl of Essex ) , contemporaries were satisfied that Sir Philip Sidney 's love-making remained a strictly literary affair . The single criticism ever to touch his reputation on that score came from Queen Elizabeth , who , always furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men married , acted when " my Philip " married as though he had gone the limit in Elizabethan sensuality .
