txt The Treasury decided tonight to exercise full rights under the Gold Re- , serve Act of 1934 and subsequent Presidential orders to issue silver certificates on the basis of the full statutory value of the silver stocks held by the Treasury prior to approval of the Silver Purchase Act . This action was taken after President Roosevelt , returning from his Western trip and sea cruise , had conferred at the White House with Secretary Morgenthau . Mr. Morgenthau departed for New York City following the conference . Under the new decision the Treasury said it now is issuing , under lauthority of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 and Presidential order , I about $80,000 , u00 in silver certificates , againe62,000,000 ounces of free silver held by the ' Treasury prior to approval of the Silver Purchase Act . This silver cost the government $46,900,000 . Law 's Requirement Pointed Out . The silver certificates will be issued on the basis of $1.29 an ounce , instead of the 64.5 cents the government has been paying for newly mined domestic silver and the less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' alizing silver . The Treasury said that the silver certificates were being issued on a basis of $1.29 an ounce , " because that is required by law for all silver certificates . " The difference between the cost of the silver involved and the face amount of the certificates to be issued , the Treasury said in a statement , " constitutes seigniorage under the law and , as these certificates are issued , that difference will be shown on the daily ( Treasury ) statement as such . " Seigniorage , or profit on silver , appeared today on the Treasury statement as of Aug. 8 and was given as $6,136,421.10 . The item was under general receipts . No explanation had been made earlier in the day , and officials declined then to say whether this was profit from newly mined silver or from other sources . $10,000,000 Issued to Date . About $10,000,000 of these new silver certificates have already been placed in circulation , and it was on this basis that the Treasury statement showed a seigniorage item today .

A Treasury expert said tonight that the policy on which the government was now embarked should still be spoken of properly as " expansion , " but that it might be regarded in some quarters as " slight inflation . " He preferred the term " expansion , " but remarked that some persons might see in it an indication of later inflation . He pointed out that a careful distinction should be made between the silver held in the Treasury prior to approval of the Silver Purchase Act , which is affected under the newly announced policy , and silver acquired later , on which certificates will still be issued , for the time being at least , on a basis of the cost price of the metal . Estimates Are Withheld . The Treasury has been issuing certificates only on : : he basis of what was paid for silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how much of an expansion of the currency could eventually be expected from such a policy as this . The Treasury said that eventually it would use silver being acquired under the Silver Purchase Act as a basis for issuance of silver certificates and that these would also be issued on a basis of $1.29 an ounce , as required by law . The Treasury announcement followed closely on yesterday 's order and proclamation nationalizing silver and calling for delivery to the mints within ninety days , with some exceptions , of all stocks of silver in continental United States . It was pointed out then that even should the Treasury decide to exercise its authority to issue currency on the basis of the monetary value of the silver , $1.29 an ounce , there would still be a 100 per cent metallic base for silver certificates . TREASURY STATEMENT , The Treasury statement read : " The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 authorizes the President to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion , silver or standard silver dollars in the Treasury which , at the time of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver certificates . " In accordance with an order of the President issued pursuant to this authority , the Secretary of the Treasury is now issuing silver certificates against all the free silver which was in the Treasury prior to the approval of the Silver Purchase Act .

These silver certificates are being issued on a basis of $1.29 an ounce , because that is required by law for all silver certificates . " The total amount to be issued , under the President 's order , against these 62,000,000 ounces will be of a face amount of approximately $80 , - 000,000 . The difference between the cost of the silver involved and this face amount constitutes seigniorage under the law , and , as these certificates are issued , that difference will be shown on the daily statement as such . Seigniorage Always Counted .

The silver certificates to be issued against this silver will also , of course , be issued on the basis of $1.29 per ounce , as required by law . For the present the Treasury will issue against this silver an aggregate face amount of certificates equal to its cost . The difference between the cost of the silver which will have to be held to secure these certificates when they are issued and the monetary value ( $1.29 an ounce ) of the silver so held will be carried as seigniorage as indicated above .

Silver bullion transfers to the Treasury are exempt from the 50 per cent silver profits tax . This would apply to the nationalized silver now in the United States .

The new regulation clarified the situation by pointing out that silver delivered on futures contracts would come under the nationalization order . Order Sent to Collectors .
