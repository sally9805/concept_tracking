her . She glanced at the note again . Yes  --  Oh , dear !  --  it was too disappointing ! Mrs. Wintringham had said Saturday night of this week . ' For on Saturday night would be the school performance of The Merchant of Venice . ' Edna would n't miss it for anything  --  and she could n't miss it . She 'd have to see those children put their costumes on all right . Paul , too , would want to be on hand to applaud his daughter . Well  - -  they 'd just have to give up the dinner . But it was provoking . So provoking that Edna put temptation definitely behind her by going straight to the desk in Paul 's den , to write her note to Mrs. Wintringham without any delay . She pulled out a sheet of her best note-paper that Pearl had given her for Christmas  --  pale green with gilt edges and her name Edna ' printed on it in gold script letters  --  and opened her bottle of green ink . But then she fell a prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her thoughts on paper . She studied once more the curious phrasing of Mrs. Wintringham 's note . Finally she wrote , in her round , childish hand : Dear Mrs. Wintringham : I am sorry to say that I and Mr. Jones have to go to a school play on Saturday night that our little girl is acting in . It 's by William Shakespeare and she 's only'eleven and we really could not disappoint her . If we could have come we would have loved to . Very sincerely yoursEdna copied those last three words from the grey sheet of paper before her , though their order seemed to her affected , and yours truly ' would have been more natural . She hesitated for some moments over the signature , then wrote , very doubtfully , to make all things clear , Mrs. Edna Jones . ' She reread her note , slipped it into the green and gold envelope , and addressed it very carefully to Mrs. ConstanceP201Wintringham '  --  since that was what she called herself . But at the last moment , still the prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk for Paul 's inspection , before mailing . It was just as well that she did . For though Paul read Edna 's note with no more concrete criticism than that of an uplifted eyebrow , he insisted on going to the Wintringham dinner . He would not listen to her argument about the school play . We can see the dress rehearsal , ' he said easily . Edna tried to explain that Jessie 's feelings ' would be hurt . Oh , no , they wo n't be , ' said Paul , when I talk to her . ' Jessie listened gravely to her father , as he explained the connection that existed between a social occasion and a business relationship . She seemed to understand it with a reason beyond her years . It was all settled that very first evening and a second note was written to Mrs. Wintringham , on Paul 's curt dictation . Dear Mrs. Wintringham : It will give my husband and me great pleasureEdna marvelled at the facility with which the gracefully inevitable phrases slipped off Paul 's nimble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in thinking of the dinner party . Paul quite agreed with her that she needed a new gown . Next day , after Mrs. Jellinek 's luncheon , she went down town with Susan to look for it . Susan did n't see how The Merchant of Venice ' was ever going to be produced without Edna 's help in the dressing-room , and she thought Paul's attitude was the limit , ' but she took a vicarious interest in Edna 's prospective adventure . They wandered in and out of the ready-to-wear departments of the State Street departmentstores for the entire afternoon . It was Susan who spied in a showcase a model of coral pink satin with a swellingcrystal bodice that seemed to them both quite perfect . It 's most slenderizing , moddom , ' the salesgirl observed in the fitting-room . Edna was not sure about that . She was regretting that she had not gone on that diet six weeks before Mrs. Wintringhamhad invited her to dinner . Still , when I get thinner , Susan , ' she said hopefully , it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . ' Then they turned their attention to what Edna referred to as the accessories . ' She had learned from the Fashion Page that they were the real mark of the lady . In the best society nothing so clearly indicates the woman who does not know as the inappropriate choice of accessories . ' She repeatedthis phrase to Susan , who grinned and said , Maybe so , but they cost money . ' They did . White kid gloves  --  pink silk stockings  --  pink satin slippers with rhinestone buckles  --  Edna 's plump feet were small and she was moret than a little proud of them  --  a crystal bead necklace  --  and a sequin-covered evening bag . Just before they left Mandel Brothers to drop in at Huyler 's for the well-earned refreshment of a chocolate soda , Susan stopped at the notion counter and bought Edna a present  --  two large rhinestone hairpins to adorn her blonde pompadour . Edna regretfully dismissed as an extravagance the thought of a new evening wrap . Her tan coat would do . No one would see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could not help thinking continually of The Merchant of Venice . ' The dress rehearsal on Friday night was rather a disappointment . The boys forgot their lines . There was something wrong withp203the footlights . The voices of the children echoed thinly , unconvincingly , in the empty school auditorium . Even Jessie caught the contagion of awkwardness . Susan said sadly that maybe Shakespeare was a little too ambitious . The voice of her husband was hollow , as he reminded her cheerfully that dress rehearsals were proverbially bad . Jessie was cross all Saturday , as befitted a leading lady . She quarrelled with Junior and made him cry at lunch . Paul came home late in the afternoon and closeted himself in the den with his daughter to hear her say her lines for the last time . Not until then did Edna find time to run away from the tension of family life to the hairdresser on Clark Street to get her hair firmly marcelled for the Wintringham dinner . But she could not put her mind on it , torn by conflicting loyalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for the make-up room with Susan and Polly before going up to her bedroom to dress . When Paul was shaving and she was struggling with her hair-net , she called Junior in , to impress on him solemnly for the last time that he must behave when Mr. Peebles called for him and sit quiet , like little Sis Peebles , throughout the performance . Then she summoned the maid , to explain once more that she must stay in and sit up and see that Jessie and Junior went directly to bed , when they came home from the play . I ca n't see , ' she said fretfully to Paul , how society women can bear to live like this all the time . How can they possiblytell what their children are up to ? ' But Paul seemed quite untouched by her sense of mental confusion . When he had put on his dinner jacket and tied his black tie , he went downstairs and Edna could hear him joking with Elmer Peebles on the front porch a few minutes later . She ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief as she watched her son , unnaturally spick and span in his best blue serge jacket and knickerbockers , P204walking down Oakwood Terrace very decorously with the Peebles family . Then she finished her dressing in haste , her thoughts in the greenroom of the school auditorium . You look fine , Edna , ' said Paul unexpectedly , as she descended the stairs . The words cheered her . She smiled up at him timorously , in her pink and crystal splendour , as he held her tan coat . This  --  this all cost a lot of money , you know , ' she said . For Edna 's expenditures on dress and accessories ' had come to the stupendous total of seventy-seven dollars and eightyfivecents , and they weighed on her conscience . That 's all right . ' He was taking her in from hairpins to shoe buckles . From now on , Edna , I think perhaps we ought to spend more money . ' This observation surprised her , for Paul , though generous , had always been thrifty . But before she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to spend it in the right way . ' How do you mean ? ' Edna 's tone was puzzled . For a moment he was silent . Then , Well , you notice tonight , ' he said , a trifle uncertainly . Edna thought that over , during the fifteen-minute drive by Paul 's side in their Cadillac , down Sheridan Road and through Lincoln Park . Of course she 'd notice . Why , she 'd notice everything , as if she were at a play . But Paul 's words implied a reliance on her powers of observation that was faintly disturbing . Did he expect her to be able to imitate the Wintringhams ' manner of spending ? The idea was absurd . The Lake Shore Drive looked exactly as it had always looked when Edna had passed down it on summer nights with Paul . The street lights were blooming on their tall standards . The elm trees were stirring above them , in a faint breeze from the lake . The strip of parkway  --  the people 's playground  --  was alive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merged in a blue-greyp205plane of twilight  --  but a lighthouse kept winking , defining the horizon . This much of the Lake Shore Drive had always belonged to Edna . It was merely an extension of Lincoln Park . But the ornate , old-fashioned houses , aloof and withdrawnin their quiet yards  --  well , it did not seem possible that she was to enter one . Paul slowed up and turned into a cement driveway between two grey stone gateposts . Edna caught a glimpse of an impressive , frowning facade . At least it seemed to frown with heavy stone lintels over lighted , curtained windows . They rolled under a porte-cochere and parked the Cadillac in the carriage court beyond it . Edna 's heart was beating fast . When they stood in the panelled vestibule , How 's your nerve ? ' grinned Paul , betraying his own sense of adventure . At the touch of his hand on the doorbell the door swung silently open and revealed  --  yes  --  a butler . A portly man , thick jowled and dignified , who bowed them into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tapestried , and dimly illuminated by shaded globes in brass sconces . It was surprisinglyfull of things  --  vaguely perceived objects which impressed themselves on Edna in a confusion of gloomy splendour . Carved chests and benches , high-backed chairs , marble-topped tables . Heavily framed mirrors , a Chinese umbrella stand , a grandfather 's clock . Her pink slippered feet sank into thick-piled carpet and stumbled unexpectedly over the yawning papier-mache jaws of a tiger-skin rug . She found herself amazedly confronting a knight in full armour who was guarding the staircase . This hall was furnished in the best tradition of Chicago 's earlier Lake shore Drive period , but Edna had never seen anything like it . A dapper maid , in cap and muslin apron , popped out from behind the brass lamp on the newel post , and , as the butler gravely accepted Paul 's hat and coat , she took command of Edna and led her to a dressing-room , bright , roselit , cream-panelled , but tiny , tucked away under the stairs .   On Oakwood Terrace , on the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not had in ' for the evening , never left the front doorknob until every guest had arrived . You went upstairs alone and laid your wraps ' in a guest-room , or your hostess 's bedroom , to which you were mechanically guided by an unwonted display of electric light . This maid , and this dressing-room especially designed for the reception of company , ' seemed exotic to Edna . The maid impassively relieved her of her tan cloth coat . She laid it with other coats  --  a velvet and brocade one , Edna observed uneasily  --  on a small settee , and stood motionless . She seemed to be regarding Edna 's pink satin gown with disheartening detachment . After an instant of uncertainty , Edna approached a rose-draped dressing-table , thickly sprinkled with silver accessories for the toilet , and removed the veil from her hair . She would have liked to prink , but the presence of the maid embarrassed her . She poked in the glittering hairpins with nervous fingers , and then , with no more than one quick glance at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a confused impression of rigidly waved hair , scared eyes , flushed cheeks , and pink and crystalplumpness she hurried to join Paul in the hall . He was waiting for her at the butler 's side as nonchalantly as if he had always stood by butlers . It was discouraging , she reflected fleetingly , how hard women had to work for the distinction of appearance that a good-looking man achieved without effort in the black-and-white severity of evening dress . Then the butler , like a stage butler , said , Mr. and Mrs. Jones , ' as he threw open a door . Before she saw anything she heard the cackle of voices , raised high in the febrile excitement of social conversation , slightly stimulated by alcohol . Then she stood on the thresholdof another bright interior . Rose brocade walls , gold furniture upholstered in damask , tall mirrors , glass vasesP207of pink roses . A little wood fire , crackling its welcome on a white marble hearth . People  --  six or eight of them  --  clustered in a knot beneath the crystal chandelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly thin , in severe black satin , with no other adornment than her startlingly large diamond earrings , detached herself from the group . ObviouslyConstance , ' though Edna had imagined her much younger . Ah , Mrs. Jones  --  come in . ' For Edna was still hesitatingin the doorway . Delighted to see you . ' Her highpitched voice , with its shrill overtone of conventional cordiality , fell with no note of reassurance on Edna 's ear . And this is Mr. Jones  --  Henry 's told me so much of you . You must meet all these people . Cora , this is Mrs. Jones . Mrs. Jones , Mrs. Truesdale  --  and Mrs. McElroy -- and my daughter , Carol . And may I present Mr. Truesdale and Mr. Fox and Mr. McElroy and  --  Henry , where are you ? ' Henry a grey-haired gentleman with stooped shouldersand the face of a wise old sheep  --  was shaking hands with Paul . He turned and Mrs. Wintringham ended triumphantly , Mrs. Jones  --  my husband . ' However did she do it so glibly ? Edna was wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inarticulate embarrassment , fumbling handshakes , awkward smiles . This was over so quickly that Edna had hardly heard the names . Pleased to meet you , I 'm sure , ' she murmured . But no one seemed to be listening . Mrs. Wintringham was presentingPaul to the women . He knew all the men . He was smiling , bowing , looking quite sure of himself . Edna stood silent , trying to marshal her impressions . The house and its furnishing surpassed her wildest anticipations . The men were bewildering , in their identical livery of dinner jacket and black tie . At the first glance , however , the women were disappointing . Not really beautiful and not nearly gorgeous enough for the festal decor that surrounded them . Few jewels , no hair ornaments , simply attired in their plain , dark gowns . Only the rose on Mrs. McElroy 's shoulder relieved her brown net . Yet there was something about it  --  and something about her odd monkey face too  --  Edna supposed it was style . The intricate cut of the floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her slim figure . And the third woman , whose name Edna had n't caught  --  the one with the pearls  --  in that sleek , slinky , midnight blue satin  --  why , she looked like a fashion plate . Yet , save for her pearls , which were as large as green peas , she was starkly unadorned . Somewhere in the back of Edna 's brain the sacred words were uncomfortably echoing , In the best society nothing so clearly indicates the woman who does not know as the inappropriate choice of accessories . ' Her spirits sagged heavily and with them , unconsciously , the muscles of her body . Her plump arms hung awkwardly . Her short little fingers in the new white kid gloves  --  she was the only woman who was wearing them  --  clutched her glittering evening bag with the grip of quick despair . For all of a sudden , she knew she was all wrong . She felt foolish and overdressed . She felt fat . She was glad that Susan could not see her . She would never tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal and rhinestones , her coral pink satin , even her pink slippers with their stubby toes half hidden beneaththeir glittering buckles , looked silly and tawdry in this sophisticated gathering . She was staring at her companions with eyes that grew slowly hopeless . It was more than the women 's clothes . It was their manner , too . How did they achieve it  --  that lively composure , at once studied and careless ? Laughing and drinking and smiling up into the faces of the men , as if nothing mattered but the entertainmentof the moment.  |p209Then  a man spoke to her . He handed her a cocktail from the butler 's tray . ' I expect you 've got us all mixed up , ' he said . His eyes were amused but kindly . I 'm George Truesdale . ' Edna gazed at him awestruck . My goodness  --  George Truesdale ! It was the measure of her confusion at the moment of her entrance that she had not heard this name . Is  --  is that your wife ? ' she faltered , indicating the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt inquiry , and nodded , smiling over his cocktail . Very much so , ' he said humorously . Edna drew a long breath and took in the pearls again , with a respectful glance  --  then the thin , somewhat fretful , still pretty though middle-aged face that was above them . So  --  that was Cora Sewall Truesdale  --  Pearl 's Gibson Bride . Paul was talking to her vivaciously . He was making her smile . Edna glanced up at Mr. Truesdale and smiled herself , shyly . This  --  this was n't so bad when someone was talking to her . Then the butler spoke from the doorway and Edna was wondering if some man would offer her his arm to go into dinner , and just how she should accept it if he did , when she observed that , led by Mrs. Wintringham and Mrs. Truesdale , everyone was wandering informally into a farther room , a library , it turned out to be , booklined , gold-lamped , and very Italian  --  Edna was impressed by the number of carved walnut cupids she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through it into a dining-room , where silver shone on sideboards and portraits gleamed on walls , and silver and lace and flowers and glass profusedly adorned a long oval table that glowed in clear candlelight . Here you are , Mrs. Jones , ' Mrs. Wintringham 's high voice cried responsibly , on Henry 's right . ' On Henry 's left sat the redoubtable Mrs. Truesdale , andP2I0the dinner for Edna resolved itself into a painfully endless interval of coping with strange forks and stranger conversation , under her civil but faintly curious eyes . Somewhere in the midst of it she met her first artichoke , and suppressed a gasp of amazement as she saw Mrs. Truesdale begin to attack hers with her lily-white fingers . Conversation was general and vivacious , as never on Oakwood Terrace , and Edna soon gathered that nobody cared if she sat in silence . At the opposite end of the table , Paul was entertaining Mrs. McElroy and Mrs. Wintringham . She could n't see Mr. Truesdale and Carol on the left of her hostess , over Mr. McElroy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , after a few perfunctory questions , ignored her . Edna was grateful for this , as very soon and quite definitely the conversation began to be about Art . Insurgency in Art ; Cubism ; and Post-Impressionism . They all seemed to have been to some show at the Art Institute . At this point Mr. Fox disconcerted her by leaning across the table , his dark eyes gleaming behind bone-framed spectacles , to inquire abruptly what she thought of The Nude Descending the Staircase . ' Edna had never heard of it , but everyone else had . She was greatly relieved , after a few shocked moments of listening to their patter , to discover that it was only a picture . Mrs. Truesdale was convinced that its painter was mad . Dismissing him as such , she shrilled a few bright questions down the length of the table to Mrs. Wintringham in regard to her recent experiences in Dr. Riggs 's Sanitarium . Mrs. Wintringham , it appeared  --  though Edna could hardly believe it  --  had been occupied in wood-chopping , as a cure for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest cures to psycho-analysis  --  which she held was disgusting . From what she could understand of it , Edna was sure that it was . She heard for the first time , and with a peculiar creeping discomfort , the word sex ' uttered casually , and other words , new and unmeaning  --  Freudian , ' sub/limation , ' fixation , ' and inferiority complex . ' The latter , she gathered , referred to an obscure spiritual malady , but little suspected that it described her personal predicament and that Jessie , her eleven year-old daughter , was to live to inform her that it did . For the first time , too , when the ladies were settled in the library with their coffee cups , she saw women smoking , and she thought for a moment of Florrie Brophy and the smell in the kitchen of the Brophys ' La Salle Avenue flat . But by this time Edna was feeling a little confused . The cocktail , the sherry , the champagne , and above all the few drops of an innocent-looking cherry-coloured liquid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat anaesthetized her . The women around her were talking with intimate gaiety of people unknown to her . They called them by undignified nicknames  --  Beetle , " Tippy , ; ' Buck , ' Catty , ' and Coco . ' Edna did n't even try to follow . In one brief pause , she essayed a conversation with Carol , who was seated on the sofa beside her . This is a lovely home you have here , Miss Wintringham , ' she observed shyly . Miss Wintringham stared . She was a pretty girl in her early twenties and she stared prettily , with dark , long-lashed eyes . Oh , do you think so ? I want Dad to tear it down and build an apartment and live on top of it . ' Edna stared in her turn , for this was beyond comprehension . As they do in New York , ' said Miss Wintringham casually . And said no more . When the men came in , some women rose and there was a readjustment of chairs and footstools . Mr. Truesdale was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her sofa , he strolled over to her and sat down beside her , still with thatP2I2 amused smile in his kindly eyes . He asked her a good many questions about her children . If she had any and how old they were and what they did on Oakwood Terrace . It seemed he had three children of his own . Cora and Kathleen and Georgie , and Cora was bright , like Jessie , and Mr. Truesdale seemed proud of her . He told her what they did in Lakewoodand how they played with their cousins , Sam and Sally Sewall . He , too , seemed to like large families and he gave Edna a very different impression from the one that she had received from the Society Columns about what went on in a palatial Lakewood home . ' If she could just have subduedthat uncomfortable feeling that he was a very importantpersonage , Edna would really have enjoyed talking to him . She was feeling less confused now , and her depression was lightening . Paul seemed to be having a very good time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had never once flashed at Edna that glance of conjugal intensity , so familiar to her on Oakwood Terrace , meaning that it was time to go home . It was time , though . The hands of the clock on the mantel-shelf stood at five minutes past eleven . Mr. Truesdale 's conversation had died three times and had been revived again amiably , and she had caught him twice looking intently at Mrs. Truesdale , before that lady rose to her feet . We must see more of you , ' she was saying to Paul , very graciously , when Edna joined them . The party broke up then , very much as the parties broke up on Oakwood Terrace , in a little complimentary chorus of farewell . The maid was sitting up in the dressing-room , but she was so occupied with helping Mrs. Truesdale into her cloak of gold brocade and Mrs. McElroy into her cape of brown velvet that Edna slipped into her tan coat unaided . Well , I  --  I 'm certainly glad to have met you ladies , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have met them , now it was all over.  |p213They  nodded , smiled pleasantly and said Good evening . ' Edna was out in the hall as far as the newel post before she remembered that she had forgotten her sequin-covered bag . She turned back to the dressing-room and heard Mrs. McElroy laugh and Mrs. Truesdale say , It 's hard on him . She 's impossible . ' Then Mrs. McElroy said drolly  --  she was droll  --  as droll as her monkey face  --  she had kept the men laughing all evening Wives of great men all remind usWe should leave our wives behind It was n't the first thing that Edna had heard that night that she could n't make head or tail of . One of the most uncomfortablethings about this dinner party had been its incomprehensible jokes . But she was surprised at the startled expression on Mrs. McElroy 's face as that lady perceived her , standing in the doorway . Mrs. Truesdale 's thin lips were frozen in the very midst of her smile . My bag ' Edna faltered . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The maid retrievedit from the settee where she had dropped it . Neither Mrs. McElroy nor Mrs. Truesdale uttered another word until she had left the room . From out by the newel post , she just caught Mrs. McElroy 's whisper , Good Lord ! ' But Paul stepped out from the group of men who were waiting , beyond the knight in armour , and they all said Good evening ' and she forgot the queer feeling of that moment in the dressing-room . Then she and Paul were once more in the vestibule , but the door was left open behind them and he did n't say anything until they were safe in their Cadillac , following the McElroys ' Packard down the cement drive . Then  --  ' Good party , was n't it ? ' he observed . The tone was his casual one , but he looked subtly elated , and Edna knew his words were quite consciously an understatement . Paul had enjoyed himself tremendously . ' Y-yes , ' she said doubtfully . Did n't you like it ? ' Irritation had crept into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Edna assured him hastily . It  --  it was wonderful to see it . ButYou did n't enjoy yourself ? ' She said apologetically , Now , Paul  --  you know me . I could n't talk to them . Not to any of them  --  except Mr. Truesdale . ' Well , he 's a good one to talk to ! ' Paul was laughing now , very good-humouredly . I 'm glad you talked to him . I think I made quite a hit with his wife . ' He had turned into the traffic on the Drive before he continued , still in that casual voice that always indicated to Edna that what he had to say held more importance for him than he was quite willing to admit . Truesdale 's going to put me up for membership in the Lakewood Country Club . ' Edna was very much surprised . Really ? But  --  what will you do there ? ' I 'm going to take up golf , ' said Paul very firmly . So firmly that Edna decided that it would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to go on talking with him about the dinner party . On the whole , she preferrednot to . She felt very tired . If Paul had n't noticed how  --  how different she had looked from all those other women , she would n't open his eyes . She 'd tuck her embarrassmentaway in the farthest corner of her consciousness and just try to forget it . At any rate , it was over . The familiarsight of Oakwood Terrace , asleep in the starlight , convincedher that it was . This was where she belonged  --  this was what she liked what those women at the Wintringhams ' thought about her was unimportant . She was surprised to see that the lower-floor windows of the Peebleses ' house were ablaze with light , though the timeP215was half-past eleven . A folded slip of paper was stuck under the crack of her own front door . She picked it up and read aloud to Paul the pencilled words that were scrawled on it . The play was a knock-out . Jessie was wonderful . The children are at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul went over . Susan had staged an impromptu supper party on coming home from the play . She had brought six or eight of the little actors home with her , with their parents , to talk everything over . They had scrambled eggs and made coffee , and lemonade for the children . When Paul and Edna arrived , the party was just about to break up and go home  --  Junior , indeed , was asleep on a sofa  --  but they all sat down again to rehearse the triumphs of the evening . A chorus of startled compliment rose on the lips of the women  --  they were all near neighbours  --  when Edna removedher tan coat and revealed her sparkling gown , and , though she knew now that there was a higher canon of criticism , their admiration consoled her . It consoled her more to forget the ordeal that she had just put behind her and to listen to their comment on The Merchant of Venice . ' ' l'hey all talked at once and nothing was very clear , but Edna soon gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had never seen Jessie so excited - - nor so pretty . Her small face was flushed , her dark eyes were glowing , as she sat dangling her legs in the folds of I'ortia 's costume , on the edge of the Peebleses ' sitting-room table , Paul 's mortarboard  --  a relic of his graduation from the Northwestern Law School , re-covered by Edna in purple sateen for the purposes of Portia  --  cocked aslant on her straggling hair . Paul 's face , as he looked at her , was excited too , as if he were sharing vicariously in the odd exaltation that invaded his daughter.  | Half an hour later , when Edna joined him in their bedroom , after having tucked Junior away in his bed , Jessie was with him , still talking over the delights of her evening . ' I wish you could have been there , Papa . They clapped and they clappedGo to bed , now , Jessie , ' said Edna . You really must . It 's after twelve o'clock . ' But when the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish we had been there . ' Yes , ' he said , it was a shame to miss it . But I 'm glad we went to the Wintringhams ' . ' As Edna said nothing , he threw a quick glance at her . Are n't you ? ' he added . Oh  --  I do n't know , ' said Edna wearily . You really did n't like it ? ' She hesitated , then plumped out with I did n't feel equal to it . ' Why not ? ' Oh , Paul  --  I 've told you  --  those women  --  I could n't talk to them . ' You could if you 'd make an effort , ' he said reasonably . Edna knew it was useless to challenge that statement . After a moment , he went on , very kindly , ' I want you tomake an effort . I want them to like you . ' They never would , ' said Edna . Why not ? ' he asked again . They think I 'm stupid . And  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsteady . Paul 's was crisply reassuring . My dear , you overestimate them . They 're not very clever . As a matter of fact , Mrs. Wintringham 's quite dull . ' This astonished Edna , but Paul gave her no time to voice her astonishment . He went on eagerly : Now , listen , Edna  --  you must n't be misled by appearances . And you must n't be discouraged by them . As far as women go , they 're justP217a question of the right dressmakers and the right hairdressers . A lot of charming women get by who ca n't really talk . But the cleverest man  --  if he 's married  --  can get to a certain point and then he needs a wife to help him . You see that , do n't you ? ' Edna was n't sure that she did . ' I try to help you , ' she murmured . ' Of course . I know you do . And up to now , I think we 've done pretty well . But  --  ca n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , I was struck by her tonight . I think we ought to plan a little for her  --  for their future . ' ' Plan  --  how ? ' asked Edna , puzzled . He smiled disarmingly , ' Edna , I told you when I married you that I meant to get on in the world . ' ' You told me before that . You told me the first night 1 met you . ' Her eyes grew softer , as she thought of the Blue Island marshes  --  of her own sweet sense of confusion on that tandem bicycle . ' And you have . ' ' So far , ' he said . ' Just as far as Oakwood Terrace . But I do n't mean to stay here forever . ' ' You  --  do n't mean to stay here ? ' Suddenly security was threatened . Her eyes were wide with alarm . ' No . Of course I do n't . What do you think I 've been working for ? I want ' He stopped , abruptly aware ofhe impossibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quietly : ' Well , for one thing , I want the children to grow up to know the kind of people we met tonightand to know them naturally . To take them as a matterf course  --  to have them for their friends . ' ' But , Paul  --  they could n't . ' ' Why could n't they ? It 's really very simple . It 's merelyit matter of neighbourhood and schools . Why should n't theyhave the best ? Why should n't we get it for them ? ' ' But what is the best ? '   Do n't be silly . You know . ' And Edna did . That was the odd thing about it . That is , perhaps , one of the odd things about American democracy . In spite of her affection for her friends on Oakwood Terrace and her liking for the life there , and in spite of her own simplicity and her extreme discomfort that evening at the Wintringham dinner , Edna knew exactly what Paul meant . She believed that there was a best ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl were no more than little girls in the cottage in Blue Island , they had been aware of the romantic existence of a small social group of superior beings who lived on a remote and exalted plane , sustained by the pillars of the society columns . It had never occurred to them that they could scale those pillars and attainthe plane . But they did not question its superiority . She did not question it now . Well  --  what do you want to do about it ? ' she asked dully . Why  --  nothing , yet . I think it 's still their move . But they 'll make it . We 'll see more of the Truesdales . I shouldn'tbe surprised if the McElroys asked us to dinner . After thatWhat ? ' asked Edna despondently . Paul grinned sympathetically down into her woe-begone countenance and made with mock levity the daring suggestion , Why , we might give a dinner ourselves . ' P119PAUL was right , as usual . One evening , some three weeks after the Wintringham party , Mrs. McElroy telephoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on Astor Street . Paul happened to answer her call . He accepted immediately , and Edna resigned herself to the inevitable . She wore , on that occasion , her black lace dress that had seen two winters of wear on Oakwood Terrace . It was a stylish stout ' model  --  price thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents  --  which Edna had bought originally from a rack at a sale at The Fair . Now it was shabby , but thoroughly inconspicuous , and Edna at least felt easy ' in it . It was one of those old stand-bys a woman likes to wear . She was nerved for the worst , but she found the evening less formidable than that of the Wintringham dinner . The smart little house was simpler , the meal was shorter , and the conversation much less of a problem , as they rushed through four courses and coffee and went later to the play . Mrs. McElroy brightly explained that Fritzi Scheff in MademoiselleModiste ' was a concession to Mr. McElroy 's deplorablylow-brow taste in the drama , but Edna thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Edna thought they u ( . re queer ones . As a matter of fact , Mrs. Wintringham would have agreed with her . Mrs. Wintringham 's intellec- tual interests were negligible , but Mrs. McElroy liked to patronize both artists and the arts . On her left that evening sat a red-headed , talkative interior decorator in his middle twenties , lately returned from London , who vied with his hostess in the art of droll retort . Edna thought he looked pretty young to be so interested in Mrs. McElroy  --  hardly more than a boy , in fact , and she must be forty-odd . The other guest was a middle-aged spinster with a lean and hungry look , which came , perhaps , like Cassius 's , from thinking too much , as she turned out to be a novelist of minor renown . Her cream chiffon evening gown was quite as shabby as Edna 's black lace one , but she , too , was talkative . Edna had certainly never expected to meet a novelist at a dinner table  --  nor , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she regarded them both with awe . Mrs. McElroy 's frock was as smart as her conversation , and her round little monkey face kept twinkling up at Paul and the young interior decorator , but she took competent charge of her oddly assorted party . So competent , indeed , that Edna was rather relieved to hear that she was closing her house next week and going to Europe for the summer . Mr. McElroy was moving out to the Lakewood Country Club for June , July , and August . In the absence of his wife , Edna was convinced that Mr. McElroy would present her with no further social complications . On the whole , he seemed bored by his guests and had little to say to any of them , except to Paul . But they did see more of the Truesdales . Paul saw a lot of them at the Lakewood Country Club , that summer of nineteen-thirteen . He developed new week-end habits , which Edna thought were good for him , and for the first time in his life he stayed away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after luncheon in the Cadillac , or catching the twelve-eight train in company withP22IMr . McElroy and George Truesdale and his brother-inlaw , Horace Sewall , lunching at the Club and spending the afternoon on the golf links . He went in for golf quite seriously , applying himself with his accustomed concentration to the instruction of the professional , and by the middle of August he played better than an average game . On Sundays , too , he liked to run out to the Country Club , and he took Edna with him , on the maid 's Sunday in , ' when she could leave the children . They left the house early , after a twelve o'clock luncheon , and the long afternoons in the country sometimes seemed endless to Edna , for there was little to be done at the Country Club that Edna could do . She met Paul 's friends there , but the meetings were casual and never grew into friendships , for Edna could not play tennis or bridge and she did not make much of a success of golf , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her  --  he did not play with women  --  but left her to the ministrations of the dour Scot who was the professional , while he went off on a foursome with three other men . Her lesson over , Edna would wait for him on the wide club verandah . In the early afternoon it was always deserted . She would sit in a cane-seated rocker and look over the empty terrace at the few idle caddies who were laughing . and loitering about the side door of the locker rooms , and wish that she could walk over to talk to them , for the freckled-faced boys in patched knickers and open-necked shirts recalled her Blue Island childhood . They seemed to her the most human inhabitants of the Country Club . But she knew that that would n't do . No one talked to the caddies , and even on the links they treated her with a silent respect which repulsed a friendly overture . So Edna was reduced to gazing , for long hours , at the view . She liked the view , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Skokie River , almost dry in midAugust . It commanded the golf course , which was dotted with bunkers and hazards and sand pits and green rectangles . Here and there a scrub-oak grove or a single shimmering cottonwood broke the monotony of the level plain . To the left were the tennis courts , but they were screened from the verandah by a high hedge of cedars . Edna could not see the players , but she could hear their breathless laughter and their shrill , staccato voices , piercing the country quiet . Sometimes the bridge-players laughed too , but briefly , near the open windows of the lounge behind her . Across the golf course the little figures of golfers moved methodically , pausingto putt with deliberation on the emerald greens , too far away for interest or identification . The flatness of the country and the sense of space above it reminded Edna of the marshland of Blue Island . The wide , western sky was the one she had always known . It was usually brilliant  --  a vault of high , soft blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fair-weather clouds . They moved generally from the southwest , borne on the prevailing summer wind from a thousand miles of cornfields , and always toward sunset they massed a little and sank toward the horizon and became an ethereal Switzerland , rearing white peaks like snowcaps . The sunsets were glorious . The earth grew drab and sank to nothingness . The sky flushed rose and yellow and deepened to purest turquoise . The clouds caught fire and glowed with gold and pink and lavender and incandescent flame . At last the fingers of the setting sun stretched out and gilded the meadowsand the treetops and the white facade of the Country Club and its glittering windows and even the bare boards of its verandah . Colours were intensified , the light grew mellower , then slowly faded . But by that time Edna was no longer alone on the verandah . The bridge tables in the lounge were abandoned , the tennis courts were deserted , and the links were no longer sprinkled with little white figures . The players collected onP223the terrace , motors drew up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were filled with gay groups of people in light summer clothes . They laughed and talked and smoked , and drank orangeades and ginger ale and iced tea and highballs . Edna knew them all , reverently , for the caste of the Society Columns . Some of them she knew to speak to  --  many by name . When Paul came back from the eighteenth hole and met her on the verandah , they usually joined a group and had a drink and talked of his own and other men 's golf scores . Sometimes they stayed at the club for Sunday supper and motored home under the summer stars . Gradually her acquaintance grew and she overcame a littleof her shyness . She met all the Sewall family  --  because they were Paul 's clients  --  and was surprised by their disarmingsimplicity of manner . It matched that of George Truesdale . But when she and Paul lunched one August Saturday with the Truesdales in their big Georgian house on the lake , she was overwhelmed anew by the magnificence of the service and the decor . They went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , on the wide Sewall lawns . Edna was sorry that they could not have had Elmer and Susan Peebles with them on that momentous occasion , for Elmer would have been thrilled by the spectacular display of variegatedbloom in the borders and plots of the garden , and Susan would have lost an eye '  --  to use her own vernacular  --  staring at the women 's gowns . At their hats , too , befloweredand befeathered , and at their ruffled sunshades and their lacy wraps . Edna understood now , more fully , what the fashion writers meant by accessories . ' These women all had gloves and shoes and scarfs and purses to go with every gown . She despaired of imitating them , though she had learned , by this time , the names and the addresses of t he dressmakers they patronized . These dressmakers intrigued her , and during the August sales she lingered with Susan before their august Michigan Avenue portals and gazed in their show windows . But the dignified , liveried doormen filled them with dismay . Susan was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared to enter . But one afternoon , as they faced each other over a marbletoppedtable at Huyler 's and Edna 's favourite refreshment , a double fudge sundae , Edna told Susan she thought perhaps she would  --  in the fall . Paul wants me to get some decent clothes , ' she added , in explanation . Susan eyed Edna in silence , sucking the candied chocolate from her teaspoon . Then she said frankly , Edna  --  this bodes evil . ' What does ? ' Edna inquired . All this . ' Susan gestured vaguely with the teaspoon . The way Paul 's carrying on . He 's biting off more than you can chew . You do n't really like it . ' W-well  --  in a way I do . ' Edna tried to be at once candid and loyal . I mean  --  I guess he 's right . ' About what ? ' Susan dug savagely into her sundae . About the way he wants to live . Those people  --  I expectthey can help him . ' How ? ' asked Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . ' I dare say . But are you after it ? That brings us back where we started from . ' Edna ate her ice-cream for a moment in silence , then said slowly : I  --  do n't  --  know , Susan . You see , Paul wants Well , he wants a lot . He wants it for the children . And I do , too , I guess . I mean  --  in the long run . It would  --  it would be nice for them to know the kind ofpeople Paul likes to go with -- Why ? ' The word interrupted her sharply . Edna was silent . She found it hard to say why  --  in a nutshell.  |p225Susan  persisted , You do n't really enjoy them . ' ' N-no , ' Edna admitted . ' But the whole point of that sort of life is enjoyment . ' Susan made that point triumphantly . ' Y-yes , ' said Edna doubtfully . Her reactions to Paul 's ambitions were far too complex to be expressed with lucidity . After a moment she added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean  --  I can see it 's enjoyable . Really , Susan , those people have lots of fun . They  --  they 're the top  --  do n't you see ? And they know it  --  and that makes them feel good . And you and I know it . That 's the very thing that scares me . You know how I am , Susan  --  I just ca n't think of the right things to say to them . You have to say them quickly , for they do n't pay much attention to you . You see , they 're so busy  --  having fun . They 're nice enoughmost of them  --  but they simply do n't notice you'Stuffed shirts , ' said Susan tersely . ' N-no , ' said Edna . ' Not all of them . ' She looked up helplessly and met Susan 's fiercely independent eyes and thought of her ready tongue and was struck by a new thought . ' Susan , ' she added , ' I think you 'd get on fine with them . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know when I 'm well ufl . I like to mess around at home and look like hell when I want to and do things with Elmer and the kids . I ca n't bear pretension . The smart set 's not my line . ' ' Well , ' said Edna thoughtfully , ' some of them look like hell . Not many , of course  --  but some . I was surprised that there were any . Most of them are awfully particular about looks  --  but they do n't seem to matter , if you really belong . if you do n't  --  like me  --  well , you have to be careful about everything , and that is wearing . But Paul does n't find it so . I le takes to it naturally , and they all like him . The men and the women . ' ' The women especially ? ' Susan was scraping her glass p and her tone was elaborately casual . But her meaning as not lost on Edna . She hastened to reassure her.  | No . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul is about women . They do n't interest him . ' Susan laughed at that . He interests himself more . ' I think he does , ' said Edna . He just wants  --  success . He 's always wanted it . ' Well  --  finished ? ' Susan seemed to dismiss Paul , as she crumpled her paper napkin . Edna nodded and picked up her glass of water . But after she had drunk it , she observed that Susan had not stirred and was still considering her problem . What 's on your mind , Susan ? ' she asked . Oh  --  nothing . ' Susan rose to her feet . But she stood for a moment , quite motionless , looking down at Edna , and then added thoughtfully , Just  --  if it were n't Paul  --  I 'd say he was riding for a fall . ' Mrs. McElroy came back from Europe in early September , with a trunkful of Paris clothes and a fund of accumulated energy , and immediately demonstrated by a second invitation to dinner the fact that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that she had taken a fancy to Paul . Childless , executive , energetic , and idle , Mrs. McElroy was given to such fancies . They were perhaps an expression of a thwarted maternal instinct . She was interested in people and she was at heart good-natured , though , at any moment , under the social provocation of an amused audience , she would sacrifice good nature to a phrase . She liked to make social discoveries and to play Lady Bountiful . She liked to make over other people 's lives . She was very competent about that , and nothing made her feel so pleasantly importantas to try to establish ' young painters and writers and %musicians , and to sponsor their art shows and musicales andP227to listen to their unpublished verse and to persuade gifted amateurs to produce  --  for some worthy charity  --  their unpublished plays . For ten years and more this had caused her husband a good deal of weary annoyance . He came home too often to discover the presence of a lank-haired , low-collared , and cultured young gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea-table , and to find himself involved in considerable gratuitous expenditure . And Sandy McElroy was as Scotch as his name . But Dolly loved it , and she never confined herself to the professional problems of her proteges . That never annoyed her husband , for she was low-keyed emotionally , and was rarely more than flattered by a young man 's personal devotion . Her attitude was archly maternal , but she enjoyed givingintimate counsel and she felt she was at her best when one of her discoveries ' could present her with a love-affair or even a matrimonial tangle that cried for the hand of an executrix . She was often very droll about these confidences later , and would hold dinner parties enthralled while she told side-splitting stories about her waifs and strays and the Gordian knots she had cleverly cut for them . She was a confirmed rusher-in where angels fear to tread , but though she had given a great deal of bad advice and had wasted more money than Sandy liked to think of on promising young artists who had never fulfilled their promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had established , ' at least , a great many young men- and sometimes their wives  --  in Chicago drawing-rooms , but she always lost interest in them when they had found firm footing there . She was a born promoter and would have been conspicuously successful as a mother of marriageable daughters . She sometimes took an interest in other womens ' daughters  --  when a heart affair was at stake  --  and became their confidante and indulgent chaperon , much to the often outspoken irritation of the mothers involved.  | But it greatly astonished her husband when he observed from familiar domestic symptoms , soon after her return from Europe , that she had decided to promote his new junior partner . It relieved him , too , for Paul , at any rate , would prove a self-liquidating venture . But he voiced his astonishment . But what can you do for him ? He 's very able . ' Dolly looked at him pityingly . Men were strangely obtuse . ' My dear  --  he 's utterly helpless . Bound hand and foot . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well  --  what about Edna ? What 's she got to do with it ? He ought to be used to her . They 've been married thirteen years . ' Exactly . She 's Paul 's Plight . And he 's so good to her . I think he 's pathetic . ' But why ? ' Because he 's so attractive . ' Dolly 's voice warmed to it . And he has two nice children . He 's talked to me of his daughter . He 's touching about her . ' Sandy McElroy shrugged unfeelingly . When Dolly had persuaded herself that one of her discoveries was touching , ' it was all over but the shouting . He was thoroughly familiar with his wife 's tenderly patronizing tone . But Paul was n't quite like any other discovery . ' For one thing , Dolly soon learned that he had no time for dalliance over tea-tables . At dinner parties , however , he proved pleasantly confidential . In answer to sympathetic inquiry , he told her a good deal about his self-made youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all reference to the Beulah Orphans ' Home . He mentioned casually , one evening , his oblique but romantic descent from John Paul Jones and Dolly was thrilled by the story . She never once dreamed that it might be apocryphal . It confirmed Paul 's distinguished allure . It confirmed , also , her own powers of discernment in recognizing a modest celebrity , so she spreadp229it widely in North Side drawing-rooms , where Paul was accepted , unquestioningly , as the great-great-nephew of the naval hero . Edna never knew that she was accepted there as Paul 's Plight '  --  for Dolly had thought that phrase too good to be confined to a husband 's ear  --  but she wondered how . the impression about John Paul Jones had been conveyedabroad . Paul told her it was not necessary to deny it . A natural confusion because of my name , ' he summed it up carelessly . Then added , Let it go . Explanations are always stupid . ' Above all , Edna wanted not to be stupid . And no one asked awkward questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , she watched the cordial machinations of Mrs. McElroy with surprise . Without jealousy , however , for Paul 's machinations , too , were very apparent to a wife 's discerning eye , and she knew they had nothing to do with a tender attachment for his promoter . He knew exactly what he wanted , and he set about getting it without any delay . He was the first of Dolly 's proteges to assume the role of protagonist . He asked her advice , but having obtained it he was soon giving her orders . ' I wish you 'd tell Edna where to get some clothes and where to have her hair done , ' he said briskly , one evening . Edna heard him say it across a dinner table , and observed Mrs. McElroy 's quick acquiescence with mingled relief and dismay . They were dining that night with Mr. Fox , in his wellkeptapartment on Hyde Park Boulevard  --  just a small firm dinner . Louis Fox was a middle-aged bachelor , with a keen Semitic mind and a keen Semitic profile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was said to have inherited a considerable fortune from his father in the fur business , and he did himself very well . Edna thought he looked very distinguished in evening dress and she learned that he was a connoisseur of etchings . TheP230walls of his flat were hung with his admirable collection , and he took pleasure in displaying it to Paul . Edna had never seen etchings before . I mean  --  to look at , really , ' she explained apologetically , confronting a room full of Whistlers . They seemed to her oddly unfinished  --  mere lines scrawled carelessly on paper , infinitely inferior to her Gibson pictures . For one thing , they represented such uninteresting subjects  --  bridges , boats , docks , a ramshackle doorway  --  sometimes no more than a horizon where water met the sky . Edna liked pictures that told a story . Mr. Fox treated her with great deference , as he did Mrs. Wintringham and Mrs. McElroy . Mrs. McElroy had preparedher for this in the dressing-room . There 's lots of the Oriental in him still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also told Edna that he had remained single only because he could n't bring himself to marry either a Gentile or a Jewess , so had fallen between two stools . He went out very little in the socialcircles that were graced by the wives of his law partners . But Edna knew that downtown in the office Paul thought him a valuable man . He was a brilliant trial lawyer and he had a wide acquaintance in the Standard Club , and he was a director of the Gruenwalder Bank , and of the Jewish Charities , and of the Salamander Safety Fire Insurance Company , and several of the State Street clothing stores were his personal clients . Every Gentile law firm has to have its Jew , ' Paul had said , when explaining all this to Edna . Just as , ' with a whimsical thought for his old position with Schutzberger , Steinmetz and Stein , every Jewish law firm has to have its Gentile . ' Paul always assumed that he was Nordic . Soon after Mr. Fox 's dinner , Mrs. McElroy called Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take no ' for an answer  --  and made with her a round of the Michigan Avenue dressmakers . This expedition was a great adventure for Edna . Mrs.P231McElroy asked her to call her Dolly ' early in the afternoon . Edna found that difficult  --  after all , Mrs. McElroy was a good ten years older than she was and so very , very stylish  --  but she grew more at ease in answering her friendly questionsabout Jessie and Junior . Mrs. McElroy said she must see that they were invited to join Mr. Bournique 's dancing classes and were put on the lists ' for the Christmas parties . Then she threw out the suggestion that Edna would find that a house on Oakwood Terrace was rather far out to be convenient if she were going to do much on the near North Side . Edna let that suggestion lie just where it fell and hoped that Mrs. McElroy would n't make it to Paul . But she was mainly preoccupied by thoughts of her new clothes . She was grateful for Mrs. McElroy 's support in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressmakers . They were snooty . ' Even though they knew Mrs. McElroy well and obviously respected her as a valuable customer , the ponderousvendeuses who discussed Edna 's wardrobe and the slim , black-gowned mannequins who showed them the models assumed a toplofty manner that left Edna quite crushed . But Dolly McElroy seemed utterly unmoved by them . She was unmoved , too , by the startling digits that Edna perceivedon the price tags . Faced by Edna 's embarrassed protests , she only smiled . I 'm sailing under Paul 's orders , ' she said , and commanded kr her a dark green cloth suit , profusely trimmed with iiiink , and a lace and a velvet and a chiffon evening gown , and a brocade evening wrap , and a black crepe afternoon frock , and told Edna what slippers to wear with them . After that , at another shop , she bought a small dark green felt hat , a large black velvet hat , and a cape of black caracul . That would do , she said , for a start . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stiffer corsets before her first fitting , and told her where sheP232could get them , made to order , for thirty-five dollars . As she spoke she was gazing rather pensively at Edna 's chemise . Edna had put on her best one in order to impress the dressmakers , but Mrs. McElroy added the telephone number of a wonderful little woman who came to the house and fitted you for hand-made French lingerie that looked , my dear , just like the Rue Saint-Honore '  --  which meant nothing to Edna , by way of a recommendation . Not content with that , on the way home in her car , she indicated a shop front chastely adorned by two wax busts of a blonde and a brunettelady , and observed casually , Emile 's the best hairdresserin town . ' Edna was too thankful for all this information to resent the implied criticism , but when Paul came home that evening she was almost afraid to tell him the result of Dolly McElroy'sministrations . He bore up bravely , however , and when her new clothes were delivered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much impressed by them , and said cheerfully , Here 's some good that 's come out of Mammon . ' She told Edna that she looked like a million dollars in her new regalia , and borrowed the black crepe frock to have it copied in blue in the house . To Paul 's satisfaction , the cards soon came that invited Jessie and Junior to join the dancing classes . Jessie enjoyed them and Junior disliked them no more than was normal for a seven-year-old boy . Then Paul decided to trade in the three-year-old Cadillac for a new model with a self-starter , and Edna , a little fearfully , learned to run it in order to get herself and the children to and from their exciting new engagementsand appointments , and tried to adapt herself to this strangely more complicated life . It was n't until after New Year 's Day that Paul spoke seriously about moving . Then Edna took her stand . They were alone together that evening on Oakwood Terrace . Edna was sewing and Paul had been reading in the den . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to . I love this house and I love Oakwood Terrace . After all  --  you 're downtown all day , but I  --  I 'm home . I like the neighbourhood and I like the neighbours and I 'm perfectly devoted to Susan and Elmer . You are , too . If we moved we 'd never see themWhy not ? ' asked Paul suavely . We just would n't . ' Edna 's tone was positive . You know how it was with Hazel and Esther . I 'm still awfully fond of them , but they have n't been up here for months . Life should n't be that way  --  but it is . Everyone 's so busy , you just see the people you 're thrown withExactly , ' said Paul , with the slight , neat smile that he used when he had trapped a witness in a cross-examination . That 's why I make the point I do about the children But Edna was not hampered by the rules of evidence . The smile stung her to retort . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up her sewing again . They 're doing very well in the Public School . At least  --  Junior 's doing better than he did do , and Jessie 's the head of her grade . They both have a grand time playing with the gang here on the Terrace . They 're awfully nice kids . I would n't want a better influence for Jessie than Polly Peebles . There 's nothing wrong with any of themOf course there 's nothing wrong with them . ' Paul checked her flood of eloquence , then paused a moment to give his next words emphasis . But I want them both to learn to live another way . ' Oh , Paul - ' began Edna impatiently . He silenced herwith a gesture . You said yourself , Edna , that Jessie seemed a little at a disadvantage at dancing school . And at the Christmas partiesshe did n't know many children . ' She knows all the children up here , ' said Edna . And her voice held a hint of obstinacy.  | Paul raised his handsome eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be stupid about it . I 'm going to take my place among the big men in this city , and we ca n't go on living as we do . If we go to other people 's houses , we must ask them to our house'I said I 'd give a dinner  --  if I had to , ' observed Edna , but not very graciously . That dinner had been weighing on her mind . How can you ? It 's simply ridiculous . One maid  --  and you half your time in the kitchen , when I 'm making -- He shrugged off the exact sum impatiently as if it were hardly important . It 's all so hugger-mugger . ' It 's not hugger-mugger ! ' Edna 's pride was pricked and her tone was indignant . How can you say so , when you know I 've always  --  I 've always -- Paul gracefully avoided a scene . It 's not that you do n't do all you can , Edna , ' he said kindly . But we do live  --  inadequately . ' I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtfully . Where would you put her ? ' asked Paul practically . Where , indeed ? There was only one servant 's bedroom . And what , for that matter , would another maid do ? It wasall such nonsense . I want to make things easier for you , ' said Paul , very plausibly . Easier ! ' The word was eloquent . Then Paul rose from his armchair . He walked over to Edna and sat down beside her on the davenport . He took the little brown stocking she was darning for Junior from her hands . Look at me , Edna . Do you think I want you to slave all your life  --  like your mother ? Do you think I want Jessie to make a marriage like Pearl 's ? ' She  --  would n't , ' faltered Edna . You know she would n't . ' He 's always felt above my family , she was thinking  - -  p235then angrily , and why should he ? But she felt the quick prick of compunction that always accompanied a thought that was involuntarily a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stammeringly , trying to bury that thought : I 'm sure ShoobShoob does what he can . And I think Mother 's always been a very happy woman . She brought me and Pearl up to be happy  --  happy with you and Shoob . She 's had to work hard  --  but I do n't work as she does . You know I do n't , Paul . You 've done so much for me  --  so much for all of us ' And he had . The thought was buried now . And atoned for , by her gratitude . Then let me do more , ' said Paul , in the voice that always disarmed her . He leaned nearer , his hand still clasping hers . EdnaOh , dear , ' thought Edna , as his arm slipped around her , why not be satisfied ? ' But her head drooped to his shoulder . Her plump , stoutly corseted figure inclined toward his caress . They sat for a long moment like that , on the davenport  --  not lovers , but loving  --  peacefully entwined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paul , but of the children in that very room  --  when they were much littler . Then , We  --  we 've liked it so much here , ' she whispered slowly . We 'll like it everywhere . ' His tone was firm with conviction . But Edna was not convinced . The present swept back on her , displacing the past  --  then the alarming future . She raised her head a little to look around the den at the belovedhousehold objects that surrounded them . She could not see them clearly because of the tears in her eyes . Paul noticedthe tears and the pressure of his arm increased , but with it the pressure of the ambition she could never understand  --  much less cope with . Oh , Paul , ' she sighed , I 'm not like you  --  and you 're always too much for me . ' P236He laughed at that , but tenderly . Paul could afford to be tender . He knew that the battle was won and that they would move in May . It was Mrs. McElroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was  --  as she informed Paul , whom she called up immediately at his office on hearing at a luncheon party that it had gone on the market  --  quite definitely a find . ' He telephoned Edna to join him to look at it and he signed the lease for it that very afternoon . It was only a small grey Palmer house '  --  an infinitesimalitem in the vast Palmer estate  --  but it was not like other Palmer houses , ' which stretched down the North Side side streets in grey and monotonous rows . Grey stone in front , yellow brick in the rear , with protruding bow windows and stone stoops and golden-oak vestibules six feet above the level of the pavement , they were none of them beautiful . They were built in Chicago 's least fortunate architecturalperiod . They were three stories high , with no side light , and they were of identical interior design , with a drawing-roomand a dining-room centring on an inner hall , pitchblackand square , from which a golden-oak staircase tortuouslyascended to the upper floors . Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted . They were all on nice streets , in the restricted neighbourhood that lay south of Lincoln Park between State Street and the lake , and most of them were lived in by what Edna still referred to as the best people . ' Occasionally , in the long grey rows , you came upon a Palmer house ' that was four stories high , or had side light on an alley or a vacant lot , or boasted a front of pale yellow or dark red stone . But these were chance sports that had deviated  --  no one knew why  --  from the normal type , and served only to accentuate the uniformity of the others.  |p237But  the Palmer house ' on Bank Street was one of two only , isolated in a block of larger and much more important houses . It was the last house on the row and its side windows looked east to the Drive and the lake beyond it , over the private lawns of the Potter Palmer castle . Its side wall was finished in grey stone to match its front facade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall had been divided from the staircase by a partition and turned into a library between the drawing-room and the dining-room . It would do very nicely , indeed , for Paul 's den . But the young interior decorator whom Mrs. McElroy recommended  --  he was the same red-headed one with whom she had invited Paul and Edna to dinner  --  did n't call it a den , but a bookroom . He had many strange decorative phrases . In the throes of the moving and her sorrow in parting from Oakwood Terrace , Edna came to lean heavily both on his vocabulary and his taste . His name was William Watson Perkins , but everyone called him Perky . ' He was friendly and frank and extravagant and cheerful . He did everything ' for Edna in settling the new house . The first thing he did was to decide that almost none of the furniture from Oakwood Terrace would do ' in its new surroundings . He banished the shiny Marshall Field mahoganyto limbo . He thought nothing of bird's-eye maple . I le dismissed the Gibson pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not at all nonplussed by the woodwork and grills and the oddly spaced windows of a ' Palmer house . ' l ie had decorated many Palmer houses , ' and he accepted t heir limitations with the philosophy with which one accepts the unfortunate contours of a natural landscape . He was full of bright ideas . He stood in the middle of the small Bank Street drawing-room , nodding his red head confidently , and told Edna that he thought it would be amusing to go in for Chinoiserie . ' Amusement was the last sensation that Edna would have expected to extract from house furnishing , but she assented , bewildered , not trying to understand .   The result astonished her . He papered the walls in a gold Chinese tea paper . Edna could hardly believe him when he said that it came from tea boxes . He spread on the floor a pale tan Chinese rug . It was spotted with large , navy-blue medallions , and spotted , too , with carved teakwood furniture  --  little stiff chairs , small tabourets and tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brocade panel . He concealed Edna 's upright piano beneath another square of brocade . He placed on the golden-oak mantelpiece two chunky Chinese horses , cast in pale grey pottery  --  their price was unbelievable  --  and two red lacquer bowls and a green jade tree . Above them he hung a Chinese Chippendale mirror with a stained old glass that distorted all it reflected , and on his golden walls he tacked four Chinese panels where cherry sprays faintly flowered on a pale tan background . He could not have designed a room less like what Edna thought a drawing-room should be . Even Paul complained privately of the teakwood furniture , which he said was uncomfortable . But the bookroom was more homelike . In it were all Paul 's books and the engraving of John Paul Jones ; the Oriental rug from the Oakwood Terraceparlour , Paul 's desk and armchair , and the davenport , reupholstered to match two new high-backed armchairs in English Tudor tapestries . The dining-room was resplendent in polished Sheraton , which replaced the old-fashioned oak . The cut-glass punchbowl and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new sideboard shone with silver . Perky had helped Paul to select a Georgian tea-set for Edna , four Sheffield candlesticks and a massive silver water pitcher , and two silver compotes ' and an urn for the centre of the table . Edna just loved the silver . She had been moved to tears when Paul brought home the tea-set on her thirtyfourthbirthday . Upstairs , she thought that Perky 's taste was beautiful . He designed her a pale yellow bedroom with shrimp-pinkp239taffeta hangings . But he banished the double brass bed . He replaced it with twin French beds of walnut with cane panels , and he had made to order a taffeta puffed dressingtablewith a pinkish crystal mirror , and he bought a walnut bureau and a walnut framed chaise-longue , and across the foot of the chaise-longue he folded a white fur rug . Paul 's dressing-room , adjoining , was green and was furnished in French Empire , with a Napoleonic pallet in one corner . Edna questioned the pallet and was surprised to gather , obliquely , Perky 's views on modern marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which even twin beds night seem too intimate . The house was small and there were only two other family bedrooms : a large second-floor back one for Jessie , with its own bathroom and her own white painted furniture , and a dormered one for Junior  --  large , too  --  which stretched across the third-floor front . Just back of it , over Paul 's dressing-room , was a bathroom and a little room that Perky said was the nurse 's room , and in the third-floor rear were two servant 's bedrooms , with bath , divided by a partition from the rest of the house . No guest-room  --  which meant that Pearl and Shoob could n't come any more to spend a night away from Blue Island . Not that they did it often , but Edna liked to think t hat they could . It seemed to her ridiculous that so much of t he house should be given over to servants . She could not imagine herself directing three of them . Why , they 'd fall over each other 's feet . Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave her the address of the best North Side intelligence office . Prodded by Paul , but very reluctantly , after half a dozen uncomfortable interviews with women who seemed to know a great deal more about their prospective duties than she did , Edna secured from it a gloomy but competent Swedishcook and waitress and a very firm English nurse .   Junior regarded that last addition to the household with extreme disfavour . After all , he was seven . For the last three years he had been running wild through the back yards of Oakwood Terrace . Now , he learned that after school he was supposed to walk the city sidewalks and the park paths by the side of a blue-caged Nana , meeting other small boys in durance vile , when occasion favoured , and joining with them for an hour of guarded play . The boys were all right  --  he knew some of them at his new school ; but the Nanas sat on park benches and told them not to unbutton their reefers and not to lose their caps and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Junior could bear . The week that they had moved , Mrs. McElroy had capablyinserted both children into the Latin School for the last six weeks of the term . Jessie 's new schoolmates all lived in the neighbourhood and Jessie was not hampered by Nana . Every afternoon she went to one of their houses to play . Nice houses , on Astor Street and State Street , and the Drive , and the side streets that joined them . Edna was surprised by how little she seemed to miss Polly Peebles . Edna missed Susan at every turn . She missed her smile and her sympathy and her trenchant comments on everyday happenings . When Jessie 's first report came home , with its customary complement of A 's and B-pluses , Edna did not understand why it was made out in the name of Jessica Jones . She questionedher daughter and the child replied frankly . Miss Eccles asked me if Jessie was n't a nickname . The first day I was there she asked me my real name . They do n't like nicknames . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , ' said Jessie glibly , what Jessie was a nicknameof . And she said Jessica and she called me Jessica . They all call me Jessica . I like it much better . " Jessie Jones " sounds so silly . ' It 's your name , just the same , ' said Edna tartly . Your name  --  like Grandma's. '  |p241Well  , I do n't like it . I think Jessica 's prettier . ' I 'll explain to Miss Eccles , ' said Edna . Put I do n't want you to , ' said Jessie . She took it up with her father and surprisingly he agreed with her . I like it myself , ' he said . I never cared for Jessie . ' And to Edna 's remonstrance , Oh , let it go , Edna . Children often have such fancies . ' But Edna knew that it was more than a fancy . Next day she heard a scuffle in the corridor . Junior was whining and Jessie was hissing , Jessica  --  Jessica  --  Jessica ! I 'll pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn . ' And Junior did learn  --  slowly  --  and so did Nana , and Paul took up the name , as if in fun . Jessie ' became no more than Edna 's pet name for her daughter , except in the presence of Mrs. Losser . Mrs. Losser and Pearl came in to see the new house long before it was really settled . They were very much astonished by the reckless expenditure that the moving had involved . Faddy , ' was Mrs. Losser 's comment on the Chinese drawing-room . She could not understand why it had been necessary to engage Perky to furnish it . Your old things were so lovely , ' she said wistfully . Well  --  some of them are upstairs , ' said Edna , and the rest are in the cellar . I was wondering if perhaps you and Pearl could n't use the piano lamp and the parlour settee and the Morris chair and the vanity from the guest-roomThey thought that they could . And the brass bed as well , and the fumed oak from the dining-room . Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny mahogany from the old lavender guest-room had been divided between Junior'sroom and Nana 's . The cook and the waitress had the bird's-eye maple . Mrs. Losser clucked her dismay over that . But she and Pearl were both deeply impressed by the silver , and they thought that the view from the side windows up to the Potter Palmer turrets was lovely .   Edna agreed with them . They 're beautiful in moonlight , ' she said solemnly . I think they must be like Europe . ' Pearl nodded thoughtfully . Like castles on the Rhine . ' One of the five or six German books that Shoob had inheritedfrom his mother had steel engravings in it of those castles  --  each with a little sheet of tissue paper in front of it . He prized the book highly , but Pearl could n't read it because it was written in German . Nevertheless , she and Shoob hoped some day to see the Rhine . Pearl did n't know when or how , for a violinist could n't put much by . And there was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would put orchestras out of business . In the meantime she was grateful for the piano lamp and the vanity and the oak table and the six side chairs that matched it . But she thought that her mother should have the brass bed . The springs of the big black-walnut one , in which Pearl and Edna had been born , sagged badly after thirty-nine years of service . And the settee and the Morris chair would cheer up the Losser parlour , which needed cheering . William Losser had been trying very hard , these last years , to save money . He was sixty-five years old and he talked a good deal about his pension . But it would n't amount to much . Pearl sighed and stood staring out the windows of the bookroom at the Potter Palmer lawns . It was simply wonderful what Paul had done for Edna . Settling her now in a high-class neighbourhood like this . Pearl sort of guessed that Paul would look out for his father-in-law . Shoob would n't have to shoulder it . The summer was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , and Perky left town for Mount Desert Island . He had abandoned a trip to England , becauseof the war . The change in his plans  --  for Perky was garrulous and discussed them freely with anyone who would listen  --  brought home to Edna the fact that a war was occurringthat might affect Americans . Up to that time she had n't paid much attention to it , though Paul was interested . P243She had been too busy hemming window curtains to hear the shot at Sarajevo in the early part of the summer , and she still ignored the newspapers . England  --  France  --  Germany  --  even now they were no more to Edna than the irregularcoloured shapes in her old school geography . Susan seemed to be excited , on the rare occasions when she saw her . Violently pro-English  --  though she had never been to England . She had formed her impressions of what she called our mother country ' from the books that she had read . Edna , however , had no idea how high feeling could run  --  for Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the end of September , began to return from the mountains and the seaside and to open their town houses . Pro-Ally sympathy , she gathered , was much stronger on the Atlantic seaboard than it was in the West . Everyone she met had a German atrocity to relate . Mrs. McElroy came home from Bar Harbour with a thrilling story of the interned Kronprinzessin Cecilie , the queen of the German merchant marine , which had anchored in Frenchman 's Bay , right under her very windows . She had run there to cover when England entered the war , with several of Mrs. McElroy 's friends on board who had been sailing to Europe . Mrs. McElroy made the most of it . My dear  --  those German officers  --  just the sight of them made me sick . They looked so brutal . And they went swaggering around the village , talking German together Edna really felt that Mrs. McElroy had been in the war lone . She was not surprised when , with her accustomed energy , she immediately exerted herself in behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantial contribution . Later in the autumn , Edna joined , with Mrs. McElroy , a group of women who rolled bandages for the Red Cross . They met every Tuesdayand Thursday morning in Mrs. Wintringham 's ballroom , on the third floor of the Lake Shore Drive house ,  | and worked busily at long tables . Paul made a contribution to that cause also , and Edna enjoyed the bandage rolling . She was very good at it . Fourteen years of housework had given her deft hands . The women all wore costume  --  white aprons and blue veils set into starched headbands with a red cross over the forehead  --  and they beguiled the long hours of their mission of mercy with gossip  --  and the atrocities . Edna came to know some of them quite well  --  the war at least did that for her  --  and her tongue was slowly loosed . She talked of Paul , whom everyone admired , and of the children , and once  --  but only once  --  to Mrs. McElroy of her family in Blue Island . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Mrs. Shoob Schultz . Mrs. Franz Schubert Schultz , ' Edna corrected herself . For Shoob ' did n't sound very dignified . ' A  --  German ? ' inquired Mrs. McElroy , in a tone so pained that Edna knew what was the trouble . A German-American . He 's an American citizen , ' she added hastily . His father came from Leipsic . ' Oh ' said Mrs. McElroy , and abandoned the conversation . Edna knew she was thinking that Shoob was an international spy . Mrs. McElroy was not alone in regarding Shoob with suspicion . He 'd had a little trouble with his orchestra , whose leader was named O'Flaherty . The second violin was a Frenchman , Lucien Foucher , who had bowed his fiddle by Shoob 's elbow for years . For this reason Shoob resented the trouble . He thought that he could count on his old friend 's sanity and he had n't the sense to keep his mouth shut . He fought the Battle of the Marne over again with little Mr. Foucher and said that only luck had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgian babies and the violated Belgian nuns . He talked of war psychology.  |p245He  had the temerity to say that Germans were just like other people . It worried Pearl . It worried Edna , too , and she knew that it worried her mother . It would be a serious matter if Shoob lost his job . Already , insidiously  --  as it did on all those who were connected with German-Americans  --  the perception was beginning to creep over her that the war was important - even in America . It presented a question of cleavage . It might have far-flung consequences . It was n't just a matter of rolling bandages in Mrs. Wintringham 's ballroom for the right side . What those consequences might be , Edna could not imagine  --  for still she did not concentrate on the newspapers  --  but a vague uneasiness loomed . At home , Paul talked of uncertainty and tumbling stock prices . He was beginning to take an interest in the market . Nevertheless , that winter of 1914  --  15 was gayer than any Edna had yet known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave , finally and with many misgivings on the part of Edna , two or three dinners themselves . She came to know a good many people well enough to speak to without terror at a party . But the new neighbours were not what Edna called neighbourly . Very few of them came to call . She did not know the names of several who lived on the same block with her . Bank Street was not a community like Oakwood Terrace . Her acquaintance was widely scattered and there was no informal running in and out of front doors . Back doors did not exist , of course , except for the use of servants and tradesmen . Edna felt oddly out of iflace in her own kitchen . Her cook could cook better than she could and she made it plain that she considered Edna an interloper when she peered in her own icebox . She preferred to come upstairs to take the day 's orders on the threshold of the taffeta-hung bedroom . She telephoned to the market and the grocery . The waitress could  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , when she had observed the hysterical flurry in which Edna had reviewed the preparations for her first dinner party , her cold Swedish eye had held a steely glint that was faintly that of humour . You may safely leave it to me , madam , ' was what she had said . But even more disquieting was the British reserve of Nana that was slowly but surely building an invisible wall around the daily doings of Junior . She planned every moment of his day . Exercise  --  fresh air  --  a light supper  --  an early bedtime . Good things in themselves , but they removed Junior from all intimate companionship with Edna . Mornings in school , afternoons in the park , and supper on a tray in the nursery . Paul asked to have the dinner hour set later and later , and seldom came home until after seven o'clock . He had joined the Chicago Club  - -  put up by Horace Sewall  --  and he liked to drop in there for a cocktail , when office hours were over . All this , Edna thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked back to the days on Oakwood Terrace , when she was busier , to be sure , but had only to open a window or step out on the back stoop to see or hear the children playing somewhere in the vicinity , and when they were always running into the kitchen to ask for a doughnut or a cooky or an apple , and Paul helped Jessie with her home work in the den in the evenings , while she tried to keep Junior quiet . But Paul still occasionally did that . Jessie , in second-year high school , found her lessons interesting , and Paul enjoyed stimulating that interest . At thirteen and a half she seemed older than her age . Socially advanced , ' Miss Eccles put it , in the parlance of a pedagogue . The girls in her grade were all one or two years her senior and many of them were the children of Edna 's new acquaintances , but she entered into their activities without any sense of strain . She danced with their brothersp247at dancing school and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner  --  Jessie ate with her parents , of course , which made only the more of an immature pariah of Junior in the nursery  --  the telephone was very apt to ring . If Edna answered it , she was quite as likely to hear a boy 's breaking voice as a girl 's piping one inquiring , Can I speak to Jessica ? ' The conversations that followed were interminable and distressingly audible , for the telephone closet was under the hall staircase . They sometimes annoyed Paul . I wish she would n't giggle , ' he would say , irascibly rustling his newspaper . But Edna seemed to remember that she and Pearl had ( lone a good deal of giggling when they were Jessie 's age . The adolescent awakening of her slim , dark daughter , so unlikeherself , made her think of her own girlhood . Of the boys in Blue Island , and of Shoob 's first attentions to her big sister , and sometimes , very secretly and a little shamefacedly , of Al . Al  --  Al Reimer  --  the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Edna thought of him , and the thought was like the homecoming of an old friend , for Edna had n't remembered him in years . She remembered him now , however  --  weedy , inarticulate , shy , but with eloquent grey eyes , thickly fringed with those odd yellow lashes . She remembered his straight blond hair , slickly parted in the middle , and his short chin with a cleft in it , and his scarlet neckties , and just how his slope-shouldered figure had looked in his blue brakeman 's uniform . She remembered his devotion and despair . He was gone on me , all right she reflected simply , but not without pride , and saw him once more in the light of a street-lamp , walking quickly away from her on the night of his declaration on the Blue Island street-corner . I wonder what 's become of him , ' she thought , sighing unconsciously for the quick flight of youth  --  then glancing at Paul to see if he had noticed it . He had n't , of course . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how cross he 'd once been over Al . Jealous , really . Now , it did n't seem possible . Paul  --  jealous of a brake-man ! But much of that early life did n't seem possible in the house on Bank Street . Even when Edna went out to Blue Island to see her parents  --  which she did pretty often , but not often enough , considering that her mother was sixty - she found it hard to connect her girlish experience with the lot of her middle years . No one she saw now , but Paul , had any conception of the discipline of poverty and plain living  --  and he seemed to have forgotten it . The cottage looked small and shabby , her father 's depot dingy , her mother 's life seemed meagre . Often Edna felt guiltily that she , too , had learned to forget . At moments like that , she sometimes stared at Jessie and Junior with a startled realization of how different their background was from that of their own parents . There must be a gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the years would widen and only affection span . Edna held firmly to affection as the knot that would unite a family . In the spring , when Junior was eight and a half , she took her courage in hand and dismissed an astonished Nana , replacing her with a housemaid who would help wait on table at the ever more frequent dinner parties , and keep her clothes , as well as Jessie 's in order  --  and let junior alone . This crisis exhausted her emotionally , but when it was over she felt better about the family . And junior 's spirits revived , though he was seldom as clean as he used to be and his tables manners relapsed rapidly from Nana 's norm . But then the Lusitania was sunk and the flame of the nation 's anger swept over the country , and the Losser family was caught by it . For Shoob would say that she wasp249carrying munitions and was fair game for a torpedo , and he lost his job with his orchestra . Paul said he was a fool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But later , when Shoob could get only an occasional engagement with his fiddle at a German Turn-verein , Paul made Pearl a little allowance and she accepted it thankfully . But the cost of living was rising and Shoob had to keep up his life insurance , so he sold the small , two-story , red-brick house that he had inherited from his mother , and he and Pearl and the dachshundSchnitzel , who was an old dog now , went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Losser in the frame cottage . Pearl said they were very comfortable there in the bedroom that she had once shared with Edna . But when Edna went out with a new print frock she had bought to cheer her up , she found her crying alone , over Schnitzel . Pearl was thirty-eight years old and perhaps , if Shoob could n't hold a job , it was a mercy that she had no children . But it seemed very pathetic to Edna that there was only Schnitzel to cry over . And the fact that he was a dachshund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice day for the picnic , ' said Edna . She was sitting at the breakfast table behind her Georgian silver coffee pot , with her eyes fixed absently on Junior , who was pouring too much syrup on his waffles . She decided she would n't mention it . It would only annoy Paul . Jessie was eating her poached egg very neatly . Her table manners had improved so rapidly in the course of the last six months that they gave Edna hope for Junior . She could n't see Paul at the other end of the table . Just his lean hands supporting the screen of the Tribune . Jessie said , indifferently , What time do they start ? ' Oh , they 're off by now . The boat sailed at seven-thirty . Aunt Pearl did n't see how they were ever going to catch it . ' I wish I could of gone , ' said Junior , finally spilling the syrup . Careful , ' said Edna , but mildly . She smiled on her son . She wished she could have taken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spree . The Western Electric Company had planned a gala excursion for its employees to Michigan City and had charted two lake steamers for the day . Shoob had a young Polish friend , Jo Kubiac , who was a draughtsman for the company , and Jo had wangled a job for Shoob in one of the bands . Shoobp251had persuaded Pearl , and Pearl had persuaded Mr. and Mrs. Losser , to buy tickets  --  price seventy-five cents  --  and join the party . They all liked Jo and his young wife Rosie , and Mrs. Losser thought that Pearl needed the pickme-upof a little pleasure . Pearl said she 'd go if her father would  --  he 'd been feeling the cruel July heat  --  so William Losser had taken a day off . He had n't had one since the Saturday last August , when he and Pearl and Mrs. Losser had gone to Riverview to eat hot dogs and ride the roller coasters . The baggage master that the Road had installed in the depot with the growth of population in Blue Island could spell him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his watch from his pocket . Twenty minutes to nine , ' he said . I 've got to be off . ' Good-bye , dear , ' said Edna placidly . Do n't hurry in this heat . ' As she spoke , her eyes strayed to the strip of blue lake water that she could see from her dining-room windows over green lawns through the fringe of the Drive 's elm trees . She just loved a boat trip , but she knew that Paul would never have approved of this one . He 'd think a company picnic was pretty plebeian . He was beginning to have ideas that were definite on what he wished , and did n't wish , his wife to do . Then , Hand me the paper , Jessie , ' she added . She wanted to glance at Lillian Russell 's ' Beauty Secrets . ' Ignoring the war news , she turned the pages until she found the heading , Be Careful Of Your I lair , ' and settled back comfortably to read . A woman 's crowning glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring in the hall . Paul , at the front door , stepped back to answer it . Sheheard him say Hello ? ' Then , after a brief pause , Yes -- What ?  - -  What ? ' with sudden emphasis . There wasanother pause , much longer , broken finally by Paul 's voice , strangely altered  --  tense , yet subdued . My God !  - -   No No , we have n't . The ' phone has n't rung  - -  Yes , you 'd better Yes , I think that 's the best thing todo . I 'll wait for you here  - -  I 'll go back with you -- How is she ? Yes , of course . We 'll be ready for her  - -  - I 'll tell Edna -- Keep your nerve , old man . You can'tbe sure I do n't believe -- Of course , I ca n't realizeit -- All right , Shoob . Good-bye . ' At the name Shoob , ' Edna , already alarmed and listening , had risen from her chair . She heard Paul 's step in the hall . In the doorway he paused . She met his shocked eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl --  ? ' she faltered . No . Not Pearl . ' He moved quickly to meet her . Sit down , Edna . ' His hand was on her arm . Not since the day that Jessie was born had she read such concern in his glance . She sank back in her chair , her body trembling . She was conscious of the children 's faces turned toward them  --  blank  --  questioning . Tell me , ' she whispered . But he stood silent , frowning unconsciously , as if he did n't know just how to say what must be said . She tried to speak again and could n't . She felt her lips move , soundlessly . After an instant , The Eastland turned over at her dock an hour ago , ' he said . " He  --  Eastland ? ' she questioned , stupidly . The words meant nothing to her . The boat  --  the excursion boat . ' Then she understood  --  if you could call it understanding . She gasped , That  --  that 's not possible . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ? In the river ? ' He nodded gravely . ' They were all on board . They were thrown into the water , separated somehow . Shoob was n't very clear . Anyhow , he 's got Pearl . They 're safe . ButP253'Mother  --  and Father ? ' whispered Edna . Then sharply , ' Paul  --  tell me ! ' ' I ca n't tell you . I do n't know . Shoob did n't know . He 's been looking for them looking for Pearl , too . He foundher , in the crowd . He 's bringing her up here in a cab . She 's all right , but she was in the water three quarters of an hour . He called up from a drugstore to ask if we 'd heard from  --  if anyone had telephoned . There 's a great mob down there , milling around . He said there was a panic . It 's perfectly possible that they 're all all right  --  saved , I mean  --  and could n't find each other . He said there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe'Twenty-five  --  hundred  --  people ? ' Edna 's lips moved stiffly . Paul nodded . ' All  --  in the water ? ' ' Yes . Men , women , and children . So you can see Paul 's voice was steadier now . It was almost plausible . Edna buried her face in her arms on the table , trying not to see the picture that his words had evoked . She felt the pressure of his hand on her shoulder and heard the children 's voices  --  questions flung excitedly at Paul and gravely answered . ' Yes  --  in the river , Jessica . Near the Clark Street Bridge . I do n't know how deep , Junior . I could n't say . ( if course they 'll be saved . Lots of them  --  most of them . Why , they were right next to the dock  --  within arm 's reach of the shore . You know how many boats there always are in the river . And people on the bridges .

' And ncle Shoob ! '   Of course . And there 'd be lots of others who could , too . And lifeboats and life-preservers and rafts -- Edna raised her head . Her eyes were tearless . She said tonelessly , I want to go down there . ' Paul patted her arm . My dear  --  you ca n't . And what would you do ? ' I 'd look for them . I might see them . In the crowd or  --  in the water . ' Her voice was still flat and lifeless . My dear girl , they would n't let you get within sight of the water . The police will rope off the mob . ' What will you do ? ' Go back there with Shoob . ' ' But if I 'll get to the dock , somehow . ' She knew that he would , Take me , ' she said . He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be all in . ' Edna rose to her feet , leaning heavily on the table . Her knees were shaking . She felt weak  --  exhausted  --  like an old woman . The realization of the calamity was slowly coming home to her , in all its implications . She saw her mother drowning  --  her father 's white face lifeless  --  Pearl and herself orphaned . Parents  --  died , of course . All parents did . But not like this . Not helpless  --  in terror and panic . In that clear moment of revelation , she knew that they were dead . Paul said gently : You must think of Pearl . She 'll be here in a minute . ' With a visible effort she forced her mind from that desperate inner vision . She said vaguely , Yes , we ought to get ready for her . ' Practical planning  --  always the soul 's salvation . I 'll put her to bed in our room , Paul . ' She touched the bell on the table . When the waitress came , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ready for her . ' She had never given an order with so much composure . The girl 's eyes widened , startled . As she left the room , Edna turned again to Paul . Should I call a doctor ? ' ' We might try . I guess they 're all down there , though , from this part of town . ' He looked a little puzzled by her unnatural calm . Just then the doorbell rang . The children rushed from the room , Paul only a step behind them . Edna reached the hall as Jessie flung open the front door . Paul 's tall figure was blocking the doorway . Junior 's yellow head was bobbing at his elbow . Then Edna pushed by them . In the bright July sunshine , on the broad grey stone step , Pearl and Shoob were standing . The taxi was still at the curb . Edna 's first thought was , stupidly , I 'd forgotten they would be wet . ' They were drenched  --  sodden . Seen against the orderly perspective of Bank Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neat Palmer houses '  --  their demoralized appearance was monstrous . Shoob 's shoddy blue suit clung to his thin body . He had no hat . His fair , wavy hair was plastered to his skull . His shoes oozed water on the pale doorstone . His arm was around Pearl , supporting her . She needed support . The new print frock that Edna had given her was moulded to her gaunt figure . The sheer silk was saturated and the colours had darkened and the dye had run . The skirt was torn and the blouse was stained with muddy slime , and one of her shoes was missing . Like Shoob , she had no hat . Her hair was soaked , flattened over her high forehead , where a hruise was darkening , and her puffs of false curls were mere dripping strings of hair , dankly awry , straggling down her neck . All this Edna saw in a glance  --  and then Pearl 's face . It was yellow-white , dazed , vacant , her wide lips Hue , her pale eyes void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her in her arms . She stood on the doorstep holding her , not thinking at all , conscious only of the thick wave of heat reflected from the stone steps , and the sun beating down on them , and Pearl 's damp body . Then Paul came forward . He helped Pearl , stumbling , into the relative coolness of the dark front hall . She sank on the nearest chair and began to cry helplessly . Oh , Edna --  she sobbed . Mother  --  I  --  I lost her and FatherHush , Pearl ! Wait . Do n't try to tell us --  ' Then Edna saw that Paul had brought some whiskey from the dinning-room sideboard . He was handing her a glass . ' Make her take this . ' His voice was quick and cool , like that of a doctor . He was pouring Shoob a drink . Pearl took it , obediently . After a moment , she was able to hold the glass in her own hand . She drank the whiskey , shuddering . Edna looked up at Shoob and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth were chattering on the edge of his glass . He sat down suddenly on the bottom step of the stairs , and smiled foolishly . I guess I 'm kind of done up , ' he said . Paul took command of the situation . You come upstairs with me . I 'll get you some dry clothes . ' With Edna at his heels , he helped Pearl up the staircase to Edna 's bedroom . He pushed Jessie and Junior before him from the room . A moment later , as she was stripping Pearl , Edna heard his voice and Shoob 's in the dressing-room . Pearl heard it , too . Oh , they ought to go back there , ' she moaned . She was still crying . Crying and shuddering and trying to talk . They will , Pearl . They will . Now , do n't you say anything more until you 're safely in bed , ' said Edna . But she , too , felt that every minute was precious . She was filling a hot-water bottle for Pearl 's feet from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl was shivering  --  when Shoob came in , with Paul . How d ' you feel , Pearl ? ' he asked solicitously , bending over the bed . The comedy of his figure , in a suit of Paul 's clothes that was much too large for him , contrasted weirdly with the anxiety of his face . Oh , Shoob , ' wailed Pearl from her pillows , please go back ! You should n't have come up with me . ' We 're going back , ' said Paul . I 've called a cab . ' Then , turning to Edna : I 've been talking to Jessica . She 's right on the job . She wants to help and she 's taking Junior up to the park to see the animals . I told her to stay away until lunch-time . Now '  --  he smiled uncertainly , looking from Edna 's pale face to Pearl 's wan one  --  will you two girls he all right ? I want you to take it easy . ' Easy ! ' sobbed Pearl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Paul 's voice was brightly reassuring . We 'll telephone any news . I wish you 'd call up my office , Edna , and say what 's happened . And you might ring the doctorI do n't want a doctor , ' put in Pearl . I just want you to go ' There 's the cab , Shoob ! ' Paul was glancing out of the window . Roth men kissed their wives . A moment later , Edna waved tremulously to them from the window . Then she went downstairs to telephone to Paul 's secretary . Jessie . uid Junior had already left the house . When she came back to the bedroom , she thought that Pearl looked more tranquil , and certainly her colour was better . It was a relief to know that Paul and Shoob had gone ; that everything was being done that could be . From the clock on the bed table , Edna observed that it was only half-past nine . Fifty minutes since Shoob had telephoned . It seemed like days . She sat down wearily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her own to the clock . Just  --  two  --  hours , ' said Pearl slowly , since we were standing on the dock  --  looking up at that boat . ' Edna said nothing , and after a moment Pearl added , We almost missed it . ' Then she began crying again , but quietly . Wiping her eyes , she said brokenly : We might just as well have been on the Theodore Roosevelt , Edna . That was the other boat . It was right there . But Shoob 's band was assigned to the Eastland I think you 'd better not talk just yet , ' said Edna . She made herself say it . She wanted desperately to know every detail that Pearl had to tell . ' Talking 's better than thinking about it , ' said Pearl . Then , after a long pause , Father 's drowned , I know . But possibly Mother Her voice failed her . Then Edna began crying . Great tears gathered in her eyes and ran down her cheeks , unheeded . She forgot her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , tell me  --  tell me from the beginning ! ' For a moment Pearl lay motionless , her head thrown back on the pillow , not looking at Edna . The beginning was fine , ' she said . She spoke slowly , wearily , as if she were trying to preserve and recapture her early impressions of the morning  --  to disassociate them from the horror that had followed . It was a lovely day . We got up awfully early  --  not long after five  --  and we caught the six-ten train to town . We almost  --  did n't . Mother had to leave the breakfast dishes unwashed . And that bothered her . She kept talking about it on the train . You know she always liked to leave the house as neat as a pin . But when we got down to the dock , she forgot about it . It all seemed so gay . The crowd , you know  --  and that early morning feeling . Not hot yet . Down on the wharves we could smell the fresh water . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edna . ' P259A big crowd ? ' Yes . The streets had been empty  --  it was so early . But down on the dock there was a perfect mob . All out for fun  --  boys in duck pants and men without coats and women in wash dresses . Lots of women with children . Mostly family parties . ' Her voice dropped a little and lost its detached note . The Kubiacs had their baby . ' Oh , Pearl ! ' Edna 's eyes widened , then clouded in pity . Oddly enough it was the Kubiacs ' baby that brought home to her the first acute realization that this was more than a personal tragedy . What happened to it ? ' I do n't know . Drowned , I guess . ' Pearl 's tone was as laconic as her words , but her mouth was quivering . It was only eight months old . It looked awfully cute . Rosie had made a hat for it  --  its first hat  --  out of white pique , because she thought the sun would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all went up on the top deck , because that was where the band was . Shoob went straight to the band . The rest of us pushed through the crowd and Jo found two chairs for Mother and Rosie , right next to the rail . Then Father said he 'd go downstairsand check the lunch basket . Everyone was checking the lunch . It was hard to hold it , and the top deck was hot with the sun beating down on it , and Mother thought the mayonnaise would spoil . Rosie said she 'd go with him . She had the baby 's bottles in a pail on ice , but the ice was melting , and she thought maybe she could find an icebox. jo said he 'd go , but she said no , the baby needed changing and she 'd take him down to the ladies ' room . So she went along with Father and took the baby and the bottles with her . ' So  --  that was how they were separated , thought Edna . She had n't understood it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then what happened ? ' she asked .   Pearl answered quite matter-of-factly . Why , nothing happened for a few minutes . I took Rosie 's seat , and Jo went off to see if he could find any more chairs . You could hardly move on deck . It was just jammed . But everyone was very good-natured  --  laughing and talking and yelling after children , and some were waving at friends on the other boat , and the band had begun playing -- Mother and just sat there and listened to the band . We looked over the rail at the dock and saw the gangplank pulled in , and the line that held the back of the boat cast off , and five or six people arriving too late to get on board . They were arguing with the ticket-taker when the boat swung out from the dock  --  sideways , because the line that held it in front was still tied . And then  --  it seemed to sway a little . Not much , but I noticed it . I remember thinking it was funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watching a tug that was chugging around in front of us . It was tied to us by a rope . I guess it was going to tow us out into the harbour . And then --  ' Pearl paused , with an effect that was as dramaticas it was unconscious . She paused and drew a long breath and leaned up on her elbow on the pillow . She stared at Edna intently , her pale brows contracted in a little frown . Beneath them her eyes looked puzzled . Then it gets so I ca n't tell it very well , ' she said . The boat began to heel over . Slowly at first , so you did n't believe it was happening  --  and then quicker . The deck slanted horribly and our chairs slipped . I reached out and grabbed the rail and I saw Mother grab it . We neither of us said anything . And then , there must have been an instant of silence  --  maybe nobody said anything  --  for I heard the band , much louder . It was still playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams began . Suddenly everyone screamed  --  and slipped  --  and fell down , all jumbled up , on top of each other . And the deck was a hill . And inside theP261boat there was a great roar , above the screams , of heavy things falling . And our chairs caved in and slid out from under us . I saw Mother 's hand slipping away from the rail . I saw her face . She just looked  --  surprised . I tried to catch hold of her , but I could n't  --  and then there was a sort of lurch , and my hand slipped , too . I fell down on other people and the deck was sloping up above me . I saw two men dive , over our heads . And then  --  there was the water . I was in it  --  with people all around me . I tried to swim but I ca n't do more than two or three strokes , and I kepthitting people . They were everywhere  --  beside me and beneath me  --  struggling and fighting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I came up and went under again . And then a man got hold of me  --  a bald-headed man . I never saw him before . His face looked perfectly wild , and he shouted , " Do n't struggle ! " and he held me up , at arm 's length , for a minute . But I guess I did struggle , and he pushed me off . I sank , of course , but when I came up he shoved a crate at me . Just a rough , yellow peach crate that was floating by in the river . It almost went under with me , but not quite . I hung on to it and coughed and choked , and when I 'd got my breath again I pulled myself up and lay with my chest on it , like a raft . It was all under water , but it raised me a little , and then I looked around for Mother and Shoob . ' Did  --  did you see them ? ' Edna 's words were breathless . No , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked like , Edna . Something in hell . The water was just thick with bobbing heads  --  people splashing and struggling . But the screams had stopped . You ca n't scream when you 're drowning . Except on the boat . There was screaming there . I t had turned clear over , on its side , and the river was n't very deep , so it just lay there , half out of water . Some of the people were hanging on to the chairs that had slipped off i t s decks and some had climbed up on its hull . But it must have been hard to do that , because there were n't many women there . Mostly men  --  and a lot of little boys . I was n't more than fifty feet away from it , and I saw Jo Kubiac , for a minute . He was kneeling over a porthole , I think  --  he must have smashed the glass somehow  --  and he was just yelling into that huge hull like a madman , and I knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Father , caught somewhere inside . I felt sure he was drowned , though I saw some men dragging a few women out of another porthole . ' Oh , Pearl , ' gasped Edna , I do n't see how you  --  livedYou want to live , ' said Pearl . You fight to live . I do n't know why , but you do . It must have been just about then that a man grabbed my waist and felt the crate under me and tried to pull himself up on it and it began to sink . I fought then , Edna . It was like a nightmare . He was awfully strong , but I had the crate . I kicked him off and he started to go under , but then he caught hold of my leg . He was pulling me down , from beneath , but I struggled and his hand slipped down to my foot and I kicked and suddenly my shoe came off and he  --  he just disappeared . After a minute I realized that I 'd drowned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hated to think of him under me . I was glad I was floating with the current . It did n't take long . Jo Kubiac was still yelling when I looked back at the boat . I was floating downstream  --  upstream , rather  --  you know the funny way the Chicago River flows . I could see the people crowded on the bridge and hear the trolley-cars running over it and even the rumble of the " El " on the Wells Street Bridge beyond . The docks were jammed , by then , with people watching , and the windows of the warehouses . Some people were even on the roofs . ' Edna shuddered at the thought of those impotent watchers . And they could n't help you ? ' P263Oh , ' said Pearl , they tried . The river was full of things by that time . The Roosevelt had lowered its lifeboats and some of the Eastland 's had swung free from the davits . Women were hanging on to them and men were climbing into them . I saw life-rafts floating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all along the docks the stevedores were flinging boxes and chairs and ladders and barrels into the water  --  anything that would float  --  and people were clutching them . I guess that 's where my crate came from . Or maybe it was on the Eastland . And other boats came  --  the tug was there , you know , and a steamer called the Petosky  --  I saw its name on a lifeboat . But by this time there were ever so many fewer heads bobbing around and almost no splashes . And I began to be sure that Mother had drowned  --  and Shoob , too , maybe . And I thought of Father again , inside that black hulk . There were firemen on top of it now , cutting through the steel plates with some kind of a flame . But the people inside it  --  even if they were n't drowned  --  must all have been terribly injured . I could n't believeBut , Pearl  --  what happened ? To you , I mean ? ' Oh after a while I was dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess  --  just in time . I was getting awfully tired and my hands ached and I hardly knew what was happening . It was full of survivors . The thought came over me , as they dumped me down on top of them , that I was a survivor . They had to carry me up on land . They laid me down on a baggage truck , near a big pile of fruit crates . I could smell peaches  --  and the smell of that kindling wood they make crates out of . I just lay there and smelled it and felt the sun slowly warming me . I guess I was hardly conscious . And then Shoob came . ' ' He found you there ? ' Yes . He 'd been looking everywhere . Pushing through the crowd and staring at dead bodies . There was fightingP264on the dock , too , just like there was in the river . Mothers looking for children and men looking for wives . Shoob was all right . He 'd dived in , as soon as the band stopped playing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They dug their heels into the deck and went on with the tune . Shoob said he did n't know why  --  they just felt they had to . But then he dived , and he swam around a long time , looking for me and Mother . But he could n't find us . And when he saw bodies being carried up , he went on shore . He thought we were all dead  --  before he found mePearl 's voice died down so definitely that Edna was alarmed . Then Pearl fell back from her elbow and lay relaxed , her long body stretched beneath the smooth sheets in a line of utter lassitude . Her face looked very yellow against the white pillows  --  drawn and exhausted . Edna rose to her feet . I wonder you 're not dead , ' she said gravely .. But you 're not  --  so maybe Mother is n't . And even Father  - -  Remember , Pearl , you saw some people brought out of that boat alive . I 'm going to go on hoping --  ' Severely , she disciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get hold of a doctor . And order you an eggnog . You must drink it , Pearl . ' Pearl made no remonstrance . The hands of the clock on the bed table stood at three minutes past ten . Edna thought desperately of the lagging minutes , the creeping hours , of vigil that lay ahead of them . But Pearl was living  --  preserved to share that vigil . Edna was deeply moved by her inert presence . Facing this sorrow they shared the common memories of childhood . In some ways , as you grew older , there was no one so close to you as a sister . Even back in Blue Island , before they were married , Edna had never felt nearer to Pearl . P265At two o'clock that afternoon , the telephone rang and Edna answered it . All morning she had been waiting for that ring . She had answered other rings , hope struggling with fear , only to be disappointed . But this was Paul 's voice . Yes , ' she said breathlessly , ' it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've found your mother . ' ' Living ? ' she gasped . The pause , no more than instantaneous , was terrible to live through . Then Paul 's voice answered tonelessly , ' No , Edna . Dead . ' She closed her eyes . She leaned against the wall of the telephone closet : . Thought was , for an instant , suspended . Paul 's quiet words went on . She died  --  quickly , I think . There 's no mark  --  no sign of a struggle , ' Then , as she did not speak , his voice rose anxiously , ' Edna  --  are you all right ? Are you there ? ' She said dully , ' Where did you find her ? ' Again there was a pause . When Paul spoke his tone was a little constrained , ' They  --  threw a wire net across the river at La Salle Street . You know there 's quite a current . It was there ' ' I see , ' said Edna . She tried to see . She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies from the river bottom . She could not see it . She said vaguely , What are you going to do ? ' Go on looking ' said Paul tersely . ' Shoob 's making the  - -  arrangements . About your mother . He 's pretty well exhausted , by this time . He ca n't stand much more of this . I think he 'd better go back to Pearl when he 's finished . But how are you , Edna ? How 's Pearl ? ' ' Oh  --  we 're all right . Pearl 's resting . She just droppedP268been recovered from the river . Four hundred and thirteen men , women , and children were reported missing . Seven hundred were known to be safe . The papers were strewn about Edna 's taffeta-hung bedroom . All afternoon , she had never thought of them , but now she read them , horrified , learning more gruesome details of the tragedy than the workers on the dock could learn from their work . The three-inch headlines shouted .

They waited patiently , all signs of panic stilled , for the doors of the vast death-chamber to open . The faces of the mourners , indeed , could be distinguished by their dulled apathy from those of the sensation-seekers who mingled in the crowd . A moment before eleven the figure of Coroner Peter Hoffman appeared before the doors of the Armoury . Paul recognized him instantly , in the dim light of the street-lamps , and others did too , for the mob surged forward . He raised his hand for silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go away and let those who are seeking for relatives and friends come in and identify their dead . ' The words rang out solemnly , yet terse with official authority . The mob fell back . Twenty at a time , the searchers were admitted to the Armoury . In less than a minute a line began to form on the sidewalk that stretched the length of the block . As the moments passed , the line grew longer and longer . It was there , in the farther corner of the Armoury , that Paul found the little body of his father-in-law . A strange young man had already identified it . Paul did not know him . I le was standing by a litter not far away , with his own dead . A woman and a baby  --  a young woman , with long dark hair that straggled over her shoulders and over the child in her arms . ' I  --  I 'm a friend of Shoob 's , ' the young man said brokenly . He did not add his name , and Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his story , Shoob told him who it must have been . Edna heard him , and thought that the name completed the perfect cycle of her misery . She had not known the Kubiacs and their baby meant nothing to her . But it seemed peculiarly pointless and poignant that it should have perished with its mother in the Eastland disaster . And strangely enough , it was of that baby she was thinking  --  and its little pique hat -- when two hours later , in a cot in Junior 's nursery , she dropped into a troubled sleep . For the next three weeks the arrangements ' that follow death in all well-regulated families took much of Edna 's attention . You would n't have thought , she often reflected , that in the little estate of William and Jessie Losser there would be so much to arrange . But there was William 's life insurance , and William 's will  --  leaving everything to his wife and the cottage to Pearl after her death ; the absence of Jessie 's will  --  she had never made one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to which had survived the other . Edna settled that question by assigning to Pearl her rights in the real estate  --  by far the most valuable asset  --  as soon as Paul informed her that it could be so settled . She gave Pearl , too , her share in her father 's insurance and savings . But still there was the question of the cottage itself . Should it be sold , or could Shoob and Pearl afford to live in it ? Probably not , unless Shoob soon found work , but Edna urged them to try . Paul said he 'd help out by increasing Pearl 's allowance , but Shoob did n't think that was right , for Pearl now possessed all William Losser 's cash assets , amounting to nearly seven thousand dollars . Paul said they ought to put that aside for a nest egg ; and live so that they would n't have to touch it . Family discussions were prolongedand waxed almost acrimonious  --  everyone was tryingso hard to do the generous thing . Edna went into deep mourning and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the double funeral in BlueP271Island both women were cocoons of black voile . Paul hated black and urged Edna to take the veil off her hat as soon as the funeral was over . He said that he did n't believe in oldfashionedmourning ; that nobody wore it any longer ; that it had gone out with the war . Over in Europe , he 'd heard  --  in England , anyway  --  women wore colours in a month or two after the death of a son or a husband , and went right on going out to parties , keeping the stiff upper lip that had made the Empire famous . I 'd keep my lip stiff if I wanted it stiff , ' said Edna , with rare spirit . But I do n't . ' It 's only a convention , ' said Paul persuasively . A survivalof barbarism , really . ' It 's not a convention , ' said Edna . It 's just  --  the way I feel . ' It would do you good to go out and see people . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to see anyone but Pearl  --  and Susan . ' For Susan Peebles had been , as usual , a bulwark . She and Elmer had come to see Edna the day before the funeral , and since then Edna had been up to spend several days with her  --  and with her own memories  --  on Oakwood Terrace . Susan had loved Mrs. Losser . But Edna 's main worry was Pearl . She 's not well enough yet , Paul , to do her own cooking and cleaning . I wish we had an extra room , so she and Shoob could stay with us . ' Paul shrugged off that suggestion . It was really very queer , thought Edna  --  he 'd been so kind and so capable in he hour of tragedy  --  someone to depend on utterly . But now that that hour was lived through , he wanted to put it behind him . Sometimes Edna suspected that Paul would never really miss her mother and father , then banished that suspicion because she did n't like to think that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as , for instance ,   did Shoob . Shoob still could n't keep his mind off the disaster , but Paul rarely spoke of it . Edna could see that it annoyed him when anyone mentioned it in public . That made Edna very uncomfortable , too , but her feeling could scarcely be defined as annoyance . Dolly McElroy , who called with pink roses , had inquired , But , Edna , how did your parents happen to be on a boat like the Eastland ? ' And Paul had changed the subject before she could explain . Edna was grateful for that , of course . She certainly did not want to tell the whole dreadful story to Doily McElroy , but she saw very clearly that Paul was  --  yes  - -  ashamed to have his new friends know that her father and mother were going on an excursion with the employees of the Western Electric Company and that her brother-in-law was a member of the band . She did n't mind so much what Paul thought of Shoob , but to be ashamed of the dead was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the new friends were kind . They left cards and wrote notes and sent flowers , and Dolly McElroy joined Paul in urging Edna to Iighten her mourning . The McElroys had taken a house in Lakewood for the summer , and Dolly wanted Paul to rent a little cottage at the club . She knew a perfect one that he could get from the middle of August through September . It would be nice for the children to be with their friends , and it would do Edna good to go out to a few informal parties . Get her out of herself , ' she said . Edna told Dolly McElroy that she simply could n't face all those people in the club dining-room . Dolly smiled sympathetically ; but , My dear , ' she said wisely , you ca n't keep a man like Paul Iocked up for months , while you sit home in crepe . I mean  --  is it fair ? I 'm sure I wish Sandy were more like him . He 'd like me to go into perpetual mourning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly vetoed the club cottage . Jessie went offP273to visit a schoolmate at a camp in Wisconsin , and Junior played rather forlornly in the deserted streets of the neighbourhood . Paul stayed home , pleasantly enough , on the summer evenings , reading his paper or a volume of biography at an open window . Except on Saturday evenings . On Saturday afternoon , Paul always went out to Lakewood to the club . Sometimes he spent the night there and played golf all Sunday , returning for Sunday supper on Bank Street , looking tanned and rested and healthy . There were always lots of people at the club , but Paul rarely told Edna what he had done the night before and she seldom asked him . Though Dolly McElroy 's warning remained with her disquietingly . She was thinking these things over one Saturday afternoon , in the Chinese drawing-room , and feeling rather worriedand lonely , when the maid brought in the mail . Edna had no correspondents , and the postman never left anything at her door but bills , invitations , and advertisements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some momentsin her hand . Then her glance fell carelessly on the top one , and something about it arrested her attention . It wasn'tthat the handwriting was familiar , though it wakened some vague echo in Edna 's consciousness ; it was rather that it was different from the handwriting that she was accustomed to seeing on envelopes of late . It was straggling and a little uncertain . It had n't the brisk competence of a confirmedsocial note writer , and it was obviously written with none too good a pen . The paper , too , was different  --  cheap drugstore note-paper , pulpy in the fingers . Here and there , on a down stroke of the pen , the ink had run into it . It looked something , indeed , like one of the very rare letters that Edna had received from her father on an occasional birthday , though the writing was the rounded type of her own public school generation  --  not her father 's sloping Spencerian hand . The envelope had been forwarded by Pearl from Blue Island.  | She opened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined note-paper that it contained and read , first in utter bewilderment , then in breathless excitement , the lines that were written on them . Dear Edna , I read some time ago in a list in the papers that your father and mother were drowned in the Eastland disaster and I 've been meaning to write to you ever since . I was certainly sorry to hear it . You and Pearl must feel very bad about it . I rememberthem both so well . Your mother was always great to me and your father used to talk to me about the Rock IslandRoad and tell me there was no opportunity for a young man any better than the railroads . I guess he was right . I got nothing to complain of . I am a conductor now on the Southern Pacific and I got a good run on one of the crack trains between Los Angeles and San Francisco .

The Coast is all right and Nelly do n't miss Kansas much any more , but I 'd like to get back East and see the old folks in Moline and all you in Blue Island . I just wanted to send you my condolences and let you and Pearl know I was thinking of you . There 's no friends like old friends . Yours trulyALLOS ANGELES. /lug. 27 , 1915 . P.S. Al Reimer  --  in case you have forgotten . The flimsy lined paper almost dropped from Edna 's fingers . She was so  --  surprised ! Al Reimer  --  in case you have forgotten . ' She was laughing a little . But she 'd bet Al was laughing when he wrote that line . Maybe not , though . Maybe he was n't . Maybe he was remembering well , more than he said he remembered . Nice of Al to write thatP275letter  --  to be sorry about the Eastland  --  to think of herand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that about her father and mother . Well , they deserved it . Her mother had thought a lot of Al . Her father had prophesied big things for him . And here he had turned out just like her father had said he would . Conductor on a crack train on the Coast  --  sitting pretty . And married . Edna assured herself earnestly that she was glad he was married . But she wondered what Nelly was like . Married for seven years , he 'd said  --  Edna counted on her fingers  --  that meant that for eight he 'd stayed single . Eight years was a long time in a young man 's heart . On the whole , Edna felt quite pleased with herself . And two kids  --  a girl and a boy , like hers . No  --  referringagain to his letter  --  she guessed the boy was the older . Al Junior  --  she wondered if he looked like Al , Those eyelashes were too good to waste on a boy , ' she thought ; I hope Nell 's got ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna summoned all the resources of her powers of deduction to picture Nelly 's looks . Knew her three years before he married her , ' she reflected wisely . ' Not love at first sight . I bet her face would n't stop the traffic . He must have learned to love her . But I hope she makes him happy . ' For  --  Gee , Al deserved to be happy ! I le was a good kid . Edna 's thoughts were racing joyously in the vernacular ) f her girlhood . My  --  she 'd like to see Al again ! Some day , perhaps she would . If he did come back East , he 'd find Pearl in Blue Island . How Pearl would laugh at that letter ! It would do her good . It would take her back . ' Pearl used to laugh so much with Shoob and Edna and Al . She 'd certainly laugh now over that in case you have forgotten . ' ' Well , ' thought Edna , still in breathless , happy exciteent , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I 'll ell him all about Pearl and Shoob  --  and Paul and the children is But then something jolted her . She looked down at the letter . Yes  --  oh , dear !  --  Al had forgotten to give her any address . Just Los Angeles  --  and that was a big city . Her excitement suddenly dropped . How could he have forgotten ? He 'd never know , now , how much his letter had meant to her  --  and that she remembered everything ; but was glad about Nelly and wanted to meet her , if they ever came to Blue Island . Oh  --  why did he forget ? She thought doubtfully , ' I suppose I might reach him through the railroad . ' But she was n't sure . And then , she wondered . She drew a long breath and wondered if Al could have done it on purpose . He wanted to write  --  he wanted to remind her . But  --  she thought of Al 's reticent make-up . She thought of Nelly and Paul . Was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address a certainshy delicacy that distinguished between romance and reality  --  that preferred to keep the Edna that she had been distinct from the Edna that she was . Maybe he did n't want to start anything , ' she thought . I 'd write  --  and I suppose he 'd answer . And I 'd write again . But there 'd be Nelly and Paul . Paul would just think I was crazy  --  and Nellie 'd be a wonder if she could understand . I guess  --  I guess it 's better if we leave it all in Blue Island in 19oo . ' She sighed at the thought , but not unhappily , for it was a romantic one , and fell to thinking seriously of Al as he had been , and of herself at twenty . She thought of Paul , and traced in order the procession of the years . It brought her girlhood nearer . Of late , Edna Jones had seemed too far removed from Edna Losser  --  who was the real Edna . But I 'm just the same person , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what happens to us . ' In that reflection , in her shifting world , she found a comfortablestability . It blended , too , with her simple memories of her father and mother . Al 's letter had warmed her heart . It recalled a day , when , as she looked back on it now , lovep277had been all around her . It had done much to integrate her past and her present . And it occupied her evening , which would otherwise have been lonely . For it was one of the evenings on which Paul stayed out in Lakewood , and just before dinner she received a telegram that informed her that Jessie was prolonging her visit in Wisconsin , and Junior went early to bed.  |p278WELL  , I certainly do n't want to move again , ' said Edna . But I think we ought to be with him . ' Susan Peebles nodded her approval . No one knows how long the war will last . ' Pearl said : He might be in Washington for years , Edna . I know Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred by the Road , she never had any patience with the wives who stayed home and let their husbands live in board-ing-houses . ' Two years and two months had elapsed since the Eastland tragedy , but Pearl and Edna still often referred to their mother . Her opinions would guide them as long as they lived . ' Elmer Peebles chuckled . I bet Paul is n't in any boarding-house . ' No , ' said Shoob seriously , he has rooms in the Shoreham Hotel . ' They were sitting in the bookroom on a September evening  --  just the five of them , with Schnitzel , the dachshund . School had begun last week , and junior was upstairs doing his home work . Ten days before , in a fever of joyous anticipation , Jessie had left home for boarding-school . She had entered Broadmoor-on-Hudson , together with Kathleen , thep279younger daughter of Mrs. George Truesdale , who had told Paul about the exclusive establishment , so well run by Miss Stackpole , on the banks of the Hudson River . Her elder daughter , Cora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just made a war marriage with young Alan MacLeod , the son of the first vice-president of the Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company  --  had graduated from it only the June before . Paul had been in Washington most of the summer , making fleeting visits to Bank Street and his law office , when his war work permitted . Paul had taken up war work as soon as war was declared . He had busied himself with the Draft Board in Chicago through May and June , with his accustomedenergy . He had worked nights at his law , as he had in the old days , in order to save daylight hours for this new interest . He was tremendously interested in the idea of universalmilitary service . He was a great admirer of Woodrow Wilson , and heart and soul in favour of the entrance of the United States into the war . Early in July , he had been called to Washington to serve on the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the Army . The Adjutant General was in command of it , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna and Jessie and Junior that the work of the committee was to find the right jobs for the right men in the army . All sorts and classes of men had flooded into the camps . Clerks , engineers , day labourers , professionalmen , hordes of young boys with no particular training . The Committee on Classification of Personnel assigned such of them as had special qualifications above that of mere cannon fodder to particular positions as repair men , truck drivers , balloonists , aviators , officers ' chauffeurs , accountants , machinists It was an endless and complicated task and Paul loved it . He liked living in Washington , he wrote Edna . It was interesting  --  stimulating ; he was meetngthe men who were running the country . Men who would run the world , perhaps , now we had joined the war . Paul had no doubt that Wilson was right . This war would end war , and out of it would come a confederacy of nations , es tablished on the sound rock of democracy , in which the weak would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions would be stronger than others , Paul admitted  - -  tor the Huns must be disarmed and the Russians must be disciplined ; but , though the world would be a democracy , the statesmen of the future would govern it and themselves on the oldest and most gracious of aristocratic principles  -- noblesseoblige . Edna missed Paul on Bank Street , and she missed Jessie , who had flitted from one house party to another all summer . On her sixteenth birthday she had turned up her hair . I t was knotted on her neck beneath a barrette and two hairpins . She had dropped her skirts three inches . She had really seemed a young lady when Edna saw her off at the station for Broadmoor-on-Hudson , with pretty Kathleen Truesdale . Paul approved of that intimacy . But there were compensations for living without Paul on Bank Street , and even for Jessie 's departure . The child had no sooner gone than Edna had put up the cot bed in her daughter 's bedroom and invited Pearl and Shoob and the dachshund to spend two weeks in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as she liked of Pearl and Susan , and as little as she liked of other people . And Shoob needed cheering . His professional difficulties had not been helped by the fact that the country had entered the war . Not since the Lusitania sank had he had what could be called a steady position . Just work now and then . He and Pearl were scraping along somehow in the Losser cottage . And of late Shoob had fallen strangely silent in the face of war talk . He had n't argued at all with Susan , this evening , when she extolled the British . She had said , apologetically , Of course I know how you feel , Shoob , about the Germans ,  | ing his black-and-tan body . His coat gleamed sleek in the lamplight . Pearl was always brushing him . Shoob smiled down at the look of abject adoration , slightly tempered by sleep , in the dog 's yellow eyes . Shoob , ' said Edna , would you mind going ' round to the drugstore on Clark Street ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothbrush . I meant to get it this afternoon . His old one 's a disgrace . ' Sure , I 'll go , ' said Shoob , from the doorway . The dachshund , knowing perfectly well that a stroll was in the offing , had preceded him into the hall . A Prophylactic toothbrush ! ' Edna called after the two of them . When the front door had closed , Susan said , Pearl , I do n't think Shoob looks very well . ' He 's well enough , ' said Pearl , but he 's worried . ' What 's he worried about ? ' Well , of course , ' said Pearl , he 's always worried about money . But he 's worried now about the war . ' Because he thinks Germany 's going to get licked ? She will be , of course , but ' The words were Elmer 's . That partly , ' said Pearl , but that 's not all . ' For a moment she said nothing more  --  just sat looking discouraged in her high-backed armchair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you  --  not even you , Edna  --  know what Shoob 's been going through , these last three years . He 's awfully proud of Germany , and I can see why . After all , she 's fighting the world . She almost conquered it . She would have , surely , if we had n't gone into the war . His father was German  --  and his mother  --  and he 's got six cousins , fightingin the German army . At least he did have . He doesn'tknow what 's become of them . But that is n't the trouble he never saw any of them . It 's just  --  just something inside . He feels German . He ca n't help it . At least , he did . But nowp283Now ? ' repeated Elmer . He looked interested . Now we 've gone in  --  ca n't you see how it tears him to pieces ? Shoob 's been taking it all seriously since 1914  --  none of the rest of you did . I mean  --  it was Shoob 's war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something about itDo what ? ' asked Elmer . Pearl met his eyes . Her own were very troubled . Then her glance shifted to Edna . I have n't said anything about this , Edna , ' she said , because it is n't settled . I mean , I think he 's crazy . But he thinks he should enlist . ' ' Enlist ? ' Edna started forward in her armchair . Why , Pearl , he 's forty-two ! ' I know , ' said Pearl . But I do n't think any of you know what 's been going on for three years and more in GermanAmericans . They 're sick of being called Huns . They 're sick of having all their old friends think they 're traitors and spies ! ' Pearl 's voice had risen hysterically . With an effort she controlledit , and said , more quietly : Shoob 's a good American . But this is n't just patriotism  --  it 's self-justification . He wants to prove that a man can feel the way he did about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own when it comes to war . He wants Oh , I guess he wants people to think well of him again ! It 's terrible , is n't it ? I said  --  I think he 's crazyBut , my goodness ! ' said Edna . We  --  we must n't let him . ' She was thinking that Paul would say that this was utter folly . He ca n't leave you , Pearl . And he 's too old , anyway . I mean  --  what good would it do ? ' Because Junior was only ten , there was no tremulous overtone in Edna 's voice , as she ended triumphantly , The army wants boys ! ' As if answering her subconscious thought of him , Junior appeared in the doorway . He slung his schoolbooks on Paul 's desk and advanced into the room . A thin little boy ,  | pale-eyed , light-haired , with a mild expression that vividly recalled the face of William Losser . I 'm hungry , ' he said . Edna had dismissed the housemaid as a war economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the minor compensations for Paul 's absence that she now knew more of what was going on in her own house . She knew that minute that there was a jelly-roll in the pantry cake-box . And root beer on ice . She rose to her feet . Let 's all have a little snack , ' she said . Come on , Susan  --  you help me . ' They had entered the dining-room , when the front doorbellrang violently . That 's Shoob ! ' called Edna . Elmer 's voice answered , I 'll go to the door . ' Edna had opened the pantry icebox and Susan was cutting the cake , when Edna heard Pearl 's voice , Shoob ! Oh - - Shoob ! ' raised in anguished outcry . As she swung the pantrydoor open , she heard Junior crying . With Susan at her heels she rushed into the hall . From the doorway of the bookroom she saw that Shoob had , indeed , returned and that Pearl and Elmer had risen to their feet and that something seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ davenport with his face pressed tightly into its Tudor tapestrycushions , and the room was loud with his crying . His shoulders were shaking , his thin legs were twisted , as if in pain . Edna ran to his side . Junior ? ' she cried . Then Pearl said , Edna  --  look ! ' Her voice was thick with tears . Edna turned then , and saw for the first time , as Elmer moved from in front of him , that Shoob was holding Schnitzelin his arms . The sleek , dark body of the dog was stained with mud and was drooping strangely . A cut was bleeding on his haunches . His tapering tail hung slack . His head wasp285concealed by Shoob 's shoulder , but as Shoob turned , Edna saw  --  and knew what was the matter with Junior  --  that that head was bleeding too , bleeding badly . The mouth was crushed  --  the eyes were glazed . As she stared , Shoob fumbled in his pocket with his free hand and pulled out a rumpled handkerchief and spread it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stammered sorrowfully . A motor , she thought  --  some death-dealing driver . Then she noticed Shoob 's expression . His face was very white  --  his eyes stern and angry . And the hand that held the dog was red with blood . Shoob  --  you 're hurt , too ! ' Oh , Shoob  --  are you ? ' Pearl sprang forward , to look at his hand . Elmer took the dead dog gently and laid him on the floor , in a corner . Susan sat down on the edge of the davenport and began patting junior 's shoulder . It 's badly crushed , ' said Pearl . Her voice sounded worried . What happened , Shoob ? ' asked Susan , over her shoulder . Relieved of the weight of the dog , Shoob 's slim body was wavering strangely . Elmer pushed him down in an armchair before he could reply . He threw a concerned glance at Edna . She ran for warm water and a towel . When she came back , Junior was sitting upright on the sofa , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quietly . Shoob was leaning back in his armchair , with his eyes shut , whiter than before and obviously faint . Pearl was kneeling beside him and Elmer was hovering over her . They both looked anxious . Edna put her basin of water on the floor and picked up Shoob 's hand . It was badly bruised and swelling rapidly , and the flesh on three fingers was cruelly macerated . The fingers were stiff and numb . Broken bones , thought Edna . Shoob winced as she bathed them . Presently they were clean . Run upstairs , junior , ' said Edna , and get me the alcoholand the antiseptic gauze from the blue box in my bathroomcupboard. '  |p286Shoob  did n't say anything till Junior had returned . He sat with his eyes closed , looking weak and sick , and he groaned a little , as Edna bandaged his fingers . Then , Shoob  --  what was it ? What happened ? ' asked Pearl . Her anxiety over Shoob relieved , she glanced at poor Schnitzel , in the corner . For eight years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears . It was  --  unspeakable , ' said Shoob . His voice held a dazed note of horror . He opened his eyes and looked up at them all for a moment in silence , then said quietly , ' Schnitzelwas stoned to death . ' Stoned ? ' The incredulous cry was Edna 's . Shoob nodded solemnly . Stoned , ' he repeated . Stoned by a crowd of boys . Six or eight of them  --  young toughs . They caught sight of him when we were walking west on Goethe Street  --  Goethe Street , ' he repeated in a tone so anguished that Edna wondered if his wits were wandering . Then he added , bitterly , That 's a good place to stone a dachshund to death . ' But  --  why ? ' stammered Edna . Why ? Because he was a German dog  --  that 's all . Becausehe was a German . I 'll believe all you tell me now , about the war atrocities . If here  --  in Chicago ' His words were choked with emotion . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Schnitzel ? He did n't do anything . He was just out of my arms . He was n't very quick any more , you know , and even here on these quiet streets I was always afraid of motors . So I carried him across State Street at the Goethe Street corner , and then I put him down on the sidewalk and he began to run ahead . A group of boys were standing around the alley in the middle of the block , and when they saw him they called out , " Hello , Fritzy ! Why  --  it 's Hans the Hun ! He 's the Crown Prince 's dog ! " And one of them let fly a stone . It did n't hit him , but it scared him , and he startedp287to run back to me , and then one of them kicked him , and he dodged down the alley . They started after him , yelling , and I started after them . The alley was dark , but I could see them . He had n't run very far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of broken bricks , and they were shouting and flinging bricks at him . I ran up to them , furious , and I said " Du Lieber Gott ! " God help me ! I do n't know why I said it . I guess it was all Germany rising up in me . And when they heard the German they jeered , and I hit one of them , and two of them hit me . They went on flinging bricks and 1 ran to Schnitzel . But he 'd fallen over perhaps he was dead already  --  I could n't see  --  I do n't think he knew me . I do n't remember any brick hitting my hand . But I guess one did , for when they ran away  --  they did in a minute  --  it was hurting and bleeding , and I saw Schnitzel 's head was crushed and I knew he was  --  done for . I picked him up then , and walked back with him  --  out of the alley and up Goethe Street and home . ' My God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes wide and distressed . Pearl was crying helplessly . Junior had risen from the sofa . He had been listening , open-mouthed , to his uncle 's sorry tale . He turned now , and walked over to the dead dog and knelt down beside him , sobbing in deep childish gasps , and patting the sleek black-and-tan coat between the mud patches , with his thin little hand . I think , ' said Edna soberly , we ought to let a doctor look at your hand , Shoob . I 'm afraid of infection . ' No one made any objection . And when the doctor came and saw Shoob 's fingers and heard the story , he said he thought that Shoob had better come around with him to the I Henrotin Hospital and have it properly dressed . Pearl went with him , and Edna tried to comfort Junior . Susan and Elmerwent out into Edna 's back yard with the furnaceman'sshovel and , in the September starlight , dug Schnitzel a grave.  |p288But  when Pearl came back , she said she wanted to bury Schnitzel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was going to spend the night in the hospital and take every precaution , for two of his fingers were broken and one was badly crushed . His left hand , too , Edna , ' said Pearl apprehensively . His violin fingers . ' Edna had not thought until then about Shoob 's violin . The next day they buried Schnitzel in the back yard , after all , for Shoob 's hand was giving him trouble ; he was a little feverish and Pearl did not like to leave him . He 'd gone all to pieces when he 'd realized what was at stake . Three days later , his third left-hand finger was amputated just above the knuckle . The other two had been set , but they would always be stiff . Shoob never again could be a first violinist . To be sure , he could not enlist , either , and join the fighting forces that were waging war against Germany . Maimed men were fighting in France , but on this side of the water the recruiting sergeants were more particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next paid a fleeting visit to his family , he felt the time had come to make a desperate effort in behalf of his brother-in-law . And it 's really easier to get him a job , ' he told Edna practically , when he ca n't insist on playing that fiddle . ' For Shoob , through all adversity , had been determined to stick to his violin . Music meant everything to him . Before he 'd give it up , Pearl always had said , he 'd starve . Paul spoke to his friend , Horace Sewall , and found Shoob a job in the vaults of the Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company . There , buried beneath the bank and the city pavements , he stood all day , with keys in his mutilated hand , escorting depositors to their security boxes . The salary was fair . But Shoob did n't seem well , and Pearl was worried about him . She thought it was too much for him to commute back and forth from Blue Island . There was a great deal of agitatedp289family discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she should , and then George Truesdale , who was in real estate , helped Paul to find a very good offer  --  too good to be rejected . So Edna helped Pearl to empty the cottage and settled her in a four-room flat with a sun porch in town , not far from Oakwood Terrace , where Susan could look after her . For Paul had decided to move his family to Washington . The excitement over this decision helped Edna to face the sad fact that the home of her childhood : was passing out of the family . Her years on Bank Street had been a period of violent change in much that was nearest to her . She was almost glad to leave the house  --  except for her furniture . But their lease was still running and Paul at last persuaded her to sub-let it furnished . Then he went back to Washingtonand left her to prepare it for the tenants . Junior wanted to go  --  that at least was something . But Edna had Pearl on her mind , and the parting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McElroy called , with a great deal of good advice and six letters of introduction to her friends in Washington . But no other of her acquaintances took any notice whatever of Edna 's approaching departure . She had seen so little of them since Paul took up war work . She did not suppose that they would even observe that she had gone away . But Edna had underestimated the height of Paul 's social eminence . The very last day that she was in the house on Bank Street , she had an unexpected caller . She was standing in the hall when the doorbell rang , throwing a last housewife 's glance around the lower floor . All was in order for the tenants  --  nice people from Lakewood , who would bring out a daughter in the Chinese drawing-room . The maids would leave as soon as the expressmen had called for the last trunks and packing-boxes . When Junior came home from school , Edna would lock the front door and go up to Susan Peebles 's house , where they were dining with Pearl and Shoob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . When she heard the bell , Edna thought that the expressmenhad arrived , and she opened the front door . A thin , middle-agedwoman , in a long dark coat and a black felt hat that had seen better days , was standing in the vestibule . Edna could not see her features very well , because the light was behind her . She was very much surprised when the woman said , with a slight hesitation , Hello , Edna . ' The voice had something familiar about it . Hello , ' she said doubtfully . The woman stepped into the hall then , and Edna saw , instantly , that it was Hazel Jenkins  --  of all people . She had not laid eyes on her for nearly six years . She did not look at all like the Hazel of the La Salle Avenue flat , nor even like the Hazel who had last lunched with Edna on OakwoodTerrace  --  oh , long before she moved !  --  with Esther MacFarland . She had always been wizened  --  with an elfin , witch look  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her face had lines in it that never used to be there . Under her black hat , Edna could see that her dark hair had turned quite grey . She was shocked by her appearance , but she instantly calculated , If I 'm thirty-seven , Hazel must be forty-two . ' She looked every day of it . Hazel was saying , I thought your door would be opened by a butler . ' But the sarcasm in her tone was a little uneasy . ' I have n't got a butler , ' said Edna mildly . Come on in , Hazel . I 'm awfully glad to see you . ' And she was glad . But a trifle conscience-stricken . Funny  --  she 'd never thought to say good-bye to Hazel and Esther . She led the way to the drawing-room and cast a glance of apology at the single pack/ing case , neatly corded and carded , that was waiting for the expressmen in the centre of the floor . I 'm just going away , ' she said . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel . Sit down , ' said Edna , indicating a teakwood armchair . I wish I could give you tea , but there is n't a scrap of food in the house . I 'm moving out today . I 'm so glad you came . I should  --  I should have called . you . up to say good-bye . How 's Esther ? ' ' Esther 's all right . She and Barton have moved out to Elmhurst . He 's done very well . She 's got another boy . Kind of an afterthought . He 's four years old now . ' Has she ? How nice ! ' observed Edna. politely . Are you still in the flat ? ' The question sounded so stereotyped . Queer , she was thinking , what time did to you . She did n't feel easy with Hazel , as she used to . Perhaps it was because of the odd expression in her eyes . Hostile , almost . She was glancing about the drawing-room , taking ' it all in rather scornfully , and the bookroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old supercilious smile . But Hazel had never smiled like that on Edna and Esther on La Salle Avenue . No . I 'm boarding , ' she said , in answer to Edna 's query . Up north . I moved out of the flat two years ago . Old Mrs. Dillon died that year . And Miss Slade had a stroke . She 's in the Old People 's Home now , and Miss Effie 's living with a niece on the West Side . ' Her glance returned to Edna and focused more sharply . But I guess you do n't care about that . I know you 're busy and I do n't want to keep you . I 've just come for an interview . ' An  --  inter-view ! ' The words were jolted out of Edna l ) y astonishment . Yes . I 'm back on the paper . Doing special articles . Maybe you 've seen my column  --  " Worm's-Eye View "  --  of celebrities , you know . I 'm the Worm . '  |p292Edna  had . Bright little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never read them . They were far too sophisticated for Edna 's taste . You 're  --  the Worm , ' she marvelled . Then , puzzled , But I 'm not a celebrity . ' Paul is , ' said Hazel tersely . Oh , yes . Distinguished attorneygone to  --  talk for his country . Give me the dope on Washington . ' I do n't know anything about Washington . ' Well  --  you 're going there , are n't you ? How do you feel ? This is all good stuff , of course  --  the way the house looks  --  so rich and so orderly , with just that packing-case in the foreground . It 's exactly what 's going on , I suppose , in the homes of ten thousand dollar-a-year men  --  with millions . But I 'd like a statement . ' Edna eyed her doubtfully . Her tone was so inimical . Paul was n't a dollar-a-year man . He had a major 's salary . But still he had n't millions . Indeed , he was working in Washington at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said slowly , I do n't know what to say . ' Hazel laughed shortly . Oh , you do n't have to say anything , really . I 'll say it for you . Just give me carte-blanche . It breaks your heart to leave this little cot on Bank Street , but if you had six husbands , you 'd give them all to your country . You think the hand that rocks the cradle shoots the guns . You are n't a bit afraid of tripping up over red tape , as you follow Paul to the fighting front in Washington . I 'll say it all  --  if Mrs. Paul Jones will sign it . ' Edna 's eyes were very round and shocked . Hazel  --  I could n't sign it . I mean  --  that 's just nonsense . ' Pretty mean nonsense , too , she was thinking . If Hazel always acted like this , she could n't be a very disarming reporter . Why is it nonsense ? ' The words came coolly , but there was a spark of malice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Paul 's doing what he thinks is right . ' Hazel 's face softened . Then she laughed a little . Oh , Edna  --  you 're just the same goose you always were ! ' I dare say , ' said Edna . You look awfully different , but I seem to recognize the old heart of gold . ' Hazel 's laugh had turned into a smile that was almost apologetic . You know , I came today  --  partly for a lark . Though I would like the interview . Now that I see you  --  ' What ? ' asked Edna . Hazel replied with a question . Why did n't you ever ' phone us ? Esther 's been wanting to drop in and see you , but I said you 'd throw us out . I thought you were through with your old friends , now you 'd landed on the Gold Coast . But I guess you 're just a beachcomber ! ' Edna laughed . But it was too true . Hazel 's voice was still running on . Now , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The publicis interested in the war workers  --  when they 're prominent . I 'll write something snappy but dignified  --  without too much heart interest . You can trust me . Will you sign it ? ' Of course I 'll sign it . ' For this was the old Hazel who could be trusted . Thanks , ' said Hazel briefly . It will help me . My column 's been running downhill . And I guess I 'll be steppingalong now and get the copy in . You must have a lot to do - ' She rose to her feet . Edna 's puzzled eyes were fixed on her . There was much she still wanted to know about Hazel . Hazel , ' she said gently , where is Jerry ? Why are you back on the newspaper ? ' Hazel 's lips twisted in the ghost of her supercilious smile . Jerry ? Oh  --  you did n't know . You would n't , of course . I did n't give any interviews . Jerry went over to France ,  | in ' 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas with the Canadians . He 's been in action a lot of the time . ' Oh  --  Hazel ! ' Edna 's hands stretched out to her , but Hazel ignored them . Yeah ? Great  --  is n't it ? I have n't heard from him for seven weeks . Jerry 's forty-four years old . But he thought that academic mind in the White House was never going to get going , and he fell in with some fire-eaters in Paris . Maybe it was n't so much patriotism as the journalist 's instinct . Jerry always had to be in the Big Tent . I do n't know . I 've become a pathological pacifist . But I guess Jerry 's having the time of his life . ' She stopped and her bravado flagged , but after a moment she had recovered her composure . She turned toward the drawing-room door . You have n't got a picture , have you , Edna ? ' Edna shook her head . Well , never mind . We 've got one in the morgue , of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it 's peanuts . Maybe it 's popcorn or chewinggum . Anyway , something to make the world safe for democracy . ' She paused on the threshold to throw a last glance around the drawing-room and down on the packingbox , neatly labelled for Washington . What 's that ? ' she asked . The silver , ' said Edna . Invaluable in the trenches , ' was Hazel 's comment . Then , with a sharp look , Do you want to go , Edna ? This is n't for publication . ' No . Not much , ' said Edna honestly . But I think I ought to . ' Just as I said , ' grinned Hazel . If you had six hus-bandsOh , Hazel  --  do n't , ' said Edna feebly . But she knew she read Hazel 's heart . She did n't blame her . I 'm terribly sorry about Jerry , ' she added.  |p295So  am I , ' said Hazel ironically . Then , rather surprisingly , she leaned forward and pecked awkwardly at Edna 's plump cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worse things that can happen to you than moving to Washington . ' Edna nodded , speechless . She was standing in the doorway when Hazel threw a Parthian shot from the vestibule . I 'd like it , for a change , to be a great man 's wife . '  |p299To  EDNA 'S surprise her first few weeks in Washington resolvedthemselves into nothing more alarming than a new and exciting adventure in domesticity . She was charmed by the Federal City , and she had not expected to be . It was so unlike Chicago that she felt she must be abroad . ' The train trip with Junior was in itself an experience , for Edna , in spite of her sound railroad background , had never slept in a sleeping-car . The sense of adventure began the moment she closed the door on their little boxed-in compartment , and grew in intensity with every revolution of the wheels of the Capitol Limited . Paul met them in the vast concourse of the Washington Station . It was a golden October day . The moment that Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt the mild , bright autumn air , she knew that this was going to be somehow  --  different . It was a difference to which every quick impression of the eye and ear contributed . She noticed , first of all , in the wide , sun-washed plaza , the absence of all mechanical sounds . No roar of traffic  --  no hum of elevated railroads . A city of human noises . Then she remarked the black faces of negroes . The presence of men in khaki . Her ear caught the drawl of the Southern accent , and her eye observed the gracious dignity of the dome of the Capitol , rising above treetops in the middle distance . Treetops everywhere , she was soon to discover . A city that was a park . Paul insisted on showing them the town , on their way to the Shoreham . A scenic option , ' he said , quoting the AutomobileBlue Book . They drove in the Cadillac  --  Paul had had it shipped to him late in the summer  --  around the green lawns of the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna was astonished by the picturesquemodesty of the shabby stores . Then past the Treasury Building and the White House  --  which Edna eyed reverently , nudging Junior and saying , That 's where President Wilson lives '  --  and around the open Ellipse , circledby its garland of golden elm trees , to the stark shaft of the Monument . In the park beyond it they had their first glimpse of the yellow Potomac and across it the heights of Arlington , rising from tawny woods . Edna thought she had never seen anything so beautiful . And Paul acted as if he owned it . In a way , of course , he did . Everyone owned Washington , Edna reflected . She was deeply impressed by her own sense of patriotic possession , as she stared at Greek facades , at corniced colonnades and pilasters , at flights of granite steps , at statues and at fountains . Even Junior was awestruck  --  and Junior was usually indifferent both to the charm of nature and the artifice of architecture . On the way back past the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Navy Building , where he had his office . Edna thought even that was beautiful  --  though certainly not Greek . They whirled by Lafayette Square , and she caught a glimpse of the curved and curly statue of Andrew Jackson on his rearing hobby-horse , striking a gallant attitude that conveyedan impression of a great deal of action without much execution  --  symbolic of some of the war workers in the present crisis , Paul said caustically . He was impatient of all departmental delay that interfered with his work.  |p30IOn  Sixteenth Street , Edna thought the houses looked like palaces . She saw an embassy 's flag and had again that sense of foreignness . Then the Star-Spangled Banner , seen for an instant down a side street floating against blue sky , recalled her to patriotism . But the white stone facades and the gardensbehind high iron fences seemed exotic and alien . The shiny , dark green leaves of the rhododendron were unlike any foliage she had ever seen before . The quality of the air , too , which had a luminous serenity  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck her as lovely and strange . She found the plan of the city  --  its symmetrical circles and starlike radiations  --  extremely confusing . She had quite lost her sense of direction when Paul turned abruptly into car-tracked streets , where the stores seemed shabby and meagre , as they had on Pennsylvania Avenue , and she was once more impressed by the number of black faces . He stopped at the entrance of a great grey hotel . Inside , it looked like all hotels , except for the crowd in the lobby and the presence of so many men in uniform . And not all American uniforms . Edna 's round eyes marvelledat distinguished Britons with the scarlet splash of the staff insignia on their low khaki collars , at dapper Frenchmen in horizon blue , at dark-eyed Italians in greyishgreen , with boots and trappings of black leather . Paul pointed out a Blue Devil to Junior , distinguished by his beret from his fellow Frenchmen . He was talking to some plump little officers  --  Central Europeans , Paul said they were  --  gaudy as peacocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These gentlemen , so Paul explained , were all on the various Allied missions that were flooding Washington . Some had women with them  --  beautifully dressed women  --  whose presence recalled Edna to herself and woke her shyness . But she lost it again in staring at the odd old men in funny frock coats and the odd middle- aged ones in casual business suits . They had suave , smooth faces and urbane manners and oratorical mouths that spoke with the tongues of the forty-eight states of the Union . Congressmen , Paul said  --  or perhaps senators . The Shoreham was a great place to lunch . That 's Mr. McAdoo , the Secretary of the Treasury , ' said Paul , indicating a keen hatchet face . And that 's Mr. Hoover . ' Edna turned eagerly , for the word of the Food Administrationhad been for four months the word of God in her Bank Street kitchen . She stared and was disappointed in what she saw . A chubby face  --  putty-coloured  --  at the moment expressionless . But the face of the great Herbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving Belgians and was now safeguarding the nation 's food supply , calling to his legions every housewife in the land . She sighed , feeling a little dazed by all this distinction , and said mildly that she must wash Junior 's hands before luncheon . Their rooms on the fifth floor surprised her by their elegance . Three bedrooms . Why three ? she questioned Paul . He said : Well , I was settled in a single room . It did n't seem worth while to move my things . We 'll find a house immediately . ' They must , of course . Edna was sure that all this magnificencemust be costing Paul a pretty penny . She ventured a remonstrance , and Paul said easily , Do n't worry . I 've counted the cost of this venture and I can afford it . ' Edna knew that the war had boosted the price of stocks and that Paul 's investments had been fortunate . Thrift was bred in her bones , however , and she resolved to find a house without any delay . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so easy . War workers had been crowding into the city all summer long , and furnished houses were already at a premium.  |p303A|partments  were scarce and almost impossible to find . She met a horde of frantic matrons besieging the real estate offices . Misery loves company and they talked to each other freely . Edna found their comments far from encouraging . I 've looked at seventeen houses , and I have n't found one with a kitchen my Alma would put up with for twenty-four hours . ' You make a mistake to bring a white maid down here . ' Five thousand a year , if you would believe it , with one maid 's room in the basement , no bathroom on the third floor , and , I give you my word , six cups in the pantry ! ' Coloured servants they had , and that laundry  --  well , just crawling ! ' Edna could not yet trust herself alone in the Cadillac in the maze of bias streets and circular parks , so she taxied about with an agent , who pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards , one was hung with wistaria , another faced Rock Creek Park ; still others were framed in magnolia and syringa bushes . But all , inside , were bitterly disappointing . Back in the real estate offices she heard the melancholy chorus . Helen took that one  --  the dogwood will be sweet in the spring , but there 's no pantry . ' Laura 's decided on it . I love that old brick , but the servant 's toilet is out in the yard . ' Kathy has the one on the fourth floor . She can see the dome , but the tubs are in the kitchen . ' Edna 's house-hunting tour had served merely to convince her that the Jones family could live in nothing they could pay for and pay for nothing in which they could live . But the Shoreham was impossible . It was no place for Junior , for one thing , who was growing fractious under the restraints of hotel life . Paul was too busy to help her in her search . At the end of four days he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , and asked what he should do with them . Edna knew that the question was purely rhetorical and the patience assumed . She went on house-hunting , and her standards of living fell rapidly in the course of the hunt . She began to try to reconcile herself to the thought of black servants . At the end of one despondent morning , she came upon a small red-brick English basement house with a little side yard , on Nineteenth Street , not far from Dupont Circle . It was oddly flanked on one side by a ramshackle brick shanty inhabited by a populous chocolate-coloured family , and on the other by the one-story establishment of a coffeecolouredtailor . But also , in accordance with the strange juxtapositions of residential Washington , it was across the street from at least the back door of the British Embassy , and opposite the imposing red-brick and white-pillared residence of a very important gentleman , Mr. Henry White , who , a year later , was to shed distinction on all his neighbours , white , chocolate , and coffee-coloured , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur overcoat , to attend the Peace Conference , as one of President Wilson 's delegates . The house had a square hall and a kitchen on the entrance floor , a living-room and dining-room above , four bedrooms and one bathroom . It had open wood fireplaces and side south light over its little garden , which commanded the picturesque and exceedingly decrepit shanty beyond . It was furnished with a few good pieces of old mahogany furniture , eked out with fumed oak and white iron beds that reminded Edna of interiors on Oakwood Terrace . The walls of the living-room and the dining-room were hung with gilt-framed oil paintings , in which a cheery feeling for bright colour notes and a certain high varnish were the **29;2982;TOOLONG . Edna rather admired the arsenic depths of a Forest of Arden , which hung over the living-room mantel-shelf , andp305she did not object to a moonlit seascape on the opposite wall . But not even she could countenance the still life in the dining-room  --  dead ducks and deader salmon  --  one with a fly affixed to it , incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's art . The bathroom , indeed , was its only period room . It was pure 1880 , without one jarring anachronism , from its dark wooden wainscoted walls to its pink marble washstand and its boxed-in toilet and its tin tub , wearing red on the slope . But Edna did not mind . It was a touch of Blue Island . Paul thought the house very inadequate , but , faced with the housing situation , consented to rent it . Edna planned to take the second-floor front bedroom for herself and Paul , and call the back one Jessie 's room , and tuck Junior away in the third-floor front . The third-floor rear was a servant 's room , so small , so inadequately furnished and so far removed from all toilet conveniences that Edna knew she must put a coloured woman in it , and her spirits sank at the thought . She was later to marvel at the fact that it was thus by mere chance that coloured servants came to figure in her scheme of living . Had that bedroom been more commodious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house possessed proper laundry facilities instead of two meagre tubs in close juxtaposition to the kitchen range , she would doubtless have been served by some dreary approximation of the taciturnSwedes on Bank Street . If so , she would have missed a world of humorous experience and a sympathetic understanding that was to last her forever of the endearing human dualities of the coloured race . Her first dusky friend proved to be a legacy from her landlady , whom Edna had never met . The landlady was a genteel little woman , the impoverished relict of an obscure army officer , who had put her house on the market at the first hint of rising real estate values , and had gone South to visit her daughter in Georgia for the duration of the war.  | On the morning when Edna finally left the Shoreham with Junior and their suitcases , and drew up in the Cadillac at the curbstone in front of the house on Nineteenth Street , she saw a stout , middle-aged coloured woman standing by the garden gate . The woman moved as Edna descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dark eyes , and inquired of Edna , Was you lookin ' for help ? ' The simplicity of the question was disarming . It got to the heart of the matter . But one coloured woman looked very like another . Edna eyed her doubtfully . Ah kin cook , ' said the coloured woman . Ah kin cook right well . Ma name 's Carolina  --  after the state Ah was bo'n in . ' Edna still felt uncertain , for Carolina , though clean , seemed dingy . Ah got a ref'rence , ' she said , reaching down into a petticoat pocket and producing a creased and dirty sheet of note-paper . She offered it to Edna , then tossed her head at the shanty behind her . Ma sister lives there . She aims to do yore washin ' , unless yo 're already suited . We bin waitin ' fo ' you to move in . Her husband wukks fo ' the gov'n'ment , off and on , but he ' lows he kin tend to yore furnace . ' Again she smiled hugely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glanced at the reference in her hand . She observed the signature of her landlady . Honest  --  willing  --  a capable plain cook - ' Her eyes ran over it . Carolina was saying : Ah wukked fo ' Mis ' Montgom'ry five winters . Ah lived here in the house . Ah ai n't had a place since she lef ' . Ah never fancied much wukkin ' here in summer . That kitchen gits too hot . ' That 's true of all kitchens , ' said Edna , a trifle sharply . Yas 'm . That 's why winter 's the only time Ah wukk . ' Again Carolina smiled , over that triumph of logic . After all , it was only October . Edna said , conservatively , I suppose I might try you . '  |p307Yas  'm . ' Carolina stooped briskly to pick up a bundle that was at her feet , and added , You ai n't ever goin ' to be sorry . Ah got my clothes right here . ' , Carrying Edna 's suitcase , she followed Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah know a yella gal that would maybe wait on your table . Ah know there ai n't room fo ' her in the house , but she likes to live out , so 's she kin feel free to accept an invitation . ' Edna thought that over , somewhat soberly , as she was ascending her staircase . She felt that yella gal ' would never , never do . But later that morning , when she turned up at the garden door , she was so confident of her capabilities that Edna could not bear to disappoint her . Her name was Theresa . She called Carolina aunt ' and instantly established herself in the pantry . She was little and neat and lemoncoloured , and her apron became her . That could not be said for Carolina , who , when girded for her duties , looked like a living advertisement of Aunt Jemima 's Pancake Flour . But Edna was soon to discover that she was not without her small personal vanities . Among them was an ample switch of black wool , which , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet and solemnly assumed on Theresa 's day out , abandoning her bandanna and tightly twisted pigtails in honour of the dining-room and the front door . She wore , too , on one shining black arm , two worn silver bracelets that jangled gently as she moved about her work , vaguely reminiscent , Edna always thought , of shackles and the jungle . Rather to Edna 's surprise , Carolina 's sister Hattie showed up that very first evening for supper in the kitchen , carrying in her arms an eight-weeks-old pickaninny . Junior was fascinated by it , and Edna fell instantly a victim to its charms . She thought that the high polish on its ebony cheeks , the glint in its roving brown eye , and the kink of its first wisps of black wool , already twisting into faint indica- tions of future pigtails , were quite irresistible . Facing that pickaninny , it seemed merely churlish to make any point about supper . The pickaninny , indeed , became a permanent member of the household . It came every day with its mother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove on a pile of soiled linen . Washington , Hattie 's husband , was often about the basement . He did not seem oppressed by his work fo ' the gov'n'ment . ' For the princely wage of seven dollars a month he tended the furnace and hot-water heater , blacked the shoes , washed the windows , watered the grass , swept the sidewalk , and even carried the wash up and down stairs , in chivalrous consideration of his wife 's lumbago . Paul said it was plantation life  --  but he said it goodnaturedly , for Carolina turned out to be an excellent cook . Like Edna , she was a great admirer of Mr. Hoover , and took kindly to war economies . She used Karo and Crisco to save sugar and butter , and knew many meat and wheat substitutes . She even taught Paul to eat the lowly rabbit , when succulently fried . . Edna never cared much for the days when the rabbits were skinned in the kitchen , but she sighed with relief to find the servant problem so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the casual supper parties , even the unexplained basket , with which Theresa invariably departed for her engagements ' of the night , though she knew it had something to do with the absence of all leavings ' in the icebox . She wondered , sometimes , if her mother would have accepted all this quite so casually , but dismissed the wonder , feeling that everything irregular was adequately compensated for by her servants ' genial smiles . She put Junior in the Friends ' School and then said to Paul , Now , I 'm going to fix up the house . ' It did need fixing , and Paul was thoroughly in sympathyp309with her intentions . When she set about realizing them , she discovered that she had been spoiled in Chicago by Marshall Field and Company . For Washington 's apologies for department stores  --  so they seemed to Edna  --  were edifices of narrow aisles and crowded counters and inadequate elevators , especially designed , it would seem , to thwart that most fundamental of all feminine impulses , the Will to Purchase . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at once so congested with things designed to be bought and yet so bereft of things that one could bear to buy . In one way , their limitations rather simplified existence . Edna purchasednecessities and forgot there were such things as luxuries . First , kitchen utensils and bathroom accessories and a better mattress for Paul . Then yards of bright chintz , a domestic rag rug to cover the worn linoleum in Junior 's attic bedroom , and a ninety-eight-piece dinner service of gold-and-white earthenware . But she had her surprises , for , intoxicated by war profits , the floorwalkers in the emporiums of F and G Streets seemed never to have heard of that slogan of modern retail trade , so soothing to the rasped nerves of the feminine shopper , The customer is always right . ' They disconcertinglyinquired what was wrong ' with the chintzes that Edna wished to return . Goods sent on approval , she learned to her astonishment , must be lugged back personally by the purchaser . Deliveries were curtailed  --  in order to defeat the Germans , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundles , imposed on her after long argument by indifferent clerks , each humorously labelled , with a bright scarlet sticker , This parcel is carried by a patriot . ' But the house was quickly enhanced , and Edna grew fond of its air of shabby gentility . There was something homely about it , and she learned to ignore the scars on the dark old mahogany furniture and the threadbare areas in the faded Oriental rugs . She hung her bright chintz in the windows , spread out her dinner service on the pantry shelves , unpackedher silver , and felt more at home . At last , she took down the dead ducks and salmon from the walls of the dining-room and covered the discoloured patches of wall paper with Food Administration posters , which she thought were colourful . ' Paul laughed at them heartily , and declared that his appetite waned under the discouraging admonition , Food Will Win the War  --  Do n't Waste It ! ' and the even more disconcerting inquiry , Are You Willing to Eat , While Our Allies Starve ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ khaki-coloured knitting were the only indications in the little house on Nineteenth Street that a war was progressing in Europe . For still Edna never read anything more than the headlines in the newspapers , and Paul worked no harder in the Army and Navy Building than he always had at the law . He said little about his work , and he had not been given a uniform , which Edna suspected was a source of disappointment to him . Washington was congested by mere dollar-a-year men wearing khaki and military caps and brown leather riding-boots or puttees . They looked very smart and quite like comrades-at-arms , as they stepped briskly down the sidewalks , in groups of two or three , returninga curt , patronizing salute to the privates who passed them . Paul said that informality had been all very well in the summer , when things were getting organized and boots would be hot , a high cloth collar hell . But he thought now , when the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the Army was functioning so admirably and in such close co-operation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect from the regular officers if they had officers ' rank . It would facilitate the work , ' he explained with dignity.  |p311Edna  was sure he 'd look wonderful in a major 's uniform , though she was never quite certain of the hierarchy of the military insignia that she saw on the shoulders of war workers . But she wrote Pearl and Susan all about her coloured servants and that Washington was lovely ; that a few roses were still blooming in her little tangled garden in the middle of November , that Junior was making friends in his new school , and that Paul was immersed in his work . Thanksgiving was over , and Edna had begun to count the days until Jessie would come home from Broadmooron-Hudsonfor the Christmas holidays , before she was really settled . Then time began to hang heavy on her hands . There was war work , of course , and Edna joined a group of bandage rollers who met in the Red Cross workrooms . The women were all strangers in Washington , wives of thedollar-a-year men , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them served on canteens in the railroad switch yards and others clicked typewriters for the Council of National Defence . A few of the younger ones drove motor trucks and staff automobiles and were dressed in khaki uniforms . But , aside from her bandage rolling , Edna could only knit . She knitted endlessly  --  a sweater a week was her stint  --  and grew sick of the colour of khaki . Many of the wives of the war workers were more or less banded together by the activities of their husbands , and prattled of departmental dinner parties , but none of Paul 's colleagues on the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the Army made any overtures to Edna . And presently she discovered the reason . In the long , hot months of the summer , they had become accustomed to thinking of Paul as a detached m-an . Washington , to be sure , was replete with detached men ,  | at this time when other cities were reduced to hen parties . Dolly McElroy wrote Paul that Chicago was depopulated of males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Paul chuckle , I 'm tired of fish and females  --  give me meat and men ! ' But Washington had men enough and to spare , if you did n't mind middle-aged ones . When bachelors , widowers , and husbands bereft of their wives could be found on every hand , Edna tried to think loyally that it was all the more credit to Paul that he was asked out to dinner without her . He was , pretty often , and these dinners seemed always to be , for one reason or another , important . Paul felt he should not miss them . But he always apologized in accepting an invitation and assured Edna that he would mention her presence in Washingtonto his hostess , who would , undoubtedly , call . ' But the time-honoured Washington custom of calling ' had suffered an abatement in war-time . At least , nobody called on the war workers , unless they were friends of friends . Washingtonians , indeed , claimed , not without reason , that the newcomers were ruining the city  --  congestingthe quiet streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and they were far too numerous to be welcomed with the conventional overture of the callingcard . Edna grew so lonely that she sometimes thought guiltily of Dolly McElroy 's six letters of introduction , but never so lonely that she mentioned them to Paul . Just before Christmas the wife of his immediate superior in the Army and Navy Building did come once to see her . But she never came again . She was Viola Sloan  --  Mrs. Arthur Sloan  --  of New York , and Edna shyly liked her . She liked her looks , which were clear-cut , decisive , and distinguished . She liked her vaguely reserved smile . She liked her slim , angular figure in her smart tweed suit , and her neat , dark hair and her light blue eyes beneath her tailored hatbrim . She seemed , so Edna wrote Susan Peebles ,  |p313'really  the real thing . ' Her voice was disconcerting , for Edna had never heard any other voice that was exactly like it . Low and vibrant , with r 's that were unobtrusive and vowels that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , and held echoes of a superior culture . Her husband , she said , was a New York lawyer , who , like Paul , had offered his services to the Draft Board and had been transferred to Washington . She said she had no children . She was , perhaps , forty-five years old . She stayed for half an hour and said that ' Arthur ' had enjoyed Paul so much in their work together , that she had been in Washington all summer , and that she , too , had enjoyed Paul . Edna was sure that she had enjoyed him nicely , even before Mrs. Sloan smiled pleasantly and asked her to drop in for tea any Sunday afternoon in the old house that they had taken in Georgetown , explaining , ' We keep open house on Sundays . ' She said that she loved Washington and had always loved it , and that she had visited there as a girl . ' I had an uncle on the Supreme Court , ' she explained , ' my mother 's favourite brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her she 'd be amused if she 'd ' take in the vaudeville in the Capitol . ' Edna asked her , ' What vaudeville ? ' and was astonished at her answer , ' Oh  --  the House and the Senate . Prohibition and Woman 's Suffrage are coming up , you know . The old boys will be priceless . ' Very soon after that , Mrs. Sloan took her leave . Edna asked Paul about Prohibition and Woman 's Suffrage . She was interested in both of them , because Mrs. Losser had been an anti-suffragist and a theoretical teetotaller , though she had never made much headway with William In the latter cause . Mrs. Losser herself had always admitted that a punch and a pudding were better for a little liquor . There was nothing benighted about her . Paul found Edna a ticket of admission to the House Gallery on the fatal day when Prohibition was passed.  | Edna was deeply stirred by the argument , and her opinion fluttered like a flag in the various gusts of oratory . She nodded her head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and Down with the demon rum ! ' She shook it as vehemently in answer to the plaintivequestion propounded by their antagonists , Would you deny an American citizen the right to drink a glass of sherry with his wife and children in his own home ? ' She was far too much excited over the issue at stake to have any sense of the wordy futility of the procedure , and was profoundly impressed by this , her first , glimpse of the legislative body , and certainly could not understand why Mrs. Sloan , whom she saw in the opposite gallery , had referred so slightingly to the debate . There were many things that she could not understand in the conversation she heard in Mrs. Sloan 's Georgetown drawingroom , when , on a subsequent Sunday , Paul took her there to tea . The house was an old red-brick one , set in wide , sloping lawns , and faced with a pillared portico . A grey-haired coloured butler opened the front door . A broad white hall with a circular staircase stretched empty before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It came from the drawing-room , which  --  lovely , rectangular , white panelled  --  was crowded with people . Most of the people were men . Mrs. Sloan seemed very different on her own hearthstone . No longer tailor-made . She sat in a yellow winged armchair in a silvery blue velvet tea gown , but her face looked just the same . Delicate , aquiline , distinguishednot really pretty  --  framed by her neat , dark hair . She was dispensing her tea with a casual elegance that Edna at once recognized as the social manner for which Dolly McElroy , when playing the hostess , had been dimly groping . This was a salon  --  Edna was sure of it . And Arthur Sloan completely eclipsed poor irritated Sandy McElroy , as a wife 's support . He was a slim , grey-haired man  --  tall and a little stooped  --  with large yellow eyes that looked kindly and bright and tired . They lit up , eloquently , over everyone 's little joke . There were a great many jokes , and Arthur Sloan seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , at whom he kept glancing intimately , as if he appreciated her . Edna rather thought that she appreciated him , also , somewhat as Susan appreciated Elmer . A happy marriage , she reflected . You were conscious of a bond between them that never for a moment wavered , even in that crowded room . But he did not say much , and neither did Mrs. Sloan  --  in this she was so different from Dolly McElroy  --  but listened to what other people were saying . Paul joined in the talk vivaciously , and Arthur Sloan gave Edna a cup of tea . It was a funny old lustre cup  --  Edna was surprised to see it in so elegant a household  --  and she sat down with it on a stool near the corner of the wide , white fireplace , and listened with all her ears . She was so completely ignored that she hardly felt shy , but rather disembodied . A man on the sofa beside her was talking to a red-headed woman in brown velvet  --  with a brown velvet hat drooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New Republic . The red head countered with a reference to a cartoon in Harvey 's War Weekly . Two other men , erect on the hearthrug , were discussing an impending gesture from the White House , in terms so discreet that Edna marvelled that each knew what the other meant . One of them had heard something that was frightfully significant repeated on the authority of an exalted personage , whom , owing to his exaltation , the speaker was unfortunately not at liberty to quote . He was passing on his anonymous information , however , with appropriate emphasis . In the corner behind her , Edna heard a gay-voiced woman attacking the Administrationas light-heartedly as if it were the king of indoor sport . Cassie  --  you 'll end behind barbed wire , a political martyr ! ' laughed her male companion . Well  --  send me a basket of fruit at my internment camp , ' the gay voice continued . The group of men that Paul had joined were speaking of a senatorial investigation . Someone said somethingadmiring about Henry Cabot Lodge ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were quoting somebody , and still a third said , scathingly , Wilson wo n't get anywhere with that presidential billingsgate ! ' None of it meant anything to Edna , but she was dazzled by the brilliance of the gathering and a little numbed by her sense of enlarged social horizons . This was the sort of talk , she supposed , that Paul , on coming home from a dinner party , referred to as good . ' But she wondered that people dared to criticize the President like that , right here in Washington , where they might be overheard . Paul was sticking up for him . That relieved Edna . But she wondered even more , as she looked at the eager faces all around her , why these people did n't seem to care about anything but talk . The women 's clothes were beautiful and the room looked lovely  --  all firelight and flowers ; the tea and the toast and the little light sponge cakes were perfectly delicious . But no one seemed to be noticing anything like that . All this casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms it was duplicated  --  was taken for granted , as a background , a sounding-board , against which Conversation ricocheted and reverberated , from the centre of government out into the void . Nearly everyone was talking , intensively , fervently , and those who were n't were listening , passionately preoccupied , apparently , with talk . Even Mrs. Sloan did not seem to be wondering , like an ordinary hostess , if the tea was still hot , or if the next tray of toast was coming in quickly . Edna had not heard anyone remark upon the cake . It was really too good , she felt , to pass uncomplimented , but she did not feel equal to raising her voice in the din that was around her . Paull ' voice was raised . He was saying something clever about thep317Cabinet , and everyone was laughing . Edna had not heard what it was . That Jones man 's a card , ' said one of the men on the hearthrug . The other nodded , and Edna smiled in pride . When they left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him her long , slim hand , with one star sapphire ring on it , and said , Nice of you to come , Paul , ' and smiled her vague , sweet smile on Edna . Paul paused to speak with her , and Edna turned toward the door and met Arthur Sloan and told him she 'd had a lovely time , but she knew from the expression in his large yellow eyes that he had n't the slightest idea who she was and perhapshad never known . That was rather discouraging , when she liked the Sloans and wanted so much to be friendly with Paul 's friends . But Edna did not know just what she could do about it . Jessie came home from boarding-school three days before Christmas , all set for holiday parties . She was very much disappointed to learn that none had been planned . None planned , at least , to which she had been invited . She turned on Edna immediately . Do n't you know any people , yet , Mother ? ' she asked . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul came to her relief . There 's plenty for you to do in Washington , Jessica , ' he said reprovingly , without gadding about . ' Jessie raised her fine eyebrows in a stare of astonishment , but Paul continued , I want you to see the city . ' He managed to take a good many hours away from his war work to see it with her , and Edna and Junior went with them , because , until Jessie came home , Paul had never suggested sight-seeing . Now Edna gained a new impression of the wonders of the town . They explored the Smithsonian Institution and the NationalMuseum and the Corcoran Art Gallery . They visited the White House and the Capitol and the Congressional Library . They went to the Bureau of Engraving and Printingand to the Pan-American Building and to the crypt of the Cathedral . One clear , cool day , when Washington was spotlesslymantled in its first soft snowfall , they ascended the Washington Monument and saw spread before them the noble complexity of the plan of the town . Descending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new emergency war offices to the unfinished Lincoln Memorial and over the river to the National Cemetery at Arlington . There Edna was deeply impressed by the long files of white headstones , each humble in itself , but producing in the aggregatethe effect of a vast ghostly army on parade . Next day , four hours of morning sunshine removed every trace of the snowstorm , and that afternoon they motored up the river on Conduit Road to the Great Falls of the Potomac , which Edna thought the most glorious natural spectacle that she had ever seen . But Junior would terrify her by climbing on jagged rocks at the very torrent 's edge , and she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw him running back on the wood path in front of her , jumping delightedly on the frail suspensionbridge , then safe on the level dirt tow path of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal . The century-old , whiteplastered , hip-roofed tavern that presided over the lock delighted her with its quaintness . And two days later they motored to Mount Vernon . Mount Vernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme simplicity . But she vaguely appreciated that that simplicity was as exquisite as it was extreme . It 's somehow  --  American , ' she said inarticulately to Junior . The wide Potomac curved grandly before them.  |p319The  bluff of its bank rose sharply from the water and swept over open , brown lawn to meet the square-pillared porch of the nation 's dearest shrine . The old house stood , chalkwhitein the January sunshine , crowning its hill and cherishingits relics . The felicity of the site , the richness of the associations , and the bright , foreshortened glamour of America 's brief history , broke over Edna with unexpected poignancy . She thought suddenly of the war . Of other wars . Of soldiers . Soldiers in the buff and blue uniform of the Continental Army had walked , of course , over this very lawn . Soldiers in Union blue and Confederate grey . And soldiers , now , in khaki . She thought of the headstones in Arlington , and immediately , for an instant , that alien conflictin Europe became a personal affair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had died for it Simple concepts . Childlike . But tears stood inEdna 's eyes . She could not have described the whole shining immensity of that instant of confused emotion , but she was , while the vision lasted , most truly a patriot . Then Junior tugged at her arm , demanding instant entrance into the house itself , and she followed Paul and Jessie up over the lawn and across the porch and through the modest doorway . She stared over fenced-off thresholds at little panelled parlours , and climbed , a trifle breathlessly , up steep and narrow stairs . She marvelled at antiques , ' and later at the box in the garden . There were no outdoor flowers , of course , and the trees were leafless , but the chill , wintry weather had discouraged other tourists and they had the place to themselves . They walked around it for an hour , and Edna felt again that sense of possession that had accompanied her first glimpse of Washington . This lovely place was hers . It did not seem too fantastic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always came back to it  --  which , in spite of its grace of line and grandeur of situation and the storied dignity of the mighty ghosts that hauntedp320it , remained at once its most noble and humble charm . The day before Jessie went back to Broadmoor-on-Hudson , the debate on Woman 's Suffrage came up in the House . She went with Edna to hear it , and sat listening eagerly to the eight hours of oratory that preceded its passage . Edna was somewhat disconcerted to learn that her daughter was a suffragist . So were most of the other women who , sandwichesunder one arm and knitting under the other , had formed in the corridors outside the gallery long before the doors were thrown open . When they finally were , and the women pushed wildly forward , stumbling down the steep aisles , Edna found herself seated in the centre of the purple and yellow cohorts of the Woman 's Party . This disgusted her , for Edna had no patience with the tactics of suffragettes . Several of her nearest neighbours were jailbirds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to the woman beside her , an angular , spirited spinster of forty-odd , who immediatelyconfided to the wide-eyed girl that she had been taken up for picketing the White House with a banner inscribed , Kaiser Wilson , the Fight for Democracy Begins at Home , ' and subsequently sitting down on the Pennsylvania Avenue car tracks , to the utter confusion of the unsophisticatedtraffic police of the District . The sight of the Lady from Montana , Miss Rankin , who , together with the Gentleman from California , Mr. Raker , was handling the suffrage side of the debate , also disgusted Edna . She did not approve of women in public life . She thought that Miss Rankin looked bold , ' down there without her hat , among all those congressmen . The sight of Mr. Saunders , the Gentleman from Virginia , and Mr. Meeker , the Gentleman from Missouri , who were championing the antis , somewhat reassured her . But Jessie  --  who read the newspapers  --  informed her that last night the President had cast confusion into the Democratic ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requesting the Solidp321South , at this eleventh hour , to reverse its position and support the amendment . Mr. Clark , the Gentleman from Florida , ably voiced his outraged feelings . ' I am a Democrat and I want to follow the leader of my party . And I am a pretty good lightning change artist myself sometimes , but God knows I ca n't keep up with this performance . ' Mr. Clark , Edna soon gathered , was a gentleman of sound , conservative views . She agreed with every one of them . Women , as a class , while the intellectual equals of men , and frequently their superiors , are peculiarly fitted for those duties that pertain to the home and home life  --  gentle and loving , tender and true ... Gentlemen , there is no truer declarationthan that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the nation and it is as true today as when first uttered ... To confer on woman the right of suffrage is to lower her from her proud estate , and , as for me , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high pedestal that , from the dawn of civilization she has so fittingly occupied ... Todaywoman stands the uncrowned queen in the hearts of all right-thinking American men ; to her as rightful sovereign we offer the homage of protection , respect and love , and may the hand of an all-wise Providence stretch forth in this hour of peril to save her from a change of relation which must bring in its train sorrow , discontent , and pain . ' The suggestion that the resolution should be passed as a war measure , in order that the men and women of the countrymight present a united front to the world , roused Mr. Clark to new flights of oratory . Do these good women , if given the privilege to vote , intend to shoulder arms and go to the front ? ... Women take up arms only after the men have become yelping coyotes and skulking cowards , and I thank God that America has not yet become Russianized .... Political parties and candidates for public office would be stirred up over the prospect of these millions of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of presenting to our enemies an unbroken and harmonious front , this great Republic in the very midst of the most terrible and devastating war of all time will exhibitto the world such a spectacle of domestic disorder and internecine strife as will inevitably dishearten our allies , strengthen the hopes and courage of our enemies , and weaken us in the opinion of the world . ' Amid lawless applause from the antis ' gallery , Mr. Clark went on to paint a picture of domestic felicity which would prevail if the amendment were to be passed : We should find husband and wife constantly engaged in political disputationwhich would grow warmer , more heated , and more acrimonious as the campaign advanced , until finally a veritable conflagration of domestic infelicity would be kindled , consuming the marital tie , destroying the home , and sending the children , to all intents and purposes orphans , out on the cold charity of the world to become charges on the State ! ' At this point the disquieting suspicion that Mr. Clark was something of an alarmist crept over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ballot without the adviceof Paul . But of course there were other kinds of women . At the suggestion that some needed the vote for protection , Mr. Clark inquired passionately , My God ! Has it come to pass in America that the women of the land need to be protected from the men ? ' The day wore on and the exciting incidents were many . The regrettable pacifist stand of the Lady from Montana upon the declaration of war was cast in her teeth by Mr. Gray of New Jersey , who reminded his colleagues that the sole female representative of Woman 's Suffrage in the House , Miss Jeannette Rankin , admitted , not from judgment but from her woman 's heart , that she loved her country , but could not vote for war . '  |p323This  war may last a year or it may last ten years , ' said Mr. Gray , ignoring alike the irrepressible cheers of the antis , who seemed ignobly to glory in the weakness of their sex , and the groans of derision from the dauntless jailbirds at Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you like to see a majority of the membership of Congress made up of women ? And that in the face of the fact that this is a war to the death , a war of extermination , a war of annihilation , a war to be fought to the finish by strong men , courageous men , red-blooded men , virile men , men who can watch their life-blood flow without whimpering ... This is no issue to be decided by women 's tears , fears , and emotions . ' But the arguments were not all against the amendment . Mr. Fess of Ohio , after declaring that woman as wife and mother will always be the queen of the home , as a power of personality will ever be the guiding influence of our schools , and as a spiritual force will continue to be the chief reliance of the church , ' went on , to Edna 's surprise , to express a wish to extend to her also the courtesy of the ballot box . She had anticipated a different conclusion , for the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ! , the less they were concerned with their enfranchisement . Mr. Campbell of Kansas made perhaps the most stirring defence of the amendment . The women of the world today have given to every battle front , and to the fighting ships upon the sea , the men who are fighting the battles of this epoch-making war . And the women of the world today are the inspiration of those men on every battle front . And iiiore , they are doing as much for the success of the war in America and throughout the allied countries as are the men behind the lines ; they are doing every kind of work today that men are doing ; they are manufacturing munitions , ships , arms , provisions , and clothing ; they are doing every manner of war work . At this very moment , in these galleries , the women who are listening to this discussion are working for our soldiers and sailors . Not a man today in these galleriesis doing anything except idly listening to what is going on ! ' And at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Edna found herself on her feet , laughing and waving her war knitting . The Speaker rapped in vain for order , and the lines of applauding women were lively with banners of grey and khaki and navy-blue wool . At seven o'clock in the evening , the final vote , with its narrow margin of victory for the amendment , created renewedpandemonium in the galleries and on the floor . Jessie voiced her views to Edna in the Cadillac , on the way back to Nineteenth Street . I 've just as much sense as boys have  --  and so have other girls . I used to wish I was a boy . But I do n't any longer . I think women are going to get their rights and keep their privileges . And I do n't mean just seats in streetcars . No nice man would want to take advantage of a woman . I mean  --  he 'd feel more comfortable if he did n't  --  and a lot more graceful . Gallantry 's becoming . I do n't think it will die . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want fromJessie , ' said Edna severely , do n't talk nonsense . If you 're lucky you 'll fall in love some day and then you 'll forgetall about getting . When you 're in love , ' I know , ' said Jessie ; I 've seen some girls at school who are in love , and I think they 're asses . I do n't mean to be like that . I know what I 'm after . ' For an instant the crowded traffic of Connecticut Avenue was blotted out for Edna 's eyes by a vision of the marshlandsof Blue Island . Paul and herself in a buggy , drawn by an old white horse . Paul saying , Funny  --  I was sure I knew what I wanted . I had it all planned . ' Her own quick , jealous alarm over Paul 's imaginary mistress of millions . ' Tall  --  dark  --  with an enigmatic smile and an infinite capacity for adoring a brilliant husband . ' Odd , that shep325had never forgotten the words of that description . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess in question was not unlike Mrs. Arthur Sloan . But Edna was not frightened , because of the very patness of the characterization . For Mrs. Sloan did seem to adore her yelloweyedhusband . There was something else there , too , that Edna could rely on  --  a standard of taste  --  of dignity  --  of decorum . But  --  other goddesses , less happy , more casual  --  met at those frequent dinner parties ? Edna remembered Dolly McElroy 's warning . Still , Susan had said , Paul keeps out of trouble  --  I 'll say that for him . ' And Susan was very wise . Her thoughts had wandered far from the emotional pitfallsthat opened in the path of her egocentric daughter . She jerked them back with the warning , You 'll only be happy , if you marry for love . ' I intend to , ' said Jessie . But I 'll love the right person . ' Edna really could not think of any answer to that . Jessie went back to school next day , and the dull fog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , as the weeks went by . Paul 's friends were slowly becomingaware of her existence . A few women called , and some of them instructed her in the etiquette of state dinnergiving . When in doubt , ' they said helpfully , you can call up the State Department and give them your list of guests . There 's an Under-Secretary there who will be glad to seat them for you . ' They went on to relate tales of horrid indignities that unwitting hostesses had inflicted on distinguished Peruvian ministers and Third Under-Secretaries of State . Edna gatheredthat a Washington dinner was nothing to plan lightheartedly.  | These same sticklers for etiquette , having carefully explainedthe art and science of grading one 's guests from the celebrities on the right and left hand of the hostess and the right and left hand of the host , invariably gave Edna a seat among the nonentities in the exact centre of their long tables , though Paul was always placed well above the salt . For the wives of the war workers did not rank officially as consorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were free lances  --  soldiers of fortune  --  who rose to distinctionby the force of sheer personal charm . The dinners were large , and sometimes Edna could barely distinguish the features of her host and her hostess in the dim distances of candlelight at either end of the board . But she did not resenther lot , for she knew she would have nothing whatever to say to a celebrity . It was enough to stare at one . And Edna whole-heartedly stared . The spring of 1918 saw Washington more crowded than ever . Departments were enlarged and staffs were doubled ; new stucco dormitories were erected for women clerks and empty houses were commandeered by the Government , to the intense resentment of absentee owners , as lodgings for employees . In the first spring verdure of leafy circles , bronze admirals and generals seemed to gaze from their pedestals with conservative disapproval at the desecrating blue placardshung on imposing facades , announcing that the premiseswere temporarily the property of the United States Government . Then the Salisbury Act was passed , continuing all leases in the District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war . It was intended to check profiteering , but Washingtonians referred to it as the betrayal of the District . ' It deprived a landlord of the right to evict a war worker at the expiration of his lease , provided he continued to pay his rent , and it put a successful quietus on Edna 's little landlady in Georgia , who had written a dire letter , threatening to triple the rent for a second season.  |p327So  their claim on the house on Nineteenth Street was automaticallyextended until the Germans should be conquered , and Edna felt even more settled ' and free to devote herself to the lovely outdoor pageant of the Maryland spring . That spring was a spell , and Edna succumbed to it in wonder . She had never been much interested in nature ' before . The little coronet of cherry trees bloomed for her around the Tidal Basin and the purple Judas and white dogwoodflowered in Rock Creek Park . Long avenues of horsechestnutsand lacy locust trees burst into white blossom in the city 's centre . Country roads were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hedges . Wistaria drooped in lovely lavender plumes . Edna took to picnicking with Junior on the twelve miles of tow path that stretched along the canal from the Great Falls of the Potomac to the Georgetown Bridge . The river-bank was a fairyland of azalea and magnolia and laurel and flowering thorn . They made friends with the lock keepers in the little white locks and watched the whitewashed canal boats , drawn by lazy mules , slip up and down the narrow stream that mirrored every feathery spray in its tranquil surface . Paul was always too busy to join them , but it was hard for Edna to believe , in that loveliest leafy moment of the year , with new life budding all around her , that a World War raging in Europe , spreading death and disaster , was directly responsible for her serene enjoyment of the peaceful scene . She felt utterly detached from the great national adventure . Even Washington itself , which was , to be sure , the arena of Paul 's activities , was for her no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past and of the present  --  and her first vague fear of the future , but always a personal future . It sometimes came over her , with a quick prick of panic , that she and Paul were growingvery far apart . His interests were alien . The note of official government  --  administrative echoes or political up- roar  --  reached her but vaguely , for it did not concern her . It had values for Paul , she knew , but to her those values were never really clear . The War was a word . The fragrance of Maryland 's April was much more vivid . The profligate bloom of May . The quick coming of summer . But the very mutations of the season held a hint of somethingrestless that would not stay for enjoyment . A reminderof the changes that life with Paul had brought and would always bring.  |p329But  when the days grew hot , and Junior 's school let out , ' and Jessie came home again from Broadmoor-on-Hudson , and Carolina began talking philosophically of knocking off ' work for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed and shutters put up for the season . The grander avenues took on an appearance of emptiness . Fullfoliagedtrees hung heavy in the breezeless air . Official residentsleft town and coloured citizens awoke in the dingy cottages in which they had been hibernating . They hung over open window-sills to gossip with their neighbours , sprawled on sunny doorsteps in lazy family parties , and the sidewalks of their quarters were alive with playing pickaninnies . The war workers remained , but their wives and children began going away for the summer . Jessie complained that there was nothing to do . Junior grew pale and peaked , and Edna found that she could not sleep at night in the close , humid air of her bedroom . She caught herself thinking of the dry southwest wind that blew over western prairies and the cool , invigorating tang of a Lake Michigan breeze . She was secretly wondering if a flying trip to Chicago would be too expensive when Paul suggested the seashore . Edna liked the suggestion . She had never seen the sea.  |p330But  it was Jessie who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey . She had spent her Eastervacation there , at an informal house party in the house of a schoolmate , and had met some young people and was familiar with the town . She wrote her friend and found the cottage  --  a little red frame one with a view of the water  --  and moved Edna into it in time to celebrate her seventeenth birthday with a clambake on the beach . Paul came up for that and for several week-ends in the course of the summer . Hattie was keeping his bedroom in order and cooking his breakfasts in the Nineteenth Street house . Carolina and Theresa had moved to the shore ' with Edna , for Carolina had conquered her natural disinclination for work in hot weather , in order to see the world . Edna 's summer passed pleasantly enough in keeping an eye on ' the children . Jessie and Junior learned to swim and to sail . Edna could do neither , but she liked to walk down to the beach and look at the bright blue expanse of rippling , sun-shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and the seaweed and certain strange shells , Edna thought the ocean was very like Lake Michigan . She made a little collection of the shells , and sometimes , where the sand was dark and damp , in a moist , bronze ridge of seaweed , she found a starfish or a horseshoe crab . But mostly , she sat on a rock with her knitting and watched Junior paddling with other small boys in the shallows and tried to pick out a sail that might be Jessie 's , in the flotilla of knockabouts , far out in the bay . Jessie sailed every afternoon , with a crowd of boys and girls who lived in the surrounding cottages . They were the children of Philadelphians and New Yorkers , brokers and lawyers and doctors and bankers , who had summered for years in this village by the sea . Their mothers were middleagedmatrons who had long since decided that vacations must be sacrificed to children . Day and night they wentp331about informally in white linen dresses and brilliantly colouredsilk sweaters , and all swore devoutly by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the weekends , when they swam and sailed with their offspring . Exceptfor an occasional bridge table set on a screened porch , there was no adult social festivity . Edna could not play bridge , but she picked up a pleasant beach aquaintance with some of her neighbours . Like her , they were all knitting for the war . Edna thought that Jessie 's friends seemed rather less sophisticated than the young people that she had known in Chicago , but they were much gayer than their parents . They had things all their own way . The girls , with their fresh tanned faces and fly-away hair , looked incredibly pretty in light summer sport clothes , and the boys , tall , lanky , and sunburned , endearingly young in white ducks and blue jackets . The boys were still in prep school and bored with the thought of college . They longed to get into the war . The girls talked of war work and chafed at the restrictions of boarding-school . They wanted to go to France . These lively ambitions , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie was out of the house all day . She went off every night with some callow youth who turned up on the front piazza , to dance to a neighbour 's Victrola or play bridge with the gang . ' When Labour Day came , and Edna packed up to go back to Washington , Jessie departed for a visit in the Berkshires that would last until Broadmoor-on-Hudson opened . Junior was melancholy at the thought of re-entering school . But the house on Nineteenth Street seemed quite like home when Edna returned to it , and she was glad to be reunited with Paul . He looked thin and worn , she thought , pulled down by the summer heat , and he welcomed both her and Carolina . He was tired , he said , of eating at hotels . She was no sooner settled than the influenza epidemic broke over Washington in fury , creating fearful havoc in the overcrowded town . More than a hundred thousand war workers had crowded into the Washington that , in the spring of 1917 , was only a village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , as expressed to Edna in that last interview on Bank Street  --  dollar-a-year men with millions '  --  though popular , was erroneous . The most striking feature of the war emergency organizationwas the faithful , unrecognized , unremunerated service of a myriad little commonplace people who lived in wretched , overcrowded boarding-houses , paying exorbitant prices for inadequate , often unsanitary lodgings . Young girls left comfortable homes to accept volunteer jobs under conditionsthat , under normal circumstances , no paid office assistantwould for a moment tolerate . Middle-aged men left their families behind them , often in the most straitened circumstances , to lodge themselves in wretched hall bedroomsand eat their hasty meals off a counter at Childs ' . Married women cheerfully accepted the curtailment of a bread-winner 's income and shared the house of a mother , mother-in-law , or sister in their home town , or joined their husbands and , for the first time in their lives , cooked , cleaned , and even washed for a growing family . If a sense of adventureoriginally lured these war workers to Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had once realized the discomfort of their daily living . The moneyed war worker was a great exception in the crowd . If the sense of adventure persisted , it was only through the stoical perception that their jobs , no matter how humble , were , in brief , magnificently , the winning of the war . Congestion breeds contagion , and the condition of these war workers who lay helpless in furnished lodgings was perfectlyappalling . Hospitals were crowded , doctors all too few , and nurses almost impossible to find . With a thoughtp333for her mother  --  who she knew would have done it  --  Edna volunteered in answer to the call for amateur nurses . Paul approved of her decision and gave her a list of the names and the addresses of the clerks who were victims in his own department . Inwardly panic-stricken , she packed the Cadillacwith thermos bottles of hot soup and thin gruel , and , donninga white influenza mask that was saturated in carbolic acid , went into the dreary boarding-houses . In them she found landladies too terrified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threshold of a sick-room and patients who had had no attention for three or four days . She found double beds occupied by delirious girls , whose roommates , still well , had been sleeping on the floor beside them . She found one young bride , hysterical with fever and the fear of a possiblemiscarriage . The very first day of her nursing , a boy , unconscious , died in her arms of double pneumonia before he had ever been seen by a doctor . Edna wrote to his mother in Oklahoma , and received a heart-broken answer. the letter ended , he had a weak heart that kept him out of the war . ' But soldiers , too , were dying . Camp Meade was quarantined . Coffins piled high in the railroad station . The city seemed plague-stricken . Some timorous citizens wore white gauze influenza masks in stores and in office buildings , and even on the streets . But Edna passed unscathed , and so did Paul and Junior , and early in November , the epidemic was under control . It passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer seemed full of pestilence . The tree-lined avenues turned russet and pale gold . Dogwood flamed scarlet , and the white-trunked sycamores stood stark in the yellowwoods , as Edna first remembered them . A cycle of seasonshad been completed in Washington . How long , ' Edna wondered , is this going to last ? ' She meant the War , of course , and their queer , unsettledp334manner of living in a house that was not their own and a city in which they had no permanent place . American troops were in Europe now , and on the floor of the House and the Senate vituperative attack on , and hysterical defence of , the war policies of the Administration both went by the name of patriotism . The conditions in the training camps were the subject of investigation . There was talk of another draft . Out of it all was borne in on Edna an increasing sense of the seriousness of the War . It might last for years , she thought . It might last until Junior But that was ridiculous . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul had been finally supplied with a major 's uniform  --  and had had his picture taken in it  --  Bulgaria slipped out of the conflict . Paul declared that the end was at hand . Soon the Kaiser was in flight . The German army was retreating . Hostilities collapsed with a speed that was almost anti-climactic . And then  --  it was over . The Allies were victorious . The War was won . Edna saw Washington celebrate both the false and the true Armistice with ringing bells and tooting horns and long dancing lines of soldiers and sailors and government clerks singing through the city streets . Bone-dry , the District was , by war-time legislation , and the rejoicing , for the most part , was as innocent as that of a children 's Hallowe'en party . Late in the evening of that eleventh of November , Edna took Junior  --  for Paul was downtown somewhere , celebrating victory with his colleagues  --  in the Cadillac up the small hill by the Monument , to watch the searchlights and hear the joyful cries coming up from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said redundantly , as they looked and listened , in the hush of the little green park . And her voice shook foolishly , for Junior now might grow up in Peace . This War had ended war , for all the small boys in Paris and London and Brussels and Rome  --  and in Berlin and Vienna , too , and the Russian towns with names shep335could never remember  --  as well as in all the American cities . She thought of the streets of the world , filled with surging , rejoicing , hysterical humanity . Even Germans must rejoice  --  German mothers , anyway  --  that the slaughter had ceased . Edna easily dismissed the Germans from her meditations , because she felt pretty sure that by this time they must see through ' their Kaiser , who had run away from his troops . Then she thought of the empty trenches and the devastated villages in the districts evacuated almost within the week by the retreating armies . What reunions would take place when the refugees flocked back to them ! And then , absurdly of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was no war sufferer  --  she began thinkingof Chicago . Of Pearl and Shoob and Susan and Elmer and of the house on Bank Street . Of all her possessions  --  and many of them so dear to her  --  that she had not seen for over a year . Almost immediately  --  in a week or two , anyway  --  she would leave Washington . Do you want to go home , dear ? ' she asked Junior . Sure , ' replied Junior promptly , with twelve-year-old simplicity . But Edna 's reactions were somewhat more complicated . With the certainty of home-going at last assured her , she was surprised to discover that she felt almost sorry to go . But Edna did not go for seven long months , for the work of the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the Army continued during the period of demobilization . The eggs had to be unscrambled , Paul said . The men who were peculiarly fitted to meet the industrial needs of the country were found in their training camps and dismissed from the ranks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army were prepared for publication.  | Paul wore his uniform all winter , and was known in the Army and Navy Building as Major Pau : Jones . Carolina and Theresa and Hattie and Washington all : ailed him by his titleand referred to him as the Majah . ' Paul laughed at it , but liked it . He seemed to be in no hurry to leave Washington . His work was less pressing now , and sometimes , in pleasant weather , he was able to leave his office at noon and motor out to the Chevy Chase Country Club for a round of golf with Arthur Sloan . But as the city emptied and social festivities quieted , and one by one her casual aquaintances slipped away to their home towns , Edna felt very idle . When her war work ended , she found she had nothing to do . She saw President Wilson set out for France and heard Congress voice its recalcitrant attitude toward the Peace Treaty and the League of Nations . But that did not seem important . The War was a finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the streets grow tranquil , the uniforms diminish , the emergency war offices deserted . Junior was in school all day and she spent endless hours alone in the Nineteenth Street house . She began to look forward quite desperately to her return to Chicago , and to walk the city streets in aimlesssearch of diversion . She knew every display in the plateglasswindows of the shops on Connecticut Avenue and F and G and H Streets . But she never saw anything that she wanted to buy . It was late in January , when Jessie had gone back to boarding-school after the Christmas holidays , that Edna first turned her attention to beauty parlours . A shampoo and a wave and a facial massage would occupy a morning . She experimented with several and then became a steady patron of Elizabeth Arden 's shop on Connecticut Avenue , only a few blocks from home . She liked to talk to the operators about complexion creams and reducing diets . They seemed such nice young girls . Some of them told her about theirp337families and their love-affairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Edna 's personal pulchritude , which was flattering , if expensive . One February day , when she was passing the time with a manicure , the slender , pink-powdered manicurist , with curls of burnished copper  --  Edna knew her as Miss Pussy  --  looked up from her snipping over Edna 's plump fingers and said , persuasively , Mrs. Jones , I 'd like to see you try a permanentwave . ' Edna had read of permanent waves in Beauty Columns , but they were still a startling novelty . There was something alarmingly irrevocable in the thought of permanence . ' Edna met , uncertainly , Miss Pussy 's lovely pansy eyes . It 's surprisingly youthifying , ' the girl said earnestly . Edna was thirty-eight  --  she would be thirty-nine in April  --  and she had grown no thinner on Carolina 's cooking . Still , Miss Pussy 's comment was tactless . No one had ever urged youthifying ' on Edna before . It was only urged on those who seemed definitely middle-aged . Edna supposed that she did seem that to Miss Pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sighed at what she saw . A stout little woman in a smart tan suit with a brown fox collar  --  thick-shouldered , broad-bosomed , short-thighed , with stocky ankles and puffy insteps protruding plumply from black patent leather . A high tan hat , in shape not unlike a small inverted waste-basket , was perched on her blonde hair . Edna liked the hat , with its dashing brown aigrette , and the round face beneath it still boasted skin that was soft and white with only a few almost invisible crinkles beneath the china-blue eyes  --  but the chin was distinctly double . Edna frowned at that chin and at the fat cheeks above it . Her hair was not grey at all , but the honey-coloured curls of her girlhood had straightened to yellow strands that needed constant rewaving . In the end , ' urged Miss Pussy , it will be an economy.  | Think what you 'll save on marcels . And it will save you so much time . ' Time was not a commodity that Edna felt much need of saving . She sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her small hands . Pretty hands , stretched on Miss Pussy 's towelled cushion  --  pale , soft , with dimpled , slightly double-jointed knuckles , and short fingers that tapered into curved finger nails that Miss Pussy was colouring into little pink shells . I  --  do n't  --  know , ' she said doubtfully , as if the fate of nations depended on her decision . But by the time that Miss Pussy was gently massaging scented bleaching cream into those dimpled knuckles , Edna had succumbed to her argument . Miss Pussy bore her off in triumph to another booth , and very , very gingerly , with craven thoughts of electrocution , Edna allowed her long tresses to be twisted into tight metal curlers and wrapped with malodorous chemicals and thrust into the torturing machine . Two hours later , the result astounded her . First , a round , slick head , neatly checker-boarded with tiny parts from which hung corkscrew ringlets like yellow shavings . And then , after a firm shampoo , a head that was glorified into an incredible halo of pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speechless by this sudden transformation . Whatever would Paul say ? What if he did n't like it ? It was too late , however , for restraining thoughts like that . Permanent , ' thought Edna , with many misgivings , and reassumed her waste-basket and smiled wanly at Miss Pussy 's felicitations . Carolina opened her front door , for it was Theresa 's ' afternoonout . ' She smiled broadly in welcome . Edna promptly removed her hat to hear her cook 's verdict . Carolina 's smile broke into the contagious , squealing laugh of the colouredrace.  |p339Mis  ' Jones , Ah declare you look like a white niggah ! ' It was not too encouraging . When Junior came home , he , too , laughed aloud at the sight of his mother . Edna was afraid to hear Paul 's latchkeyin the front door . When he entered the living-room , he stared blankly at her from the threshold . Then burst into a guffaw of good-natured derision . Edna flushed to the roots of her crown of excelsior , and began to explain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving . Paul 's reply was surprising . Edna , I 'm willing to agree that it 's the greatest discoverysince that of fire for the comfort of the human race  --  but have you seen Theresa ? ' Edna , mystified , shook her head . Just wait , ' he said . I met her in the lower hall . She , too , has not been idle . Just wait . ' He refused to elucidate further , but when Theresa appeared in the doorway to announce dinner , Edna understood and was convulsed in her turn . Theresa had occupied her afternoon out ' in having her black wool permanently straightened . ' It lay ironed and oiled to her neat little cranium , in jet-black Mongolian wisps some four inches long . Paul could n't get over it and chuckled his way through dinner . Junior giggled outrageously whenever Theresa came through the pantry door . Edna struggled in vain to maintainher own decorum , as she met Paul 's mocking eyes . All in all , this little domestic contretemps provided the Jones family with a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . Edna could not remember when she 'd laughed so much with Paul . And that night in her bedroom , when she shamefacedly pulled out her hairpins and let down the mantle of pale golden fuzz over her plump shoulders and her white cotton nightgown , Paul drew near and looked down at her with a gleam of quizzical interest.  | Good Lord , Edna , ' he said , it looks like a grand-opera wig . I feel as if I 'd married Sieglinda . ' Edna did not know who Sieglinda was , and she did not recognize the air of the slow , sweet music that Paul for a moment hummed in his tender baritone , as he stood looking down at her . Then he stopped and smiled . A long , slow smile that Edna had not seen on Paul 's lips for a long time . It made her think suddenly and unexpectedly  --  perhaps the humming had something to do with it  --  of youth and of spring . It made her heart beat faster . As if he knew that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick step forward and laid his hand on her shoulder and stooped to bury his face in the halo of her hair . This action stirred the scent in it of Elizabeth Arden 's hair lotion . Edna vaguely remembered that Miss Pussy had called it Le Reve . ' Paul sniffed its insidious fragrance , as his fingers slid softly down over her neck and his other hand clasped her . Edna shivered deliciously in astonished expectation . But even as he held her , he laughed a little , as if in self-mockery . Or perhaps he was mocking her . As she met his dark eyes in the mirror over her dressing-table , Edna could not be sure . When he spoke his voice , though shaken , held a slight note of irony . You look different tonight . You 're not , I know . But  --  kiss me , Edna . ' Her soft little hands , with fingers pink-tipped , crept up to his face . This was very different from the conjugal nonchalanceof Paul 's customary approach to her . Her astonishmentwas drowned in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Come here , ' he said . The irony had vanished . Edna clung to him , obediently , but across her emotion she silently wondered . Were beauty parlours this powerful ? Had a permanent wave so changed her ? Or was Paul just pretending he had a different girl in his arms ?  |p341In  thinking of it afterward , Edna never knew whether it was due to the permanent wave , or to the soft , subtle influenceof the Southern spring weather , or merely to the fact that Paul , as his work for the Government lightened , was much less preoccupied and , for the first time in his life , had leisure on his hands . But in the months that followed she experienced what was really a brief recrudescence of young marital happiness . Paul , to be sure , saw little of her in the daytime . When not in the Army and Navy Building , he was on the links at Chevy Chase . He went out to stag dinners at the Cosmos Club , which he had recently joined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by departing hostesses who had entertained him in Washington . But Edna was no longer alarmed by these ladies ' potential charms . She knew that when Paul came home to her , and Junior was asleep in his bedroom , she could give him whole-heartedly what he suddenly supremely desired . That knowledge transfigured the whole of her daily living . She was no longer lonely . Her fears for the future were assuaged . Paul was now forty-five years old , and handsomer than ever . The little grizzled pinions of Mercury in the dark hair over his ears had widened and whitened a trifle , emphasizing the dark distinction of his lean , keen face . That face was oftenas inscrutable to Edna as in the days when she had first known him . Impenetrably reserved , save when ruffled by domestic irritation or lit by the bright flash of passion . She was always faintly conscious of the dignity that hung about him , not pompous or pretentious , merely inherent in his achievement . He was a man now , fully grown in experience and capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had affairs of note that identified him with important personages on the national scene , buts that slight hint of mockery that lurked in his glance and his accent whenever he referred to them conveyed the impression that he was never the dupe of their importance . He lived in a wider world than the tenderly intimate one that was encompassedby four bedroom walls , and when he came back from it he sometimes seemed a stranger to Edna , in spite of the years she had lived with him . But he could always exert over her , with the minimum of effort , the power of an inexhaustiblecharm . His strangeness , indeed , increased , in her new-found happiness , her exotic sense of possession  --  her triumph in the truth that she was necessary to his needs . She had only to meet his eyes with a glance of willing surrender to see flickering on his lips a smile that was brilliant as a banner . She knew that they were miraculously reunited . Words were not necessary . The touch of his hand could pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped for some entranced weeks that she was actually going to have another baby . But that hope died . I guess I 'm too old , ' she thought sorrowfully , for she had turned her thirty-ninth birthday . Not very many women had babies after they were thirty-nine . Forty next year  --  a frightful thought . She was always to remember those last few months in Washington as a unique ecstatic interlude  --  a pause in a life 's occupation . She held in her hand the rainbow bubble of her happiness . She saw again in the lovely open city the recurrentbenediction of the spring . It was hard to plan to leave it in the green and golden light of the first May mornings , though the fleeting illusion of the loveliest of seasons was not needed to make Washington beautiful . Back in Chicago her memories of the months would remain with her . The yellow Potomac rushing boisterously through red and yellow October woods , and the banks of Rock Creek , when every tree was a torch and every bush a flame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dome and shaft ,  |p343extended  in architectural distances . The White House in an evening snowstorm , its shimmering portico glimmering vaguely through drifting flakes in the light of its graceful lantern . The Monument on a frosty night , vast and serene , piercing the winter sky , sharply outlined against the sparklingwinter stars . And now  --  her last long walks down leafy avenues that framed vague vistas of equestrian heroes in distant circles , the Southern sunshine , the strange , exotic blossoms , the blue Maryland sky over all. to the skyscrapers and the smoke and the noisy metallic ' clamour of traffic in Chicago . As Edna began to pack up her St belongings , she wondered irrelevantly if the War owed as much to the war workers as the war workers owed to theWar . But thoughts of Pearl and Susan dispelled these melancholy reflections . She was thoroughly excited at thethought of seeing them . And Paul ought to get back to the #ti law . He had said very little , of late , about his former associates . Even in Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr. McElroy had shrunk in the per-spectiveof the last two crowded years . Compared with Viola Sloan , Dolly McElroy seemed rather ridiculous . So busy  --  so importunate  --  so concerned with idle activity . Edna could not see , now , why she had once seemed so important . Her importance , at any rate , was insignificant , beside that of Viola Sloan . Yet Mrs. Sloan just lived  --  andlet things quietly happen . She never rushed madly about , 1 corralling people for parties . Celebrities meant nothing to her , unless they were her friends . Edna had seen very little of her , but her mode of living was one that Edna instinctively admired and would have been glad to imitate . Though , ofBut Paul 's work was ending and they must soon return course , she knew very well that she could never succeed in that imitation . And Paul , though he liked the Sloans so much , would never have been satisfied with their casual social attitude in his own home . If he had been , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not like to let things happen . He always wanted to change them . He had a stake in the game . One late afternoon , Edna was standing on a stepladder , taking down the chintz curtains in the living-room , and thinking quite happily of how dirty the house on Bank Street would be and of how much she would have to do to it , when Paul came home from the Army and Navy Building . He smiled very pleasantly at her from the threshold . We 're packing up in the office , too , ' he said . Nothing left but routine jobs . ' When do we go ? ' asked Edna , untwisting the catch of a curtain rod . I 'd like a week to get ready . ' For a moment Paul did not answer . He walked over to the empty fireplace and pulled a package of Camels from his pocket and scratched a match on the inside of the chimney and lit his cigarette . He had puffed out his first mouthful of blue smoke , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , yes  --  in a way I do , ' said Edna . Of course I do . I 'm crazy to see Pearl . ' Paul made no comment on that observation . He stood smoking in silence . Edna let one curtain slip from its rod to the floor and reached for another . And Susan , ' she added . Then smiled reminiscently . Susan will want to hear all about everything . ' Paul said irrelevantly , Edna  --  I 've been talking to Arthur Sloan . ' She knew from his tone that something was hidden behind the cloak of irrelevance . What about ? ' she asked quickly , and turned on her ladder to look at him.  |p345He  said calmly , He wants me to go to New York . ' To New York ? Now ? What for ? ' She was eyeing him anxiously . To practise law with him . ' Paul still spoke calmly . You mean  --  to live there ? ' Yes . Of course . ' To live there  --  forever ? ' She was aghast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming and clever . His firm is one of the best in the city  --  Sloan , Harkness and Sloan . The first Sloan , Arthur 's father , is dead . He 's been dead for years , and Harkness is over sixty . Arthur offers me an even partnership  --  one third of the profits and , believe me , they 're some profits  --  and my name in the firm . Sloan , Harkness , Sloan and Jones . ' Paul smiled as he repeatedit ; then added brightly , I 've seen Harkness . He 's a grand old dodo . Very impressive . Whiskers like a walrus and eyeglasses on a ribbon . He was down here last month and we talked it all over . ' Edna sat down weakly on the top of the stepladder . Do you mean to say , ' she demanded hotly , that you 've known this for a month ? ' I 've been considering it . Pulling Arthur up on the cut he offered me . ' And you  --  never  --  told me ? ' Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell ? ' As she tried to marshal her argument , Paul answered his own question . Nothing  --  until I 'd decided . ' Edna stared at him , stupefied . Then , Have you decided ? ' she gasped . Yes , ' said Paul briefly . She knew what that decision was . Like a frightened child she stammered : But , Paul  --  you ca n't . I mean  --  I do n't want to . I ca n't move to New York . ' Why not ? ' The words dropped tersely.  | I 'd hate it . ' You 've never been there , ' he pointed out coolly . I want to go home . ' ' Why ? ' Because  --  because Oh , Paul ' She stretchedout her hands to him and felt suddenly insecure on her lofty perch . She clutched the ladder 's rail . She moved and turned to climb backward and clumsily down its treads . She was fat , awkward , slow . She knew it . She tripped on the last rung . Safe on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really must listen to me . I  --  I ca n't do this . I belong inChicago . I want to live near Pearl . She 's all I have -- All you have ? ' Paul raised his eyebrows . Left from childhood , I mean . And that means so much to me . She 's the only one now who goes back  --  like Father and Mother She remembers Blue Island . ' I remember Blue Island , ' Paul permitted himself to remarkwith a touch of irony . Edna burst out indignantly : You do n't understand . You ca n't comprehend what I 'm talking about because you never had a home . Just with me , I meanJust with you ? ' Paul 's critical accents reversed their positions sharply . Edna found herself on the defensive . Well  --  I did n't mean that the way it sounds , Paul . You know  --  you know how much I 've always thought of our home . That 's why I think you owe me a little considerationnowI am considering you . I 'm considering all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And above and beyond the shattering prospect of uprooting her every early association and surrounding her shy self with strangers , Edna felt the dull shame of the utter lack of confidence that Paul 's secrecy had involved . She stared at him miserably . Why did n't you tell me ? ' But I am telling you . ' P347Perhaps it was n't secrecy . Perhaps it was indifference , even disdain . And this was the man to whom she had felt miraculously reunited . Tears born of her helplessness welled up in Edna 's eyes . Her words came hysterically . ' Oh  --  I do n't understand ! How could you , Paul  --  how could you have all that on your mind  --  the way  --  the way we 've been  --  and not even ask me ? ' Not ask you what ? ' A conjugal patience veiled the wearinessin his tone . If I wanted to  --  if I 'd like it  --  if I thought it was the best thing for us ! After all  --  it 's my life , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in very controlled accents . The words were a bomb that burst at her feet . In thebright flash of the explosion , she saw the truth clearly . ' But I 'm not ! ' ' You 're not what ? ' Your dear Edna ! ' She was trembling with anger . Never before had she spoken like this to Paul . I 'm just your -- Oh , God ! What am I ? I do n't mean a thing to you , really . You go on  --  alone  --  in your own way  --  and you do n't give a damn if I 'm happy or unhappy ! But I thought  --  I did think  --  that we 'd come so close again  --  lately . Well  --  I see I was wrong ! ' Paul 's eyes narrowed slightly in a moment of eloquent silence . Then he said calmly , Edna , the servants will hear you . Is it necessary for you to make such a scene ? ' ' Yes . It is , ' she snapped . She realized stupidly that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impotently . Paul turned to toss his cigarette butt into the grate behind him . I 'm not going to let you ruin my life , ' he said distinctly . ' Nor the children 's lives , either . So you 'll have to control yourself . I ca n't understand what all this shooting 's for . There 's nothing to row about . The Sloans are delightful people and New York 's a pleasant place to live in . Much pleasanter than Chicago . You ca n't make the charge that I 'm not generous with you , Edna , and you 'll have more money to play with than you 've ever had before . ' I do n't care about the money ! ' said Edna passionately . She believed every word of it . Well , you spend it , ' observed Paul pleasantly . But perhapshis conscience pricked him , for he added : And I like you to spend it . The children will love it . Jessica has friends there already , that she 's met at Broadmoor-on-Hudson . And Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York 's no place for a child . ' She had heard this said in Chicago drawing-rooms , in defence of her native city . Now , she repeated it triumphantly . It 's time Junior went to boarding-school , ' said Paul very firmly . It 's time he was pulled together in a life with men and boys . He 's tied to your apron strings , Edna . And I want him to go to Harvard . He 'll have to prepare , and Arthur Sloan tells me he thinks he can get him into Saint Clement 's . ' What 's Saint Clement 's ? ' gasped Edna . A boarding-school in New England . A very good boarding-school . Arthur went there and he knows the headmaster . ' This was the last straw . Oh , Paul  --  I ca n't  --  I ca n't bear it . ' Her voice was a wail of protest , but it held a note of resignation . She knew it would all happen , exactly as Paul planned . He spoke very cheerfully : Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we first talk about it . But you do in the end . You 'll see I 'm right about this . I think you 'll enjoy New York , when you once get used to it . And of course you 'll see Pearl . I 'll have to wind things up with the firm . We 'll go back to Chicago now , with Junior , and say goodbye to everyone . And we 'll have to get rid of the house and pack all our furniture . '  |p349It  was almost as if he were making her a present of this delightful prospect . But Edna looked perfectly miserable . He considered her a moment in silence , then had a bright idea . You can spend the summer there , if you like , and lease the house in the fall . It might be a good plan for me to shake down in New York alone , the way I did here , before you join me . New York 's a desert in summer . The Sloans have a place on Long Island ' His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet Paul had never been on Long Island . His face was the inscrutable mask that Edna knew so well . The wider world was claiming him , and Edna , estranged by their quarrel , stood wondering in dulled apathy in what shape he would come back to her . It never occurred to her that words uttered sharply in anger were sometimes like flares of abrupt revelation which lit up crude truths that unspoken had never been recognized . I do n't mean a thing to him , really , ' she repeated in thought , very sadly . But still , they were married . And Edna was far too old-fashioned to admit the possibility that a husband might never , in one sense , come back to a wife at all . P350THE early dusk of a chilly April evening was closing down on the neat brownstone fronts of East Sixty-Fourth Street . The sky above them was an oyster-coloured cloud . The air was coldly fresh with the breath of the rivers and the harbour  --  a watery exhalation very different from the dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humidity of Washington . It still made Edna remember , after more than four years ' residence in the city , that , little as you would think it in the centre of Manhattan Island , New York was a seaport town . She was standing in a front first-floor window of one of the brownstone houses , looking down into the street . The house was differentiated from the rest of the row by the fact that it had been recently remodelled with an English basement entrance . The room behind Edna was a pleasant one , symmetrical , high-ceilinged , and oblong , which stretched across the entire front of the house . The window was open , for Edna had just raised it to air out the stale odour of Jessie 's cigarettes . The child had been smoking there , while waiting for some young man  --  Edna did not know who  --  to call to take her to some place  --  Edna did not know where . The damp air sucked in , stirring the cream net curtains and the damask draperies , freshening the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanking the old davenport  --    reupholstered once more , and this time in wine-coloured velvet  --  two lamps were lit , illuminating the long rows of Paul 's cloth-bound and leather-bound books , set in walnut panels . A small wood fire was smouldering on the hearth . Above it Louis Betts 's new portrait of Paul , an interesting study in greys and browns , with only his keen face picked out in an eager highlight , gazed thoughtfully across the expanse of tan rug and brown Italian furniture at Louis Betts 's new portrait of Edna , hung in the centre of a rosegarlandedwalnut panel on the opposite wall . The portraits had been painted the autumn before when the house was remodelled , and Edna , in effigy , represented the colour note that Mr. Betts and the architect had thought the brown room demanded . She had worn , at their request , an evening gown of cerise velvet , and over the back of her armchair Mr. Betts had draped a turquoise-blue shawl . It picked up the colour of her eyes and set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done her pearls wonderfully . The April before , on her forty-third birthday , Paul had given her a long and luminous string . Both portraits had been much admired , on exhibition that winter , and Edna thought Paul 's a very striking likeness . Jessie had already said , affectionately , Dad , you must leave it to me , in your will . ' Considered as a colour note , Edna had to admit that her own was satisfactory , but it was hard for her to believe that the stoutly corseted little woman , so distressingly well dressed , with pouter-pigeon chest , round , fat face and sleekly bobbed head with its fashionable hair wave , was what she really looked like . Junior did n't like it , but Jessie had said cheerfully that the portrait represented what New York had done to her mother  --  and a good thing , too . If so , it had done it so thoroughly that Louis Betts had at least seemed to see nothing ridiculous about it . But of that , of course , Edna had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , that Paul was a very interesting subject . Paul had enjoyed Mr. Betts and had liked to sit for his portrait . It was so extremely lifelike that Edna , when alone with it , often felt Paul was with her in the room . It made her feel almost uncomfortable to meet in its grave , quizzical glance the very glint that in Paul 's living eyes seemed to say that he was no fool and saw through ' all other fools  --  and among them Edna . She was n't sure  --  but she supposed a clever portrait painter must come to know a lot about his subjects . Perhaps in both canvases Mr. Betts had taken pleasure in conveying more , with ironic delicacy , than the casual eye observed . But Edna was not thinking of the portraits now . She was staring through her open window at the familiar brownstone prospect of East Sixty-Fourth Street , and reflecting that it was hard to believe that only three blocks away , in Central Park , the trees and the bushes were swelling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first green shoots of spring . In hollows there that Edna knew , behind grey rocks remote from gravelled footpaths , an odour of damp dirt and dead leaves and decomposing pine cones and acorns suggested the strong earthy scent of the wild woods that she had known in Washington . If she closed her eyes on the benches and the rubbish cans and the pearly rampart of the distant skyscrapers , she could almost imagine that she saw the purple mist of a Judas tree or a layer of green-white dogwood budding against grey treetrunkson the slopes of Rock Creek Park . But then the clangour of the streetcars and the toots of the motor traffic and the dull , distant roar of the Elevated Railroad  --  always the monotonous background for New York 's sharp pattern of noises  --  would recall her from the dream . Certainly on East Sixty-Fourth Street , on that April evening , only a native New Yorker could have discerned any note of the spring . The house fronts rose abruptly fromP356tiled entries and cement sidewalks and the sidewalks terminatedin asphalt pavements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree or bush or grass . The only odour was a faint breath of motor exhaust , to which Edna 's nostrils were so thoroughly acclimated that she accepted it for ozone . Still , the vernal note was struck , if only by the hand of man . The house fronts , here and there , were adorned with green window boxes , lately planted with geraniums and petunias and daisies and trailing strands of ivy . The black iron railings of the house directly opposite were gleaming with fresh paint . A taxi passed , new-lacquered , as yellow as a daffodil . And far off to the east , the strains of a hurdygurdy , jingling a solo obbligato of Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean ' against the swelling diapason of the city 's orchestral accompaniment , could be distinctly heard . Edna reflected that it was time she set out the tulips in her square of back garden . That garden was a solace , for Paul always spent the summer working hard in town . Last August , Jessie had set up three large red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little red shed , with its silly Russian murals , to house her amateur bar . Edna knew she must see to the cleaning of those parasols , for that bar had been a sensation , and she supposed that when the warm weather came all Jessie 's young men and her feminine cronies would come flocking back for their alfresco alcohol , and would raise that infernal din in the garden , from five in the afternoon until the midnight hours . Last season four of the neighbours had complained of the nocturnal singing , and Paul had told Jessie crossly that any court would hold her a public nuisance . But Jessie had only laughed . By laughing , the child could get anything she wanted from her father . And Edna had thought that it was a good idea to keep the young people home from the night clubs on the West Forties . So the din had prevailed . Of course  --  Edna sighed  --  the bar would be a specialP357problem this summer , if Jessie revived it , for Junior was seventeen , and Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what could she do about it ? Junior informed her that all his contemporaries drank . Even when their parents provided safe ' liquor in punches at the dances they gave for them in hotel ballrooms , the boys and the girls went off in taxis after midnight in parties of four and six to places in basements , where Edna was never quite certain what they saw or what they did . Jessie said placidly that they only danced and listened to floor shows , and that it would n't hurt junior . But Edna felt helpless and worried . Junior was a good boy , but he was easily led . ' In some directions , that is . She had tried in vain to lead him in the paths of temperance . I 'll ask your father to give you a thousand dollars if you 'll promise not to drink hard liquor until you 're twenty-one , ' she had said to him , earnestly , though she hated to drag Paul into it , because he was not sympathetic with Junior . As the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's peremptory discipline and of the seven thousand dollars that had comprised her father 's insurance and the savings of his lifetime . But Junior was not impressed . Could n't be done , Mother . At least  --  not in vacations . The girls set the pace . But at Saint Clement 's , you know , we 're dry as a bone . You get kicked out for drinking . ' Edna had tried to take some comfort in that . But it was cold comfort , because she was always afraid that Junior would be . He was not a favourite with the authorities of his school . Its standard of scholarship was high , and Junior did not keep up with it . The bills for his extra-curriculum tutoring were enormous . He would not be ready for Harvard for another two years . Saint Clement 's was founded on the sound rock of classicism , and Dr. Scrope , the head master , had once observed sarcastically to Paul that the Army and Navy could n't make Junior study Latin . There 's no harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may not be college material . ' Paul had flouted that suggestion . He would not accept the fact that his son was distinctly not bright . Well  --  it 's up to you , ' he had said , so coldly that even the august Dr. Scrope had flinched and had found himself spinelessly accepting the inference that the honour of Saint Clement 's was staked on the progress of Junior . But Junior liked the school and had always liked it , after his first three months of thirteen-year-old homesickness . That had nearly broken Edna 's heart . She had grown very close to her son in the loneliness of Washington . She had felt that she positively could not leave him , alone and little and tearful , in the cold grey stone cloisters of Saint Clement 's on that fatal September evening when they had had to part . She had just moved to the East , after her last summer on Bank Street , and her heart was already torn by her parting from Pearl and from Susan . Jessie had gone to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleasant with Dr. Scrape , paternally firm with Junior , very cheerful with Edna , but a little preoccupied with catching the midnight train from Boston back to New York . But Junior had settled down in the school routine by Christmas . He liked his new friends and he came home for the holidays proudly wearing the school hatband . That spring , for a new boy , he did pretty well for Saint Clement 's in track . He had the build of a runner , and his grandfather 's optimism and his gentleness and his utter indifference to any intellectual problem . Remembering her own dull struggles with the higher branches of learning in the Blue Island High School , Edna knew exactly how he felt . Paul did n't , and in the vacations he always argued with Junior . He held up the example of his own well-spent youth . P359If I 'd had your opportunities --  ' he 'd urge , and Junior'sblue eyes would grow vague with boredom . He was a thin boy , tall , lanky , and lackadaisical , with straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utterly unlike Jessie , whose desires and decisions , though Paul often criticized them , were fundamentally synchronized with her father 's brisk tempo . Edna 's thoughts had wandered very far afield from the tulip bulbs for her garden . She spent most of her time , now , worrying about her children . But the room was growing chilly and she shut the window . Then she heard the parlourmaid'sstep in the hall . Yes , Katie ? ' she said receptively , at a tap on the door jamb . Katie stood in the doorway , a grey-haired woman in her late forties , with shrewd , friendly features that , in spite of the civilizing influence of her smart maroon silk uniform and organdy apron , suggested a rural American background . As a matter of fact , it had been that of an Iowa farm . Shall I draw the curtains , m 'm ? ' M 'm ' was the nearest approach that Katie would concede to the madam ' of conventional service . But her voice was respectful . She had been with Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her window . Her house ran like clockwork now . She had mastered the hard task of being waited on . As Katie pulled the portieres , she volunteered over her shoulder , The cake looks lovely , m 'm . ' Edna 's eyes met Katie 's and both women smiled . The cake was for Paul , for the day was April first , which passed for his birthday . When Edna had married him , she had been shocked to realize that he had never known what day that actually was . She had urged , Paul , I think you ought to pick a day , ' and he had said , Well , I was left onp360that doorstep on a late April evening . I think April Fool 's Day would be an appropriate hypothetical selection . ' She had baked him his first birthday cake , iced it in pink , and trimmed it with twenty-seven candles , that very first spring in the La Salle Avenue flat , when Jessie was coming . And now Sherry had made the cake , and Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar roses and fifty candles set round it in a big wooden ring . Even as she gave those instructions , she had not been able to believe in the fifty candles . In spite of the long way she had travelled , she did not know where the years had flown . She glanced at Paul 's portrait and thought of the young Gibson Man ' she had met at Pinscher 's Park , and saw him as distinctly as the man on the canvas . White-flanneled , blue-coated , stiffsailored  --  with that fascinating something so different from Al Reimer in his manner and in his eyes . In his voice , too , ordering his beer , as if the waiter were negligible . She saw his face beside her on the bench in the poplar grove , dimly romantic in the starlight . She heard his voice again . How many men have told you you were awfully pretty ? ' Edna would never forget the dizzy delight of that moment . But now , Edna sighed . I expect Mr. Jones may be late , Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be very rare . ' She had ordered wild duck for Paul  --  he loved it  --  with wild rice and fresh peas , and green salad and imported Camembert to follow . A sound man 's dinner . Yes , m 'm , ' said Katie , and went out into the hall . Yes  --  Paul would be late , and he 'd certainly be tired . He had arrived in New York on the Century that morning , from a flying trip to Chicago . Business , of course . Consultationwith Wintringham , Fox and McElroy , who were glad to handle occasional Western lawsuits for Paul 's New York firm . Edna had called him at noon in his office , to say Happy Birthday ' over the telephone , and he had remarked that he was busy . But then , Paul always was.  |p361He  had worked very hard , harder than ever , Edna sometimesthought , for Sloan , Harkness , Sloan and Jones . The New York pace was swift , and Paul more than kept up with it . Old Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna that Paul was by way of being considered ' a coming leader of the New York Bar . But they had n't seen much of the Sloans  --  at least Edna had n't . And she had n't expected to , though she liked them both and she rather thought Arthur was the best friend that Paul had ever had . The men were thoroughly congenial , but Viola Sloan  --  well , of course she was always pleasant and friendly , but months went by without Edna 's ever once laying eyes on her . She invited Paul and Edna to dinner occasionally . More rarely , she and Arthur dined with them . She had been kind to Jessie her debutante season . She had asked Edna to join a hospital board and a committee that raised money for a day nursery . But that was all . New York was like that . So big and so busy . Cut up in different sets . The Sloans lived away downtown on Washington Square . They spent , too , six months of the year on their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Edna first joined Paul in New York , after his four summer months alone . Edna had been sorry , for she had n't a single friend and she had needed a word of advice , as she faced the great city in the late September heat , and looked blankly for a home . She had thought the brownstone streets looked formal and ugly , the small parks dingy and sordid , the city blocks restricted , with no great eastern expanse of the familiar Lake Michigan view . The Hudson River had come nearer than anything else to supplying an open horizon . Edna had finally found a nine-room apartment on Riverside Drive , with a broad view of the river . The rent was beyond belief , but Paul was too busy with his first New York trial work to pay much attention to it , and he signed a year 's lease without any demur.  | Edna had unpacked their belongings there  --  the teakwoodparlour set and the dining-room Sheraton , the books and the Tudor furniture from the bookroom , and the French walnut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her rearrange them . It had never occurred to her that interior decorators could be found in New York . The effect of the apartment was jumbled , but homelike and pleasantly familiar , when everything was in its place . The sunsets were glorious , over distant New Jersey hills , and she never grew tired of looking at the river . But when Jessie came home from Broadmoor-on-Hudson for the Christmas holidays , she had said promptly that the place was a mess ' and that Riverside Drive was ' impossible . ' All of her school friends lived east of Central Park . And Paul had listened with the veiled , ironic respect that he had come to accord , of late , to Jessie 's social intuitions , and said , with no more than a touch of parental levity : All right , young lady . I suppose you 've grown up to think you 're the doctor . We 'll move in the fall . ' So they had moved , to East Sixty-Fourth Street , and Jessie had come out ' there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing-room on the left of the front door . That was before they 'd had the house remodelled and refurnished  --  anotherof Jessie 's ideas that Paul had adopted . Edna had been worried about that tea  --  for who , she said , would come to it ? She had made no friends in her first year in New York . But Paul had declared that was nonsenseand Jessie 's heart was set on it , so Edna had prepared to struggle with caterers and flowers and engraved invitations , and in the end Paul was right . They had quite a respectablecrowd . For Mrs. Sloan came with Arthur and said Jessie looked lovely , smiling above rosebuds in her frock of cream chiffon . She had pleased Paul tremendously by observing , as if she meant it , You have quite a distinguished child . ' Old Mr.P363Harkness came , with his three married daughters and his debutante granddaughter . And all Paul 's acquaintance in the office , with their smartly dressed wives . Jessie 's young friends swarmed in , with a sprinkling of their parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never remember . A few of Paul 's new uptown clients turned up , with their feminine relations ; and five of the women whom Edna had met on the hospital board and the day nursery committee . By six in the evening , Edna was beginning to worry for fear that she had not provided enough of the little ice-cream moulds . But she had . Later that night Jessie had had a dinner of twenty-four debutantes and young dancing men that she seemed to have met at other people 's houses , and Paul took them all out afterward to some midnight show . Edna had been too tired to go with them , after the strain of the tea and the dinner party . She had sunk into her bed in a state of utter exhaustion , only able to feel thankful that Jessie was successfully launched on her New York career . Since that day , Jessie had led her own life , competently and uncommunicatively  --  which often seemed to Edna preposterous . But what could a mother , who was a New York stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gay young people who telephoned and dined and drank at the bar in the garden . Jessie was out of the house all day . She was out of it most of the night , and she kept running off for the week-ends . She took no interest whatever in the older generation , except in Viola Sloan . Edna suspected that she had been rather impressed by the dinner that Mrs. Sloan had given for her , in the fine old house on Washington Square , during the Christmas holidays of her first season . She had met a lot of different people there , who never , she said to Edna , seemed to go anywhere . ' She had told Paul , at the end of that evening , that she thought Old New York was a wee bit mouldy . ' She had his trick of mocking the heightsp364that she was delighted to attain . Intellectual independence , ' Paul called it . But on Jessie 's young lips , Edna thought it was just plain bad manners . ' She was thankful to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual presence of Viola Sloan . And now , Jessie had been out ' for four years , and this last season she had been three times a bridesmaid for **28;3013;TOOLONG . Her serious ' interests centred in the work of the Junior League committees . She had joined the League two years before . She would be twenty-three years old in July . As old as Pearl , when Paul had married Edna . But oddly enough , in spite of her completely detached and self-reliant existence , Edna still thought of Jessie as a child . She could not imagine what went on in her young head , behind the bright mask of her competence . She wondered , sentimentally , what Jessie might be thinking of all her young men . They were so numerous  --  so casual  --  so familiarly devoted . But that young head seemed never to be turned . Girls did n't dream of devotion now , as they used to . They did n't long for marriage . They had so many other things to do . And the young men  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and the motor , which Edna disapproved of so highly  --  what were they thinking of the girls who set the pace ' ? As far as Edna knew , Jessie had never yet had an offer . ' She had questioned her tactfully about this , and Jessie had replied , with cheerful impudence , Mother , you do n't know all that goes on in a taxicab . ' Edna had visibly recoiled . But , She ca n't mean anything as bad as that sounds , ' she had thought . Yet she worried about it , when Jessie was out in the long midnight hours . She tried to reassure herself with the reflection that youth was never confidential , and in this connection was obscurely comforted when it chanced to occur to her that Mrs. Losser had died without ever knowing that Al Reimer had pro-posed . ' P365Edna 's thoughts were interrupted by the abrupt ring of the doorbell . That might be Jessie . Paul always used his latchkey . Then Edna heard her daughter 's voice , downstairs , addressing Katie sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tappe 's ? ' Katie 's answer was inaudible . Then the telephone bell rang . I 'll go , Katie , ' shouted I Jessie . And then there was silence , broken , after a little , by Jessie 's feet on the stairs . Mother --  ? Oh , there you are ! ' Jessie stood on thethreshold , in her little navy-blue coat , with its absurd white polka-dotted silk muffler , a tiny blue felt beret aslant on her dark bobbed hair . She was carrying a bandbox , and beneath it her slim legs , visible from the knee down in the sheerest of beige silk stockings , made her look like a little girl . Her lipstick modified that look  --  bright carmine on her thin lips  --  and so did her clear-cut , eager profile . Her dark eyes were adult and restless . ' My hat 's come . I 'll wear it tonight . ' Jessie  --  you 're not going out ? ' cried Edna , in dismay . You bet I am . Dick 's coming for me in fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party that Lucy 's throwing for that lemon Hartford cousin of hers who went to Radcliffe . She 's the world 's worst news . Lucy says it will take more than Hot-cha to warm her upJessie , ' said Edna , it 's your father 's birthday . I toldyouI know , ' said Jessie . And I absolutely forgot . I have a Charvet tie for him , upstairs on my bureau , but when Lucy asked me I just never thought of it Jessie , I really think you ought n't to go . You canOh , no , I ca n't . I mean I could n't . Lucy 's absolutely counting on me . But it 's all right . ' What 's all right ? ' Edna 's tone was thoroughly critical . Father 's not coming home . He just telephoned . I took the message . He says that he has to work all evening **27;3043;TOOLONG . They lived on his face and legs . We vaulted the barred gate into the soft pasture . The shutters were closed on the buff walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild locust trees was there any one under the columns of the heavy portico . Slaves had survived ; the masters were gone . Sun flooded the meadow in rolling green . Before us , far and falling in shade , were the huge willows that bordered the run . We hurried toward the cool . Undressing on the bank , I stretched out my legs . Until the last moment , I kept some covering . And when I stood straight , I clasped my shoulders in the wind . Clouds were small and low above the blue mountains . Lifting my feet from the strange prickle of grass I went slowly . Morton was in the water before me , swimming did not looktoward me . But I was conscious of my body as I walked on tender feet and swayed as I stepped from the bank , oozing down into deep mud . I was naked in the sun . Yet I was proud in the water circling my knees before I plunged . We dove , we swam . We splashed , sending on each other cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung in faces until our eyes were red . We shoved water , stood and laughed in a glitter of drops that shivered into a rainbow mist as they fell . Again we swam . Maybe even better was being dried somewhat by the wind and dressing in the air . Clothes are wonderfully warm and comforting that way , when the skin under them is partially clamp . We walked back under the willows , following the run upstream and climbed out by the first bridge , coming back to town by the Ruddimont pike . But now at Ruddimont , in the woods of June , jays winged flashes of heavenly azure . Under the high oaks they called with raucous laughter ; marauders moved among theP101branches , stealing from other birds ' nests , feeding on living eggs . Ardista was more accustomed to the place and no longer took affront at any command . Apparently she understood that there was nothing demeaning in being asked to do what Caroline would vastly have preferred doing herself but for her condition . She still flushed making butter . Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , counsellingher from the moment she sat down to the churn until under her hand the fat yellow pats were released from the mould , each perfect in shape and plump in the impression of a sheaf of ripe wheat . They worked in the cool spring-house , where the sun fell on whitewashed walls and the squarecutwindow through a trail of shadowing willow . Inside was the chill of running water . Boards dripped and the floor on which the crocks stood was constantly damp . At such times , Caroline could have an exasperating patience . Ardista worked with her arms bare , her elbows sharpened and red as though from chafing . At every reproof , she flamed in sullen obstinacy . She ran through the halls like a killdeer and meeting her suddenly she was like something wild , shrill and frightened . I helped her with the chickens , when she fed them after breakfast . And in the late afternoons , we collected eggs . We went first to the odorous henhouse and then hunted for stolen nests in the barn . At night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with young broods into their coops . When the doors were broken , we closed them with strips of board weighted in place by a stone . It was not that I was taken with Ardista . Brought up with three brothers , she affected to despise all boys . I was called rowdy when I outran her . She was afraid that I would look down on her because she came from the poor country close to the mountains . I had seen her father's farm . She was rude to me to prevent my scorn , but too restless to be convincing . Chance had set me after her . She incited my curiosity about girls . Ardista was pretty and my confusion was only increased by familiarity . Some mornings I went with her to gather strawberries before the dew was raised from their leaves . We moved between the straw-lined rows , in the sun , as children do , withoutrising from their crouched knees . I told her about Mordington . " Then I do n't believe you 've got a girl -- It was true . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of eight and been constant in the affair until I was more than twelve . It had been absorbing in ( lancing school , for the most part pleasant , even in its jealousies , and painful only in games at parties when older boys , with knowing persistence , tried to make us kiss . But it was gone now . I had changed . Somehow it did not seem significant . " Because if you had , you would n't want to spend so much time here on the farm . " I told Ardista nothing . I searched for strawberries , hidden scarlet and plump under overlying foliage . The runners were burnt deep red . She stooped in scorn over her basket . She picked faster than I did . We came together , approachingalong several rows . When she found a large red fruit , she presented it to my mouth . I knelt so our knees touched . She held the stem while my teeth closed on it . She fed me a second berry . I held her hand and sharply bit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . But a moment later I saw her eyes bright with merriment as she brought me another . " You can take that and eat it yourself . " But I caught and held her , swaying . Laughing , her facep103was alight in the morning air . When I loosed her , curls were blown across her face . At supper it occurred to me that I might fall in love with Ardista . I sat looking at her while we ate strawberries and cream . " You know , " I said to Caroline , " I always think they taste better with the caps on . Straight from the patch  --  " " You do n't like them with cream ? " " No , " I said seriously . Then , disconsolately I had to see my scraped bowl . But I was convinced that I had eaten Caroline'sberries only through politeness , so I refused when she offered me more . tI lingered in the door of the dining room until Ardista , who cleared the table , had gone . I went upstairs early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window of my bedroom . The house was dark except for lamplight on green leaves outside the kitchen door . There rose soft negro voices . Air drifting from one chimney was bitter with wood smoke . Below me was the lawn all dim and dewy amid nightdrenchedtrees . The first bats fluttered after the last belated swift . Crooked on the sill was not a comfortable way to sit , but I was trying to think of situations to show me in love . I knew all about love . I had read many books . Stars pricked the sky . Crickets began their din from dark grass . Deep in the woods a screech-owl , tremulous and tender , repeated his note . I had no trouble imagining desperate and romantic actions , but none of them seemed available at Ruddimont . I was partial to shipwrecks . I had no thought of sleep . But concentrating on myself , I could find no other symptom of being in love . And strangely and without effort I started thinking about campingalong the river . When I heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I leaned from the sill , not without disgust . Charlie was there too , sounding coarse and loud . They were laughing and talking . Rush giggled high . I slammed the sash down . There was nothing to do but undress . And sadly I brushed my teeth , spitting viciously over the bowl . I lay on the bed , but the night was too warm . I had to get up again to open the window . The next morning I intended avoiding Ardista . But later I came on her in the gallery of the summer kitchen . She sat on the brickwork under the low arches shelling peas . " Hello , Mr. Stuck-up ! " I had never been particularly bothered by girls . But now I was struck with self-consciousness . She pouted when she saw me . I asked if I could help her . " If you want to  --  " She moved the pan over and for some minutes there was no sound between us but the plopping peas . " Why did you call me that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon you are all right to me here . " Her fingers were rather blunt and her hands had the same mauve hue as though they were cold . " But you know why ? " " No , " I swung my legs . " Because we 're not in Mordington . " " What 's that got to do with liking you ? " " You do n't like me . " " I do . " I had not thought about liking her , but was willing to say so . " You wo n't speak to me when I meet you in town . " " Of course , " I said , swinging my legs . Her eyes were grave . Her dress was blue gingham and her arms bare . " Even if you was with one of your town girls ? " I agreed . Then I made her an offer . She had finished with the peas and lowered her pan to the brick pavement . She leaned against the low white arch . " What 's it about ? " Ip105tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry ? Because I ca n't read most books , they are always so sad . I do n't want to cry . " We were both in the gallery the following afternoon . I read aloud to her , propped against a pillar , from The Hound of the Baskervilles , when suddenly she left me , throwing her legs over the brick ledge . " Come on ! " She plunged through lilac bushes into the rain , I after her . I had known from the pages that the skies were clouding , but read on through the first pattering drops . The shower was sudden and windblown . We ran to shut in hens and their late broods of chickens . They cuddled underblustering wet wings . Ardista stooped , tumbling the small balls of yellow fluff into the coops . She pulled her skirt up from behind to hood her head and shoulders . Rain ran over my hands . We shut in the hens and stopped the low openings into the dark coops . The chicks were safe in dry straw . The doors slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We entered by the lower door that led to the stalls and stood there a moment , breathing and excited . Ardista held the latch ; rain poured against the walls and was blown through the open crack . We felt it , a violent cool mist , on our faces . My shoulders were soaked . Then we tramped past the empty cow stalls . And the darkness had a wonderfully dry and dusty smell from oat bins . The steps were steep as a ladder . Her stockings were cotton and her skirt wet . Climbing , I put my arm around her . " Are you wet ? " " Yes , " I said . " And so are you . " My arm was awkward about her . I touched the moisture ) i '  |p106of  her hair . Then I let my hand stroke her throat under drippingsmall curls . There was wonder in the spaces of the barn , in the high rafters laced with cobwebs and in the dark dingy air under the roof . Swallows twittering darted down from their nests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rain on the shingles seemed far off . And here the shower had a safe sound . I made her laugh , but felt her breath . My hand had never seemed so light . " You are afraid , " she said and her eyes were wide . Wondering , my hand was on her damp shoulder , I saw where the drenched gingham shaped her breasts . " You are afraid to kiss me . " " No , I 'm not . " And while she waited in a sort of contempt , I brought my mouth to her cheek . " I knew you were . " She looked into my confused face and kissed me quickly on the lips . I clambered hurrying after her up the ladder . She tramped the hay . " We 'll hunt for eggs . " I followed her , rather relieved . It was fun to search in the mow for hidden nests . Dust from hay stifled my nostrils . I was in familiar circumstances now . In bare patches the floor was loosely laid and between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not know how it happened . I did not trip . She called . I thought she had discovered a nest under the hay . Then I found myself lying upon her , panting . I wanted to kick the floor . Then her lids were open and I looked deep down into her eyes and I heard the rain . I listened as though it were fallingvery far away . She was annoyed . " Get off of me ! " Shrill and angry , she thrust at " Her voice was husky now and her face pathetic.  |p107Going  down the ladder , my clothes were cold . She went out the front of the barn into the rain . I could only follow her uncomfortably . I was sorry for being young . And sad for what was not done I sat around a long time in wet clothes before going upstairs , shivering , to change . We ate supper late . Charlie came out from town after the rain , bringing my mother . The sun set in a sulphur light1above wet trees . Ardista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I went out on the porch in the dusk . " I do n't know , " Caroline said , " but I have n't felt the slightest movement . Not for a month now --  " " And what does the doctor say ? " " That it is probably the change of corset . He says not to worry . " My mother to console her changed the subject . " I 'm so grateful to you for having John here . " I sat by the steps and as she spoke I took my mother 's hand . I longed to tell her how I loved her . By this time , what had been shame made me feel virtuous . My mother was feather-stitching when Charlie burst in on us . I do not know whether she understood at once when he spoke . She looked up at him in a helpless and incoherentcalm . " The doctor says the child must be dead . He ca n't hear a heart beat . " Charlie 's coat hung over his arm . He was ruffled and stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer light straining at the green slats of the shutters . I stood by the sitting room door . " He was n't satisfied the last time he came out to Ruddimont . Caroline has n't felt any movement for over a month now . I could see he was suspicious as he sat there prodding her . But you know how he is . Doctor Dermott is a talker , but he 's damned secretive . He never will tell you any morep108than he has to . I followed him out to the car . But all I could get out of him was to bring Caroline into town . I can make a more thorough examination there . ' It was all he would say . " And this morning I was waiting in a little side room at the hospital . And even then he did n't dare tell me . He sent in one of the young nurses . I never thought the examinationcould be over so soon and when she came in she looked all around before she spoke to me . I thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor thinks the baby is dead . ' She was so casual , I could n't take it in . " " But Caroline ? " " I took her back home . She do n't know . " Neither of them noticed that I was in the room . My mother sat still , without color . She retreated from the shock , and when she spoke , her voice was almost unconcerned . " What does he say ? " " Doctor Dermott ? Well , I just came from him . This morning I was dazed . I did n't move . I suppose I ought to have caught him as soon as he had seen Caroline , before he had a chance to get away from the hospital . Or maybe I could n't . I do n't believe he wanted to see me . " For a moment she sought his eyes and the color was once more apparent in her cheeks . " I 'm so sorry , Charlie . I 'm as sorry as I can be . They bring their love with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Charlie rolled a cigarette . His bearing was defiant , but his dark eyes were quick-shifting . " He says there 's no danger . But Caroline still has to go through with it . " " He 's not afraid of blood-poisoning ? " my mother asked . " He says not . " Charlie moistened his lips . " But I don'tknow . He 's so slippery . He hangs on to you while he 's talking to you , but all the time you know there 's something he 's holding back . I wanted to kill him . But no , he says she ought to go ahead and have the baby . In the natural manner , ' he said . As if it was natural  --  " " Would n't a Caesarian be safer ? " " Not as far as I can find out . " " It 's a very simple operation now , " said my mother . " I can stand it , " he said . " But I do n't know how I am going to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she 'll have to know when the baby 's born . It 's going to be awful when she knows she 's been through it all and has nothing to show for it . " My mother stared straight ahead of her . It was a wrapperfor the baby she was working on . When Charlie left she took it up again . The activity of her fingers was calming.  |p110it  was morning when they left Ruddimont . A red-shoulderedhawk circled the warm woods . The leaves hung motionless . Charlie had a sense he had never before known of having no existence of his own . They drove along the white hot road in a glare on which the tasselled top of the surrey made a rambling shade . On either side were rail fences . A heat of silence lay on the growing corn . Charlie 's hands were hot and the sweat ran from his hair . He drove at an easy pace . The valley spread wide , rolling and varied with fallow land and meadow . Fields of wheat were in shock and quivering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing green . Beside him was Caroline 's suitcase with the things she would need at the hospital and clothes for the baby . Against the back seat , Caroline was sustained by cushions from the parlor . On three nights , after she had undressed and lay in bed , she had been sure her pains were starting . She looked at Charlie with wide eyes . Once he had summonedDoctor Dermott and returned to wait restlessly on the foot of her bed , timing the pains . They were coming every fifteen minutes . Then nothing happened . After an hour the pains had stopped . The night before he had tried to talk to her . They still slept together and he sat straight up in bed , in his excitementmoving his hands . Her hair was soft on the pillow , and she listened gravely , her eyes staring in the darkness . He took care to remind her only of what she must already have known . But something was wrong , since she had felt no movements from her womb for more than two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise if she went to  |p111the  hospital where she could rest until the child was born . Her natural placidity was worn by loss of sleep . He was suddenly aware that he was talking very loud . Sitting upright , his knees pointing the sheets , he was tense in the throat . Charlie had never before known he had nerves . She assented , whatever he said , softly . He proclaimed she was not to worry . And then under the sound of his words , she was sleeping . He had the sense of her warm and soft and breathing beside her . Her patience was anxious with waiting . Caroline still supposed that the child she carried wanted to be born . Charlie carried his secret . Since Doctor Dermott had told him two weeks before , that the child could scarcely be alive , there being no heartbeat , he had known it as a constriction . And he felt it now , driving , a tightness that would not let him quite breathe . The surrey went slowly . His templestrickled sweat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white stony road . His naked hands were inflamed in the sun . In his consciousness of what awaited them , it was he and not the woman behind him , who , as they drove , bore toward the hospital a dead and unborn child . It must have been about a quarter of eleven when Charlie came into the parlor at Ruddimont . Shadows lay long on the floor . The curtains had not been drawn . He turned on the lights and shut the moonlight out . The first thing he saw was the game of solitaire which Caroline had laid out the evening before on a low table in f tort of the sofa . He was confused by the innocent cards . They had not ken touched . All day they had lain there , scattered , their blank faces staring upward , jacks , queens and kings , as Caroline 's hands , probably dishonestly , had disposed them.  |p112He  was caught in a consciousness of time . Last night , she had not known what awaited her . Concentrated on playing , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support her back . Caroline 's cards were never allowed to run entirely by chance . A mad irritation swept over him . Her game had not come out . He had a moment of torment , which was hopeless and passed , leaving him utterly empty . He flung the cushions he had brought in from the carriageto the sofa . The table was shaken , cards fell . The blank placid face of a queen looked up at him from the floor . She was not alive . The boy was not alive . He could never have been living . At the hospital he felt nothing . The doctor ca n't hear the heartbeat . But that was two weeks ago , he had suffered knowing , but the event had dulled him . Even in the corridor , when he stood by the closed door , waiting until he could see Caroline , and the nurse passed carrying a basin with a cloth over it , and he turned after her and she rapidly said , Yes . It was what the doctor thought . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' And standing with his hands against the bare wall , He was perfectly proportioned . But like a seven months ' child . ' Even then , he had known nothing but that sense of helplessness , as though he himself had been a boy , shut out by his elders and lonely because he can hear them talking behind a closed door . He had not looked . Even now he did not know whether it was his son covered in the copper basin . The nurse hurried on down the bare hallway . He went into the dining room and at the sideboard poured himself a drink . It warmed his throat . He could drink himself into stupefaction and then sleep . That was one way out . But it was no good . He drained the last drops . He wanted somebody to talk to . He strode toward the kitchen , leaving the lights on all the way . He had had nothing to eat since morning . Hep113had not thought of it before , and even now had no need of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug and still tired with pain . She was stretched in a voluminoushospital gown and half covered with a sheet . He held her hand . Yes , ' she said , I knew . It was something the doctor said as I was going under the chloroform . They thought I had gone and then I heard him say , The baby is dead . That was the last I heard . But then when I came out again , I knew . I did n't have to ask him . I looked for the basket . It was still there . And I knew there was no baby . ' She was far away from her voice . She seemed distant and ashamed . Even then , it was dullness he felt , looking down at her tired body . And now I want to sleep . ' Her hand was frail . He felt nothing now , not even hunger . He looked in the ice box , found a ham on one shelf . On the back porch was a moondusk latticed with black shadows . Stooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grass . Some one was behind him . " Ardista ! " " I heard you come in . What about the baby ? " His heart went down . " It was dead , " he said . Then suddenly he found a full breath . The night was clear and the summer darkness cooled by dew . He drank in the air . She came up to him and laid her hands against his chest . " You poor thing ! " He touched her cheek . And when she lifted her face from the dusk of her hair , he brought her to him and felt her body invade his vacancy . It was young and under her gown soft as it yielded . He held her to him , without desire , wondering at the smallness of her waist . She was living in his arms , yet very still until her head fell back and he kissed her lips that parted underp114his wilful pressure . She was there in pitiful abandonment , clinging after he had raised his mouth . " Come on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood within his arms , yet he scarcely held her . " I want something to eat . And I 'm as hungry as a hound . " " Where ? " " In the dining room . I have n't had anything since I left here this morning . " While she laid the table , he poured out another whisky at the sideboard , but this time he diluted it with water . He was in no hurry now to get drunk . From then on , all that he did was deliberate . He knew he could take her whenever he wanted . He was not excited . But Ardista was desirable and only desire could fill the void within him . Not that he thought of it as a decision of will , there had simply been a moment when he knew that nothing that came after could prevent his having her . As he watched her across the table , he was sure not even his own consciousness could stop him . He drank at first because he was nerveless and tired ; but now because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . But he was not drunk . And it needed an effort of his mind to call her to him . He would not go after her , but made her come to the armchair where he sat at the end of the long table . She trailed a faded and flowered kimono of Caroline 's , which fell apart when she loosed her hands . He lifted and held them , then , looking into her confused face , he put one arm around the thin cotton nightgown that covered her thighs . But he went first into the parlor and it was dark when she followed him . There was only a silver air staring from the three long windows . With a preliminary shiver , she gave way to his advance . Ardista did not exist for him ; in the darkness she was a being whose clasp consoled him and whose pain when hep115encountered it completed his own . He was held by the night , his desperation alive . When he unclosed his eyes , he saw her hair crushed into the cushions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two lyres of the curving arm . The low table was overturned and the cards scattered on the floor . Then she was crying in his arms . " I know you wo n't love me any more . After what I 've done , you 'll hate me . I know you will . " He knelt beside her , his heart empty . Until she was quiet he held her , and humiliated waited the return of desire.  |p116I  HAD come in from the soft and sunny morning . My grandfather was at his office desk , splitting envelopes with a thin steel poniard . Closing the door , I asked him how he was . " Worse , thank God ! " Here he was littered with law books . Bound in buff leather , they were ranked in shelves , tumbled on tables , pressed into tight rows behind glass doors . A pile tottered by the couch . The window was open beside him , and on the wall above his roll-top desk hung a yellowed map of Mordington . Dated twenty years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the Boom , which he had promoted , not terminated with the tracing of these imaginary streets and circles , these speculative plots and squares . " Always worse ! I do n't get any younger . But there are times , you know , when I forget that the practice of law 's not a damn thing but looking after other people 's damn business . " Through the window I could see the trees of the courthouseyard coming into leaf . " What 's the trouble ? " " Your friend Miss Virginia has just given me a very nice job . " " Did she write you ? " " No , no . She just reminds me . It 's something I promised to do two months ago . I 've put it off . I do n't want to do it . " One letter he carefully placed in a brass rack and tore the rest to scattered bits . " You know Mrs. Boxwood ? " " Yes , sir . " " She cleans my office for me . Once a week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil . She'sACT OF DARKNESS I17p117got four children . I do n't pay her much , but then , dammit , she do n't clean very well . " I sat on the sunny sill . Sparrows shivered their dusty feathers in the street , squabbled over straws . " So I do n't want to do it . " " Do what ? " " Put her out . " The boughs of sidewalk trees unfolded in green . In one of them a cocksparrow was courting his mate with fidgety energy . " The dwelling was empty when she moved into it . And now your friend Miss Virginia is after me because I did n't get her out two weeks ago . " Quivering , the cock-sparrow hung above his shivering hen . They lived in the May air . " Ca n't she pay the rent ? " " Rent ! " said my grandfather . " Nobody 's paid rent on that ramshackle old tenement since the War . She 's poor as dog 's broth . I 'd like to tell you about it some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's too run down . Even niggers wo n't live there . And when Mrs. Boxwood moved in with her whole raft of children they let her stay . " I watched the sparrows , the hen shifting from twig to dose twig , the little cock following in feathered frenzy . " Nobody bothered her . But then Miss Virginia had to come along and buy the place with the house thrown in . She ca n't let it . But she wants to get Mrs. Boxwood putut . I do n't like it . But I will say this for Miss Virginia , It ai n't the rent . I do n't think she 'd trouble the poor devil for that . But it 's this fool philanthropic idea she 's got in her bead . She wants to make the place into a park . " Tie sparrows had amorously gone into other green leaves , on , " said my grandfather . " I want you to go with " I do n't think I can , " I said. " 0 , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you there . " The ceiling was stained from lamps that had gone out in the ' eighties . The heavy gas chandelier was wired for electricity . He stood smoothing the dust from his broad black felt hat with his sleeve . " You might as well come along . I know you have n't got anything better to do . " Reluctantly I left the window . I thought how pleasant to be a cock-sparrow . I was fifteen . " But I 'll admit , " he said , " that Mrs. Boxwood is a case . You ca n't wonder that all the respectable ladies condemn her . They 've never been able to figure out how she had so many children from a bedridden husband . He was paralyzedfrom the waist down . He 's dead now . And this last child , they say , has a touch of the tar brush . I do n't know . All I know is , she ca n't clean very well . The first thing she does when she arrives is to ask for twenty cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat off until I 've given it to her . And then when she gets it , she 's off to the drugstore . She 's gone about ten minutes and when she comes back she has her little bottle of paregoric with her . " We had come out on the step . " But paregoric  --  " I said . " That 's a medicine . " " Yes , " said my grandfather . " It is a medicine . They give it sometimes to little boys . But it 's also a mild form of morphine . Mrs. Boxwood ca n't work until she has it . " We crossed George Street and passed the bank . He was slim , tall , erect , and even his unbuttoned coat had a sort of distracted distinction . With his cane alert , he walked deliberatelyon Washington Street , through the two blocks of brick stores , with small hesitations as though he were shortsighted . His blue eyes could be very keen , but he had a way of not seeing anything he did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stiffly mannered , putting out two fingers of the hand that held the cane in a slight pressure . His old pinkish beard seemed to have faded . But when he crossed the street he missed none of the mud . As we went steeply down toward Snake Hollow , the pavement stumbled and narrowed between maples shadowingthe bricks and porches protruding with children from small houses . Their wide clapboards were washed with crackling color . In the windows , tin cans sprouted geraniums . He stopped where the sidewalk ended . The road continuedover a stone bridge . No other house was quite so low in town . The water that morning sparkled and ran like clattering sunlight over deep pebbles . Along the weatherboards on one side trailed a smear of green slime . As I looked from the bridge a school of minnows darted from under it and , as they deployed in the shallows , suddenly shone , swimming upstream in silvery transparence . My heart beat with happiness , pressed on the parapet . The run had crumbled plaster from the old foundations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All walls leaned , but no two to the same level . Shinglesre missing , and the lichened roof sagged on its beams. c whole abode had a destitute air . Where windows were rokcn , the dark panes had been stuffed with sacking and dirty bits of quilt . I delayed by the running water . My grandfather called me . He waited on a flagstone lower than the mud . The door was half open . The hall gave an odor of povertyWickerthabitation . Strips of paper that had been gaudy Peeled from the wall . The stench was thick as the shadow On the stairs . " Justice , " he said abruptly , climbing , " is not an absolute . " The rail creaking under his weight , he climbed . " It 's acans . " He knocked with his cane on the first door abovelanding . " Virginia does n't know that , " he whispered.  |p120We  stood listening . I was careful to touch nothing . The door opened timidly and a girl 's head of about eleven peered out . Her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , almost a baby , confined in a grocer 's box of white pine . " Where 's your mamma ? " " She ai n't here , " said the girl . " Where is she ? " " She 's away . " The baby stood gurgling in his pine box . He was nakedbut for a single shirt . I hung behind my grandfather . Theboy 's head was downy with blond curls , his smile filthy . " But where is she ? " " She went away . " The girl showed her teeth like a rabbit . My grandfather stepped into the room . She was afraid . The baby boy 's eyes were dulled and brown . His skin was too dirty to know the color . " And you do n't know when she 'll be back ? " " ' Deed I do n't . She do n't never say . " A mattress tumbled in quilts was spread in one corner . There was no other furniture but store boxes , a chair with its back gone and a pot-bellied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tin can was cooking . I smiled at the little boy . His small grasp was sticky on my finger . He had been sucking something sugary , smearing red on his chin . " Then you ca n't tell me ? " " No , sir , " said the girl . My grandfather let her shut the door behind us . " That 's where Virginia 's wrong . " He hesitated above stairs . " She has all these notions about abstract justice . She thinks there ought not to be any poverty . And she 's going to tear this house down . " His cane dragged behind him as he clattered down the - steps . " I know Mrs. Boxwood is a scandal . But what are youp121going to do about it ? Only God Almighty could change her and if I 'd been Him I 'd never have let her be born . She 's damned because she 's destitute . ' Tai n't a thing you can do unless you leave her here and let her dope herself to death . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did she do ? In a day or two she did n't have a stick left . Sold it , with the children crying all over her , for the oblivion of laudanum . " We had come out into the sunny air and the sound of the water on stones . My grandfather walked around the decayed house . He tried a window , but the sash was nailed to the sill . " Come here ! This is the room where Charles Lee and I Ioratio Gates sat in conspiracy . Take a good look at it , as it will soon be demolished . They drank uproariously . " I peered after him through the dimming panes into a vacant room . I saw a fireplace under a low ceiling and walls stained by smoke . " They thought they were going to oust Washington and take over command in the Revolution . Lee was secondajor-General in the Continental forces , but he got so hot end disobedient at Trenton that Congress sent him down re to cool off . Gates was also a Major-General , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where they plotted . was the Cherry Lane tavern then . And your friend iss Virginia wants it torn down . " Mrs. Boxwood is to be put out . But Miss Virginia will ' went a park to the town . " He raised his cane in derision . ' his ! " Spring was bleak on that hillside . Scored with ridges of limestone , it lifted a few misshapen locusts , late to put out their leaves . On the lower ground some daffodils had withered on stalks in the abandoned grass . The sun was warm on my back . " What the town will do with it , I do n't know . " We satp122down on the stones . " But we 'll wait and see . We 'll wait until Mrs. Boxwood comes . Maybe she can tell us whether she can use a park . She 's got four children . And after all , dammit , it is a landmark . Lee was a great soldier of fortune , fought all over Europe , called on Frederick the Great at Potsdam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of Poland . Then he turned up out here at Leetown . A lot of good he 'd have seen in a public park . Marked off his house with chalk lines ! " Now Gates might have liked a park . He had some claim on Horatio Walpole . But ostensibly he was the son of a butler . And when he came to the wilderness , he taught his wife to drink port for company and to keep up the custom . They used to sit around out there after dinner . Mrs. Gates would let her head get heated . She had a tongue . One night , when the argument had been just a little hotter than usual , she asked Lee what was his opinion . Was n't she right ? Lee thought a minute . Then he picked up his hat , called to his dogs and sidled toward the door . Madam , you have asked me to state an opinion of your conduct . I will now do it . ' He opened the door and stood in it . My consideredopinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a tragedy and in public life a farce . Good-night , ma'am ! ' " A flock of pigeons circled the sky and swooping let slide a glitter of noon from their wings . I followed their luminousflight , half-listening to my grandfather 's discourse on an eighteenth-century squabble . Gates and Lee could not corrupt me . But I would resist his solicitations when he spoke of Mrs. Boxwood . I did not want to be sorry for her . She repelled me as much by her sordidness as by her moral degradation . She may not have threatened me , but my grandfather 's pity of her did . I was dismayed by her children , but the young have a small excess of emotion for others . They know that to survive they mustp123be hard . They will have their own sufferings , but when prompted by their elders will not respond . Had I come alone on Mrs. Boxwood and her children in their poverty , I might have been sorry for them . As it was , I meant to remain intact . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an Italian orderly and a housekeeper . Your eyes are better than mine . " But he had seen her first . Mrs. Boxwood stopped at the end of the sidewalk . She pressed down on the handle of her baby carriage and ran it on the rear wheels through the mud . She gazed on my grandfather with a gaunt and bewilderedcountenance when he approached her at the door . She thrust the strings of her streaked graying hair from her eyes when he talked to her , forlornly repeating , " Yes , sir , " to his words . Her wicker baby carriage held bundles . She wore a short buff jacket with leg-o ' - mutton sleeves and a bedraggled skirt from which braid was hanging . Feathers and ribbons in a fantastic and confused mass had been assembled on top of her head and were held there by a jet pin and a green veil stretched until it was torn . " Yes , sir . I reckon I can find another place . " Replying to my grandfather , she picked up her bundles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have shown a child . " Well , when you do , I want you to come to me and tell me what rent you 'll have to pay . " " Yes , sir . I will . " She sniffled . Her air was one of trust , not discouragement. " 1 ) o I owe you anything ? " " ' l'wo weeks . " My grandfather gave her a dollar bill . As we walked away , he said to me , " I know now what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to make Virginia pay her rent for a good twelvep124months . Dammit , if she wants to have these generous feelings , she 's got to pay for it . I 'm not going to let her off . As far as I am concerned , charity begins with Mrs. Boxwood and her four children . I do n't take much to organized kindness . "  |p125A  VACANT land beyond the railroad tracks had been seen by the speculators of the nineties as real estate . They had crossed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer soon brown , the lots were an empty waste . The whole tract had a blighted look , as though the soil had suffered and dried in its owners ' disappointment . It was known , though it had long been abandoned , as the Boom . Once or twice in a summer a circus would come and leave the bare marks of its one ring . Or a rare travelling show would play there under canvas . The carnival came in July . I went out at night , alone . Crossing the railroad tracks , I could see lights in motion of the Ferris wheel , shining clear against the immeasurable blue of the summer sky . The road was dusty . I paid my admission . The grass at the side of the ticket booth was trampled deep in dust . Inside , the night closed down . The sky was black above the carnival 's blaze . The merry-go-round pranced to a monotonous mechanical music ; barkers shouted , called , wheedled , moaned in hoarse and brazen confidence . The crowd moved with the slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a farmer 's boy stopped to gape at the turning Ferris wheel until his trousers tightened and stood above his shoetops . Girls from town strolled , their arms linked , with a swish of organdy . Their retorts were quick when boys they knew caught at them and they craned behind . They laughed among themselves . I was myself one of them and enlivened by their living . I had known most of these people all my life , I had seen many of them in the streets . In the din of the carnival they were not familiar . I could not move without be/ing impeded by them . They showed their skill at shooting-gallerieson fragile pipes and balls balancing on a squirt of water ; spent their dimes on fortune and squanderedtheir quarters on games of chance ; they separated and fought where two men had bloody mouths . They carried their children , after buying them salt-water taffy . The light on their faces was like a mask . They were not unknown , but there was an added pleasantness in recognizing them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were a necessity . But with none did I lose the sense of my own separateness . That was the pleasure of the crowd . To be a part of the mass and to remain more distinctly myself . Myself came at me , from as many as seven directions . I turned a corner and as many more mirrorings of myself moved at new angles . The light was dim and the reflections in the glasses not very clear . I had spent my first dime after coming in at the gates on an entrance to the Crystal Maze . I was lost . Wherever I went , I met only myself . It seemed to me strange that I should be alone among these wandering mirrors . I could hear some one , but could see no one but myself , turn as I would through the glass corridors . There was a trick to the maze , which somewhere I had heard , but at the moment I had forgotten it . I was not frightened , but I could not get out . I touched my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . It was Morton who came round one of the reflecting corners . " I was looking for you earlier , " I said . " How do you get out of this damn place ? " It was then that I remembered that simply taking every turn to the left would bring us back to the starting point . I grinned in the glass beside the door . It seemed good to be in the air again . A young countryman took off his coat , rolled up hisp127sleeves and spat beyond his hands before trying to send the hammer down that would ring the bell and win a cigar . We stopped before a tent where on a narrow outer platform the shoulders of Zobeida , the beautiful Oriental dancer , were held by her barker with huge apprehensive hands . He extolled her charms . She was wrapped in a big maroon cape . The man vaunted Zobeida 's dance which would take place immediately inside for all who would pay the small price of one dime . She smiled . The crowd groped closer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . I was taller than he . The barker cajoled us in a husky whisper . He was too tired to leer . Morton 's eyes followed the girl as she slipped under the flap , dropping her cape . I paid the admission for both . The air inside was dark and leaned with smoky faces . We sat forward on thin wooden benches . The dirt of the field was under our feet . The dancing began . A fat woman straddled a camp stool t one side of the stage , in an absent gaze , shaking a tam-.  --  urine . With a quick fist , she would knock the stretchedin , rap the wooden rim with a dead sound against her nee . Zobeida 's feet were bare and slow . She was seriousd remote . Her stare was for all and for none of us . It was obvious in the glare that her pink silk trousersre faded and used by the stage . Her lips were brightlyinted . But more than the grace of her body , though sheas slender and young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culminating motions , I found the  --  . k in her eyes troubling . For a moment they rested on , wide in their blue shadows of mascara , and in them afrank recognition of lust . It was for that she was there . She danced to be possessed by eyes . Only her name was needed to tell me that she was beauWu ! . It did not escape me that all this voluptuousness wasp128deliberate and at the same time that it could not have been shown , had it not once been real . I was enthralled . For the mystery of sex to the adolescent lies not so much in what is unknown as in what he knows only too well : its power is beyond the control of his will . Zobeida had made it into a dance . Her hands were pressed to the back of her head , which bound in sequins let fall loose veils of thin blue . Her feet were close together and still . The tambourine stopped . Her motions were tortuous and extreme . The dance had been brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two negro youths complained they had not felt their money 's worth . " Dog gone ! " said Morton . " I 've got to go somewhere and ride something . " He bought four tickets at the Ferris wheel . We swung in space , seat rocking , above the mass moving in the dust among luminous small booths , swung slowly down to the level of faces and again rose . We were suspended , side by side , when the wheel stopped to let off and take on passengers . I leaned over the seat 's bar . Then Charlie and Ardista rode behind us and as we came down their seat went to the wheel 's height . Through a half turn I saw their backs . As we came down , I turned , and in the flare saw Charlie 's face rising . He seemed amused . I waited for them beside the ticket stand . Morton wanted to go on . I remembered what Ardista had said to me at Ruddimont more than a year before . I would speak to her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attendant held the seat while Ardista stepped from it to the platform . Morton was impatient . I let him go . Then they came down the steps . Charlie when I called answered a surly " Hello there ! "  |p129Ardista  did not look at me at all . But I knew she was aware of my being there , her avoidance of me was so shamefaced . She was powdered and her cheeks had a purplish tinge in that artificial glare . Her dress was a ruffled white organdy , and her hat wide and flowered with poppies and wheat . There was another change , but they were gone so soon into the crowd that I was only aware of it , without being able at once to say what it was . I stood under an iron pillar supporting the roof of the merry-go-round . The painted cavalcade swept past me , swinging to the mechanical tune of a piano that turned in the centre at a slower pace . Come over here , come over here ! Again and again with arched necks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then a slot clicked , there was only a sound in the piano of slidings . Then , eyes wide and tails alert , the wooden steeds proceeded after silence to another mechanical music . I waited in the dust , I wanted to see Charlie and Ardista once more , but not enough to follow them . I did not want to be rebuffed again . It was her gait that had changed.  |p130VIRGINIA  opened the shutters so that I could admire her father 's portrait . I felt a chill draft from the empty chimney ; the mantelpiece projected a shelf of pure white marble . Aloof above it was a young man , his neck straining out of a black frockcoat , while a large forelock tumbled over a face transparently pale and consciously sad . It was at once sensitive and respectable . His eyes were gray and fervidly romantic . " And they never changed , " said Virginia . " He aged , of course , but his eyes were the same till he died . " I followed them and discovered they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't mind , " she said . " I must get back to Caroline . She ought n't to be left alone . And I know you can entertain yourself here . " Virginia 's consideration for Caroline was not merely social ; since they had become so intimate , her attitude was one of passionate protection . They had always , I suppose , known each other , but it was only since Caroline had sufferedthe intensely disappointing loss of her baby that their attachment had become so conspicuous . I could not pretend to understand it , I saw very little that they had in common , though Caroline 's temper , naturally so placid , was now uncertainand Virginia 's , when they were together , almost calm . And together they were as often as possible ; Virginiawas constantly at Ruddimont , whenever Charlie was away , spending the night . Caroline much less often came for the afternoon to Guyon Hall . I did not know whether Virginia had closed the door to get rid of me , or because she vainly thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depress/ing ; the walls were darkened with leather bindings . On a chance I took down the Crannock works in two volumes . The Dramas were Southern in inspiration and Shakesperean in intent . I read one or two of the tirades extolling the virtues of the Confederacy ; there was no subject that bored me more completely . Nor did the comic scenes of slaves afford much relief . I tried the lyrics ; they were a little better . Occasionally a line reminded me of Poe . But I could not make much of them . They were at once too highflown in their fine sentiments and too matter-of-fact . I came back to those eyes of the poet , which were so wistful and at last seemed to rest on the gas jet and the solid leather armchair beneath it . I thrust the books back into their places on the shelves . The room was chilly with the past . It had been too long closed and unchanged ; the few ashes on the hearth did not account for the exhausted smell . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you can stand until you have to . " I shut the door on the books and came out into the hall , which was wide and at the far end opened on the Septembersun in the garden . The wallpaper was monstrous with salmon roses . " But Virginia , after all , I 'm married to Charlie . " " He 's very attractive . " " Is he ? I do n't know . It 's so long since I have really looked at any other man . " Virginia said something I could not hear . Then her voice rose : " But just why should that make such a dif-ference ? " " But it does , honey . Men are all like that . " " Why should they be ? What right have they ? " " I do n't know anything about rights , honey , but I have found out that what I used to think were Charlie 's greatest faults are really what 's best about him . " " You are more generous than I should be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to him . And I never did mind Charlie 's being a man . " I had no compunctions about listening to them , and if I did n't it was because I could not conceive that anything Carolineand Virginia would say to each other would have more than slight interest for me . I had already acquired a habit , when actually in the presence of older people , of appearing attentive and not hearing a word they said . I could sit for hours content with my own existence . I was conscious of Virginia and Caroline only that they were discussing Charlie . It may be that their voices sank , or that I became too abstracted to hear them , but I remember only when Caroline 's became nervously shrill . " But what I could n't stand  --  No , I 'll tell you . It was when he talked in bed , he used to sit upright . He talked so excitedly I could n't sleep . That 's why I made him take another bed . So I could sleep alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruder family portraits , witless-faced likenesses in immeasurably tiny bodices and incredibly high rolled collars . There were sofas , carved and scrolled , seats slippery in haircloth , black and shining . Over one of these , against the salmon confusionof roses , were old-fashioned muskets and suspended from a dusty tasselled cord an instrument that looked rather like a halberd . Caroline was crying . But I was startled not so much by her tears as by her pounding on the table . " I 'm going to have a reception . I do n't care what anybody says . I 'm going to have a reception at Ruddimont and have everybody I know and I want you to pour the coffee . I want them to see me . " The pounding on the table was loud , uncontrolled , almost mad . Virginia surprised me kneeling on the sofa . I was inspectingthe halberd . She sent me upstairs for ammonia . When I came down again , Caroline had done crying . Shep133dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief . I did not pass the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Virginia came out to me . " One of these pieces is quite interesting . I saw you looking at it . " She detached the halberd from the paper roses . " It was given to one of my father 's slaves by John Brown . " " Was it really ? " I rubbed my hand along to pole and tried the now dulled edge of the axe-like blade . " Would you like to know about it ? " Virginia was composed . " Go out and ask old Silas . He 'll tell you all about it . He 's there now in the garden . " She stood in the door . " Caroline wo n't be ready to go for quite a while yet . She 's been a little upset . " I found Silas . He was planting box . " Do you know what this is , Silas ? " He looked up at me , and said , " Whar ' d dat come from ?

" The sun was shining but he glanced disconsolately at the sky . Then he took up one of the plants and dismembered it , shaking his head .

BOOK IIp139THE parsonage was next the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , open windows were profound with shade . The gate was unlatched . Charlie went by , leaning forward from the hips and slouched a little in his stride , until he came to the corner . Ile turned down as though he were hurrying to the station . Only once did he glance to the side . One window on the lower floor swung its green shutters into a depth of althea bushes . He passed in his loose-bodied stride . The iron fence of the lawn of the parsonage was followed by the  --  Hinted palings of the garden . At the end of the lot wasastable ; he stopped under the whitewashed boards ; wallshave back a glare . The darkness burned on his closed eyes. could not shut his eyelids to the light . His hands wentto his pockets and he started rolling a cigarette . The airas breathless .

Spillingtabacco into his hand , he began again , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long habit , lickedlast the cigarette into shape . Charlie walked behind the negro 's back . The street drowsed . Clouds were rising incolorless sky . Suddenly he stopped , made an abrupt gesture as though re was something he had forgotten , and started backand the corner . He quickened his pace until he wasin the gate and on the brick walk leading up to thesquare porch . Mounting the steps he gave a tug to theHis hand stayed on the brass knob . Within walls it rwanged.  |p140Waiting  it seemed to him a long time , he tossed his cigarette into the grass . His hat was pulled down over his eyes . It was Doctor Pasmore himself who opened the door and stood there crumpled in linen . Charlie still felt about him the afternoon . From the shadow within the doorway , the old man looked up at him in sharpened surprise . " Why it 's Charlie ! " There was a moment before he could say , " Come in ! " He had made his voice cordial . He was a small man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The steel eyes that peered up at Charlie through the frames of glasses were disconcerted . The corridor was shadowy with cool floors . The door at the far end had been left open on the green drenched sunlightof June . " Come into my study ! " Doctor Pasmore led the way carefully limping . Here , too , the shutters were closed against the sun , save where on the side , beyond the chimney , one window let the althea bushes come close to the sill . There the air moved . " Sit down ! " Charlie heard and found himself sunk into the rounded depth of a leather armchair . " I thought I 'd come . " Doctor Pasmore stood over him , the chair was so low . " I 'm very glad to see you . You know , Charlie , the more I look at you these days the more I am reminded of some one I used to know . A friend , yes , some one I knew . " " I probably look more like the devil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't think what it is . Not the features , of course , but something in the face , the expression , it must be there if I can see it . Of some one I used to know , yes , when I was young . But I ca n't remember of whom . " " You know why I 've come ? " Charlie asked pI41The minister moved over to that long table he used as a desk and sat down there in a wicker chair , propping his poor leg before him . Wilted in his linen suit , his black tie was crossed on a glazed shirt front . " I know it 's been a long time . " " Not since the funeral . " Then Charlie hastily added , " My brother-in-law 's . I came once to see you about that . " " That 's right . I knew it had been a long time . " His chair was higher than Charlie 's . He still looked down on m . " It 's been kind of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rumpled handkerchief and wiped his eating hands . " Good corn-growing weather , I suppose . " " Could be worse . But dry . " On the table before the minister were Bible and Condanceand smaller volumes . His hands strayed among scattered sheets of the sermon . " I guess I 'd better be going , " said Charlie , and leaned ward for his hat which had fallen on the floor . " I don'tm to have come at a very good time for you . I forgot ut it 's being Thursday . " No , no , it is n't that . I do n't want you to go . The ser-n can wait . And it wo n't make a great deal of difference it is never written . No , it 's not that . It 's  --  would n't you to smoke ? I 'm sorry I have nothing to offer you . " He brought his game leg down from the little stool on ch he had propped it . He stood before Charlie as gh to prevent him from rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I 've got to do . Then I can talk to . But you must stay . " And he went limping out the door at the back of thePre-Raphaelite angels turned their dark grave eyes from ml the bookcases , their folded wings displayed onp142either side the door through which the old man had slipped for coffee . The woodwork was white , the walls covered with a brown cartridge paper . Charlie started up . A brass hod beside the hearth , for all that it was summer , brimmed with coals . He could go now . Above the mantel , General Lee , on a white horse , swept his plumed hat under a heaven of stormy clouds . He stopped to look at the first sheet of the sermon . He might have been alone in the house . In the green shuttered windows were slats of light . That morning in the hardware store , leaning for some time on the glass case , Charlie had at last asked if he might look at one of the revolvers . The clerk allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent . " I 'd like to see how you load it . " The clerk filled two chambers . Charlie pressed the barrel to his temple . " Hey ! If that 's what you want it for , you pay me first ! " Charlie grinned . " I 'll take it . It feels all right . " He laid the money on the counter . " What would you have done if I had ? What would you do if somebody came in and killed himself with a revolver he had n't paid for ? What would you do ? " The clerk did not think it was much of a joke . " I think it 's blowing for rain . " Doctor Pasmore had come back into the room , not through the door by which he had left it , but by way of the hall . " Yes , we 'll get rain . " He showed a perturbed face . Charlie said to him , " You know why I 've come . " " Yes , " said Doctor Pasmore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to talk to you . I want to tell you you were mighty kind . " " 0 , not at all . I buried her . " He clambered again to his high wicker chair . " That 's hardly a kindness . There are dead and dead , but we bury them all . The earth isp143charitable and takes them all . We ca n't do less . But it 's hardly a kindness . " " You know what I mean , " said Charlie . " You went out there . " " 0 , yes , I went out to her father 's farm . Yes , yes , I did do that . Her brother , I think it was her brother , there 's a raft of children , the youngest boy , at any rate a boy about fourteen came for me . A great shock of hair . Yes , about nightfall . He came for me and I drove out with him in their buggy . But why do n't you sit down ? " " What I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 , yes , dead , yes . When I got there it was after dark . You know the house . The family were all in the kitchen around an oil lamp . Yes , they wanted me to go upstairs . I thought then it was because she was dying . I could n't get much out of the boy . And then Mrs. Burnham took the lamp and went ahead of me . I saw the glint of the eyes of the others , Ardista 's brothers . But the woman had gone into the passageway . The stairs were between two walls , 3 had to turn , and I saw them looking at me out of the dark . There was only that one lamp , or maybe there was no more oil . I do n't know . At any rate , I knew they were poor . And when I had followed her mother to the door , the steps were steep , and my breath is bad , she held the lamp for me . There as one more step just as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know even then why I had come . " " I do n't see why , " Charlie said angrily . " What did you say ? The girl was alone on the bed . They had put a pallet for another of the children on the floor.Something made up out of old quilts . But I did n't know even then she was dead . " " You knew I was the one got her into trouble ? " " Yes , I suppose I did . I knew then . " " Did he tell you ? " The minister did not at once answer . He put his handsp144together by the tips . " I do n't remember any one 's telling me . " " Her father ? But you knew ? " " Yes , I knew . " " Old Burnham is just about the oneriest rascal that calls himself a farmer in three counties . He 's no good . And what 's more , he 's a scoundrelly liar . " " He did n't condemn you , " said Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie . " I gave him money to keep his mouth shut . And not to make trouble . And what 's he done with it ? " He put his hands over his face . " They might at least have left a lamp there with her . " " He seemed to me much too beaten to find fault with anybody . He took the calamity as something that had to come to him , and having come , belonged to him , as much as his weathered skin . " " He 's a dried-up old brute , " said Charlie . " As I was saying , I went up to the bedroom . I did n't know until then . Her hands were outside on the coverlet . I could see then why she died . " " He 'd just as soon have all his grandchildren bastards , " said Charlie , " if he could get out of ' em what he got out o ' me . When he made trouble , it was n't on Ardista 's account . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " said Charlie , " I ca n't . I just ca n't sit still . " " It was her fingers , " said Doctor Pasmore . " They were flattened . As though they had been struck with hammers . I have seen that before . So I knew why she died . " " That was n't my fault . And you know it . " Charlie leaned against the mantel , his serge coat dark , collar and tie askew on an old faded blue shirt . Leaning he was alert and his thighs were long in sallow breeches . He wore puttees , stained with the sweat of much riding . " Ardista had consumption . That 's not my fault . I was n't the one sent her to die . "  | " No , " said Doctor Pasmore . " I do n't think you did . God appoints our time . For each of us . It was God who determined that Ardista should die . Perhaps  --  " " Do you believe in God ? " His dusky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Doctor Pasmore . " And in His wisdom . " " I mean , " said Charlie , " what I 'd like to know is , here , I mean here alone , do you still believe ? I know how it is . Naturally , when you are standing in the pulpit before all the congregation , you 've got to believe what you say . I can do that . Always I can believe what I say as long as I 'm sayingit. " " 0 , no , " said Doctor Pasmore . " It 's not there . I have always found it difficult in the pulpit . Perhaps because I am a timid man . So I preach Saint Paul , for that is what they expect . I have to say to myself , it ca n't do them any harm . As my old father used to put it , Going to church may not do people any good , but at least they are in the way of good . No . I sometimes find it difficult to believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here it is different . Here I am alone . There is nobody in the house but the colored cook . I only let her in here once a week to clean . Here I know God . Do you remember what Plotinus says of the soul ? He calls it a flight of the alone to the Alone . " " Are you a Presbyterian ? " " Why not ? " asked Doctor Pasmore . " As a Presbyterian , do you think some men are predestinedto be damned ? " " Not only as a Presbyterian , " said Doctor Pasmore . " Whatever they do ? " " It 's what they do that 's damnable , " said the old man , watery pale behind his glasses . " I think you only have to look into the street on a sunny day to see that there are men that are irrevocably in hell . They do n't wait for the hereafter . " He took off his spectacles and wiped them slowly.  | " There is nothing Yonder that is not also Here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard when preach-ing . " " You are a good man , " said Charlie . " I am a religious man , " said Doctor Pasmore . " Which is a very different thing . You know there are days when I go to bed at night and I 'm tired . And when I sit by the bed , taking my shoes off , I try to think what I have been doing all day . And I ca n't for the life of me remember . Then , after I 'm in bed , and lying looking at the night , it comes to me that I have been writing a sermon . " A rustle of wind ran over the table . He put out his hand to stay the scattered papers . " Yes , I believe . " " Why ? " The study was a brown twilight on which wide-eyed Pre-Raphaelite angels let fall their wings and Confederate generals rode on horseback toward unknown and disastrousbattles . He sat back in his wicker perch . " Because , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? " " I know what you are trying to say . I am sixty-three . I have seen as much as you have . More . I have seen some things you have not . Remember , I saw her . I saw her after she 'd died . But let me tell you this , young man , it may be hard to believe in the goodness of God . There are times  --  But it is impossible to believe in the goodness of men . " " You know I 'm beginning to like you , " said Charlie . " There was something else you were going to ask me . " " No , " said Charlie , " I was just fixing to go . " His hand brought tobacco and cigarette papers from the sagging pocket of his coat . " Then there 's one thing I would like to ask you before you go . Will you answer me ? "  | " Maybe . " Sprinkling tobacco , he turned the paper on his finger . " What were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to the hardware store . " " But there was something before that . Tell me all day . " " Well , " said Charlie , " I got up . No , that ai n't quite true . I lay awake a long time and at last I saw I was n't going back to sleep , so I routed myself out of bed and dressed and went down to the barn and pitched hay for the horses . Then I sort of went around . It was early . They were still milking the cows . " He stopped to light his cigarette . " I wish you 'd sit down , " said Doctor Pasmore . " Then I went back to the house and into the kitchen and got some breakfast . I was n't hungry , but I had a cup of coffee . It was still a little early and they were just baking biscuits . And Rush was there . He cut the ham . Yes , I saw him cut the ham . I can see it rolling on the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he put it in the frying pan and turned it with a fork and it started to sizzle . While his back was turned , I gave him a rake across the calf with my rowel spur . I do n't know why . I put ' em cn when I got up . I guess it must have been that . " " Who 's Rush ? " " He 's a colored boy . He 's kind of queer . He turned round . And his face was screwed up with pain and called out Wow ! ' He hopped on one foot . And kept calling , ' Aw , Mister Charlie , you ought n't to done that ! ' And then he saw the ham was sizzling and hot . And he looked like an imp , hopping on one foot and the long meat fork in one hand , hopping all around the kitchen and his face screwed up , holding his foot with the other hand . I like to burst out laughing . It made me laugh , I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode round the place . I saw the fence was brokenp148down in the pasture and the colts would get through . So I rode over to the tenant 's house and found Toplady and told him he 'd have to fix it . Then I came to town . I do n't quite know what there was ; anyhow I thought of some things I had to get . I was in Barr 's hardware store . I talked first to one of the clerks and then to Jim Barr there . They 'll tell you . " " What I want to know is why you came here . " " I wanted to talk to somebody . I did n't know whether you 'd listen . " " I guess you 'd never had much trouble getting some people to listen . " " Well , it was n't talking with Ardista did it . I do n't believeshe ever heard a word I said . I could tell you just how it happened if you want to know . " Charlie leaned forward as though he intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not rise . His long hands were spread . " This is a small town , Charlie , and even I hear a good deal . " The air had darkened . In the duskiness of his face , Charlie 's eyes shone , his spittle-whitened teeth . Doctor Pasmorelooked away . The curtain was blowing from the window . " I did n't do anything she did n't want me to . Not even when she asked me to close my eyes . " The space between the long driven branches of maples was filled with indigo sky . The infinitely torn leaves of maples were driven by the wind , tossed and pale . The rain was there as yet only as a terror . " She was a good girl . " Charlie crouched forward . " She was the best I ever had . It was good for a while and then it was n't any good . " Doctor Pasmore turned back to him . " Why do n't you use your rowel spurs on me , Charlie ?

" " It 's not my fault they were poor . " " No more than it is mine . " " You want to know why I came here ? It was to tell you I 'm not sorry . " The storm against the window broke in blackened rain , spattering big drops on the sill . " That 's not so ! " Doctor Pasmore hopped from his-wicker perch . " That 's not why you came .

" My leg , " he said , " always hurts me more when it rains . " The two men met . " I 'm sorry she died . " Charlie wiped his hands on his breeches . " But that 's all . That 's all I 'm sorry for . " " That was n't what you came here for . I know you better now . You think you can assuage your own suffering by inflicting suffering on others . I know now .

He stood there with failing hands , in his wilted linen suit , unable to move , and through the glasses his gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seeing across a great distance of years.  | " She 's dead , " said Charlie . " Yes , she 's dead , " Doctor Pasmore responded timidly . Then startled at a clap of thunder he grimaced painfully . " She 's dead . But after all , immortality is only a logical necessity . The real desire is to be a god . And it was the Greeks with their beautifully logical minds who perceived that it was only after death that man could be made one with the divine . " There was a lull in the storm , in which was heard only the violence of the rain . " Do you know the verses of Dante ? " Charlie waited , grinning . " I can only translate them roughly , " said Doctor Pasmore . " The born with us and never dying longing for the divine dominions . What was that ? " A terrific sound of thunder smote the air . " I think you can understand that , " said Doctor Pasmore timidly . " She 's dead , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead as a dog is dead . Dead as " " Yes , perfectly , " said the minister .

" " I 've told you , " Charlie smiled . " You have been unkind , " he said . And then , " It 's rainingin my bedroom . I left the windows open . " " You want me to close them ? " Charlie had already stridden to the door , when he whispered , " Yes . It 's the room on the other side . To the left on the landing . " He thought above the rain he heard Charlie shouting . But he could not be sure . He had picked up the sheets ofthe sermon , and crumpled them . Charlie came down again . " I could tell you something . " Age was in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead high and smooth . " I suppose you had to ruin this girl . You only find yourself alive when you can feel your power on others , to corrupt them or to make them suffer your pain . Without their suffering you do n't exist . " Charlie smiled . " No . It just happened . " " I do n't doubt that . " He stood above the minister . " Go on ! " But Doctor Pasmore had nothing more to say than , " If you believed in God , you would also believe in yourself . " Charlie wiped the sweat off his forehead and crumpling the handkerchief into a wad showed it to Doctor Pasmore . " That is God ! " " Of course . " He blinked at him . " Do you remember the story of Europa and the Bull ? He , too , was a god . I have sometimes wondered at the agony of a god just before assuming bestial shape . " " I did n't come here to hurt you . But you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing you did was of any use . " " But there you 're wrong . There was a great deal to do . As I tell you , I got there after nightfall . " His voice , it seemed , was lost in the rush and sibilant thrust of rain . " When she was dying they sent her from Baltimore . They did n't want her . They put her on the train . I can see her if you ca n't , as she walked through the aisles of the cars , tarrying nothing but that ticket . They sent her back with her seat paid for . A dusty seat in the day coach . That was all . And that was all when I climbed those stairs between the walls , the woman in front of me and both of us in the narrownessclimbing and the oil lamp held before her as though by another hand . A bony hand that had nothing to do with her body , gaunt as it was in that old wrapper that faded even more in the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know then what Ip152climbed for , whether there was life or death at the top of the stairs . There was the door and the one step , where the woman warned me I should n't fall . It was hard to say if I groped more in the darkness or was carried up by the one tilted oil lamp . You did n't see her then , did you ? No . It 's rather a pity . There are some things that need to be seen . The spool bed and the dirty quilts , I rather think you should have seen that . And her hands were on the counterpane . You say there was nothing we could do then . And of course , you are right . But there was one thing still to be done . They had sent the poor child home to die . She was there . I could see as well as you when the woman held the lamp , there was only one thing that could still be done . I could pray . The woman listened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer , how much they listen . But even then there was somethingstill to do . I could still be of use . " There was nothing in the house . You say you gave Burnham money . Yes , I 've heard that too . But it was gone . Maybe it was spent . Maybe he had hidden it away . They had no idea what they were going to do , if they were going to the county , what . Or if they had , I could n't get it . For you see , that was still to do . I could be of use there . I mean to bury her . So naturally I turned to Virginia Crannock . " The room darkened by the rain he could still see Charlie 's face . He saw in it the dusky change . " I went to her . She and I together , we bought a very pretty white dress . I could n't see why not . So she bought white . " He stopped , aware of the sudden rage in Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She paid for it ? " " And the funeral as well . You see , she is a woman singularlyabove prejudices . I 've gone to her before in such cases . " " Damn her ! " He snatched up his hat . " I 'll get her forp153this . You see if I do n't ! " And he was gone from the room . Doctor Pasmore limped after him . The door had been left open . The rain had not cooled him . Dripping , he shouted from the gate , " And do n't forget , you do n't know why I came . "  |p154AT  breakfast Charlie leaned over toward me . " Do you want to go over to Maryland ? " " But must you ? " Caroline objected . " It 's so hot . " " I did n't say anything about your going , " he said . " I asked John . Do you want to go ? " I said I did . " All right , " he said . " Come upstairs with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs and past the landing , he turned and clattered down again . I had mounted only three steps . The banisters were white on the stair , at the bottom the rail , dark and polished , coiled on itself like a shell . I do not think he knew that he brushed against me as he went by . I followed him into the wide drawing room , where Rush closed the windows against the day ; they had been left open at night to catch whatever coolness there was . And the room in its faded yellow brocades and reflecting mirrors held from the early morning an odor of fields and drying hay . Caroline came to the door . " When 'll you be back ? " " Do n't know , " Charlie shouted . " All I know is I 'm going . Do n't look like that . You 'll be in a damn sight bettercompany when I am not here . " And from the next room he called , " Come on , John ! " I heard Caroline : " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ? " " If you 're not coming back , I 'll get Virginia  --  " " Get who you please . " " Charlie , I ca n't stand being alone . "  | " Neither can I , " said Charlie . We went through the gallery at the east of the house , half underground ; three arches were open to the air . Charlie unlocked the office and we went in . This had been the old Justice 's library , Caroline 's greatgrandfather , who had built not the first house with its strong bare wall of stone , but on it imposed a proud front and , adding wings , faced the lawn with four porches , arched galleries and pavilions . After his appointment to the Supreme Court he was always building . Pronouncing on law in Washington must have paid more than it did in Mordington . Nowhere else in the county was there a dwelling so commodious as he made Ruddimont , none which conserved so precise a symmetry . The office was not much used . Charlie kept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more than twice a year . The shutters closed on a dead air , the shelves were for the most part lined with decrepit law books mouldering in calfskin . One held deserted poets . I found Seneca , four small volumes in a vellum stained by damp or it may have been only time , which opened on the small print of Elzivir . " Put that book down , " said Charlie . " ' Tai n't the day for reading . " In his hands was a revolver ; I had not noticed where it came from . The holster lay on the table . " Open that shutter , " he said to me . " I want to see what I am doing . " The cartridges were in a box in the table 's half-opened drawer . He loaded . " I 'll get that bitch yet . I always said I 'd drive her off this place . The next time she comes here A bundle of letters scattered the cold fireplace , in ashes , torn and half burnt . Above it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting front claws and displaying a ragingsmile of many rows of teeth . I snuffed a musty air . Charlie leaned on the window sill and took aim and fired.  |p156His  shot was stopped by an oak some twenty-five yards away . " It works , " he said . " I just wanted to see . " He replaced the shell . " Come on . " We did not go back through the house . I waited for him by the summer kitchen , while he went to get the car . Rush saw me standing there alone and came out . He wore his blue apron with the bib tying over the shoulders . " Mr. Charlie sure is on a rampage dis mornin ' . He come into my room and rooted me out of my bed ' fore ever I was awake and made me come down and git his breakfas ' for 'm . " He wiped his long moist fingers on the skirt of the blue apron . " What for you goin ' wid him ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He been drinkin ' . You don ' know dat , do you ? Well , he have . You stay here . " I shifted , uncomfortable in his eyes . " Better n't you ? I got some vinegar to rack off an ' you kin help me mos ' likely . Then , " he said slyly , " you an ' me can slip off and go down to de run . It 's goin ' be awful hot . It 'll be good down ' ere swimmin ' . " All the time his eyes had a black sly glitter . I said nothing and Rush lolled his tongue slowly over his lip . And all the while he looked at me . I kicked a stone out of the roadway . " You don ' want to come ? " " Go to hell , " I said . For I had heard Charlie 's car . In the warm summer air , not in the dark , there was still fear . Repentance from fright , but fright first from a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was afraid because of what I had done . Not in a dream . In the days of my innocence I had sinned ; now I longed , but could only remember I was not innocent . Nights when I woke in sweat and sustained the torment of my age , twisting sheets until my nails were in my hands and tossing I crushed the pillow on my sighs.  |p157Charlie  drove up , stopped and swung out . " Rush , go up and bring me down that old brown suitcase . I 'll give her a little water before we start off . " He unscrewedthe radiator cap . " She 'll be here when I get back . You 'll see . Here , you go get me a bucket of water from the kitchen . I ca n't come home now but I find her here . " I poured the water carefully and Rush flung the old batteredsuitcase on the back seat ; Charlie cranked . We moved off . I leaned out and waved . Rush grinned , standing on the doorstep , straining a steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you down , " said Charlie . He braked the car with the engine ; we dropped , wound through the woods . " They all try to get you down . And if you put two women together they 're both at it . They 'll try to twist you . They talk all the time just like it was n't anything they were doing , but give ' em a chance and they 'll take you every time and twist . The two of them . " A chewink called from an underground of dead leaves . " Every time . A woman forgives her son for being a man . I ; ttt no other man will she ever forgive . They 'll never forgiveyou that you are strong where they are weak . " He jammed into third . We came out on the level drive ; the poplars were dusty , the sky a heat of blue , in the fields the ledges of limestone glittered white . We made our own wind . " I 'll be damned before they 'll take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay wagon , its summer load sheared by rails . On the instant he swerved . The dust shrieked behind us . The farmer called . " I 'll be damned ! " Damned , I thought . I had waked from a dream . Then in the sun , in the haymow . Slanting the dust shone , pollen of gold . Once it had been simple as lying in the sun . That was the summer the Maryland yellowthroat winkedp158at me through his black mask . I bathed alone in the river . And I saw in his mask he had included two miniature black suns . In innocence I had been strong . Now I sat by Charlie and sensed that he was still sound . I relaxed in the seat . I should have liked to touch his coat sleeve . Mordington is seen from the pike not as a town but a forest in which there are spires . The Episcopalian steeple had dissolved its slate in morning light . We approached willows , but first a whitewashed cabin and a paled yard and an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping close to Charlie . He was sound . We rumbled over the boards of the bridge and a dappled willow shade . Charlie said : " There 's only one thing you can do to a woman ; if you do that , everything else is all right . " We ran into town . " You 've got to strip her and take her . It 's the only relation they understand . If you do it right , then they 'll stay quiet and let you alone until the next time .. She thinks she only wants to talk about me , she thinks she only wants me prowling around , she thinks she only wants to laugh at the way I come into the house . The two of them . She thinks a hell of a lot ! She 's not so tight there as she thinks . I 've had ' em a damn sight worse-look-. ing than she is . But that 'd be just where the trouble 'd begin . Virginia 'd begin-falling in love with you . " Fill up , Spink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the curb in front of what had been the Dangerfield house . I remembered a fanlight and the soft brick walls . Now there was plate glass and Spinkle 's Garage . We went out of town so as to gain the Middletown pike . Charlie went over the railroad crossing without looking . There were things I should have liked to ask him . Why , I pondered why ? If he did that to her , why should she love him ? And why did n't he want to be loved ? I sat wellp159back in the seat , my hand laid on the car door gathered dust . I had been a fool . I had walked up the railroad track . March was still bare . I had imagined a girl who would come striding the cross-ties the other way , in a blue country dress and sturdy cotton stockings . She would stop and it would be just as simple . At the side there were thickets of dead leaves and then a marsh of brown cattails . And there was a spring house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done there on Sundays . By other boys . 0 , the green and gold of the wild marsh marigolds ! That had been March . And they were other boys . When you are damned you must ride as I did , your arm gathering dust and unthinking . We crossed the river at Shepperdstown and went past the Antietam battlefield . And the high uncolored blue heaven was cloudless . By Sharpsburg I was aware of Maryland . The roofs flattened , the small brick houses came close to the road . When the doors opened it was on low stoops set into the pavements . The pillars were square and white . We ran through the one long street . From the countrysidetoo I knew that we had crossed into the Cumberland Valley . July was dry and unkempt , but the fences were clean of weeds , behind the burnt roll of fields loomed the big barns of Maryland . As we drove through the dust I saw on the mail-boxes the same names that lived on my grandfather 's map of the battle of Antietam : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shorn wheat fields consumed stubble in morning light and ranked corn rolled up to the ugly monuments in growing masses of another summer . Hagerstown came into sight with smoke and factory chimneys . Charlie ran the car into one of the side streets off thep160Square . We walked across the cobbled pavement where a trolleyman was swinging round the pole of his car . The sun was dripping from Charlie 's face . " We 'll have a drink . Where do you want to drink ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " I 've never been here before . " i " Never been here before ! Where do you boys go whenyou start on a rampage ? " I was thirsty and I was hoping he would stop in the drug store beyond us and buy me a lemonade . I had no money . But he swung past and under an awning and through a door into the lobby of the Bolton House . Armchairs were tilted before the window , the old man nearest had fallen asleep under his panama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . One fed on the wart by his chin . I saw it in passing . The place was strange . " You 're twenty-one , see ! " I tried to look it as Charlie led me through the swinging doors . I had not known that a barroom would be like this . I tried to do as Charlie did , but it was hard when I saw my own face reflected from the mirror . The bartender swabbed the bar ; his morose pink face had whitish circles around the eyes . He had the drooping countenance of an old hound . " What 'll it be ? He swabbed more and more slowly . " Two martinis . " " I 'm sorry , " said the melancholy mustaches , " but I ca n't serve the young man here . " Charlie affected surprise . " No ? I 'm his brother . " " I ca n't help it . He 's not twenty-one . " " Sure he 's twenty-one , " said Charlie . " He do n't look it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ask his mother ? Come on , we 'll call her up . Where 's the telephone ? " I felt myself flushing.  | " I ca n't do it , mister . " " Well , " said Charlie , " give me something to wet my whistle so I can go on with the argument . We both come from a dry state . Make me up that martini . What you want , Johnny ? Ginger ale ? Give him a ginger ale . " The drink was mixed , lemon peel pinched over the stemmed glass . Charlie gulped it . " Have one with me , bartender . " He shoved back the glass . " I never drink , " said pink drooping face . " Then make it two for me , " said Charlie . The bartender poured them before him , watching with his sad circled eyes . " Doubles or quits  --  " Charlie let a silver dollar fall rattlingon the bar . " I never gamble . " " You do n't seem to like me much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , " said the morose pink man . " Well , that makes it fine and democratic , " said Charlie . " I guess you do n't mind if I give the boy here my olives . He 's trying to acquire a taste for ' em . He 's eaten three so far . I Jere , Johnny ! " He tumbled the small green soaked fruit into my hand , from the emptied glass . I ate it from the seed . " You would n't like ' em either if you stayed in this place the way I do . " The bartender with his rag again swabbed the counter round and round . " All the men I see live between just two things . They come in here and lap up a drink and then they go in the lavatory next door and sometimesthey leak , sometimes they lose it . That 's all I ever sec . You ought n't to try to start that kid . It 's a waste of time . " " But if you like the kick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the bartender.  |p162Charlie  turned to me a full cocktail and while the bartenderstared I drained it sputtering . It made my face feel as though I had brushed straight into a cobweb . " What 're you trying to do ? Get me into trouble ? Do n't you know there 's a law against that ? " " You 're too big a crab to get into trouble , even with the law . " Charlie flung his silver dollar on the bar . He took me through the swinging doors . " How 'd you like it ? " " Fine , " I said . My face still tingled as though it were covered by a spider 's mist . We came out under the burning awning . " There 's one thing to remember , " he said . " Getting drunk is fine . It 's one way of finding out who you are . But do n't forget it 's an illusion like any other . " He took me in his long stride . " We 'll eat . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what I saw was a big girl whose eyes were wadded in powdered flesh . She squinted . Her nose held only her nostrils . She moved in white bulk to put down our glasses . I drank in a noise of plates and cutlery . " Where 's Irma ? " Charlie asked . The girl tumbled knives and forks from a rolled napkin . I wondered if I was drunk and painstakingly spelled the gilt letters , dull and reversed on the front window . " She do n't work here no more . She 's on her vacation . " MOOR HCNUL NAIHTNIROCI decided I was n't . I was only thirsty . " What 'll it be ? " Charlie ordered soft-shell crabs . " You want some ? They 're good here . Two ! " The girl at the back of the room called our order.  | " Are you pure ? " Charlie suddenly asked . I pretended not to know what he meant . " I mean are you still a virgin ? " I shook my head . I should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At nine , there was chaff in her hair . In the smell of haydust I did what she wanted . But when , another day , she asked me to kiss her I said No . I thought her ugly . It was through a fence and her mouth was moist with spittle . " It 's been a long time , " I said . The tiled walls were white reflections in the whiteness of the smooth table . The girl brought the crabs . " You do n't know where Irma is ? " The waitress did not know . Contemptuously , she punched our check . " I 'm sorry . I thought I could fix something up for you . Irma was a good girl and accommodating . " He did not lower his voice . " I guess what the trouble was , the Greek got too insistent . I do n't blame her . " I peered through the cobwebs . The Greek leaned from a stool on the cash counter , a heavy blue jowl . He was reading a paper . He spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good girl . Of course , they 're all good , " said Charlie . " Only some are better than others . " The crabs were hot . Everything was hot . " You boys have it luckier than we did . " Again I did not know what he meant and let him go on . " Because you know you do n't have to take anything off anybody . Not if you do n't want to . There are never very many people who come alive and when there 's one that does , then there 's always a hundred trying to live on him . My mother used to whip me . Not once in a while , but every day , with a cowhide . I reckon I was pretty mean . I was going on towardeleven . She whipped me . And then one day I threw her arm back and said , What are you whipping me for ? ' Ip164was mad . I took her by surprise . I asked her again . She did n't know . And she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pushed back his chair . " And there 's somebody else I 'm going to take by surprise . She do n't know it yet . But when she finds out  --  You were n't lying to me just now ? " " What about ? " " You know what about . " I felt my face warm . " No , " I said , looking straight into his eye . He smiled with malice . What is done in innocence does not count for the damned . I was lying now and knew it . And Charlie must have known . He lit a cigarette and smoked still smiling . " It 's all right . You do n't have to if you do n't want to . But you 're too young to know that . You boys are lucky . I must have been just about your age the summer I spent down at Uncle Cassius 's . There were nine boys there , includingthree cousins on the other side . There was n't one of us went through the summer without getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't anything else in those days . " What do you want to eat now ? " I asked for sliced peaches and cream . Charlie ordered coffee . " Did n't you ever notice that about Virginia ? She looks all right , but when you get close to her , she 's dead inside . That 's the whole trouble with her . But I 'm not taking anything off her . I do n't have to . At your age , you think you must , because that 's the only way to get what you want . When I was young I was all for playing the stallion . But now I know that being a great man with the women does n't count , it 's being a great man to your-self . " He stood up and looked at the paper check which the girl had put on the table.  | " There 's no good my telling you this . You 'll have to find it out yourself , but when you 've lived through it , one day you 'll remember and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He stopped at the cash counter and I stared aside . In the wide door the hot day panted . Charlie paid . The Greek contracted and as his pudgy ringed fingers put down change spread his big black eyebrows . " Come again ! " " I do n't see Irma around , " Charlie said . He tipped the big girl . " She get too gay . I fire her . " The Greek sweated . His silk shirt , striped in black and orange , moulded his pectoral muscles and under the armpits seeped wet stains . " Go on , " said Charlie , " and wait for me at the car . " I walked across the sun and the traffic and from the oppositecurb looked back . The shadows of the street were hot . The Corinthian Lunch Room was white ; the two men came out and talked in the trembling heat of the pavement . Charlie 's legs were wide . He plucked at the orange-striped shirt , as though the black Greek had been a child he was teasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court house was a cast-iron fountain . Under sycamores its trickle ran with a cool sound . The cab horses were in their nets and stamping from flies . Suddenly Charlie pointed and shouted , standing back . The Greek slapped with both hands at his black massed hair . And Charlie closed in and before I had seen what he was doing had the shirt tail ripped out of the belt and the belt loosened and the shirt over the Greek 's arms . He wound it twisting around his head and held him for a moment , blind . Hairy and bare , Charlie swung him as by a halter . I was not the only one who saw . They laughed . Charlie let go.  |p166The  Greek raged , then , half naked , scuttled into the lunch room . When he ran raging out again , resplendent in silk and sweat , Charlie had turned the corner . He came back with a policeman . The policeman was chuckling . But he straightened confrontingthe blue-jowled owner of the Corinthian Lunch Roam . " I Chris Papamichael ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlie was smoking . I crossed the street . He motioned to me to keep away . I only heard the law say very solemnly , tapping each word on the by now striped in orange and black ribs of the Greek , " I know Mr. Marston and if I hear another word from you I 'll run you in for disturbing the peace . Understand ! " Charlie again signed to me to keep away . The Greek was silly . " I Chris Papamichael . I pay taxes . " When it was over I went back to the car.  |p167WE  turned into the burning Square . " What time is it ? " " Hell , if I know . It 's still today , if that 's what you mean . Pile out ! " We stopped . The grocery window displayed a trim battalion of scarlet and white uniformed cans drawn up behind plate glass in acrobatic formation . Charlie shouted and a clean-jacketed clerk came out , his shoulder distorted by the weight of the suitcase . When the car was loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved hill past the market house . It was nearly five o'clock ; I saw it by the tower . We turned down Church Street . Charlie stopped in front of Alonzo Poffenberger : Funeral Director and Embalmer . " Nobody , " he said , " will come there looking for liquor . " Ile took the precaution , however , of locking the car . " Come on , I want to show you off to Plush-Eye Lillian . " It was a few doors down the street . The windows were shuttered on the narrow brick house . He rang the bell . We stood on the stoop . I recognized the maid who let us in , a big fat mulatress in all the blowsiness of a summer afternoon . I had seen her in Mordington . " Lordy , Mr. Marston , of it ai n't you . Come in . You all ai n't been here in a long while . Ah tell Miss Lillian right away . Come in . " Her voice dropped subtly when she addressedme ; I had heard that tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visitor . The parlor was small and close ; lace curtains let in a ratted light of green shutters . " He got kind of big , ai n't he ? "  |p168Charlie  slouched in an armchair of imitation leather . I stood shy under the returning eyes of the negress . " The Madam say she be right down . For you all to wait . " The negress sloppily had gone . I asked who Miss Lillianwas . " For the love of God , " said my uncle , " do n't call her Miss Lillian . Do n't you know a disorderly house when you see one ? What 's the matter with you ? Do n't you want to have a good time ? " I wanted to answer No . My heart was down . " How 's your money ? " I looked blank . Charlie brought out a roll of bills and crumpled three into my hand . He had crushed out a cigarette before Miss Lillian spryly tripped in . He lit another from the same match he held to hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short skirt black . She had the air of a dipsomaniac school-teacher , she wore pince-nez and leaning to light the cigarette , her hair strayed . Under the glasses her eyes were seen small , distorted and lashless . The spaces about them were plump with pink . " What you got for me , Charlie ? I thought maybe you was coming to take me for an automobile ride . " Charlie brought out a flask of rye from his hip pocket and set it on the marble-topped table . " Well , that 's something . " Smoking , her lips popped in little pouts . She held her cigarette in fingers daintily lifted . " I always say a drink 's as good as a trip any day . " She shrieked for water and glasses . " And a drunk 's a girl 's holiday . It takes you away from yourself . " The blowsy negress brought in a tin tray . " What 's that ? " Miss Lillian had apparently just seen me ; she peered at me through lashless glasses.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's my cousin , " said Charlie . " He 's up here from lower Virginia . " " Does he get some ? " " Give him what you think he ought to have . He 'll drink what you give him . " " Good Gawd ! " Miss Lillian smiled at me almost imperceptibly . " I 'm glad you told me . I have n't seen anything as young as that since I first went over the falls my-self . " " When was that , Plush-eye ? " " Damned if I know , Charlie . " She poured out my drink . " But I remember him the same as if was yesterday . He was a nice kid . Came round the next week all ashamed of himself and wanted me to marry him . Can you imagine it ? " She laughed from deep down in her throat . " Me married ? " " I do n't know why not , " said Charlie . " Me ? I told him , I said , You 've got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar . ' " She drained her glass . " You might make some man a good wife . Anyhow , you 'd know how to take his money away from him . " " Would n't I ? Gim me a little more of that well-wisher you got there , Charlie . " Miss Lillian scraped up her back hair with a comb . " I told him where to get off . Here 's to you , Charlie ! " They touched glasses . " Marriage ! " They both drank . Far off , a motorcycle shuddered and struggling sped through a remote world . The rumors of the street came faint into the shuttered room . I sipped at my rye in a dullnessof nerves . " Well , as the country boy says , I never been married , but I know what it feels like . " She put her glass down . " You doing anything , Charlie ? "  |p170I  should have been more excited at the thought of being there , had not the parlor , and above all my presence there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed the day . The mantelpiece was of varnished oak , carved and fluted to hold a mirror , which darkly reflected through an open door the hall and its stairs . I took in everything with curiosity , knowing I should eventually construct an excitementout of it in my imagination . I should relate it as an adventure ; just now I prayed that I should not be asked to take an active part in it . " There 's Mabel , " Miss Lillian suggested brightly . " She 's new , ai n't she ? " asked Charlie . " You do n't get ' em any newer . Three months on the turf . " " Let 's see her . " " I had to let Corie go today . She had a funeral . Her sister or something . Corie 's a great family girl . Mabel 's holding the house down . " She went to the stairs and shrieked , returning to the table and her glass . " I thought it might be you , Plush-eye . " " Me ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would n't be decent . " Miss Lillian giggled like a schoolteacherat a joke from the principal . " I 'd be embarrassed . " She was getting tight . " No , " said Charley seriously . " I meant  --  Why do n't you , Lillian ? You used to like ' em young . " Again at the stairs she yelled upward , " Mabel ! " The girl 's eyes were wild and as it seemed unseeing and she flurried scent as she flopped into an armchair . It was from my stare that she covered her knees with the ends of a red cotton flowered kimono . Her hair was tied back , like a little girl 's , with a blue silk ribbon . Miss Lillian considered me.  | " I know he 'd be in good hands , " said Charlie . " Hands , " Miss Lillian giggled . " Mabel , get me that palm leaf fan . That 's not what these young boys come here for . They got that at home . " She looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name ? " " John , " said my uncle . " He 's got nice skin . But he would n't do me any good . " She fanned herself contemplatively . " I would n't have let him in if he 'd come here alone . It do n't look right . No , " she said . " He 'd just fill me with regrets . " The girl was there and not there with her haggard countryeyes . In that light they were all pupil , burning dark . Her curls tumbled ; wisps of hair were wet at the temples . The mouth was scarlet that hung stupidly over the moist teeth . Her legs were long ; her one movement was to cover them when the folds of the red-flowered gown fell apart . I tried to see her without turning and held my glass untastedin my hands . " He 's blushing , " Miss Lillian smiled at me . " And I do n't blame him . My Gawd , but it 's hot ! Go on upstairs with Mabel , Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll stay here and look after the kid . " " He 's the one wants to go . " Charlie thrust his hand into his pocket , brought out his roll , peeled over a bill . " That 's extra for luck . " He crushed it into Mabel 's hand . It went into her stocking . " Be good to him . " As we went out of the door I felt the same glance behind us . I climbed the stair . And as I passed into the darkness which was the upper hall , I heard her voice demanding , " Say , Charlie , where did you leave that car ? You ought to come and take me out for a ride some time . " Mabel thrust the door shut and latched it . I felt its click like a doom  |p172She  turned toward me . Her powder spread a purplish film on her face . " She 's a hellion ! She 'll try to get that extra dollar out me when I go down . " Mabel lifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know what she wanted me to do ? " Her arms came out of the red flowered gown . She made me intimate with her anger while beside the bed she kicked off her slippers . On the mantel was a small white plaster Paul and Virginiawho seemed in the act of stepping off into space . " She thinks she can make me run this whole house . She used to have three girls . " Clumsily I embraced her shoulder , the red kimono slipped in my grasp . " Wait a minute , will you ? Give me time ! " She shook back her hair . Then she sat down on the bed . " Come here , let me see you . " I went toward her shyly . " Good God ! Ca n't you even unbutton it ? " She lay on the bed , in the shadow of the window . The blind was drawn but trembled below on a rim of air ; summerwas on the sill and burning reflected in the curtain . And the air beating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and houses . Her eyes waited . I took off my coat and very slowly hung it over the back of a chair . Then I stopped . " I do n't think I can . " She lay with her arm under her hair . I looked where she lay , her belly breathing and her thighs apart and bare . " I ca n't . " " Do n't you like my looks ? " I wanted to say Yes . " It 's not that ! " I was afraid of her anger and frightened of my own timidity . " It 's me . " " Well , I never ! Come here . " I let her take my hand.  | " I know I 'm a hustler , " she said . And I sat a little on the bed . " You 're young , that 's all . Do n't worry . We 'll stay here a while then you can go down and tell ' em whatever you want to . I wo n't give you away . You have n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by crimson-ruched garters . I touched her knee . " Then go over and look in the top drawer . There 's a pack of Fatimas there . " I was trembling beyond control . " And hand me that kimono . I ca n't have you sitting there looking at me if you ai n't going to do anything about it . " I escaped into the narrow hallway . The door shut behind me . In the darkness was relief . Alone , I breathed . Then knowing that I was putting one foot before the other I came down the stairs . " Gawd ! " Miss Lillian raised her red eyes , then squeezed them behind the distorting glasses . " I would n't be young again for all they could give me . But do n't they have fun ? " And Charlie said , " You wo n't believe it , Lillian , but I loved that girl . I swear when she died , I could have  --  I do n't know what I could have done . " Miss Lillian looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep well and straining to see down into the pool of dark water . " Love ? What the hell 's the use of it ? It do n't even make you feel good . Or if it does , it 's over before you know it . I can stay drunk three days and to hell with the world and every damn man in it . Give me a bottle of good rye and I would n't change it , not even for you , Charlie , and you 're one of the best . Yes , sir , I 'm just started and I would n't take the best man in the world for the way I feel inside just with a couple of drinks . You take my advice , Charlie , and do n't go mixing yourself up with these young girls . If you feel like taking a little time off come over and see me . I 'll fix you up with something that 'll cost you a couple of dollars and when you 're through with it , you 're through with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Lonzo Poffenberger and me 's sitting here a couple of doors apart . He wears a black suit for business . Ai n't that right , Charlie ? Yes , sir , he wears a black suit for business . That 's right . We both got to be . He does business in his parlor and I do it in mine . We work here in red kimonos . He gets ' em going and I gets ' em coming . Gawd ! I almost tripped that time . " She stood up swaying . " Charlie , you take my advice and stay away from these young girls . They wo n't get you into nothing but trouble . " " Lillian , " said Charlie . " You know how to run a hookshop . But you do n't know a thing about men . " " Men , " she screamed . " Me ? I do n't know about men ? " " No , you do n't , " said Charlie . " You do n't know any more about your customers than old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stiffs . " " That 's right . That 's all I was trying to say . What about it , Johnny ? Ready to go ? " She suddenly exploded in laughter of a spinster bawd . " That 's a good one . " The negress scarcely opened the door for us . Charlie stood on the pavement . He had a desperate and uncertain air . The street in the sun was strange . Charlie put me in the back seat of the car . " Do n't mind about my driving , " he said . " When I get drunk , I only get drunk in the head . But you had better be behind if anything goes wrong . " The undertaker 's window was stale with the end of summer . Two rubber plants lifted fattened leaves to the flyspeckedlight and behind them I saw on the bare planks a row of yellow chairs that waited for surviving visitors . The inner door was closed ; the room lived in a dead dust.  |p175Charlie  was a long time cranking the car . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embalming parlor . The bottles rattled . We were off . And as the car moved I went back into the bedroom with the red kimono under which the blond girl 's thighs were bare . I went back and as we came into the Square by Ramaciotti 's and the deep awning over the rotten odor of sunned fruit and under the shadow lifted trays of peaches , plums , oranges , melons and Italian chestnuts , I climbed as it seemed , out of my inexperience , the naked pink of watermelons cut across their seeds and tangled in a net of pink mosquito netting , and naked and bold I stood now in front of the bed . The trolley swung , ringing its bell , into the cobbled Square , and I climbed , all that was too young and too timid dropped with my clothes , past a row of cheap shop windows and a bay of dummies in ready-made suits , into the bed with the bare thighs . I pursued the dream undaunted , and the mouth moist in anguish scarlet , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; jolted , awake , I saw the car Charlie had just missed ; clutched the suitcase falling . In desolation I grasped it , and thought , My God , but this is an ugly town . Evening was a descent of yellow light among those hideoushouses and sooty chimneys . Brightness falls from the airQueens have died both young and fair Dust bath closed Helen 's eye . The words falling into my thought , we ran out of the town . I stared before me , assuaged by words not my own . I urn sick . I bit into my wrist until the blood left the skin and where my teeth had been was white . I am young , I must die . We rode on toward darkness . And now I was consciousp176of nothing so much as that I wanted to water and when we were out in the open fields I asked Charlie to stop and stood by the road and shot the stream high across the ditch . Sprinkling it fell clear in the twilight ; the drops gilded where in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusk of stubble a last field sparrow sang . I felt better . The odor of the earth was dry and rich . Charlie peered into the back seat . " You 'd better put the lap robe over the liquor , " he said . " If they try to stop me at the bridge , I 'm liable to let off a couple of shots in the air . How you feel-ing ? " " Fine , " I said . " Was she good ? " I did n't answer . " Do n't take it too hard . Nothing 's any good the first time . Give it a chance . " He took out his pistol and stuffed it into the side pocket of the car . I am sick , I must die . It came again into my mind , but I was unhappily indifferent . The country was dim , a warm gray mist fenced by the road , which began far ahead of us and continually widened as it swept toward the lights and sharpened its rocks when it went under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green . The air was soft . I liked being sad and hoped for trouble at the bridge . Its boards rumbled out of the night . The toll-bar was down . A man came out and looked by a yellowing lantern . It lit Charlie 's face . He spoke . Then the bar was lifted and we crossed the state line . " I must tell him , " I thought , but knew I did not have to do it yet.  |p177Iv  was late when we got back . Charlie raided the ice box , set out a hock of ham on the kitchen table . We had had no supper ; I drank milk and he kept his glass filled from a pewter pitcher of cooled water and one of the bottles he had brought across the border . He may have been drunk ; I do not know , for with him it was hard to tell ; I know that he did not want to be alone . He held me . I was restless and tired , in a state of suspense , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because he began talking , for I did not listen . His voice was between me and my own loneliness . For in the bedroom , in the dark , I was again with my own ache . And that desire which had deserted me for timidity when I stood by the bed , where the blinds were drawn and only a thin rim left for the sun to flap on the sill , and the girl lay bare with thighs , now in the room open to the night returned , desire alone and without an object . The windows were wide and the country night too filled with stars . I stifled in breathlessness and found as I never before had done the beating of my own blood . I lay tormented by my loneliness and by the night , which was a space coming from beyond the stars . It fevered my skin . I moved in sweat , faint on the straw ticking , and overcome with lust . When I came to myself , I was drowned in thirst . I was frantically alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects . I could make out the room . I lay there some moments and then got up . The water in the wash pitcher was tepid and stale . I looked into the sleepless dark.  |p178I  listened and left the door open , crossed the corridor on bare feet , feeling my way along the walls into the wider hall above the staircase . There I shuffled uneasily , until I had grasped the banisters ; sightless , going down , I leaned against them to lessen the creaking of the stairs . In the dining room I groped , not knowing where I was until I put my hand on the sideboard . It was then I was conscious of having heard , while I stood at the door , Charlie putting his half-emptied whisky bottle away . I knelt and opening the lower door , held only by a wad of paper , found the bottle . I took a swig , but it was too strong . I sputtered , not liking it . In the gallery , seeing a light in the kitchen windows , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yellow was under the door . Thrusting it open , Rush was at the table . The glitter of his eyes startled me . I stood for a moment holding the door . " Uhumm ! " He paused with his knife in the air . " What is you doin ' up at dis time o ' night ? " He cut a sliver from the almost consumed ham bone and dangled it above his lips until gaping they absorbed it . At the same time he crumbled bread and pinching it in his long fingers pressed it into his mouth . " I came down to get a drink of water . " I was bare-footed and in the heat had rolled high the sleeves of my pyjamas . He slowly looked me up and down with an incurious glitter . " I get you some . " And as he rose from the table he shrilly laughed . " Uhumm ! How de rich do riot and smell good ! " He passed me on his way to the door . " But don ' mind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was gone on the back porch , I put my head down to the pump over the sink and let the water run cool over my cheeks and trickle between my lips.  | " D'j'all have a good time over in Hagerstown ? " " Pretty good , " I said . " Not very . " He poured me a drink from the beaded pewter pitcher . " When d' you start wearin ' dem pyjamas ? " " I do n't know  --  " " Mo ' ? " He filled the glass again . " I been over to Hagerstown . Most ever ' year to de Fair . But I always found dose people over dere had a tendency to de uncouth . Dey ai n't like our nice Virginia people . Dey just ai n't . " He sat sidewise on the table and with a sinister nicety sliced little bits of ham and dangled them to his mouth , his teeth shining . " Has Mister Charlie come offen his rampageyit ? " " No . I guess not . " " Uhumm ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seed him runnin ' round here dis mawnin ' , I knowed he was up to some devilmint . " " He got into some sort of fight . " " I knowed it . " He snickered . I told him about the Greek . " I knowed he was gon na cut up some kind o ' capers ' fore he was through . He certainly can be onery to me sometimes . " Rush changed his tone . " What you want to stay out here for anyway ? Why n't you go on back to town where you be-long ? " " That 's my affair , " I said . Rush was all dressed up and his black hair , elaborately crinkled , lustrous with oil . I felt a sudden loathing for him . He gave me a conciliatory grin . " You don ' ask me where I been . ' Cause you don ' want to know . Or you just pretends . But I don ' have to go runnin ' over dere . I can have all de good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , letting his legs trail ; several times he tapped the blade of the knife on his fingertips . " You don ' even know where de boys ' clubroom is . " " It 's over Dunning 's store . "  | " You don ' never go dere , does you ? " " Not if I know it . I would n't be found dead there . " " I can have all de good time I wants right here . " He almostsang the last words , keeping time with the tapping of the steel blade . He swung his legs . " I certainly would like to know what you all done over in Hagerstown . " " I told you , " I said . " You ai n't told me nothin ' . You just lyin ' . You got lyin ' writ all over yo ' face . " His mandoline was on the table . I looked at his hands in an attraction of disgust . There is something apparently unfinishedabout a negro 's hands , and this was true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , as Caroline used to say , the best blood in the county . " You ai n't goin ' tell me ? " " Is that your mandoline ? " " Indeed ' t is . " He picked up the instrument and twanged the strings : " I been playin dis ebenin ' for de boys at de clubroom . Ef I was you , I would n't stay here . You know , I don ' have to stay here . I kin come and go whenever I feels so inclined . One of dese days , I 'm layin ' off to go to Pittsburg . You ai n't never heard me play ? " " I 've heard you , " I said . " The boys likes me to come and play for their singin ' whenever I kin arrange it . And dis ebenin ' , soon as I heard Miss Virginia was coming back , I said , Rush , dis is one ebenin ' you ai n't gon na stick around . Dey gon na look for you and you gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Car'line called me , I was away and gone . ' Cause I did n't want to be here when Mister Charlie come home and found out who 'd come back agin . You ai n't never been to de club ? " " I do n't like Clopper and his crowd and they do n't like me. "  |p181Rush  snickered . " Dat 's ' cause you think dey too rough for you . " And I remembered a day among the green willows of the run , when I had seen Rush chased with cries and sticks by an angry lot of these same boys . The strange thing was he turned when they stopped and called to them from the hill with plaintive taunts . They yelled , who could not go furtherin the pursuit . They had come naked from the stream . Rush softly twanged his mandoline . " But dat don ' make no never mind to me . I plays and dey all sings . You ought to hear 'm some time . Dose boys sure can make harmony . You know Golly Clopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Clopper was the jailer 's son . " And I would n't trust him further than I could sling a bull by the tail . " Rush laughed . " Dat boy 's got the sweetest tenor in town . I sing wid 'm . Den we have cigarettes and ever'thing . Dey treat me real nice . " " I 'll bet they do . They 're a tough bunch . " " You do n't like 'm cause dey used to be always fightin ' you all boys . But dey real nice to me . On account of my playin ' . " He laughed , a queer simpering laugh . " It is indeed so . Look here ! You got water all over yo'self . " " That 's all right . I like it . " " ' Tai n't all right . " He slid down from the table . " You go to bed wid yo ' hair all wet like dat and you 'll catch your death o ' cold sho ' . Come here ! Take dis here towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I saw a bruise on his throat , a dark discoloration . " Take your hands off of me ! " " Ai n't no use o ' your bein ' so high and mighty . I ai n't goin ' hurt you . " " No , but I might hurt you . " He snickered . " You would n't do nothin ' like dat . You ai n't like dose boys at de club . Dey 's awful . You wouldn'tp182believe it , John , but dey is . Sometimes I skeered de Lord 's goin ' strike Golly daid . He swears sumpin ' awful . " " When did Miss Virginia get here ? " " ' Deed I don ' know . What you hurr'in ? " In the dark his voice was unattached . " ' Tai n't no use . ' Cause I knows . " It was cooler now in the gallery , but the breath was heavy from the dark burnt earth . I walked among the arches , first fast and then slower , for the vault of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen honeysuckle and wished with complete passion that I might be discharged of all carnality . Dew had fallen on the bricks . And my longing was to have no more substance than this scarcely moving air that sensuously came to me from the summer lawn and trees drenched in darkness . To be cool , to be clean ! The desire was real and from my body . I entered the dark house and groped to the stairs . Mounting in the darkness , I heard voices which became at Caroline 's bedroom the noise of a quarrel . Charlie was angry . I passed on tiptoe and when I reached the wing corridor ran . When I had closed my own door , I pressed against the wall to recover my breath . My knees were weak and I was trembling . Caroline , complaining , sobbed . Her last cry was avid and almost hysterical.  |p183THE  day was hot . I must begin by saying that . All that was done that day was done under an unrelenting sun . It stayed over us , moving indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immobility . All day its splendor was around us ; not once did the smallest wrinkle of a cloud disturb that vast and vacant face . There was only the slowly moving stare which burned aloof and looked down on the earth as a judge might on the tortures of criminals who are slowly being racked to death at his orders . I woke while dawn was still a slanting light , the sheets twisted and wet . I was worn with tossing and my body desperate with the heat of the night . I got up and walked about the floor , pale bare planks and striped carpets of rag . I tried the water in the flowered pitcher . It was not cool . I crawled back to bed , seeking a little respite in further sleep . At last I went off , crushing the pillow against the sun on my eyelids . I woke again at Rush 's knock . I waited until he was gone and then stripped and stood straddling over the bowl , poured water down my shoulders . I dressed without drying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table was sullen and tired , as her hands caught reflections from silver and glass . Her hair , honey-colored and fine , was brushed from the temples where it shone a blond as pale as bee 's wax . " Good morning . Did you sleep well ? " " 0 , yes . " Virginia sat down . " Nothing ever prevents my slumbers . " " I 've tried going to bed sober , " said Charlie . " And I 've tried going to bed drunk . And nothing 's worse . " Caroline 's eyes made me afraid . When I saw them , above the chased silver of the coffee urn , I remembered the night.  | They were tired , not simply as eyes that have passed through sleeplessness , or wept , though I was sure they had done both , but rather as an invalid 's are , who has passed through a recurrent crisis . I dared not , when I first sat down , look at her straight , for in them I saw not only hopelessness but fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Blackberries were before me in a bowl . Sunlight patched the tablecloth . Virginia was cool in white . Reviving in the morning light , I almost forgot the dread I had known in the dark from my own restlessness in solitude and afterwards , passing without breath , from the voices I had heard in the corridor , the one angry , the other subdued to sobbing . I sprinkled sugar on the berries , and pouring , saw them mingle their purple curdling stain with rich country cream . I lifted a surreptitious glance toward Caroline . Would my own eyes , I wondered , betray me ? " I think , " she said , " it 's gathering for a thunderstorm . " Rush stopped before her with an alert smirk . " You ought n't to wish that , Miss Car'line ? " " Why not , Rush ? " Virginia asked . " ' Cause of it rains , when de Virgin Mary flies over de pond tonight , she get her tail-feathers wet . " " I 'd like to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As always when Virginia was at Ruddimont , three kinds of bread were brought us for breakfast . Rush had set soda biscuits before Caroline and came swinging through the door with corncakes for Charlie and me , while beside Virginia was a plate on which buttered toast was folded in a napkin . Her sleeves were short , her forearms freckled . Charlie served us summer sausage from a platter of fantastic birds , branches in a painted foliage of pale green and pink and purple flowers . " One of those damn fool niggers has been riding the bayp185colt . I do n't know how they manage it , but every time I leave this place , somebody breaks loose . " " You were away all day , Charlie , " Caroline said . " They certainly played particular hell . They 've got all the skin scraped off one knee . They must have been jumpinghim . " " You know how it is , I ca n't control them . When you are not here , they do as they please . " The confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a suspended moment of calm , in which I caught contentment . I felt I could love Caroline , since close to her I should find an appeasement and should not need to touch her . Her skin was sallow , she was not as young even as my uncle ; but though her eyes were tired , she showed a serenity not even the night could invade . I thought of my mother and how I had seen her converse at breakfast in a lively and apparently gay charm , when actually , as she sometimes later and casually confessed to me , she had lain awake half the night , distracted by debts , worrying where she would find the money to pay them . It was a quality I admired , since I did not possess it . When Caroline spoke it was to admonish , not to complain , yet I guessed her as passionate as she was patient . Her hands , pouring more coffee , were controlled on the silver urn , engravedwith crested arms , erased by use ; solid after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulling the summer light to domestic splendor . " You were rather late getting back , " said Virginia to Charlie . " Was I ? I never noticed the time . " " How was your trip ? " Rush offered Charlie corncakes . He refused them with his hand . " What ? Why , it was fine . Only it do n't taste so good this morning . "  |p186Charlie  had put on a shepherd 's plaid coat to come to the table , old and small for him . Under it , he wore a faded blue shirt and for the stables drab breeches and cowhide puttees . He leaned , drinking coffee , then lit a cigarette . His fingers were in his hair . " Tell you something funny , " he said . " You know Lafe Bider ? He got married . " " Yes , " said Caroline . " They 've just had a baby . " " That 's what 's funny . Lafe got married in April and here it is only July . " " Those things happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about them at the table ? " " But I know the girl , " said Virginia . " She used to be in my sewing class . The red-haired Doswell girl . Yes , I know her quite well . " " That 's what Lafe thought . He thought he knew her . " Charlie laughed prodigiously. " 0 , yes ! And he thought he was the only one that knew her . " " Charlie ! " " Wait a minute , will you . After it happened , Lafe went to the doctor . Doc , ' he said , that baby wo n't live , will it ? '  --  Why ? ' said the doctor . There 's nothing in the world the matter with that baby . He 's a fine strapping boy . '  --  I know he 's a boy , ' said Lafe , but he wo n't live , will he ? '  --  ' I do n't see why not . What 's on your mind ? '  --  Well , ' said Lafe , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six months , ' said the doctor , six months hell ; That 's a nine months ' child . ' " " That 's not funny , " said Caroline . " And besides with country people of that class it makes no difference once they 're married . " " That 's the joke , " Charlie grinned . " That 's what 's funny . It was Lafe married her . ' I wish you could have seen his face , ' said the doctor when he told it . But Doc , ' Lafe said , I only got there in January . ' "  |p187Charlie  looked round the table . " I do n't seem to have told it very well . But count on your fingers . " He tried to give Virginia more of the summer sausage . " I must say men are disgusting , " said Caroline . " Men ! " " Well , suppose it happened . What I ca n't bear is a lot of men standing around and the doctor telling them about it and their all laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she had a right to find a father for her unborn child . " " Good God ! What do you think they were laughing about ? " " About that poor little thing 's having a baby . " A flush of stupor passed over Charlie 's face . " I 'm licked . " He turned toward me . " This , boy , is what you 're up against . And you might as well get used to it . Lafe got his . " " They are not all as lucky as you , Charlie . " Virginia 's voice had a low harsh bitterness . " You have Caroline . " " Of course , I 've got Caroline . " " She does save your getting into trouble , does n't she ? " " I never noticed that . " Caroline did not look up . Her eyes were tired and it was as though her hair were weeping for her , falling in loose wisps of pale blond . " I mean she saves you when you are in trouble . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did not know what was going on . But I saw Caroline 's distress as Charlie caught his breath and leaned toward Virginia , his elbows thrust out , dark and flushed . " Are you by any chance referring to fornication and bastardy ? " Caroline plead with him to be still . She dropped her knife . " Must you , Charlie ? " " That 's all right . " He was silent a moment with fury . Virginia sat with her head tipped forward over the longp188line of her throat , smiling . Caroline picked up her knife and as though there were nothing else in the world , spread , butter on a round of biscuit and watched it melt into the sinking crust . " I 'll stand back of anything I 've ever done . If you want to talk about it , go ahead . I 'll be the one to get hurt . " Virginia sat with the same rather affected , friendly smile . " That 's not what I meant , Charlie . And you know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what happened yesterday ? " " It was you who started it . " " I thought I was going to be funny , " said Charlie bitterly . " You do n't shock me . I want to listen . " " And it turns out the joke is on me . " " I consider it unintelligent to be shocked , " Virginia spoke rapidly . " And I do n't want you to be ashamed with me . For I do understand you , Charlie . I know quite well what you 're after . For what you really crave is disorder . You ca n't help that , can you ? And I do n't blame you . Only  --  " she hesitated . " You see there are times when your male humor is a little too robust for me. " " 0 , that 's all ? It 's only my humor that 's too strong for you ? " " Well , yes , " said Virginia . She laughed strangely . " Charlie , Virginia 's my guest , " Caroline plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the colt ? " " Do n't worry . " Charlie rose . " I 'm going . I 'm afraid if I stayed here I might be tempted to tell you another story . " " We all love you , Charlie , " said Virginia . " Even when you 're angry . " " I could tell what happened to John yesterday . " " On the contrary , I think I like you best when you are uncontrollable . " " But maybe you 'd better ask him . " Charlie was at the door . " Get John to tell you what he did yesterday . "  |p189I  looked after him when he had gone . Caroline rang the bell . " I 'm sorry I started him , " said Virginia. " 0 , you must n't mind Charlie . He 's always most rude when he 's been drinking . Rush , " she said as he came in through the door from the gallery , " I want some hot coffee . I must have it black and very strong . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Caroline 's hands lay limp on the tablecloth . " But it does n't happen often . " She had by now lost most of her side hair . " You are such a comfort ! " " Charlie loves you , " said Virginia . " I know . " " But he does n't make you happy ? " " Why should he ? Love has nothing to do with happiness . " I was sure I was very fond of Caroline . " I do wish at times I were more ladylike . " Virginia looked at her hands . Rush restored the silver urn to its place . " The cook wants to see you , Miss Car'line . " Caroline nodding to Rush remonstrated with Virginia . " But I should find it so much simpler , being a woman , if I could let myself seem shocked . I am not a man and I ca n't laugh . I have to stay and listen . And all I ever perceive is the cruelty . " Rush smirked at me as he backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should like to stop it , but in the end it fascinates me . For I 'd rather see cruelty than be bored . Anything is better . " Have some more coffee with me , " suggested Caroline . " Thank you , " said Virginia . " Sometimes I wish Guyon Hall would burn down . " Caroline was shocked . " But darling , that lovely old place ! " " But I do . I get so bored there . And have n't you everp190wished you could destroy your whole past and begin again ? " She went on vehemently . " I should like to start all over , young and strong and ready to devote myself to what I really care for . I 'd burn Guyon Hall . Because then I 'd have nothing . " " But Virginia ! What an awful wish ! " " I know it is , but it makes my heart beat faster . SometimesI see myself standing there in nothing but the clothes I 've got on . The first time I dreamt it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how it is in dreams , you find yourself in the most improbable situationsin nothing but your nightclothes . I was standing there on the lawn in bare feet and the whole house had burned down and there was nothing left at all but a pile of smouldering ashes , no higher than that . About half as tall as I am . And on top was my father 's portrait looking up at me from the cinders . It was the only thing untouched . Not even the frame was tarnished by the smoke . And the face was alive and trying to speak to me . It was quite horriblein the dream . Then it was painful , but I assure you that now when I think of it , I find it rather a pleasant sensation . " " Well , " said Caroline , cradling the cup in both hands , " I know what I do when things get too much for me . I have a cup of strong black coffee and go to bed . And I know what I wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threshing machine was n't coming here Tuesday . Because that 's what I 'd do right now . " Rush appeared at the door . " Miss Car'line , the cook 's waiting for you . " " I 'm coming . " We went out on the porch and sat half in the shadow of the columned porch ; boxtrees were sultry in the heat . Onp191the steps , Virginia 's white skirt spread brilliantly into the sun . " Have you written any poetry lately ? " " No , " I said . " You ought to . " " What I do is not good enough . " " You are young . " " Poe had already written his best lyric at my age . " " I would n't trust him on that . Poets often lie fearfully as to the date of their first compositions . I learned that when I went over my father 's papers preparing the completeedition . So many of the dates were wrong . But you ought to work now . It 's so wonderful to be young ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not wonderful . It 's terrible to be young . " " But you have all time before you . " " That is what is so terrible . Everything  --  to have everythingbefore you and to have accomplished nothing . " My self-confidence was very low . " Everything But that 's better than to have nothing . " She looked out passionately toward the blue haze of the hills . " And you have not come to living by the clock . You do n't know what it is when the time comes and you can only look at middle age and desire sits dumb . " There was a little stir in the air and she held up her long throat to it . She seemed scarcely aware of me , but sat like a statue , her throat lifted to vibrations of reflected heat , slowly smiling . " Do you know Francis Thompson ? " " No , " I said . " Then you do n't know his essays . He says , Nature has no heart : " She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday ? " There was not much I could say of Hagerstown . " It 's more of a town than Mordington , but I do n't like it . Nor the people . "  | " But you should , " she said . " At least you should try to . And you really ought to . Because , you know , they are much more American than we are . " " But why ? " " 0 , they are thriving and progressive . And they want to do something . " " I am an American . " The warm earth was about me and the thrilling air . " Sometimes I wonder . The people in Mordington are all so proud of their particularity . But it seems to me that all they do is just live . " I looked out over the land which I loved , burning under a cloudless sky . Charlie strode across the dry lawn . " It 's hot enough to sizzle grasshoppers out there . " His blue shirt was old and faded and had been torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , I saw he had cut his arm . " What is it ? " asked Virginia . " Let 's see ! " " It 's nothing , " he put the wound to his mouth . " One of the old scythes . We were clearing out the barn and I cut myself . " He took out a dusty dark blue handkerchief , but after one glance , he crumpled it again in his pocket . " You ought to be careful . " He stood in the sun , one foot on the step , intently sucking his own blood . " You want this ? " Virginia offered him a tiny web of linen . " No , " he said . " I 'm going to have a mint julep . Wo n't you all join me ? " He lowered his arm . " I think it 's stopped bleeding anyway . " But he took her handkerchief and wiped away the smears of blood from his arm . " I 'm sorry . I ought n't to have taken it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " But look ! It 's all bloody . " For some moments they were motionless , while Charliestared at her . I followed them through the French window . Rush was summoned and a little later came bearing on a broad salver bowls of ice and sugar , glasses and gathered sprigs of mint . Charlie unlocked the sideboard . Caroline poured while the liquor rose from the ice in a smoke and the glasses slowly frosted . Drops on the leaves reflected silver . " Hot damn ! " said Charlie . " There 's nobody can make a julep like Caroline . " He put his glass down . " Why do n't you all drink ? What you trying to do ? Give John one . " " I do n't think his mother would like it , " Caroline objected . " Listen ! " said Charlie . " I 'll take all the responsibility . There 's only one first mint julep and he 'll never have another one like it . " He winked at me , plunging his nose into the fragrant glass. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up here a piece . I want to have a look at the colts . " The central of the tall windows was open . Virginia was in the parlor , she had risen when Charlie spoke , keeping the place in her book with her hand . He was outside . " Wait . I 'll ask Caroline . " He heard their voices . Caroline was in the hall arranging flowers that had been cut that morning and kept in the dark , cornflowers , gallardias , marigolds , and dark red and golden coreopsis . " By all means , if Charlie wants you . But it 's mighty hot . " The smile was rather wry on his dusky face . Virginia was all in white . She wore a big straw hat , high on one side , with a wide flat bow of black velvet . Caroline came toward them before they had left the porch . " Why do n't you wait now ? You wo n't have time before dinner . It 's almost ready . " Her hands carried flowers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the varied strand of cornflowers , dark blue jagged petals and the fiery little crowns of coreopsis . The stems were wet . " I like them , " she said . " I like everything that looks wild and still grows in a garden . Are you coming ? " And then to Virginia when she had stepped through the window , " Smell them ! They are like a hot day . Not sweet . " Virginia sat at the table in her straw hat . Caroline kept between them in their conversation ; she was intent to divert anything that might be said away from argument . As a matter of fact , Charlie was almost silent ; once or twice hep195looked at his guest , lifting his lips and showing his teeth . He might have smiled inwardly . When he came out , the tray which had held the mint juleps was still there . He poured a little whisky over the melted ice . " Maybe you 'd like one ? " " No , " said Virginia . " I 've had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dinner . But I saw them start off . They walked across the bleached lawn . The dry air hung trembling . And far off , between the still trees , after miles of farmland and of woods were the mountains like a line of bluer haze under the sky . After they had looked a while at the colts , they walked on . There was a hillside and a young orchard , they crossed it treading the long heat-smelling grass , among the ungrownapple trees . " I want to see the pond up in the cattle pasture . Do you mind ? " " No , I love the heat . " " I 'm afraid it 's going dry . " " You take good care of the place , Charlie . " " Well , I ought to , " he said . " It 's a good farm . " " It 's lovely country , all of it . Do you remember that when they took John Brown out on his coffin to hang him , he looked up and as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beautiful country ! ' " " And that was the last time for him , " Charlie laughed . " Then they hung him . " " I have thought of that often . It was these fields and these hills he looked on . " They were on a small trodden path on the edge of a pasture . Alongside was a railfence tangled with burnt dewberry . " I try to see it through his eyes . " " Why do you try to live through some one else ? Through a dead man ? "  | " 0 , it is n't that , " she said . " It 's only that I want to feel things as though I might never see them again . " She stopped and looked over the railfence . " The clover 's kind of thin in places , " said Charlie . " 0 , I think it 's all wonderful . " She stared far out . " Well , it 's pretty good for the drouth . " " The world is such a wonderful place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't think you 'd find it so . " Her eyes came back to his and were afraid . He leaned down on her . " You miss the most wonderful part of it . " " What do you mean ? " She cowered a little under his dusky face . " You 're a man-hater , ai n't you ? " " No , no , " she said passionately . " I do n't hate  --  I ca n't hate anything . " " Well , you ought to , there are a lot of things you ought to hate . You ca n't know anything about love until you learn how much of it is hate . " " No , I ca n't do it . I love what I have . " " And what 's that ? " " I am free and independent . " " That 's nothing , " said Charlie . " Nothing you have means anything . Nothing . Not even your mind . " " You do despise us , do n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was young I used to stay with some of the goddamnedest low whores you ever saw . And I did n't despise them . " " It 's too hot to stay here , " Virginia had turned her face under her wide straw hat . " We might go toward the woods , " Charlie said . " I want to try some pistol practice . And you can be in the shade there . " " You are very proud , " she said . " I used to think you hadp197no pride . But now I know . But why do you torture Caro-line ? " " I don't. " " 0 , yes , you do . You know you do . You say things beforeher " " Hell , " said Charlie . " That 's just talk . " " Yes , but you do . You hurt her . " " You do n't know anything about it . " " I know Caroline very well . And I love her . " " Yes , you know Caroline . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a thing nobody can know . " " Is it so wonderful , then ? " " Between a man and a woman ? " They had come , following the rail fence , to where they could see the pond in the pasture . A single gnarled weeping willow made a little shade trampled with cow-tracks . Some of them had dried and hardened in paler mud . The dwindling water was thick with the stirrings of the cattle . " It 's what it is . " " You can say anything to me you want , you know . " He looked at the dwindling pond . " I 'm not to be shocked . My father brought me up on the Greek and Roman poets . " " Yes , " Charlie said . " Your father wrote books too , did n't he ? " He looked down at her contemptuously . " It 's not in the books . Let 's go toward the woods . I want to try out this pistol . " " When did you start ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She shivered slightly . " Were you as wild as they say when you were young ? " " I do n't know what they say . " " And you do n't care ? "  | " Not a damn . I 'm still too young for that . But I 'm old enough to know that what 's got to be , has got to be . " At one point they were close to the edge of the farm and passed by a field of green corn . That it had been ploughed within a day or so he saw in the newly turned earth of the furrows . " Is that the Retreat ? " On the crest of a farther hill beyond the rolling furrows of corn was a small farmhouse . It was more than half a mile away . Far overhead three buzzards sailed . The sun smote its walls to yellow amid a clump of cedars . " That ! " said Charlie . " That 's just a small farm . A fellow named Cowley farms it . It used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again toward the distant farmhouse . " Are you sure ? Because I thought that must be the Retreat . " They were under the woods , closed by a thicket . From its depths came only the soft sweet cry of a pewee , like a voice of loneliness . " What did you do to John yesterday ? " " Let 's walk along a little further and I 'll tell you , " said Charlie , charging his pistol as he went . He had heard , belowthe streaked furrows of the hill , where they dipped down unseen , a man 's voice speaking to his horse . It was faint . She went before him . The shadow of the woods was dry , the undergrowth spread its tangle of wild blackberry bushes . Then she saw the thickets unclose and what might once have been a road deepen within the old oaks to a wide green glade . She had never before been alone with Charlie . The pistol clicked . " I 'm going to aim at that lone sapling over there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Beyond the dam where the stream in the open sunp199deepened for swimming , there was an old willow . Gnarled in rough gray bark , it leaned , dipping its farthest branches into the stream . The water slid slowly into its shadow , rustled by the trailing touch of silver leaves . There it was confined by roots , narrowed to a small noisy rapid . Betweenit and the bathing pool the bank curved with a thick undergrowth , gray and green screen , willows and alders . The bank was hot . The sun beat upon the near cornfieldand its stroke upon the back was like a slap . I climbed around the trunk of the old gray willow and out on the roots into midstream . The rocks were slippery under foot , coated with a silt like slime . I stepped carefully and sank slowly into the small rushing rapid . Between root and a big stone , I held ; my legs were lifted and flowed with the water , I strained against the stream and felt the noise of the swift coolness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks . Only my palms pressed solid ; all the rest of my body ran with a liquid motion : the ease of water . I rose and again subsided . My legs lost shape , absorbed into a liquid element ; I lay back , until I could feel the touch of the pebbled bed in my shoulders and at the same time , through the uncertain branches see the colorless blue of the sky . Far-off , under the trees , I heard the guttural cry of a lonely green heron . I was alone and around me flowed a cool and tremulous world . I held so still that the reflection of willow leaves formed over my belly . I was lost in the water . " What you doing ? " Morton had come up on the bank . He was shorter than I , compactly built . He tossed a strip of willow bark at me ; it was caught by the water and carried away . I raised my drenched head . " It feels good . Try it . " He came , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , he sank into the water , drifted toward me . His legs went around me , he held on to my back.  |p200Our  thighs rippled together in the stream , touching , covered with water , and under its cool rushing , his ran apart . He was brown . His hands clasped my ribs , his touch was warm ; we clung under water . I looked back into his eyes with silent laughter . I felt his hands released . He was withdrawn upstream . I saw him clamber out dripping . " What 's the matter ? " I laughed . " It 's too much for me . " " Do n't you like it ? " " Yes . But it 's too much for me . " He had a thick stubby nose and wide lips ; a lank lock of brown hair lay on his forehead . I came after him . He had grabbed a stalk of jewel weed . Retreating , he slapped me around the legs . He ran down the bank . Beyond was a pasture , open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up a green weapon of my own . I got in a slap or two , he cut me back . His body was browner than mine . We were both laughing . There was a shot . We stopped to listen . It seemed to come from the woods on the ridge of the pasture . We stood still . We heard another shot and another . Then we walked back slowly . We sat down where the bank was high enough that only our feet were in the water . We dragged the jewel weed and watched its leaves shine wet with silver . But when brought up again into the air , they were dry , with on each leaf a round crystal . I told him about my trip to Hagerstown , but this time I arranged the events so that they contributed to my pride . Afer a while we got dressed and I walked with him back to town . Above the cornfield , a sparrowhawk hung quivering , sustainedby invisible wings in the cruel inane . The sky wasp201a colorless calm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with insects was on the hot dry grass . But more and more she lost all sense of anything solid about her and not even the path was sure whose every step brought her closer to the house . The pasture was a long sultryhaze , from which , once , distinctly was detached a small sand-briar , prickly with yellow berries . The young orchard dissolved in light . Charlie touched her elbow and she was aware of a strong sunburnt hand . The ground was uneven with thick hummocksof grass . He helped her . The way was barred by a gate . She stood aside while he opened it , grasping the rough wooden post . In its burning touch she revived . " I 'll give you a drink when we get to the house . " He swung the gate closed and grasshoppers spread scattering before his steps . She remembered then he had been talking the whole way back . Coming across the lawn she saw the house in a strange calm . Ruddimont rose to unlevel roofs and many chimneys , the four porches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran along the low galleries . Above the trees a little smoke was moving from the summer kitchen . Under the lilac bushes a hound was curled . He dozed in dust and shade . She saw it all in a calm as complete as the July sky which spread over her an illimitable emptiness . She was alone . She straightened her hat , stopping by the boxtrees long enough to catch her breath . She touched her hair , smoothingloose strands . The main porch glazed its columns in white ; behind closed shutters all the house seemed asleep . She took the first step : to climb the steps and cross the porch and go in through the centre window was the most ordinary thing in the world . Yet her throat was tense and it hurt as thoughp202she had screamed . When her hand was on the knob she felt as she had done the first time she stood on a platform , the audience waiting in the pause from which she must begin speaking . She did not look through the panes . She wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Caroline was at her desk . The flowers had been brought in from the hall and from the table rose in a wilderness of sprays and gay summer hues . Nothing else was changed . A beautiful old desk , worn and waxed , it stood high against the wall . No one knew whence it had come , or who had first bought it , though Caroline supposed it had belonged to the old Justice . It was convenient with many drawers ; when unlocked , a panel let down to make a ledge for writing . And when opened , the space behind showed a compartment with its own door , supported on each side by small columns of white marble , disposed in pairs above what appeared to be a miniature Italian piazza . Reflected in mirrors , the squares of dark and light wood , diminishing in size , produced the illusion of two tessellated pavements seen in perspective . The glass was cloudy with age , but when writing it was possible without moving to see some things that went on in the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia did not answer , Caroline turned round . She saw her sunk in a chair , flushed and vacant . " Why , what on earth is the matter ? Did you have an accident ? " " No . It 's nothing . " " I could have told you it would be too hot in the sun . " " Yes , " said Virginia . " It was hot in the sun . " Caroline put her accounts away and turned to a list she was making . Provisions would have to be boughtin town , since the threshers were due next week . She did not notice that Charlie had entered by ' the dining-room door until hisp203hand was on her shoulder and he bent and annoyingly kissed her on the cheek through soft threads of hair . " Where 's the whisky ? " " You forgot to put it away in the sideboard . " Caroline did not look up . " What did you do to Virginia ? " " Do ? " Charlie answered . On the silver tray ice melted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard his heavy tread as he brought fresh water from the cooler . He poured whisky into two glasses . " A little toddy will do you good , Virginia . " " I wish you 'd tell me what happened , " said Caroline . " Happened ? Nothing happened . " He cut the whisky with water and proffered it to Virginia . " It 'll make you feel fine , " he said . He stood over her , it seemed to Virginia he was bearing down upon her . She saw the tawny light in his eyes dark under their long lashes . His skin was burnished and drawn from his brutal mouth . " Take it . It 'll set you up . " " No , no , I do n't want it ! " She cringed before his hard naked hand . Standing above her , he drained the glass he had poured for her , then took up his own and went toward the sofa . He lay down , propping his head among the yellowsilk cushions . Caroline watched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I went to Hagerstown yesterday . If I had n't , we would n't have had this whisky . " He was talking of his trip the day before . She was sorry for him . He was restless even now . He had done what he liked and was not satisfied . She felt it looking at him across the room , in the darkness of his eyes his anguish stilled and yet unsatisfied . What did he want ? Ah , he did not know . And she did not know either . But she knew that if in his suffering she could give it to him , at that mo/ment she gave it with her love . She leaned toward him , across the division of dim air . " If Charlie wants to rest  --  " Aware of Caroline , Virginia straightened in her chair . " Why do n't we go upstairs ? " " To your room , " Virginia assented . " I guess Charlie is tired . " But from the turn of the stairs , Charlie 's voice called his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bust of Juno , with grave blank eyes , serenely smiled . Virginia entered the bedroom alone . When Caroline returned , she saw Virginia staring at the bed . Across its foot , on the counterpane was folded a knitted afghan cover in stripes of violet and heliotrope . The pillows stood stiff and flounced . The shutters were closed . And Caroline said lightly , closing the door , " Charlie says he did scare you . " Virginia 's eyes were startled . " What ? " " Well , he says when he fired the pistol you almost fainted. " " 0 ! " " It 's an old pistol and had n't been fired in a long time . " " Yes , " said Virginia , " but I did n't faint . " She sat down in a chintz lady-chair . " It was more the sun . " " You 've still got your hat on , " said Caroline . " I thought I might as well . " " Well , we wo n't be going for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . She stripped the bed of its Marseilles counterpane and its slept-in sheets . " Why are you doing that ? " " Lordy , I do n't know , " said Caroline . " It 's just that this hot weatherVirginia was aware of this mania of Caroline 's . Since thep205death of her child , she was possessed by the need for a constantlyclean bed . Strangely concentrated , her brow perspiring , she folded the long sheets against her body , sheets that Charlie had rumpled . " There ! " the mattress lay bare . Virginia had heard an angry voice in the dark , coming through open windows from this room . Charlie had stayed here . Remembering , she shrunk within herself and seeing Caroline was humiliated as though she had been struck by a blow . But Caroline 's face was calm as she came from the closet in the hall . Her arms bore fresh piles of white percale . " Why do n't you go and lie down on Charlie 's bed , " she suggested . " Perhaps I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wo n't start until it gets a little cooler . " Caroline remade her own bed . " You will drive me to town , wo n't you ? " " You are fond of me , are n't you , Caroline ? " " Charlie 's coming in later . All you 'll have to do is drop me as soon as we get there . " The door was open between the two rooms . " We ca n't leave for another hour anyhow , " Caroline went on . " You 'd better go in and rest . " " You know I 'd do anything for you . " Virginia rose and came close to Caroline . " I care more for you than any one " I may ask you to take some ribbons out of my underclothes , " said Caroline . " Who 's there ? " It was Rush who rapped . He came to say that Miss Sadie Celona Fenwick was downstairs . " Good Lord ! " Caroline brushed back her fallen hair . " What 's she doing calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laundry to get ready . You stay here , " she said top206Virginia . " Unless you want to hear again what her mother said to General Grant . " " I thought it was General Sheridan who shelled their house . " " 0 , it was one of those old Yankee generals . I never can keep their names apart . I heard them too often when I was a child . " Alone , Virginia went into the smaller bedroom . She was aware faintly of a close must of tobacco and an old odor of leather . At the same time the room had the smell of the summer air and the burnt earth . Charlie 's clothes of the day before hung on a painted chair . The quilt on the bed was patchwork , faded sprigged calicos , stitched on white in a pattern of baskets . She was sorry for Caroline , who must lie in the next room , while night after night , Charlie slept here . " At least something has happened to 41e , " she thought . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shaving case lay Charlie 's gold watch . It was not running . " Strange , how none of the clocks in this house run . " When she wandered back to Caroline 's room she picked up one of the chemises that had been left for her and began plucking out the ribbon from its insertion with a pair of scissors . The motion of her hands quieted her mind . But she could not stand being long alone and went downstairs and stood for a while just outside the door . As Virginia came into the parlor , Miss Sadie Celona paused , a piece of plum cake on the way to her moled mouth , " After all , " she said , " it would be nice to have a Virginia address . " " You know each other , do n't you ? " asked Caroline . " Of course , " Miss Sadie sipped a little blackberry wine under her veil . " I was just saying to Caroline , we are , in this county , the Alsace-Lorraine of America . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Caroline poured her wine . Virginia took a plate and napkin . She was amazed to find that she was hungry . She broke the cake in her fingers . " Of course , if all the men had n't been in the army , they would never have been able to vote this county into the State of West Virginia . If you can call it a State  --  " Miss Sadie Celona precisely munched  --  " because I ca n't . " " More cake , Miss Sadie ? " " No thank you . " " Virginia ? " Virginia ate a second piece of plum cake . " But I will , " said Miss Sadie , " have just a touch more wine . There ! Thank you . I hate to be confused with coal mines . Do n't you ? " " Do you mind , Caroline ? But if we are going into town , I ought to pack . " " Virginia 's not very well today , " Caroline explained . " 0 , " said Miss Sadie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , " said Virginia . " Just a touch of sun . " Miss Sadie Celona smiled indulgently from a moled mouth . " No matter how hot it is , Floride and I just make sure we are well protected by our veils and then we do n't mind the sun . I 'll excuse you , my dear . " She watched Virginia out of the door . " Is she a special friend of yours ? " " No , " said Caroline . " I 've known Virginia a long time . I 'm very fond of her . But I would n't say she was a special friend . Why ? " " 0 , nothing ! " said Miss Sadie : " I just wondered . " As she lay on Charlie 's bed , she stared at the ceiling on which the shadows of the shutters were reflected in dim light and wondered how , when they came out of the woods , he could have been so casual . And she wondered now howp208long it had been , for as her sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to her impossiblethat she should still be in the same day and she longed suddenly for a clock to tell her how many minutes had been mechanically ticked since she came into the house and into this room . Somewhere she heard a sound as of a clock swaying its pendulum and soberly counting its seconds . Then she knew that she had imagined this sound and in the silence she looked toward the shutters closed on the sun . Now there was a noise and it came from the bathroom . Behind the thin door was some one . She started up and saw that it was closed only by a latch . She listened and as she put her feet to the floor knew that her body was warm and bleeding . In Caroline 's room , she snatched the scissors from the chintz chair where she had left them on the crumpledchemise . Then , twisting her arms , she drove the blades , between the latch and the bathroom door . There was no doubt of it now . Some one was there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened . She heard the door of the bathroom rattle as it was tried . " Caroline ! " she called from the stairs . " What ever is the matter ? " Caroline came on bare feet in a flowered kimono . " It 's time for you to get ready . We ought to be leaving in a few minutes now . " When she found the scissors wedged between the latch and door of the bathroom , she wondered who on earth had been fool enough to put them there . But Virginia-was then in the room where she had spent the night . " I would n't , " said Caroline as they drove down through the woods , " say anything about being frightened . I 'm sorry , I 'm awfully sorry . But I would n't say anything if I were you . " Virginia was driving , " I wo n't . " " I thought you would n't . " Caroline was convinced thatp209Virginia was falling in love with Charlie . " You must come again soon , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were on the pike , suddenly she said , " you know what I 'd like to do ? Let 's stop at the Benjafields ' and pay a call . I have n't been there in a year of Sundays . "  |p210AND  in the dark the earth lay immense and warm under an oppressive sky . And the breath was close that came through the window of the bedroom , the low sash propped from the sill by a stick . And she felt the night with a closenessof terror , as the last footsteps in the street died down and there was left only the intent stillness of the untrod pavement and the town that slept . She heard then the shudderingof leaves . For a while there was the arclight at the corner and in its pallor she could see the squares of panes and against the blind the shadow of overhanging branches . Then the sill darkened . She heard from the side toward the garden the night wake in the dry sounds of insects . The earth had lain long under drouth and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . The garden was burnt and strummed its blackness , loud with insect wings . She lay dull and sleepless . There was no thought in that oppression of night . Only under her shoulders she felt the dry brittleness of twigs and the bruising of dead wood ' leaves ; as she lay on the bed , under her was the living grass . They were in the woodland glade and the night pressed her down ; Charlie lay close over her . His breath was hot and the night pressed her round . She was aware of his face as it had leaned down on her in the woods , flushed and angry with blood . He had trembled , his eyes were sightless , his voice uncontrolled . She had been more frightened had he not been so like a selfish child . All the time she had known what was going to happen to her , she had known it was happening , but she  |p211had  no force to prevent it . Even now , she did not know how it had come into being , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countenance contract and his pain , and lying on the sheets , in the hot night strumming with insects , felt again his collapse into a serious lifelessness like stone . It was the thunder had waked her . She could not have slept . She was sure now she could not have slept . She was dazed . Sudden lightning widened the room , set a black chair distinct against the window . The heat was not less in the following darkness . She lay inert with fear . In a flash of lightning again the dark face leaned over her , charged with desire . She shuddered under the weight of t4 e night , and overwhelmed saw the curtains blown inward from the window and the sill and the downhanging branches of maples a livid green . In the rumbling of the clouds , she shivered as in a chill , in the hot night , shook . She was trembling all over as in a chill , she could not stop her teeth from chattering . The thunder came closer . It did not happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She retraced her steps , going again along the path of the dusty pasture , alongside the rail fence . She kept saying , Now at this point we stopped , I turned , I did not go on . And again a few feet further , No , it was here ; here I could still stop and say , " Let 's go back . It 's the sun . I 'm faint . I must go back . " Yet always she had gone on , and again past the cornfield , the small stalks stunted by drouth , and the dwindling rows descending with the hill and across the far sunburnt slope , a thick clump of cedars and a yellow house . And again she stood and saw the sapling splinter its bark and singing the second bullet struck in far lightning . And she could still turn . But she had gone on in the rumbling thunder . In the dark she entered the thicket . She felt her forehead so constricted that she thought , Ip212must be going mad . It was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually to press in the frontal bones . She sat up controlling her body , to stop the chatteringof her teeth . She no longer shook . Even in her shivering , she had not been cold . She was conscious now not only of the warmth of the soft caressing air of night , but of a warm flowing . She was sure of blood . The trees hushed on the window ; insects no longer grated the silence with their wings . She lay back on the bed , in dulled acquiescence . She let the night lie on her . Closing her eyelids she felt on her body the immense close weight of the night . And once more she entered the thicket . She did not stop . She went in under the dark trees alone and Charlie followed her . She could have stopped , but his footstep was behind her , crackling a twig . And she lay in dread acquiescing ; she felt him again in the oppression of the air . Under the hot breath of the night , heaving , she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not escape . In spite of herself , struggling , she held him , could not let him go , while all the heavy oppressions of the clouds bore down on her , the weight of a sky that could not rain . She screamed in a flash of lightning , No ! It could not happen . It filled the room , flooding the eyelids she had closed , she felt him , No , it could not happen ! And the branches lifted and threshed in the wind . Clouds rolled in close thunder . The night came down in violent rain . Awake , she lay under the pelted roof . I can go away somewhere . Then she knew she could never escape him , that she carried his crime within her . It was she , not the assailant now , who was covered with blood . Her torture had gone on a long time . The downpour was brief . The lightning came now- in faint flashes . She kept thinking back to the morning . She stood out of bed.  |p213She  lit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then went out into the hall , on bare feet listening at her aunt 's door . Beyond hers was Mrs. Hufflebower 's room , and through the pine panels she heard her snoring . Downstairs there were no clocks until she came to the kitchen . It was twenty-five past three . And she thought , It was only thirteenhours ago . Then I was free . She came back to her own room and closed the door . Virginiawas reflected in the glass over the bureau . She saw her arms bare from the nightgown . Under it were the underclothesshe had worn all day . She did not remember . She could have sworn she had changed them after her bath . Virginia bowed her head in the mirror , her body stood straight , then , her gown fluttering , she crouched over the clothes on the floor . But could she hide them ? She dared not touch them . Where ? Her aunt was ill and could not come into the room . She had already told Mrs. Hufflebower . She could not go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a child . Almost calmly she thought , If it is done , I must count the consequences . Strangely she explored her body , holding with her hands under the gown her own small breasts . For it was strange now and in cambric naked . An elbow was scraped . Regardingherself with detachment in the lamplight , she put her hand on the soft space under the ribs ' division . The rain had ceased . Her eyes were pleading in the mirror . It could not have happened to me , she thought , and in an instant was taken in a numbness of fright . She found the bed and sat there , faint . It was cooler now . Already from the garden came the first small , querulous calls of birds . In the graying dawn she put out the lamp . She was in pain . It was not her pain she crouched over , but the day through which she had come to this night . As it faded she  |p214saw  the chairs stand out in the dusky morning and slowly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first clatter of the street , she shut her eyes , on the tired yellow pillow tired for sleep.  |p215MY  mother marketed in the morning , stopping along Washington Street to see what was in the stores , ordering her provisions for the day . An hour or so later they were delivered . Wagons would drive up , the boy leap out and carrying the load on his arm , peering with a perky face at whatever was on - the porch , pass around the house and through the arbor to the back door . In summer there was the garden . She had less to buy . She made no plan , but bought from the choice of fruit dis-playedon the sidewalk in wooden flats and spail baskets under the warm awnings , from meat brought from the cool interior of the shop by the butcher and laid before her on the counter . She saw him cut it , white and bloody jacketed , black gauntleted , while she waited under the engraving of the Allied Generals and Their Staffs before Sebastopol which spread its wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put on the scales it was weighed , trimmed , wrapped and her name written on it . Almost always she forgot something , in the gossiping on the street corners . And she would have to go back . I have known her to make as many as three trips , reminded by Ginny . That morning she had again gone out after a last purchase . I had been at Ruddimont on Friday . This was the followingMonday . The bell rang . I went to the door and saw Virginia Crannock . She was in white and had lowered her parasol . She wore the same wide hat I had seen at Ruddimont , but now on its wide stiff straw brim were large silk roses , crushing their petals from crimson to pale . " Is your mother in ? "  | " No , she 's gone downstreet . But she ought to be back in a minute . " " Then I 'll wait . " This was a usual hour for calls in the summer . So I thought nothing of it when she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked around the room slowly as a person might who was taking leave . I stood . Then she came back to me with the same grave eyes and said , " Have n't you got my Shelley ? " Embarrassed , I said I had , for she had given it to me long before . " I should n't ask for it , " she said . " But it 's Mary Shelley 's edition and it belonged to my father . " My mother came across the porch . Virginia rose to greet her . " I have come to see you . But after what has happened I suppose you will never want me to come here again . " Her manner was still grave . In my bedroom , I was angry , seeing the gap in the shelves where the Shelley had been . I closed it with a black thickboundCatlin . Honest , I suppose , in most things , I was unscrupulous about books . The Catlin had been a loan when I was twelve and I had held on to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , not reading . It was too dull . And around me in a frieze were the faces of stern Indian chiefs framed in bright red cartridgepaper . I had tacked them on the wall the winter before I was fourteen . I could remember the delight with which they once filled me , their fierce headcrests and porcupinebreastplates . All the color was gone from the mats . And their faces were stupid . They were utterly unromantic . I could see nothing in them now but dull brutishness . I determined to return the borrowed Catlin to its owner . But the Shelley was a gift . I was sure of that . And I could not understand why she was asking for it back . Yetp217that was what Virginia had done . I turned the volumes in my hand ; they were old and the hoards stained . They could certainly not have any great value . Thus on the wayMask after mask fell from the countenance And form of all ; and long before the dayWas old , the joy , which waked like heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And some grew weary of the ghastly dance , And fell , as I have fallen , by the wayside ; Those soonest from whose forms most shadows passed , And least of strength and beauty , did abide . " Then , what is life ? " I criedI hated to give them up . Trying to say to myself I could not have heard her , I went downstairs . With the three stained volumes I stood in the doorway to the sitting room . My mother 's face was dazed with confusion . She held herself tight , as she did , I knew , when anything beyond her possible control came to trouble her . " That is my only hope , " said Virginia . Her back was to me ; I could not see her face , but the tip of her parasol slowly marked the carpet . " As far as I can see , that is my only hope . " " Well , you know , " said my mother . " You 'll have to decidefor yourself . You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulous in her tone ; but she had composed her countenance . I knew that she was struck ; her dark eyes as she looked at Virginia seemed to tremble on tears and to hold them back she made herself sullen . Her hair was gray at the sides . " You 'll have to say what you are going to do . " " Well , something will have to be done , " said Virginia.  | " Because if it all comes out , I wo n't have people thinking I was a party to the crime . " " Here 's John , " said my mother . I came into the room . " Plato , " Virginia looked up at me . " You know why he was called Plato ? He was the broad-browed . I think we 'll have to call you Plato . " " Here are your books , " I said . " Thank you . " She was grave and decided as she rose to go , the three stained books pressed under her thin white sleeve . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Ithought it only right to let some one in the family know . " She shook hands with both of us . My mother stood bythe screen door until Virginia had left the path . " What did she say ? " I pleaded . " I do n't know . Wait . We 'll see . " She went back into the house . There was a closet under the staircase ; unlocking it , she procured a dusty bottle of French brandy . " Your Uncle Charlie gave me this , " she said , " against an hour of need . Well , I think the hour of need has come . " That evening Charlie stopped at the house . My mother was lying down and would not see him . " We are threshing tomorrow , " he said . " Do n't you want to come out ? " " I 'll ask mamma . " Her room was darkened , the pillow under her head wet and crushed . She held a small green bottle to her nostrils . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she moaned , " go ahead . Go , if you want to . "  |p219THAT  morning was awake with a whir of threshing . And even before I went to the barn in the sound I could see the floors scattered deep in chaff and the men trampling . Two men pitched in the mows . The doors were wide . The air was stifling with dust while the sheaves incessantly were heaved , tossed into the whirling maw of the machine . The barn was strange . There was a burnt smell of oil added now to the familiar odors of cobwebs among dry rafters and old harness and the underground rich stench of ammoniacstalls . The wheat rained from a spout into sacks ; a man stood and tied them and as each sack was lifted away marked it on a board , keeping the count in white chalk . Charlie at breakfast smelt of sweat . The veins stood out on his forehead , and faded blue sleeves were rolled on his burnt arms . He had been up since dawn . And now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a man broke his arm . " " Who ? " Caroline asked . " I do n't know . One of the men came with the machine . He was standing on the mow and slipped . It was a damn fool thing , he might have had a fall . But it was n't more'n five feet . " Caroline asked where he was and was told at the tenant farmer 's . " We were short of help as it was , " he finished . It was so all day . The roof of the barn seemed to press a dusty and suffocating heat among the men . They lost their tempers as the morning wore on . There were fights at the water bucket . Outside , in the sun , the air shook with a subtle vibration continually mounting from the hard earth . Charlie wasp220everywhere on his long strides , stopped in the barn and swore , his voice overcome in the huge purring of the thresher . He was at his happiest then . Flushed by the sun , sweating , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm was quickened that one day to excitement in the threshing . I had been told off to keep water in the buckets , cool from the spring . I went back and forth , carrying water , setting it down just inside the door , shifting the long tin dipper . There was always chaff in the old bucket . And the fresh water tasted of rust . In the kitchen were three extra women , shining in black sweat . They moved avoiding the side of the stove , wiping their foreheads with damp sleeves . By eleven the trestles were set with long boards and covered with checked cloths . The men ate under the trees , crouching from low benches . Rush carried the cider pitcher , never stopping in his round of emptied glasses . The hands themselves passed the platters of corn and fried shoulder , dishes of Lima beans , tomatoes in vinegar , mashed potatoes , baked yams . Pickles were shoved from place to place and three kinds of preserves . Two of the negresses went back and forth carrying more from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's drunk , " said Charlie to me , " but for God 's sake do n't let Caroline know . I 've got enough as it is . " Now I remembered I had seen him a little after nine o'clock sneaking around the corner of the barn . When he came on me it was abruptly , with a wicked glance . His eyes were bloodshot . He went toward the corn shed . The negresses came now with pies . The men at the long trestles wiped their plates clean . Almost filled , they lifted the cut portions out on a knife and ate more slowly . In the afternoon the belt broke . It was taken off to be mended with clinches . The machine stopped . The menp221stood around or came over to the water bucket and took turns at the dipper . They stunk in the heat of the strange stillness . The barn no longer throbbed . And swallows flew in through the wide doors and - swooped about the dusky mows . The silence was oppressive . Charlie was behind the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt . Rush turned into the barn . He stared , his eyes wide , not seeing Charlie . " Where 's he at ? " he asked me . I pointed . Under Rush 's yellowish skin was a pale corruptionof fear . " Go over an ' tell him , " he whispered . " Tell him to come . " " What about ? " " You tell him to come , you tell him he got to come to de house . Quick . " I walked over to Charlie and repeated the message . " Who is it ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " Well then , tell him to go to hell whoever he is . " They were putting the last of the clinches into the belt . I told Rush he would have to wait . " No , listen , John , he ca n't . It 's Mr. Tom Slaughter . " " What of it ? He can wait . " " Boy , do n't you know he 's the constable ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could only think he had got himself into some scrape and that now the sheriff had come to arrest him . His mouth shook . " Uh-huh , I knew it . They 've come to get you . " That was what I thought . But Rush took me by the sleeve and drew me out of the barn . " ' Deed to Gawd , John , it ai n't me . I swear it ai n't . You go an ' tell Mister Charlie they come for him . "  |p222I  went back to Charlie but said nothing . I waited until the belt was once more on the wheel and the trembling machine started to whir and absorb its sheaves . I spoke high against the noise . He seemed not to hear me . He stood watching the dull red sides of the hopper whence the paint was worn . Then he shouted to me , " Who is it ? " " Tom Slaughter . " He wiped the sweat from his forehead . I followed him to the house . The constable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see you threshing . Got a good crop as usual ? " He was ' a heavy-set man , his red face lagged in great jowls . " Well , I got sad news for you , Charlie . Maybe we 'd better go in the house . " We entered through a long window . Tom Slaughter lifted a palm-leaf fan from the wing chair as he sat down . " If you 'd rather I would n't read it now ? " He looked at me . " Go on , " said Charlie . " When you 've got a secret , it wo n't keep . " " I 've got a paper for you . In fact , " he took his glasses from a leather case and pinched them on his perspiring nose , then heaved to one side and brought out his bill-fold , " in fact , this is a warrant for your arrest . " He read against a harsh and heavy breath . When he came to the end , Charlie demanded to see it . " Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in it . Not a thing on the face of the world . " " Well , you 'll know better than I how serious it is . But you 'll have to go with me . " " I could n't come into town tonight ? " " No . The charge is too serious . I 've got my car here . " " I wish that bitch had held off another two cloys . " Charlie bit his lip . " I never touched her . At least , well , yesp223I did . She got scared , I fired off my pistol a couple of times and I put my arm around her and held her . I thought she was going to faint . " The heavy man seemed to live only in his excess of heat . Legs crossed , looking up at Charlie , he began again plying his palm-leaf fan . Sweating in discomfort , he sighed . " You heard what he read , " Charlie said , " Virginia Crannock'scharged me with assaulting her . " He spoke with annoyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . " She makes me sick . " " It 's enough to make a man sick , " the constable breathed . " You 'll have to take over . I 'll give you the money to pay the hands with . If there 's anything you do n't know , go to Blain . He owns the threshing machine . And he 's an honest cuss , I reckon you can depend on him . " He was sweating now more than if he had been in the sun . " My automobile is out there , " said the thick man . " Down the road apiece . I did n't want to raise any more commo-tion . " " All right , " and Charlie fetched his hat from the hall . " I wish you were older , " he said to me . " I 'd tell you to give Toplady a good hard kick for me in the morning . When he sobers up . If he does . He 's been drunk when we were threshing . " Slaughter sat fat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thick crossed thighs . His red cheeks steamed . " I 'm ready , " said Charlie . " Do n't you want to see your wife ? " " You still have bail in this county , do n't you ? " " You 'd better see your wife . I 'll be waiting for you . " We sat in the ticking of a clock while Charlie was gone . One window only was open . The other two had closed shutters and darkened the room against the heat . Slaughter stirred his slow fan . His face almost drowsed . " Charlie 's a good farmer andp224it makes a man sick . " And again he said , somnolent on his fan , " I 'm mighty sorry . I have known his father and I have known Charlie since he was nothing but a boy growingup . I have held that boy on my knee . " He heaved his huge bulk from the wing chair . Charlie was there . He turned over to me the money for the threshers and gave me his instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , let 's go ! I 've told her . She wants to go into town with me . " I looked up and saw Caroline on the stairs . She came down , putting on white gloves . Washed , they were shrunken and too short in the fingers . " I want to hear this warrant , " she said to Slaughter , and stood there soberly , stroking back the wrinkled fingers of her silk gloves . " Is that all ? " she asked when he flared an old handkerchief and wiped his forehead . " Yes , ma'am . " Slaughter breathed like a bulldog . " Mr. Marston says there 's nothing to it . " She said it in that tone which she used to the servants when they came to her complaining . " Have you got room in your car ? " " Yes , ma'am . " They went out together . " It 's down here a piece , " said Slaughter . " What time is it ? " asked Caroline . " Do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on toward four , " said Charlie . " I 'll be back tonight , " said Caroline to me in the door . She carried her big black handbag with the metal clash twisted like swans ' necks . He waited below the steps , light and alert , for the slow , breathing constable . A golden light swam on the circle of grass . Cicadas rattled their wings with a dry sound in the trees . Charlie upswung his arm as , from the level road , the three of them disappeared into the woods.  |p225I  waited some time on the stoop . Then I went to the barn and was grateful for the deafening noise and the dusty and chaff-filled air . I stood close to Blain . It was twilight when the threshing was done and I turned my money into his hands . Then I did something of which I was afterward ashamed . I walked away from the house and toward the hill above the run . But already it was dark in the high woods . I stayed outside the thickets , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the run . I made my way back to town and let myself into the house . My mother had not returned . It was then I knew that I was hungry and went into the kitchen to try to find something to eat . I could not have spent the night at Ruddimontwith Caroline . That night there was a crowd of men about the jail . And from sunup they were again there . Curiosity brought most , but some talked of tearing Charlie away from the jailkeepers . The largest group was on the opposite corner , by the court house . Tom Toplady moved among them . He grinned . When any one proposed that they ought to take the law into their own hands and not wait for a hearing , he nodded his head . He kept a secret but knowing air . It was an hour or more after Charlie had been arraigned in the magistrate 's court before they dispersed into twos and threes and began unhitching their horses . By this time it was known that the court would not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into her aunt 's bedroom . The last twilight was in the windows . A small Aladdin 's lamp was lighted and threw its pallor over the bedside , through a white opaque globe . The old lady was quite still , she was wrinkled and her thin gray hair drawn tightly back from her face , her skin as yellow as a chicken 's legs . Her eyelids were closed . Virginia could not tell whether she slept or not . No breathing disturbed the counterpane and had not one of the old lady 's hands lying there twitched , she might have supposed she had died since lighting of the lamp . At the foot of the bed lay an Afghan cover . She shut the door and an instant stood in the dark hall in a desperation of doubt . In a half hour the stores would be closed . There was no telephone in her aunt 's house . She told Mrs. Hufflebower she was going out and to leave the front door unlocked . Down the side street , beyond the next corner , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Dermott was ill , he could not see anybody . The voice that told her was a high tremulous drawl , she asked if it was the maid . " Yas 'm . " Virginia looked back into the lighted shop ; the thin bald German baker was leaning across the counter , bespectacled , making up his books for the day . " Tell him it 's urgent , " she plead into the telephone . " Tell him it 's Miss Virginia Crannock and I must see him . " The word came back soft , polite and trembling after a long wait , " The doctor say he too sick to see you , Miss Virginia . He say if you tell him where you is , he come top227see you in the mawnin ' . Yas 'm , yas 'm . He 's sick . He ca n't see nobody . No 'm . Nobody a-tall . " Virginia hung up the receiver . The baker would not take money . He put out his lights when she had gone . The courthouse clock struck nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already blocked along Washington Street . After Virginia passed the Presbyterian Church the leafy shadows of maples were scattered on her white silk parasol . She rang the bell and was admitted by the colored maid and led through the waiting room and at once into Doctor Dermott 's office . He lay on a couch of imitation leather . " Sit down , Virginia , they told me you were coming , sit down ! " His eyes were sightless ; no light shone in them , one lower than the other . They lay dark in pouches of skin that wrinkled and ran sagging over his face , to droop on his mouth , which was slightly twisted . " I 'm glad to see you , my dear . I 've always been very fond of you . " His voice clawed at her . It was an affected voice which concealed something . " In fact , I have always loved you , Virginia . You understand ? " It was soft and clawing , his voice had no life in it . He dropped his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and seedy . " I 've come to see you about something , " Virginia said , pointing her parasol along the floor . " I want to know  --  " " Yes , yes , I know , it 's the old complaint . You want to know , my dear  --  " He twitched his nose and lying on his back ran his hands through his loose and bulging pockets . " I have been assaulted . And I want to know what I have to fear . " Doctor Dermott wriggled on his couch . There was al/most an animation in the pouches about his eyes . But no light shone in them . " You mean ? " " I mean what I say . I want to know what the results will be . " " You ? Yes , yes . I understand . " Once again his hands went through his pockets . He was apparently unaware when they came out sprinkling tobacco to lay a pipe , a package of cigarette papers and a box of matches on the floor . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I want you to tell me the worst I have to face . " " I know . " He sank back on the couch and lay for some minutes completely inert . It was his hands that first moved . " I know what you want . An examination . " " Yes , " said Virginia . " But it 's no use . Who was it ? " " Charlie Marston . " The couch curved to hold his head . " Charlie Marston , " he repeated distantly . " But that 's grave . That 's very grave , my dear . " " I know it , " said Virginia . " Yes , yes . You know I 've known you a long time , Virginia . You were just a young girl when I first knew you . You remember the time I found you walking along the street with Shakespeare under your arm ? You remember ? " . yes . " " And I told you  --  I could see your enthusiasm for Shakespeare , and I remember I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay any attention to him . That 's a long time . I 'm an old man now . But what do you think about it ? Was I right ? " She sat dazed with fear . On a shelf above the door was a row of steins and odd-shaped bottles . The room had a sweetish odor that was not all disinfectant . The chairs were stained mission oak . Beside the bookshelves , in which Casa-  |p229nova  's Memoirs sank against the Practice of Obstetrics and Margaret of Navarre pressed on Diseases of the Bladder , were white scales . On the table a white enamelled pan dripped with something . On top the china closet , stained to mahogany , which held surgical instruments , was a couple in bronze , young and dancing , in a costume vaguely Spanish . One was a girl and the other at first sight a boy ; then it was seen that in spite of his cocked hat and spangled breeches , his breasts under the short coat were high and pointed . She saw these things with her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as they reached , his eyes unseeing , and brought up the materials from the floor and rolled a cigarette , turning it in soft uncertain fingers . " Was I right ? " he said . And she answered , " Then you wo n't examine me ? " And she saw his hands , mottled , in which the veins were more important than the bones . " What 's the use ? There ai n't a man on God 's earth could tell you . You 'll have to wait . " " When ? " " Well , after two months , I might make a guess . That 's all anybody can do . But you wo n't know . ' She saw those hands and was relieved that they would not touch her . She would not have to lie on the couch where he was lying and have him over her , his hands pryingher naked flesh . " I 've had my literary ambitions , " he said . " I 've always admired you . Yes , Virginia , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , you remember the time I read you my Dream of the Amazon ? Yes , I potter on . Your father was a writer . So I always thought you would understand me . I 'd like to show you . " She remembered only his hands and sat dazed while he dragged himself from the couch and took from one of thep230drawers of the desk a folder of buff paper . He flared the typescript before her . " That 's the way to have it printed . Did you ever see anything that looked more professional ? " It was in red , green and black inks . " Back , back , Back from the altar of the divine Aphrodite , implacable goddess ! Back Ye ruffians and ye fat-heads ! " Wait ! " He picked up a stub of pencil from the desk . " That , " he corrected , " should be wreathed fat-heads . ' You see how I work along . Whenever I have a little time . " ThisIs holy ground . Back ! Back ! Back ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and backed himself toward the couch of imitation leather . He collapsed exhausted , his breath gone . He was like an old seedy actor backstage after a scene that has been too much for him . " But I 've had my living to make . I 've had  --  well , you see I was n't like your father . I did n't inherit a rich farm . And you see I 've had a lot of pain in my life . You know that , do n't you ? I 've had to  --  " he clawed the air  --  " get in a few dollars . I 've had to alleviate the sufferings of others . " He sat fatuous on the couch , his eyes sunken in , pouched , without light . The whole town knew that Doctor Dermott encouraged the use of narcotics . And there had long been a rumor that he drugged himself . " I 've always been very fond of you , Virginia . And I want you to know what I 've accomplished . You remember the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . That was what ? Twenty years ago . " Virginia remembered . He insisted on one more passagep231from the play . He began magniloquently with a long stage direction . She did not listen . Yet from time to time a line came into her hearing , she remembered hearing it , for he had read the play to her when she was seventeen . Nothing had been changed , he had pretended to himself that all the time he was writing , but there was not a line she had not heard . She was in a daze of horror , not listening , knowingonly that it had been twenty years since she was seventeen . Doctor Pasmore was much briefer with her when she called on him Monday afternoon . " This is a matter not for the cloth but the robe . " Virginia seemed not to understand . " If he assaulted you , as you say he did , then you have nothing on your conscience . And I could only pretend to advise you if it were a case of conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then you had better see him . " Then he conducted her , rather insistently , to the door . The next afternoon Charlie had been arrested at Ruddimont.  |p232A  COLORED man named Richard Hewes was driving along the pike in a stickwagon . He worked on the farm of a Mr. MacDowell , just over the Virginia line . He led stallions all over the adjoining counties in the spring of the year and later collected the fees for his employer , the owner . He could n't recollect afterward just when this was . But it was the time people generally commence plowing for wheat . So it must have been three or four weeks after Charlie Marston was arrested . He was coming along the pike in the afternoon and when they turned into the dirt lane , a young white farmer overtook him . He let him in front . Young Jones was joggingalong in a buggy and a bay mare and the black man drove behind him , just jogging along in a stickwagon . They started talking . " Say , Mr. Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Charlie Marston ? " " If I had my way with him , I 'd lynch him . " " I been hearing about it . " They stopped at Ambrose Jones ' gate down there where his man was plowing and his horses were in the field . " Where you on your way to , Dick ? " " I 'm just going over here to collect some stallion fees . Mr. Marston now , there was certainly a gentleman what liked spirited horses . " " You still up in Clarke ? " " Yes , sir , I 'm mostly farmhand . I 'm still with Mr. Mac-Dowell . " " Tom MacDowell used to work here as a boy . But that was before I can rightly recollect . "  |p233Later  the negro approached Mr. MacDowell . They were baling hay . He told him what the young farmer had said . " You think he 's guilty ? " " Mr. Marston ? That what they say . " " Well , Dick , do n't you say anything about this to any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what people will say if a nigger begins to talk . " " That 's right , boss . " " I 've heard a lot . And you 've heard a lot all over the county . And I do n't believe it . How in the name of God Almighty could he do it ? " " That 's right , boss . That sure is right . " " A man ca n't rape a woman without knocking her un-conscious . " " That 's right . Now you talking ! " " Well , do n't you talk . Because you know what people say about you anyhow , that you are one talking mouthy nigger . You keep out of it . " Garland Spotts walked over to Rolfe Norton , who was hitching his horse in the street that runs alongside the courthousegrounds . " Hi , Mr. Norton . " " Howdydo , Golly . What you doing down this way ? " " I come down on account of the sale of that Cooper property at the courthouse . " " Cooper property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He was a youngish farmer , who came of what were called good plain people . He wore a blue serge coat and trousers confined in canvas leggins . His open shirt was denim . He wore no tie . " Hot enough for you ? " asked Norton . He was also a farmer , but he wore a tie . He was from what was consideredin the county a good family.  | " Dogged if it ai n't . You ai n't going over to see Charlie Marston , are you ? " " No , " said Norton . He looked toward the jail . " They got your friend in there . Dogged if they ai n't . " " Well , " said Norton , " I do n't know that he 'll be there any longer than court meets . " " You do n't think so ? " " That woman ai n't got any case , " said Norton angrily . " Well , " Spotts drawled , " looks to me like he 's in a bad fix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad woman , she must be , or she would n't have brought the charge . Why man alive , if she 'd been a good decent Christian woman she 'd have rather gone down to her grave with nobody knowing her secret but her and her Gawd . " Spotts saw he was getting hot under the collar . " I do n't know nothing about it . I do n't know nothing about the case at all . I was n't at the hearing . " He looked at the other cautiously . " But I understand the judge refused him bail . " " Of course . He was a damn fool to ask for bail in the first place . Charlie Marston will lie about some things , but dammit , he 's not lying about that . I do n't say there 's not something to it . But whatever was done to that woman was done with her consent . " " I do n't know a thing about it , " said Spotts . " I never had anything against him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " ' Ere 's a awful lot of people here down on him . " " I 'd damn well move that case away if I was him . " " If he 's guilty , he ought to be punished , " Spotts maintained . " Who said he 's guilty ? I would n't believe that woman onoath , I would n't . Not if she swore on a stack of Bibles . " " I do n't know , " said Spotts , " she comes of a mighty goodp235family . I do n't believe she 'd a brought that charge unless it was true . " " Listen , " said Norton . " I 'm a friend of Charlie Marston 's . Always have been and always will be . I used to go out there to his hunting parties . Yes , sir . And I 'm with him . I 'm with him . I 'm going right up there to the jail to see him now . I 've been there three times already and anybody wants to know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care who knows it . " " If he 's guilty , he ought to be punished . " " Guilty ? Guilty ? You know what he said to me ? Right there in the jail . Yes , sir , right there in the jail cell . You know what he said ? He was sitting there on that old iron cot . He said Rolfe , there 's one thing . She wo n't come here and tell me I raped her . She wo n't do it . Not to my face . She ca n't do it . ' Does that sound guilty ? If it was me , I 'd damn well move the case away from here . " " Dogged if it ai n't hot ! " said Spotts mildly . " You think it 's hot here ! " Norton was perspiring all over his face . The sweat ran down his red neck which was creased all over with paler cracks . " It 's not hot here at all . You do n't know nothing  --  nothing about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western states there it 's been so dry and the earth 's so burnt up and the grasshoppers are so bad this summer , you know what they 've done ? Why , everything 's burnt up by the dry weather , the crops are all burnt up , everything 's burnt up but the grasshoppers and there are so many of those they 're catching ' em and filling the cornhouses with ' em to feed the cattle this winter ! " " That 's a new one on me . I never heard anything like that . Never ! " " Well , I told you . We do n't know anything about hot weather around here . Nothing at all . You understand ? Nothing at all . " He wiped his face and neck with his handkerchief . Hotlyp236he went off toward the jail , mounted the stoop , rang the bell and stood there where everybody could see . " Well , all I 've heard around here is people talking about Mr. Marston and saying he raped Miss Crannock . Time and time again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stale and mouldy hall was not what I had thought of as a jail . It was dark , with a straight pine stair-rail ; the flowers on the wall seemed to have rotted , while the paper was still new , in a dank discouragement . They gave off , as I mounted after Clopper 's hobbling leg the steep carpeted stairs , a faded succession of domestic odors . The assistant sheriff , who kept the jail , had done well for himself . Whether , as my grandfather used to say , the Clopper blood was tainted , I do n't know ; Courtney had a limp as he walked before me in the upper hall . The one window let the afternoon sun through curtains of imitation lace and was banked with rubber plants , potted geraniums and in one tub a night-blooming cereus . It may be his game leg had made him , for it had brought him from the old Clopper place to town , and he now ruled Mordington , whoever might be mayor , since he controlled every election . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byington , who could creep into corners where Clopper , now that his children were grown and he aspired to respectability , could no longer go . Byington , whom he kept alive , repaid him , in votes , mostly disreputable . Neither of them spent much money . The Clopper power depended on button-holing . Courtney was on the street all day Saturday , limping after farmers ; he let no one go until he had his promise for the polls . A good liar and a born politician , he worked through persuasion , and the town voted his way not so much because of anything he said as his constantly saying it . Without his approval , any cause was lost before it came to election . This jail had been built after years of campaigning . Per- haps he thought , as he talked , more of his children than of the prisoners who would occupy it . One of his daughters was studying to be a teacher , the other was training as a nurse ; George I had come to know , swimming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with surprise than with pride at its walls as he stopped to pinch off a dead geranium leaf . " I reckon you did n't expect to find Charlie here . " He swung his weight from his game leg and paused outside the door . His keys were slung on a leather thong over his shoulder . " This is my daughter Annie 's room . I put him in here . It did n't seem quite right to leave him down there with all them niggers . " He did not exactly wink at me , but his expression was one of sly confidence . " She 's away now at normal school . " He unlocked the door and held it for me . I went wonderinginto a small bedroom . Charlie , his knees drawn up under the bedclothes , had propped himself with pillows against the headboard . " Hi there ! " He laid his book down . " I reckon you know who this is . " Clopper waited until I had spoken to my uncle , then by the bedside he said loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu . He has had to have very special care . " " 0 , he 's all right , " Charlie assured him . The assistant sheriff glanced at me , still not winking , puffing his pipe , with an amused air of risking his confidence . His face was rank with smoke . " Then I reckon I can leave you all to do your talking . " He closed the door and Charlie recovered his book . " This Shelley guy 's no good . Listen at this  --  " He read aloud from Adonais , and for all his misprision his voice had a sound of excited discovery . " He was a fairy . I tell you , the man that wrote that had something wrong with him . But Byron , now , he was all right . " He let the volume slide to thep239floor and reached for another across the counterpane . " You want some candy ? " There was a box of chocolates open on the chair beside the bed . When he read from Cain it was with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen him open a book before and said so . " Well , I 've never been in jail before either . What am I going to do ? " " Where did you find them ? " " On the shelf there . I found them and Bill Nye 's Joke Book . I had heard about Byron and Shelley all my life , but I had never read ' em . So I thought I might as well . " He took another chocolate . " It 's like candy . You 'd think they might give me bail , but they wo n't . Not now anyhow . I reckon I might have read more at the University . But then that was the one chance I ever had to go in for serious drinking . We used to start the first thing in the morning and by the time I 'd found out where my books were I was too pie-eyed to see print . I do n't remember now that I had any books , but I reckon I must have . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go across the hall and get the fellow that lived there to come in and find ' em for me . They were right under the chair where I 'd dropped ' em the night before . If it had n't been for him I 'd had to walk around naked as a fish until I sobered up . I stayed at that two years . Did n't even chase the girls enough to mean anything . Then the old man decided I was not adapted to a classical education . So he made me switch over to law . That was a good one , too . I 'd have made a great lawyer . I started in serious as hell , cut out drinking as much as I ever did , sitting round in the library . You might not think it , but I did . I never was made to sit still , but I said , Hell , I 'll give it a try . And there were , you know , cases and all that stuff we were supposed to look up . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growingp240into a chair , when all of a sudden I 'd let out a whoop . I 'd laugh . Everybody else would be studying solemn as owls and they 'd look up . I annoyed ' em laughing , but I could n't help it . There was something about the law struck me as being too damn ludicrous . I do n't know , the damnedest cases and the way they went about it was absurd . So I got kicked out of that . But this Shelley , " he said seriously , " you like him ? " I said I did . How could I tell him that my sense of Shelley was not less than adoration ? " He was an atheist , was n't he ? You know , John , sometimes you worry me . I 'm afraid you 're one of these remorse boys . When I get out of here I 'll have to see what I can do for you . This thing 's coming up in the October term of court . That ought to leave us still plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady of muddy complexion , capacious in black , who from the looks of her shoes was in the habit of badly scuffing her toes . If her hat had ever had any pretensions to fashion , it was one which was now known only in old trunks ; its flowers were wilted , its ribbons frayed ; it had accepted change and probably been caught in the rain ; the straw rim was stiff and had lately been gone over with shoe polish . Miss Fenwick smiled at me . She also wore a veil which had been lifted but did not stay . " I remember your father , " she said , as I shook her hand . " He was a very fine man . " She smiled again and the veil fell . My mother let me know that she wanted me to stay . Miss Fenwick pouted . " As I was saying  --  " she had a very large mouth and by protruding it she managed to propel the veil above it  --  " we 've always been accustomed to call on any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the gracious thing to do . So when the Westonscame , we inquired about them , then we decided to call . " " You know who they are , " said my mother trying to give me a place as listener . " They 've just bought the old Dancy place on Pumpkin Hill . " " Did n't you know ? " said Miss Fenwick pushing up her veil this time for sarcasm . " It 's not to be Pumpkin Hill any more . 0 , no ! It 's Mount Parvo , if you please . The name 's changed . And they 've applied to the Town Council . But as I was saying , I said to Floride , I suppose we ought to call , ' and Floride naturally decided as I did . We thought our position as a county family demanded it.  | " So we hitched up the surrey . And we drove to Pumpkin Hill  --  pardon me , Mount Parvo  --  and we announced that the Misses Fenwick had come to call on Mrs. and Miss Weston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him give us a funny look . Because you know , the crops had n't been very good last year , so I had said to Floride we would n't buy any new clothes this year . But we were certainly very respectablydressed . " Miss Fenwick 's lips were by now hopelessly tangled in the moist veil . " And I was saying to Floride , I thought our position as a county family  --  when the man came back and said , Mrs. and Miss Weston were very sorry , but they could not receive the Misses Fenwick as they were entertaining friends from Washington . " " I never heard of such impudence , " said my mother . " Well , I had n't either , but we drove back . " Miss Fenwick'svoice was small to come from so large and vigorous a mouth , sweet and pliant . " We thought nothing more about it , though some friends of ours inquired and we understood that it was Senator Hoggesham 's daughter and , I think , the Vice-President who was there for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if she was not listening she gave no hint of it in her face . She did not even stir when Miss Fenwick brought out her handkerchief , crumpled it into a small wad , and slowly , with thoroughnessand yet with daintiness , wiped her lips and rubbed her nose . " I think , " she said , opening her purse and closing it on the muslin wad , " she found out her mistake . Floride and I have reason to believe that she did . I refer to Mrs. Weston . She drove out to return our call . " Fortunately Floride was by the upstairs window . She was quite sure of the conveyance , and without hesitation , carried word to where I was sitting in the bedroom sewing on a ruffle , just a little nonchalant ruffle , on a petticoat . So when Mrs. and Miss Weston were announced I sent down word by our colored servitor  --  " Miss Fenwick had unusualP243She draped the veil and rose to go . " Floride and I often think of you . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . " She held my mother 's hand , it seemed to me , interminably . " Good-bye ! " And she shook hands with me . " I remember your fine father . " She had a mole beside her wide mouth and her gloves of black kid had been worn by driving . When the door shut my mother turned to me with tears in her eyes . I held her against my shoulder . " I saw him , I saw Uncle Charlie being taken to jail . " Through the window I saw Miss Fenwick jerking the reins of a bay mare till she trotted off down hill still leaningfrom her buggy . " Why did she have to stay so long ? " My mother stopped me before I could say worse . Charlie , after the first excitementdied down , had been allowed out on bail ; but now that the grand jury was about to meet , he was again in custody . " You must n't . I ca n't believe it . " I let her cry . " What did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's just it . " " If you 'd let me I 'd have told that gossiping old hag where to get off . " My mother stood away from me . " Miss Sadie Celona is a lady . I know she 's shabby . But she drove all the way indifficulty pouting the veil at this point  --  " our colored servitor "  --  for every one knew that the only help they ever had was from little negro girls from the orphan asylum  --  " that the Misses Fenwick regretted very much but they were engaged entertaining themselves . Yes , I did . But if the callers were at all fatigued by the trip to the country , they would be very glad to offer a little refreshment of wine and cake in the parlor , " Miss Fenwick concluded with satisfaction . " Wealways keep a little wine and cake in the house for just such occasions . " P244from the country just to let me know she was on our side . " " Well I never heard her . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I saw him , " I said . " I saw them take him in . There was a man on each side of him . " P245HARDEST was going to the jail . Over the old office buildingand the brick fire house and beyond far up the street where it crossed the railroad tracks shone the brilliant Octoberair ; on the stoop in the wind I waited between the pressing of the bell and the opened door . This is hardest , I thought , watching others going by in the street and staring at me , trying not to see , waiting. " 0 , it 's you ! I reckon you want to see Charlie . " CourtneyClopper wore a blue stained coat sweater , dipping at the pockets with flashlight and tobacco pouch . His hard lean face was overgrizzled by a sagging moustache . " Come on in . " In the office of the jail I only looked at two doors . To the right , one led into the mottled paper of his hall , the sheriff came behind me closing the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unloosed his keys to turn the lock on a heavy door . He smoked a black-thorn pipe and slung the big keys over his shoulder where they hung on a knotted thong . " These are the sounding booths . " The metal wall was set with small square panes and under them were perforatedplaques . " I 'd like to show you everything . We got a real nice jail here now . " The light came dim through spiked windows and cold on the gray paint . A metal cabinet was unlocked ; he pressed a long lever . " The old jail was historic though , " he said smoking . I stood before an iron grill . Beyond were prisoners and almost in darkness their cells . The grill divided and slid apart , we entered and he closed it behind us . " Visitors ai n't supposed to go beyond thisP246point , but with you I know it 's all right . " His pipe thrust straight from his shaggy mouth , he talked without unclos- . ing his teeth . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even dimmer here and the stench rose , warm with negro musk , thickened with the human stink of bodies and beds without air . Five negroes were playing blackjack under one of the high barred windows , slapping greasy cards on the floor . Some white boys looked on . Men lolled against the wall , staring at us as we passed , coatless , without ties . Against the inner grill encaging the corridors of the cells , a fair long-faced countryman was pressed , cramping his hands on the bars . " You have n't forgotten me ? " " No , I ai n't forgot you , " said the sheriff . " I know you 're there all right . " " Well , a man knows when he 's sick , " he showed a mouth half filled with gold teeth . " I know . And you 'd know if you had my cramps . " " You ai n't taking Charlie nothing ? " I held up my hands , he felt my pockets . " By rights I ought n't to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's sick , " complained the countrymanon the bars . " Sheep-stealing , " said the sheriff , " and always complaining . You go on right down there and talk to him . Cheer him up . I do n't mind with friends . I 'll wait up here . Now what 's the matter with you ? " He brought his pipe up to the clambering face . " I want a doctor . " Barred from them , I went by the open doors of cells . Charlie was in the last . It was almost dark . He sprawled on his bunk . I called . He made no answer . I went back to the sheriff and he let me pass through the inner grill . I stood by the door of Charlie 's cell . " Charlie ! " P247He lay prone . " I 've come to see you . " " 0 , it 's you , is it ? Come in . " There was a rocking-chair in the cell . I sat down , my knees were against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkined tray , breakfast sent in to Charlie from the hotel . The cup showed he had consumed coffee . All else , cold , was untouched . When he turned , rumpling the blankets more , his sombre face lit with suffering . I hesitated before I said , " I 've brought you something to read " " 0 , books  --  Take them to Virginia ! " He let his head fall , turning on his side like a man infinitely weary who yet can not sleep for pain . I did not speak . His dark hair was rumpled with sweat . The upper bunk was swung back to the wall , a metal lattice painted gray . In a niche was the commode and above it a pencil had inscribed in a heart Pull Nealy W Va pen 5 years Aug 1911 . My eyes were growing used to the lightlesscell and above the cot , half-washed away from the plaster I made out the drawing of a man connected with a headless woman . " When your mother comes I ca n't bear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I keep thinking this thing did not happen , that I never did it . And then when she 's gone , I 'm here . At night I hear them sleeping . And there 's one thing I ca n't make out . I go over and over it in my mind . And there 's one thing . I can remember everything about that walk  --  but why I did it ? Well , I guess I know that too . I had to . Yes , I had to . " He stirred uneasily on the rumpled cot . When he looked up at me it was with complete listlessness . " What time is it outside ? " " It must be after ten . " P248He subsided into listlessness . Then he said , " How are you , old cock ? You do n't mind  --  I 'm glad you 've come . " His dark face twinged as with pain . I leaned toward him with a groping hand . He held it in his own . " You 've got a tender heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , but you know how to feel sorry . That 's why I like you . And then you are young . " He held my hand tightly . " To hate you have to have the right to hate . And there are some things you have to do even when you know they are wrong . " There was constraint both in what I said to him and in my silences . " Then you did do it ? " I asked coldly . " Rape her ? " He raised his hand from the drab cot . " Listen , if she 'll come to this cell and stand there at the door and say to my face I raped her , you can believe it and I 'll hang for it . But she wo n't . " He lay back again staring at the ceiling and I looked beyondhim to the filthy drawing . " She ca n't . She wo n't dare . " " Then you did n't ? " I had only bitterness in my heart . " Yes , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I hated her . But then how do I know ? Maybe that is all we can ever do to other people  --  violate them . I loved Ardista . And you know what came of that . It was wrong . It was wrong . " It was all he would say . The silence smelled of lysol and the staled commode . " I can trust you ? Maybe I 'd have to talk to you even if I could n't . Because I 've got to have somebody or I 'll go crazy in here . Doctor Pasmore came here to see me . And the old man . I ca n't tell them . They 're old . And I 've got to  --  You know why I took you to Hagerstown that day ? Why I took you to Lillian 's house ? " Well , in the first place , I thought it would do you good . You are what now ?

So I took you along . I wanted somebody to talk to . You know now ? " I hesitated , pained , not knowing how to tell him I had failed . " Well , you know what it is now . But you are pretty young . Do you know how to hate ? But at seventeen , I remember , that was something I know I was n't taught . And Virginia , I went with her . But I never wanted her . And that was wrong . Do you understand ? Wrong ! " In the trembling silence I heard my own words . " Charlie , I 'll have to tell you I did n't do anything that day . I did n't touch that whore . That is , I did n't  --  we were upstairs together , I sat on the bed beside her , I laid my hand  --  but I did n't  --  not what you meant me to do  --  " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from the rocking-chair . " May God grant you are never as lonely as I am in this world ! " The assistant sheriff stood at the door . Charlie 's face was turned toward the wall . " All through ? " I went with him along the grilled corridor . The longfacedfair countryman asked him again for a doctor . The jailer closed behind us the massive door . " He 's got a powerful complaint . Crazy sheepstealer ! Tried to hang himself last night with a belt in his cell . " He strode ahead on a slight limp , his keys flung over his shoulder from a knotted thong . I came out surprised into the day . P250AUNT MARIA put down a mink muff to pay the cabman who deposited her bags and boxes in the hall . Her brown suit was well-tailored and trimmed with fur . She kissed my mother on both cheeks , then turned to me . A small owl 's head was crushed against her hat and blinked his yellow enamel eyes through clouds of brown veiling . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the evening train . The trial was set for the next day . " I did n't dare kiss you on the platform with all those people looking . Come here . " Her mouth smacked me loudly . " I thought we would never get through the crowd . " My mother admired her . " Well , I thought it was time I was going out of black when I could n't tell my best black hat from my second best . My eyes ai n't what they used to be . And I did n't think Mr. Sherrerd would mind . " In the dining room , at the table , she lifted her veils . " Let 's not have any conversation . Let 's all wait until we have had our supper . " My mother and I had eaten earlier . We sat in silence while she ate voraciously . Her skin was clear , brown wax in the light . She stopped to say , " Ginny , your spoonbread is excellent . I think I would live in Mordington , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . " The blinds were down ; outside the hollow night heaved with wind ; against the house a shutter crashed . " I thought I 'd never get here . " She settled herself painstakinglyin the sitting room , but kept a stiff posture . " John , put some more wood on the fire . I ca n't feel the heat . " She propped her feet . " Now what is all this hullabaloo ? P251Virginia Crannock ? Ai n't she the one with the little old pinched-up nose ? " " Her nose is all right , " said my mother . " I know her . I never liked her from the minute I laid eyes on her . And she 's got a little mouth too . " Outside I heard a boy call and in the night the scattered running of feet on pavement . " Did n't she talk to me about votes for women ? And was n't she the one brought Ida M. Wish here to speak in the Town Hall ? " " Yes , " said my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I am a suffragette myself . " Aunt Maria snorted . " You do n't want a vote , Sally . " " As long as I pay taxes on what little property I have , " said my mother , " and there are more women than men in the town  --  " " Listen to me , Sally , I know what it 's all about . I am with Madison when he said it 's all a clash of economic interests . That 's politics . All the rest is talk . But the talk we 've got to leave to the men . You mark my word . You take politics from men , you 'll be taking the talk and the liquor out of their mouths . And then where will they be ? There 'll be trouble . They wo n't have enough to occupy their time . That 's been Charlie always , he 's never had enough to keep him out of mischief . And as for that Crannockwoman , she talked a lot , I do n't know what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change something . " " Yes , " said mother , " she used to talk a lot about reform . " " And I suppose she thought she was ' bout to reform Charlie , humph ! when she went in the woods with him . And you tell me she 's a lady ! I suppose she thinks she 's reforming him now , in that nigger jail . " Aunt Maria started . " What was that ? " Some one was walking around the house . P252A scatter of corn cracked on the window pane . " That 's just the boys . They wo n't do any harm . " " They always throw corn on Hallowe'en , " I added . " It 's the time the tough boys take it out on their teachers , " said my mother . " How 's Caroline taking it ? She 's sticking to him ? " " Very well , " said my mother . " That 's good , " Aunt Maria pouted her lips . " Caroline 's a born fool . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's a good woman , Caroline 's a good Christian woman . " " Tommyrot ! She 's a bore . She 's too long-suffering . But that 's because she 's older than Charlie . " Again there were rattles of stray corn on the window , sharp as hail , and a thud on the door . " And she 's been intimate with this Virginia ? " " Very . It began at the time Caroline lost her baby . " " Humph ! " " But she was . Virginia was most considerate . And you know what Charlie 's like . " " Well now , Sally , let 's get down to this . What 's the family doing about it ? We 'll admit , for the sake of argument  --  Ithink you 'd better send John out . " " 0 , he knows all about it . " " Of course he does . He 's a young man now . I 'm not thinking about him , but myself . " " Maybe you had better close the shutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix the fire . I did not want to miss anything that was said . " We 've employed Lackland Boyd from Richmond . He 's considered the best criminal lawyer in Virginia . And there 's Stewart Marshall from Clarke  --  he 's a friend of Charlie 's  --  and Alec Armstrong from Mordington .   " Heavens ! It sounds expensive . And where , may I ask , is the money coming from ? " My mother evaded an answer . " I think that 's all settled . Papa 's tending to it . " " Well , you can tell him he need n't count on me . I paid out my last cent for Charlie the time he got in such trouble at Charlottesville . He 's no boy now . " I heaped the fire and sent it sparkling . Aunt Maria relaxedinto her chair . " As far as I am concerned , this thing is all settled in my mind . This rape or whatever you call it . " I had done all I could to the fire . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No man , " said Aunt Maria crossing her feet in front of the fire , " ever makes advances to a woman unless she encourageshim . As for rape , Sally , there 's no such thing . Listen , I did n't live with Mr. Sherrerd thirty years in a double bed for nothing ! And as for those four days she waited  --  " " That 's why the town  --  that 's why almost everybody is with us . " At that moment an Osage orange came , crashing the glass , through the window . It rolled on the floor , huge pimply green fruit . The misty lawn scampered with running legs , I hurried across the porch to close the shutters . By the pale street light I saw a dark form heave , and a rotted stalk of cabbage came hurtling toward me . The crowd of boys jeered from the pavement " Rape ! " I clapped the shutters , thrust an arm up , saving my head , caught a thud on my elbow . I ran through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dodged , closing the further shutters . They came dark and flinging corn . I saved my face in the pelting , it rattled hard as hail on the walls , falling . The street under leaves was shrill with catcalls . P254The door thudded and as I closed it a huge Osage orange , that green pulpy fruit that grows in hedges , rolled into the hall . I shoved the hair from my face . The night still hurled its missiles . " I 've telephoned , " said my mother . " But these Mordingtonpolicemen are no good . They 're never there when you want them . " " I 'll go out and give them a tongue-lashing , " said Aunt Maria . " And one they wo n't forget . " They were on the porch now , we heard them dragging the rustic benches across the floor and down the steps . " I 'm going out , " said Aunt Maria . " I wish you would n't , Aunt Maria , " plead my mother . " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of my tether now . " " They wo n't hit me , " said Aunt Maria . She went out . I stood beside her , holding the knob of the door . " You young rascals , I 've had just about enough of this devilment . " The boys with the bench broke , ran , letting it tumble . Recognizing them , I yelled their names . They were across the street when Aunt Maria spoke . It was pitch-dark under the trees . " Now you all go on away from here . I know you , " she shouted , " I know every last one of you . " The arc light swung behind the windy branches and the trunks laid shadows on the dusky lawn . A bolder voice rough with youth called from the shade . He was smutty . Aunt Maria came back toward the door , a cabbage stalk hit the steps where she had stood . " Come here if you want to get it , " crowed a young cockerel'svoice , " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small boy 's voice delighted shrilled " Rape ! " They were driven into the dark , not cowed . Yelling as I closed the door , they followed us with missiles.  | " I 've lambasted them , " said Aunt Maria . And a moment later there was scampering on the porch , ringing of the bell , and a sound of scraping . It was ten o'clock when Tom Slaughter arrived , indifferentand harassed . The next morning the back gate was gone , the porch without benches was littered with corn , Osage oranges , cabbage roots and the broken pieces of a rustic chair . Another was found lodged in a pine tree . P256A BELL clanged in the courthouse tower , rousing a flock of rusty blackbirds . They flew out creaking into the wind , kept up a noisy fracas while the bell was ringing , scattered and dropped once more among the bare maples . Men stood dejected with cold about the yard , farmers in sheepskin coats turned under the huge columns of the porch , black men in blue overalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the door opened in dark red walls stained like blood , pressed upstairs to the courtroom . Since early in the morning stickwagons , buggies , phaetons , dusty black surreys , springwagons with straw , had been set with their wheels at an angle along the sidewalks , blocking the roadway . A farmer crowd dawdled in the streets . My grandfather and I had to cross from his office . A young boy , his eyes like something crazy , honked his way through cowering country women and children , drove a red car up the street and down again , cut-out open . He had lost his cap and looked out from one side , grazing hubs and blocked wheels . " I feel , " said my grandfather , " a little like the Israelites just about to step into the Red Sea . " We entered the courthouse by the small door , opening on a side street . He glanced toward the jail . My grandfather was slow in the corridors . He stopped to shake hands when any one so much as gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charlie 's lawyers . But just before we entered the door , I saw him gather himself into an attitude like nothing so much as a general about to be painted with one hand on a cannon , surveying a battlefield . And we came into the courtroom.  |p257The  crowd faced us . They sat in tiers , whites on one side , negroes on the other , leaned from the rising benches , straddled the ramp , closed a jostling mass in the doorway . From the ceiling hung a vast circular chandelier . Boys drooped on the window sills . And high up , almost against the back wall , I saw old Burnham sitting with crossed legs between his two sons . His face was bland and unshaven , his eyebrows grizzled above a stare of amused surprise . Charlie was in his place . He leaned back in his chair , listened while one of his lawyers pattered in his ear . He had a sultry look , and while his eyelids were lowered , he held his head well back . Once his glance lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same table , sat Virginia with her counsel beside her . She seemed to stare at her hands . My grandfather sought his accustomed place . Unless the docket was crowded , he used to sit , when attending a trial in which he was not professionally engaged , at the end of the row of chairs properly reserved for the prisoners . Our two chairs were the last within the stained railing . I had no sooner sat down , suffering from the many stares , than the bailiff cried , " The Court . Rise ! " There was a rustle of attention , the judge came through the door by which we had just entered , the whole room rose . He was a little man , pale-faced , with his hair brushed thin , so small that he had heightened the seat of his swivel chair with a thick cushion , in order to look down on us , visible dominance of the law . His platform was also railed ; behind him the wall was draped with a green curtain , against which hung the ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney of the town and a famous prosecutor of abolitionists . " It used to be red , " my grandfather whispered to me of the curtain . " Looks like a bob-tailed flush . " He talked to keep himself in countenance . Two doors led to this platform , two flights of steps de-P258scended from it . Between them , under the Honorable Junius B. Brompton , at his own table sat the clerk of the court . Spectacled , he appeared seedy and in a peculiar state of lackadaisical irritation . With a slow annoyance , he drew the names of the empanelled jurors from his black japanned tin box , made as if he would whistle each time he unrolled the tiny wad of paper , called a name , then drooped patiently to write down the drawn man on a tablet . The prosecuting attorney leaned to the arm of the judge 's chair and carried on a whispered conversation . Once or twice he glanced out slyly toward the courtroom ; but the judge seemed to see nothing . And nothing it seemed would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on Charlie ; I had seen him as one who condemned might hang . I was excited and suffered in that consciousness . Now nothing threatened him . Already it might have been hours since I had passed that door through which later the judge had come . All was lost in routine . Charlie , his arms over the back of his chair , drummed his thumbs on the rung beneath the seat . The lawyers waited like schoolboys for a class while an absentmindedteacher collects his books from the desk drawer . Their table was littered with bottles of ink , piles of sheepskinlaw books , blotters and pads ; Lackland Boyd , his head to one side , scratched his pen in boredom . I dared look behind me . Then overhead , sending a slight tremor through the chandelier , I heard the clock strike ten ; we had been there but half an hour . " Gentlemen of the jury , please answer to your names and come into the box as you are called . " The clerk 's voice was turned to the twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here . " " Ambrose Jones ! " " Speak up , " the judge asked , " so we can hear you . "  |p259In  the same monotone , as though he were outlining to a class a lesson with which they were unfamiliar , but which he knew all too well , the judge questioned the men in the box as to their previous service on either grand or petit jury within the last two years , on their personal knowledge of the case , their formed opinions , their relation by blood or marriage to defendant or prosecutrix . One man was dismissed , on the first of these counts , climbed down , and the clerk read out another name from an unrolled paper taken from the japanned tin box . " Do you know any other reason why you should not sit in this cause and a true verdict render according to the evidence ? " The attorneys now consulted their clients : the defense struck our six names of the twenty , the prosecution two . The jurors took their places in the three-benched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sworn by the clerk , laying their right hands on the Bible he held out to them . " That 's something you wo n't see anywhere else I know of . In Mordington , I 'm glad to stay , they keep to the old custom . " The jury was counted . " Yes , " my grandfather whispered , " and this is the only place where they 'd swear ' em and then count ' em . They still do it arse-backwards . " After them , the witnesses were sworn , but in a mass . Caroline was with my mother , who held her arm as she stumbled on the small steps on the way to the witness room . They walked in silence , tired , their faces lifted , as people do when they go in the dark . " May it please the court and you , gentlemen of thejuryIt was three o'clock in the afternoon when Cleon O'Connorrose ; it was soon obvious that he had spent the greatest pains on his address . His manner was swollen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regret the occasion that has compelled me to appear before you and now requires you to abandon for a while the peaceful pursuits and the pleasant avocations of your private lives for the purpose of performing your most solemn duty to the state . You are here because that duty has devolved upon you as citizens of a great and civilized country . " I regret that it is my duty to stand before you and say to you , citizens of this State , that once more the cry of rape is heard in the land and that this crime , this heinous and horrible crime , has been committed , not by a man of the colored race , not by one born in low surroundings , which so often unjustly shape the soul as they determine the sordidnessof conduct , no , but is imputed to one whose former education , training and fair tradition should have predisposedhim to a career of honor and worthy actions . I regret that it is my duty to charge him with this crime . " But I rejoice that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his base , cowardly , criminal act , at whose very mention the whole human race stands aghast . He is charged with one of the gravest of crimes , one which has shocked the sensibilities of men from the earliest dawn of history down to the splendid beacon lights of our own civilized century . " I rejoice that he has been brought here that this tribunal may pronounce upon him . You will hear the evidence to be brought forward by the State and afterward you will hear the evidence adduced by the defendant . This , gentlemen of the jury , is a case of no ordinary interest . It is a case of tremendous interest , for you , for me , for all of us , for our whole community  --  and I see here the representatives of the press of Baltimore and Washington  --  and I earnestly pray that you will carefully scrutinize the evidence and come to your conclusions in a sane , honest and impartial manner . We do not ask that anything be taken for granted against this de-P261fendant , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you balance evenly the scales of justice . And doing that , gentlemen , we are confident that when the time comes and you have reached your conclusion , that verdict will be against the defendant and for the State . " Now , gentlemen , the indictment in this case was sworn out by the Grand jury at the October term of this court and , leaving off the State and county and the date , reads as follows : " The Grand Jury of the State of West Virginia , in and for the body of said county , and now attending the said court , upon their oaths present that Charles Marston on the fourteenth of July , A.D. one thousand nine hundred and twelve , in the said county of Madison , the said Charles Marston then and there being a male person over the age of fourteen years , with force and arms , in and upon one VirginiaCrannock , violently , unlawfully and feloniously , did make assault , she , the said Virginia Crannock , then and there being a female over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of thirty-seven years , and her , the said Virginia Crannock , then and there , to wit , on the day and year aforesaid , feloniously did ravish and carnally know , against her will and by force against the peace and dignity of the State . Sworn to in open court and sent to the Grand Jury to give evidence in this indictment . " " Will you please state your name to the jury . " " Virginia Crannock . " The prosecuting attorney , Cleon O'Connor , was still rather young , pompous and heavy-jowled . The whole lower part of his face was smudged by a black , shaven beard , his hair retreated from a high forehead and the sockets were large and deep about small popping eyes . His hand lay on that railing which rose in a curve from the four steps leading to the witness chair and ran a row of spindles along the higher dais of the judge 's seat . He took at once a protective air , which made him like a noble hero in a melodrama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Thirty-seven years . " " When were you thirty-seven ? " " Last May . " Her voice was clear and composed : there was not theslightest difficulty in hearing her . Throughout question and answer , he stood by the rail : had Virginia tell where she lived , how long she had known Mr. and Mrs. Marston , how often she had visited at Ruddimont . " Will you please state to the jury whether or not youwere visiting there last July . " " Yes , sir . I went there on the night of July thirteenth . " " Please state the occasion of your visit on the night of Julythirteenth . " Responding , her voice was clear . She looked only at hissmall eyes . She was in black , which I had never before seen her wear . Cleon O'Connor seemed to be playing someprivate melodrama . He was the hero whose duty it was to protect Virginia ; he displayed nobility and discretion ; itwas all done like an actor . She declared she had spent the night at Ruddimont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Marston told me her husband was going away andmight be home or might not be home overnight . " ( This was the night Charlie and I had returned late andhe had sat long in the kitchen drinking and afterwards tormented by sleepless heat I had passed through the darkcorridor and heard Caroline weeping . ) " It was in the early morning that she telephoned me . Iwas just leaving Guyon Hall to stay with my aunt , in Mord/ington . She had been ill . But I told Mrs. Marston that unless I found my aunt worse I would come . " " Did you know where Mr. Marston was ? " " I was told he had gone off in his car with his nephew . " " When did you go out there ? Was it at night ? " " I drove out after eight o'clock . " " Who drove ? " " I did . " " Where did you stay that night ? " " Since there was a possibility of his return , I did not as usual spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small room adjoining Mrs. Marston 's , with a door between . " It was midnight or after when Mr. Marston came home . I do n't know . I had no watch with me . I am accustomed to live by clocks and watches . There was a clock in the room . I remember looking , I was wakened , but the clock had run down . I lay awake some time hearing their voices . My room gave on the same hall and the windows were open . His voice was angry and I heard her voice crying . " I do not remember what time we rose . It must have been early . I remember we talked at breakfast and he was angry at something I said . Afterwards Mrs. Marston was busy in the household and I went out on the porch and talked to Mr. Marston 's nephew . I did not see Mr. Marston again until after eleven o'clock . He came back from the stables and asked for a whisky . Mrs. Marston called the colored boy and sent him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ julep . He asked me if I would have one . It was very hot and I sipped a little of the crushed ice and mint . " He said he was going out to look at some colts and asked me to go along . I spoke to Mrs. Marston . She said , Yes , by all means . ' I told him I would go along with him . It was . then nearly dinner time and we waited until after dinner . "  |p264'She  sat very still , controlled : seeming to see only O'Connor'ssmall protruding eyes . " Miss Virginia , which way did you all go ? " His hand was large , white and pudgy . " We went by what is called the back way . I know be-'cause one of the colored men who opened the gate asked him if he was going the front way or the back way . " " Please state whether or not you passed through a young orchard . " " We passed through a young orchard on the way to the field where the colts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After seeing the colts , we walked on . Instead of turning to come back , we went through another field . He called my attention to the clover , some of it was good and some of it thin . I did not know where we were . I followed a path alongside a rail fence . Then I saw another farmhousein some cedars and I asked him if it was the Retreat . He said No , it was the old Clopper place . " I did not know where we were going . I never asked where we were going . It never occurred to me to ask . We walked on . We came to the woods on the hill . It is high there and on the other side overlooks the run . But here there was a thicket . He said he wanted some pistol practice . He had his pistol with him and showed it to me . He complainedit had not been fired in a long time . " He aimed at a sapling a little way off , standing alone . He fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . I was startled by the sound though I knew when each shot would come . I have never liked the thought of anythingbeing killed . And when I saw the young sapling , straight and in leaf , wounded , the tender bark ripped and the white and living wood pierced , I felt it as a pain . I put my hand to my side . " It may have been the heat , for we had come slowlyp265along the pasture path in all the sun . I was faint . It was strange . " " I do n't want to harass this witness , " Stewart Marshall addressedhimself to Judge Brampton , " but I would ask that she restrict herself to the facts . " Virginia accepted the court 's admonition with a slight impatience . " He put his arm around me , he must have thought I would fall . I felt his arm around me . He said , Let 's get into the shade . ' And we walked on in the thicket and sat down on a log . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he put his hand on my hand . I was very faint . " " What did he say ? " " All at once he turned to me and said , Why do n't we have a good time ? ' I was dazed . I did not know what he meant until he started to put his hand under my clothes . I knew that was not right and I looked at him . Then I turned my head . " " Then what took place ? " " He dragged me by my arms . By my arms he dragged me a little way from the log . " " What did you do ? " " I protested and fought with all my might . I screamed . He put his hand over my mouth and kept pulling me . There were brambles in the thicket and I fought all the way . " " Will you please state whether you resisted ? " " I resisted with all my might . " " Well , then , Miss Virginia , go ahead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hollow with grass . I had not seen it till he dragged me there and pulled me down . He was beside me , trying to persuade me to do what I would never do . I broke away from him , I ran , there were thickets all around , I do not know how far I ran , in the thickets were brambles of blackberries . IP266wanted to run screaming toward the house I had seen . He caught and held me . " " Where did he hold you ? " " He caught me by the arms . I begged him . Then he assaulted me . " That Charlie had assaulted her in the woods seemed , I must confess , not impossible . But that she should sit there calmly describing his violence , was to me incredible . The prosecuting attorney strolled from the rail toward the jury . Twelve stolid faces , rustic , tanned , intent , looked down on him , farmers and small town storekeepers , three rows of faces saying nothing . He liked to strut before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom . It was like an actor 's , with a good nose , but his heavy jowls were blackened by the shaven beard . He walked back to his rail and leaned on it , looking up at Virginia . " And now Miss Virginia , please state how you resisted . " Answering her voice was clear and controlled . " Say what then occurred ? " " He caught me and threw me to the ground . I know that because afterwards there were bruises on my back . He held me by the arms , all his weight was on top of me , he cursed me as I had never heard . " " I hate to ask you this question ; you understand , we all understand it has to be done , I hate  --  whether or not he penetrated your person ? " I leaned forward , not daring to listen . Charlie , his arms over the back of his chair , drummed incessantly with his thumbnails . The benches behind me strained ; I listened . " Yes , " Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And what took place after that ? " " After it was all over and he had satisfied himself , he stood up and helped me to my feet . He talked a great deal , P267but I was too miserable to hear . And there in the woods , I could only hear , You are not hurt . ' And afterwards , coming back across the fields , I have been with girls who were unconscious half an hour or more . I was afraid somebodywould come in and find us together . And there were others and I have known some of them to bleed like beeves . Come on ! You are not hurt . ' And when we were almost at the house , he said , I 'll give you some whisky . ' What more he said I was too miserable to hear . " " Please state to the jury what took place after you got back to the house . " " I saw Mrs. Marston first . I went alone through one of the long windows into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and sank into a chair . When she saw me , she said , What is the matter , Virginia ? Did you have an accident ? ' I said No . And a short time after , Mr. Marston came in and said he wanted a whisky , he was feeling badly , and he asked me if I would have one . I said I did n't want it and he drank the whisky he had poured out for me after his own . And we sat there and talked of what he had done the day before in Hagerstown . I hardly know what was said . I went upstairs and lay down , Mrs. Marston came with me and I lay down in her room . " Answering to the attorney , she told of her return to town . She had found her aunt ill , she could not speak to her , and after supper she had complained to Mrs. Hufflebower , who was not properly speaking a servant , but her aunt 's housekeeper . She had turned to her as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the followingmorning visited him at his office . She also told of going to Doctor Pasmore 's , finding him away and telegraphinghim , asking him to come back as soon as possible . " What church is he minister of ? " Stewart Marshall , Charlie 's counsel from Clarke county , sprang at once to his feet . " We object to that line of exam/ination and do not see its materiality . " The court sustained him . So it was ruled out of the evidence that Doctor Pasmorewas minister of the Presbyterian Church . It seemed to me that every one must know that anyhow . Nor could I understand his later objections until I was aware that Charlie 's counsel had brought out in the midst of Virginia 's testimony that it was four days after the alleged crime at Ruddimont before she had consulted Doctor Pasmore . Only after she had seen him had she engaged her lawyer and had him draw up her charge against Charlie . The judge lolled in his high-backed swivel chair ; he was so short in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to rest the elbow that propped his head . He listenedlanguidly , without ever seeming to see the witness or even to hear her , unless at the moment he was asked to decide on a point of law . " Now , Miss Virginia , I want to ask you one of the questionsI forgot . " The prosecuting attorney leaned confidently on his railing . " I want you to tell the jury how you were dressed that day . " Virginia had worn a white linen skirt and a white waist of thinner linen embroidered . Where were they ? They had been given to the Doctors Sprechels and Moore . And her underclothes ? They had been given to the doctors . " The defense may take the witness , " O'Connor announced . He returned to the long table and sat down by Colonel Case , rather slyly pleased with himself . Stewart Marshall had the air not of a lawyer but a horseman . Ruddy of face and sandy-haired , he walked stiffly up to Virginia . He wore an old suit of gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his dusky red four-in-hand . He began by taking her over the same ground the prosecutionhad covered . It was done very quietly . Only gradually did he work into his questions a note of irony . Virginia evaded him . Pressed to particulars on that walk toward theP269woods there was much that she did not know , or could not remember . That house ? Yes , she had seen a house , but that it was beyond a cornfield she did not know , nor how close it was to the thicket . She had seen no one near the house , nor ploughing in the field , she had heard no one . But she could not be sure , it was simply that she had not noticed . She returned to her statement that she had seen a house . Marshall 's color mounted , he turned , a countrymanto that county jury , angrily , as much as to say , " You see how it is . The witness is not credible . " " You tell the jury that although he attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clothes you do not remember having screamed at that time ? " Colonel Case objected . " What do you mean , at the time he did that ? " " I mean when he put his hands under her clothes when they were sitting on the log . That is my question . Read it ! " And when the question was read to her , Virginia replied , " No , I do not remember distinctly at that time . " " Now if you were conscious of his purpose and that it was an evil one , why did n't you scream ? " " Because he was there to prevent it and did prevent it . When he was dragging me away from the log I screamed . " " You know that positively ? " " Yes , positively , I screamed . " " My point , however , is whether or not , when he first put his hands under your clothes , you screamed , or whether as a matter of fact he had his hand over your mouth ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I screamed when he was dragging me away from there . " " What is your best judgment as to the distance he pulled you ? " " I have no judgment about distances . I do n't know . I wo n't attempt to say . "  | " Now , you say you broke away from him , if I understand you correctly ? " " I did . " " And started to run ? " " Yes . " " In what direction did you run ? " " I ran toward that house hoping I could make somebody hear me . " " How far did you run ? " " I do n't know that either . I ran until he caught and held me . " " You screamed during the time you were running ? " " Yes , sir , I suppose I did . " " I did n't ask you whether you supposed , Miss Crannock , you must excuse me , I asked you whether as a matter of fact you did scream while running ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . I can not remember . I think I did . " " You were within hearing distance of the house , were you not ? " " It seems I was not . " Colonel Case objected . " That is calling for the opinion of the witness . " " She saw the house , " said the judge , " and she had some idea of the distance she was from it . She can state her opinion . " " I had hoped , " said Virginia , " to make myself heard . " " Now , you did scream when he threw you . Miss Crannock , these are disagreeable questions but I can not help it , you are sure you did scream when he threw you on your back ? " " I think I did . " " Did he put his hand over your mouth then ? " " There was such a struggle at that time I can not say . " " You could not say ? "  | " No . " " Did you scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed as loud as I could . " " Now , after throwing you to the ground , I understood you to say that he hoisted your clothes ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then after he got your clothes up , I understood you to say that he endeavored to accomplish his purpose . Am I right about that ? " " Yes . " Her voice had the tired sound of survivors of an accident , who must tell over and over again their story until it becomes a dead level monotone from which all emotion has gone and almost all meaning and which yet retains in its nervelessness a recollection of calamity . Virginia kept her control , but it was a control acquired at long expense . It was as though she had already suffered her utmost , which indeed I think she had , in bringing her charge , and now she needed only an effort of nerves to prolong her recital of those events which had brought her there . Having told the town the crime of which she accused Charlie , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she sat before us in black and gave her testimony . Stewart Marshall was relentless , pressing her answers towardincredibility . " You say he then accomplished his purpose ? " " He assaulted me . " Marshall wanted to know all about this , where her hands were , whether she screamed , was she conscious ? " Why did n't you scratch him in the face ? I want to know why , when you knew you were being outraged by this man , you did not take your hands and scratch his face and tear his eyes out ? " " Perhaps , " said Virginia wearily , " if some one had been there to tell me I might have done it . "  | " Miss Crannock , would n't that have been instinctive with any woman ? " He walked red-faced before the jury . " And with that hand loose ? " " I can not say . I was so perfectly terrified I can not say . " Marshall had a movement of impatience . It was as though he were saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her accusations . And besides what does the whole thing amount to ? Red-faced , coarse of voice , he strode beforeVirginia , forcing her once again back to the house through the hot July afternoon . He followed her upstairs and down , bullying her always as to the exact time anythingwas done . " I do not know . It seems to me there was sometimes a clock on the mantel in that room , but either it was not running or else it seemed to me it was not running . I did not know the time . I am accustomed to live by clocks and watches . " He sat down with her before the table when Miss Sadie Fenwick called and Caroline served cake and wine , and Virginia had taken not one piece but two . " And ate it ? " " I suppose I ate it . I can not say whether I did nor not . " " You said you took the cake and wine because you were afraid not to take it . What were you afraid of there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was afraid of that man ! " " What could he have done to you there ? " " There is no saying what he could have done or what he would not have done . " " You mean to tell the jury that if you had refused , Mr. Marston , there in the presence of his own wife , would have again assaulted you ? " " There is no telling . What I mean to say is that if that man had thought I would tell  --  I do n't know what he would have done . I took the cake because I was trying to be asp273natural as I could with Mrs. Marston . And I succeeded . " " Now you are giving me another reason for it . Which is the correct one ? " " Both are correct . " " Then you were perfectly natural in the presence of Mrs. Marston ? " Marshall 's sarcasm was laid on for the jury . " Perfectly natural . " Marshall returned to that word after the recess of the court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that afternoon had been most unnatural in one who had been assaulted and was still in a state of fear when Charlie had left the house and she was alone with Caroline . " Do you remember whether it was twilight when you returned to your aunt 's house ? " " No , it was not twilight . It was July and the sun had not gone down . " She had not spoken to her aunt who was an old lady , delicate and frail . But after supper she had complained to Mrs. Hufflebower , and telephoned to Doctor Dermott . " Now you have stated on your examination in chief that the undergarment next your body was stained . Did you keep that same undergarment on all that afternoon and all that day ? " " Yes , I did . " " And you had taken a bath as soon as you arrived at your aunt 's house ? " " Yes . " " A hot bath ? " " Just an ordinary bath . " " Now this undergarment  --  you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you came to town , nor did you change until the following morning ? " " I did not . " " You did not take that underclothing off until Saturday morning . That was true , was n't it ? "  | " Yes , that was true . " " Did you fear  --  I hate to ask this question , but I am obliged to ask you  --  did you fear , on Friday evening or at any time during that day that you might become preg-nant ? " " I thought of it . " " But before you had seen the doctors ? " " I saw a doctor as soon as it was possible for me to see him . " " Answer my question please . Did you think Friday eveningthat you were pregnant from the effects of this ? " " I did not know . " He bullied her through the following days , through her visit to Doctor Dermott , her call on my mother and her examination by three doctors on the Friday a week after the crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sorry to have kept you so long and must apologize to you for it . " " Are you through with the cross-examination ? " asked judge Brompton . " Yes , sir , " Marshall answered . " I may have forgotten something , but I do n't think I have . If so , I 'll have to ask you gentlemen to permit me to ask it later on . " He rustled his papers on the long table . Charlie looked at him ; Marshalldid not smile , but flushed a red satisfaction . Colonel Case reminded the court that the prosecution would have some questions to ask the witness on re-direct examination . This they were prepared to do , but since the witness had been on the stand since ten o'clock in the morning and had now arrived at a period where she was exhausted , he suggested it would be better to take an adjournment . " If she prefers to postpone it , " said the judge , " I will do so . " And we left the courthouse for that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria . And Charlie in the custody of the sheriff returned to jail . Virginia disclosed but one thing new in her testimony the following morning . And this was to me amazing . She was again on the stand . Colonel Case , while conducting the re-direct examination  --  this being permitted in that court  --  brought out that Caroline , after the warrant had been sworn out and Charlie arrested , had called on Virginia at her aunt 's house . I should have liked to know when this was , and what was said , but the court at once intervened , deciding that since this conversation had not been mentioned in the crossexamination , it would be improper now . " This assault that you spoke of , " concluded Colonel Case , " made upon you by the prisoner , in which you said he had carnal knowledge of you by force , occurred in what county ? In what State ? " When Virginia had answered , she left the stand . There followed the witnesses for the defense . Mrs. Eliza Hufflebower , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crannock on South Liberty Street , that she had been there seven years in the capacity of housekeeper . On the evening of July fourteenth , some time between 6:3o and 7 , she was getting supper . She heard the front door open , but did n't go out to look , as she supposedit was Miss Virginia . She knew it was when she heard the bath water running . But she did n't in fact see her until supper was on the table . When she went into the dining room , Miss Virginia was already sitting at the table . She had n't noticed anything unusual about her excepting that she had on a fresh white linen voile dress with a lot of shadow embroidery . But then she always was a woman accustomed to minding her own business and she did n't notice anything until Miss Virginia came out to the **25;3072;TOOLONG Vaughn motor had faded out down the road , Elise medi- tatively leafed through the album of Chopin Preludes on the desk of her cherished baby grand until she came to Number 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered up into her strong , slim fingers a dozen resounding measures of the most potently heart-stirring chords she knew . Thus cleansed and reinvigorated , she rose , carried the tall glass vase out to the kitchen , changed the water she had poured in at six , carefully snipped off an inch from the long stem of the white chrysanthemum , and restored it to its place on the piano . Cupping the beautiful flower in both hands , she bent over it and inhaled deeply . It was a stimulating fragrance . Resuming her seat , she sang He Shall Feed His Flock , ' realizing that she was doing it uncommonly well . There were tears in her eyes when she finished . After that , she sat very still for a long time looking at the white chrysan- themum with the steady concentration of a crystal-gazer until it grew very large and the graceful blades of the petals shimmered with a pale opalescence . She drew a deep sigh and her fingers softly stroked the ends of the white keys . Now slippered footsteps and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently , Through for today , Grampa ? ' Elise had not turned her face toward him , but her mental picture of the kindly spirited old man was , she knew , en- tirely accurate . An affectionate smile softened the white- bearded lips . The great mop of silver hair was tousled . The knowing eyes were so black you could n't define the pupil from the iris . He was wearing the tattered , quilted , maroon dressing-gown that Grandma had made for him years ago  --  the last product of her patient and competent needle . Elise could feel the worn texture against her bare elbow as he fondled the lobes of her ears , one of his favoriteexpressions of endearment since her early childhood . She reached up and caressed his leathery hands.  | Sure you do n't want anything more to eat ? ' I should say not ! The Pipers had everything they 'd ever raised on the table , including a tough old gander . And I was ready for it , you 'd better believe . Big job of carpenter-work I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? ' Elise had heard the details twice , but knew he wanted to talk about it . Nastiest fracture I ever saw , I think . Young Jud  --  maybe I told you this  --  had been up in an old hickory shaking a limb when it broke with him . All of fifteen feet . It was a nasty one .... Right there . " Potts fracture , " we call it . Look . ' He put up a foot on the piano bench , rolled down his woolen sock , and diagrammed the accident . Elise winced a little when she saw how white and sharp his shin was . Very nasty , ' he repeated , recovering his balance . He 'll do well if he 's off his crutches by Groundhog Day . ' Elise was appropriately sympathetic and presumed that the Piper tribe was badly upset about it . Well , ' sighed the old man wheezily , sinking into the deep chair that was still warm with farm machinery , ' it ca n't be helped . How did you find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elise swung herself around on the bench , and having casually dismissed the perfunctory query about Clara 's folks , remarked , And I met the Mr. Parker who has come here to  --  to get away from every- thing while he does some special study . Perhaps he 's writing a book about it , though he did n't say so . He would n't , of course . Very modest . Does n't talk about himself , at all . ' Oh , yes ; he 's the tall , city-looking fellow with the white sweater and the bird-dog . Where does he hail from ? ' I did n't ask him . Up North , somewhere . ' Elise 's hasty dismissal of this question proved its unimportance . But he is a gentleman ; perfect manners . I know you would like him , Grandpa . He 's your kind of a man . ' Elise 's grandfather stroked his short white whiskers and grinned . His black eyes twinkled . His lips puckered , teasingly . He imitated her own childish gesture of whittling one index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall remark . Certainly not ! ' denied Elise , coloring charmingly , and exasperatingly conscious of it . Nothing of the sort ! Mr. Parker is cultured , knows a lot about music , talks of things I 'm interested in . Naturally  --  I like him . We speak the same language . And I can tell you it 's a relief '  --  she con- tinued with increasing warmth  --  to find a person in this vicinity who is able to talk about something else be- sides , ' Monkey-wrenches and post-augers ? ' suggested her grandfather , noting her hesitancy to make an immediate selection from a stock so comprehensive . I agree with you , dear . But you 'd better go slow with this man Parker until we find out a little more about him . And be careful you do n't get Randolph sore at you . I see he left early . ' He wanted to go , ' explained Elise glumly . That 's what I mean . We 'll have to be careful about that . ' For some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligently , to prove that her meditation was guile- less . Then , with a half-wheedling circumflex accent , she said softly , Grandpa . ' Yes , dear , ' answered the old man , kindly but not with- out suspicion . Grandpa  --  would you object if I asked Mr. Parker here for supper some evening ? He 's awfully lonesome , and it seems to me it 's almost up to some of us to extend a little of the hospitality we 've bragged about so much . ' Asking Randolph , too ? ' challenged her grandfather seriously . Well  --  if you think we must . But  --  do n't you see ? Randy is n't interested in music or  --  or anything else that we would want to talk about . And Mr. Parker is too much of a gentleman to discuss things in Randy 's presence that he knows nothing of . We would just have to keep to hardware .... And I do n't think it 's fair , ' she finished dismally . Resolving to let the matter simmer for the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about for a diverting topic . ' That 's an unusually fine chrysanthemum , ' he observed . ' It does n't look like a local product . ' Is n't it simply wonderful ? ' Elise offered it to him for close inspection . ' He gave Aunt Clara some because she had asked him to have dinner with the family today . She does n't know how in the world he got them here so soon from St. Louis unless he telephoned for them . They came  --  special delivery  --  while I was there . And when I thought they were lovely , he asked Aunt Clara if he might give me one . Gorgeous , is n't it ? ' ' Elise , dear , ' muttered her grandfather ominously , let me repeat that we must not offend the Vaughns . I never bothered you with this , for I feared you might be sensitive about it , but Henry Vaughn lent me six hundred dollars , in all , while you were in Louisville taking your vocal lessons . I had hoped to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitent . Oh ! ... Grandpa ! ' moaned Elise . ' Does that mean that I must n't ever talk to anyone but Randy until this money is returned to his father ? ' ' No  --  it is n't quite that bad . But , as I have just said , we should n't go out of our way to annoy them .... You need n't worry about it . But be discreet . ' He yawned to encourage her that the problem was n't really disastrous , and said he reckoned it was time for him to go to bed . ' I 've been a bit short of breath all day . Had to crank the old machine this morning . Battery 's worn out . ' You ought to get a new one , ' replied Elise . ' Vaughns have them , do n't they ? ' ' I expect so , ' he said wearily , but collections are slow , and I do n't like to ask Henry for any more credit .... You invite your Mr. Parker here , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the girls  --  Sue Sizer , or somebody . That would make it all right , I reckon . ' Elise went to bed with what she thought must be the sensations of a slave , held for debt . She turned her hot pillow over and over . What a mess her life was going to be ! Perhaps Randy would have to go down to Nashville for a couple of days ' business before long . He had spoken of it . If she waited until he had made definite arrangements , she could ask Mr. Parker over while Randy was out of town . No  --  that would n't do at all . Randy would have even more cause to feel offended . Maybe she could have Mr. Parker here and keep it a secret from Randy , though that would be difficult , with everybody knowing everybody else 's business .... Her heart pounded . Maybe she could have him on short notice when Grandpa was away on a long trip  --  a baby case , perhaps . That took all day , generally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted Clay was ! Surely that proved how attractive he . was , for Clay was always so reserved with strangers . I le had honestly liked her voice , too . He was n't saying it just to be polite . You can tell . Distinguished talent . ' I ledid n't have to do that if he was merely wanting to be pleas- ant . You could go far . ' And his face was so serious when he said it . Funny how some people seemed to be a part of their clothes . Even his blue polka-dotted four-in-hand looked as if it had been made especially for him . His shoes , too . It was probably stamped on the insole  --  Handmade for Mr. Parker . ' No , it would n't say that . It would be Handmade for Nathan Parker . ' She wondered if his peo- ple called him Nathan . Nat , more likely . It would be fun to ask him when they were better acquainted . She heard herself doing it ; heard herself saying that his name some- how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker had  --  eyes , hands , collar , shoes  --  fitted together . And his name , too . Names were such queer things , anyhow ; seemed to have personality ; seemed to be as much a part of you as your hands or your voice . Elise  --  for instance . That was as it should be . Elise . She could n't think of herself being anything else but Elise . She had always felt like an Elise . Elise Graham .... She snuggled her face into the pillow .... Elise Parker . Elise Graham Parker . She was making a lovely monogram of this when she heard Grandpa slowly padding down the stairs in his felt slippers ; a step , a long pause , a siege of coughing , another step , a longer pause . The banister creaked as if he might be leaning on it heavily . Perhaps he was going to the office for some medicine . It always annoyed him if she seemed anx- ious about his health ; disliked to have her fluttering about him when he had these little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listened . He had reached the bottom now . Doubtless he would be coming up again presently . When the clock struck twelve , Elise decided to go down . He was sitting very straight at the desk in his pungent little office , rather pitiful in the absurd old flannelette nightgown , unbuttoned over his bony chest . He had his fingers on his pulse and his blue lips were counting . Each wheezy exhalation of his gasps gave him a spasmodic kick in the stomach . His eyes were straining as if they , too , were sucking for air . Can I do anything , Grandpa ? ' inquired Elise , trying to keep her alarm out of her voice . He shook his head and remained intent on his pulse . I 'll do a morphine injection , ' he said huskily , if I do n't get relief  --  pretty soon . I 've had my quota of digitalis . ' He pointed to the hypodermic syringe to let her know he had been doing something for himself . It 's these damned stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Shall I make up the davenport for you ? '  | He nodded and tried to smile . Elise was glad to be doing something . She hurried up- stairs and collected the necessary bedding . After a while he came , walking very slowly , and eased himself down on t the davenport . She patted the pillow , but he shook his head . Not yet , ' he said . Must sit up . I 've been neglecting - . my digitalis lately .... Great thing  --  digitalis .... Could n't live  --  without it . ' He grinned feebly . ' We both have favorite posies  --  Elise .... White chrysanthemum  --  and purple foxglove .... You better  --  go to bed now . ' IP For an hour she sat on the floor , her feet drawn up under her , nestling her cheek against his knee . It was a great relief to her when he said he thought he might lie down . Ile seemed very sleepy . They met in the Post Office at nine , Elise rather flustered and rosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Mr. Parker entering and knew that an encounter would be unavoidable . It was not that she did n't want to meet him . Her ac- celerated pulse testified to that . But she was n't certain that their contact on the street or in the Post Office , which at this hour of the morning was well patronized , would be a very happy one . If she greeted him with anything like the personal inter- est she felt , someone would be sure to notice it and perhaps comment on it . If , on the other hand , she protected her- self against the possibility of being chattered about , Mr. Parker might be hurt by her attitude of cool unconcern . Her steps lagged while she debated the respective dis- advantages of either course , but quickened when she de- cided that it would be better to meet him in the Post Office than outside . He was stowing stamps in his wallet as she approached the little window . His casual greeting gave their slight acquaintance the exact value it deserved , sud- denly restoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she showed some friendly attention to  |p107| the dog . Sylvia , however , seemed a bit remote . Observing that she was about to have her ears tousled , she side-stepped the caress , Mr. Parker apologizing for her frosty indif- the caress , Mr. Parker apologizing for her frosty indif- ference . Sylvia , he said , was a man 's dog . A hunter , you know . Elise accepted the explanation , wondering whether Sylvia 's attitude toward women was shared by her mas- ter . They walked out of the Post Office together , Elise com- pletely forgetting the apprehensions that had bothered her a few minutes earlier . It seemed the most natural thing in the world to be walking down the street talking to Mr. Parker and the fact that Leeds could see him accom- panying her home did not disturb her in the least . Grandpa 's indisposition being uppermost in her mind , she confided her anxiety , her tall companion manifesting a sympathetic interest which , thought Elise , was just what one might expect of him . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had called a doctor . Oh , no , ' she replied . Grandpa always knows what to do when he has these attacks . I do n't know what causes them . He always coughs very hard when he has them , whether he has a cold or not . And he has a lot of trouble with his feet ; shoes too tight . I wanted him to stay in bed today , but he says he positively must go out into the coun- try to see a boy who broke his leg yesterday . ' I do n't suppose there is anyone he could send in his place , ' suggested Mr. Parker . It sounds as if he should be quiet for a few days . ' quiet for a few days . ' Perhaps he 'll be all right , ' hoped Elise . He always takes a medicine that helps . I 've forgotten the name of it . He said last night that he had been neglecting it and had let himself down to about eighteen grains , whatever that may himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' How much does he weigh ? ' asked Mr. Parker , to Elise 's surprise , for the question was so decidedly irrelevant . Oh  --  about a hundred and fifty pounds . Why ? '  | ' I just wondered , ' drawled Mr. Parker . ' It was rather oil the subject , was n't it ? ' Grandpa says this boy has the worst break he ever saw . That 's why he 's so insistent on going to see him . He said it was " a Potts fracture , " whatever that is , ' explained Elise , smiling companionably over their mutual ignorance . Now you know all about it , do n't you ? ' He nodded his head , profoundly , seeming to pretend wisdom . Think your grandfather would object to giving me a ride with him out into the hinterland ? ' he inquired . ' I do n't know about that , ' replied Elise , mentally at- tempting a picture of Grandpa 's reaction to such a proposal . You might hint . Look ! He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the old man waited for them to ap- proach . An introduction was effected , her grandfather delighting her with his cordiality . ' Mr. Parker has just been saying that he envied you your drive out into the hills , ' said Elise , secretly hoping , for Grandpa 's sake , that he would invite Mr. Parker to come along , and reproaching herself for wishing , too , that it might turn out some other way . It would be pleasant to ask Mr. Parker in . After a long moment , during which the old doctor looked the newcomer over with an amusingly frank interest , he told Parker to hop in , if he did n't have anything better to do . ' I 'll let you drive , too , if you like . Dog going along ? Very well . Open that rumble .... Back about noon , Elise . ' It had all happened very quickly . Mr. Parker gave her a canny wink as he started the little car . She wondered if he realized what that brief gesture of comradeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' shrilled Dr. Graham , above the racket , after some desultory talk about the glorious weather and various points of local interest along the road . ' A time or two , ' Parker admitted ingenuously. % Make you sick to look at injuries ? ' Parker replied that he presumed he had an average stomach . I may ask you to lend me a hand , out here , if you do n't object . I put splints on this leg yesterday , but I was n't very well satisfied and I may decide to make a cast for it today . If so , I 'll need somebody to help hold it in position while I do the bandaging . Was going to ask one of the boys , but members of the family are n't much good . Too squeamish . Think you 'd be up to it ? Rather nasty business . ' I can try , ' agreed Parker obligingly , if you 're not afraidI 'll be in your way  --  or do the wrong thing . ' There wo n't be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Simple job of leg-pulling . You will take his foot and pull while I apply the bandages . They will be wet plaster , and when they dry out  --  there you are ! Hard as a rock . ' Sometimes you X-ray these bad breaks , do n't you , Doctor ? ' asked Parker artlessly . ' S-u-r-e ! That 's what should be clone , by all means , in this case . But these worthless Pipers have n't a dime . They never paid a doctor bill in their lives . I 've attended the arrival of all the children , and the total proceeds were a couple of hams and a few gallons of blackberries . I advised the X-ray , of course , just to be doing my duty , but they were against it . They 're as afraid of a hospital as they might be of a pest-house . No  --  in cases like this , we just do the best we can and trust to luck and Old Lady Nature . It 's amazing , the recuperative capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little car when they drew up under the shade of a big beech in front of the un- painted old house . A half-dozen male Pipers , assorted sizes of a single pattern , viewed the arrival with big , empty eyes , and hands thrust elbow-deep into the pockets of their tattered pants . Mrs. Piper , lacking several front teeth , rolled her thin arms in her brown apron and led the way into the bedroom that probably served as a parlor '  | ordinarily . Mr. Piper , in patched blue overalls , lounged into the room and leaned against the head of the iron bed , sucking a cold corncob pipe . Herman , eighteen , stood in the doorway , scowling sympathetically . The patient tried to grin , without much success . He admitted having had a bad night . Parker watched the old doctor with interest as he paternally chaffed his patient while unwrapping the bulky bandages made of torn-up , coarse , household sheets . I le+ .. found it difficult to keep from smiling as he surveyed the strange array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag he had carried into the house . Now , here , Mr. Parker , ' began Dr. Graham , you see what we have to deal with . See there ? Run your fingers gently along there . That bone  --  you 've probably forgotten your physiology  --  is the tibia . That 's the big one . That 's the bad one . Feel that ? Now this one  --  the fibula  --  you ca n't feel the break there quite so plainly , but it 's broken , too . Both bones broken above the ankle and the ends spread apart  --  so . Understand ? Now , when you pull the foot , it will have a tendency to straighten these fragments out to their proper position . I shall put on the plaster bandage while this tension is  --  after I 've manipulated the ends of the bones into place . Got it ? ' Sounds like it might hurt a little , ' observed Parker . We 'll give him a few whiffs of chloroform , ' confided the doctor , a private announcement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ? ' Parker inquired , wide-eyed . His father , ' replied Dr. Graham , adding , reassuringly , ' I 'll show him how . ' ' But  --  my God ! ' exclaimed Parker impulsively . Is n't that a frightfully risky thing to do ? ' Dr. Graham shook his head unconcernedly . ' I 'll keep an eye on him . This does n't call for a deep anaesthesia . I mean , ' he explained , ' he 'll not need very much . It will be safe enough . '  |p1l  lp1l l Well , thought Parker , if this does n't call for a deep anaesthesia , the Piper boy is going to be a cripple for life . He began to feel sorry for everybody connected with the absurd little tragedy . His amusement and amazement kept abreast as he helplessly watched the preparations for this strange surgical phenomenon . Herman , obedient to instruc- tions , came in from the barn with the long leather lines belonging to the buggy harness and anchored his brother 's shoulders to the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water and the rolled-up plaster-filled bandages were immersed. bandages were immersed . Soon as it stops bubbling , ' said Dr. Graham , sprinkling the swollen leg with talcum powder , we 're ready . ' For a moment , Parker was inclined to be indignant . What right had this old man to do such a slip-shod piece of work ? But , after all , what else was there left him to do under the circumstances ? We were ready now , it seemed . Father Piper , as sluggish an organism as had ever been set in motion among the higher primates , was instructed how to hold the wad of gauze into which the doctor had poured an ounce or more of chloroform . Young Jud 's apprehensive tension relaxed after a few eager sniffs at it . The air was already so heavy with the potent stuff that Parker wondered which one of them would go out first . Standing helplessly at the foot of the bed , he found his nails digging savagely into his palms . In a flash there re- curred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kicked the garbage-wagon to pieces when the alarm sounded , and galloped away from her degrading job to race alongside the gleaming apparatus as it went shriek- ing down the street . Parker 's fingers itched to lay hold on those young bones that throbbed for competent attention .... X-ray ? ... Parker had a picture of that Potts fracture in his head ! Of all the cruel detainments he had experienced since that fateful morning at Parkway Hospital , this moment of supine  | waiting for a broken old man to finish his feeble pottering , preparatory to sentencing a husky youth to hobble through life , demanded a type of self-restraint that was an offense to his soul . Do you reckon it will hurt him bad ? ' mumbled Mrs. Piper , her scrawny knuckles pressed hard against her wrinkled lips . The doctor says not , ' consoled Parker , feeling that she was at least entitled to whatever relief could be offered at the moment . There would be plenty of time , later , for Mrs. Piper to grieve . She would watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My poor boy . ' And when he was forty , the neighbors would speak of him as Crip ' Piper . There was a code of ethics in the medical profession . I t had been Parker 's religion . It was a built-in fixation . He would abide by it . But his nails cut his palms . Dr. Graham , with very shaky hands and a million tiny glistening beads of perspiration on his ash-white forehead , was manipulating the fractures . . Now , Mr. Parker , ' he said in a frail treble , take the foot firmly in both hands and pull steadily  --  not too hard . ' There was a strained look on his face as he turned to the little marble-topped table for the first of the plaster- saturated bandages . Parker saw him stagger and clutch at the table for support . Mrs. Piper , ' commanded Parker . Get Dr. Graham a chair and a glass of cold water .... Herman , come here and hold this foot exactly the way I 'm doing it .... Mr. Piper , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put it down  --  closer to the face ! That 's more like it . Do n't let it touch his nose , but keep it close . ' He took a sheet they had pulled off the bed and threw it over Piper 's forearm , and reached into the pan for a bandage . After a long minute of waiting , he muttered into Herman 's ear , Now , my son , you pull just as hard as ever you can ! ' The deft , vise-like compression of Parker 's hands as he rp113manipulated the fractures and tightly applied the bandage , together with Herman 's strong tug , fetched a yell from under the sheet that flattened a half-dozen Piper noses against the window-panes . That will do for the present , Mr. Piper , ' said Parker . Put that gauze aside . We will wait now until Dr. Graham feels a little better , and he will do the important part of thebandaging . ' In a few minutes the gallant old fellow had staggered back to the bedside . That 's excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe we 've got it now exactly where we want it . ' The business of applying the rest of the bandages went forward in a workmanly manner , Dr. Graham still breathing hard but in good spirits . After they had waited for the cast to dry sufficiently for the leg to be comfortably laid on a pillow , the doctor said they would be off now . Parker could hardly resist smiling as he walked out of the ramshackle house , past the tattered , barefooted Pipers , carrying Dr. Graham 's shabby old leather kit . He knew people who would have been in- terested in seeing a picture of it . For the first half-mile of execrable road , the old doctor had nothing to say , but when they came to smoother going on the gravel , and the increased speed stirred an invigorat  --  ing breeze , he seemed inclined to talk . Mr. Parker , ' he said respectfully , you were a great help to me out there . More , perhaps , than you realize . ' He chuckled to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this affair was written up for a medical journal , none of the city fellows would believe it .... How you ever man- aged to bind up that leg the way you did , I 'm sure I do n't know .... Did Piper go to sleep at his post ? I never heard a more blood-curdling howl than you got out of that boy Jud . But I believe we 're going to have a fairly good leg there , thanks to your strong hands . ' Parker idly dismissed the commendation with a remark that he had tried only to obey the doctor 's orders , playfully insisting that Dr. Graham was pleasantly exercising him talent for the traditional courtesy of the Southland . This being the old gentleman 's chief pride , he capitulated to t he handsome young Mr. Parker  --  horse , foot , and gunsand upon their arrival home , Parker 's protestation that he should not accept the pressing invitation to stay for dinner , on such short notice to the hostess , was clamorously over- ridden . ' My dear , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were seated at the table , ' this young fellow missed his calling . ' And when she begged for an explanation , he told her , with much merriment , the story of the morning 's adventure . Then , with great serious- ness , he said , ' All jesting aside  --  I 've seen doctors do worsejobs ! ' Parker drew a deprecatory grin and remarked , as in an aside to Elise , who beamed brightly over the little implica- tion of intimacy , ' Dr. Graham is having a spot of fun at my expense . ' It occurred to him that with more truth he might have said , ' And so have I. '  |p115IT  WOULD have been quite impossible for Nat  --  she had attended promptly to this abridgment  --  not to have ob- served , from the first , that Elise Graham was warmly in- terested in him . To a degree he shared this feeling and was comforted by a comradeship of which he stood vastly in need . After his many weeks of aimless wandering , almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of a major crime , and heart-sore over the sudden collapse of a promising career to which he had given him- self with full devotion , this charming and talented girl 's unrestricted proffer of confidence was  --  to say the least  --  soothing . He was hungry for companionship and here it was to be had without stint . It was the last night of 1929 . He had just returned from the Grahams ' , leaving at ten-thirty for reasons which he considered good . Something warned him against a tote-a- tcte celebration of the New Year at midnight , their close friendship having reached the stage where it needed only such a flick of the whip to send it galloping in a directionwhich , he had firmly resolved , it was not to take . For nearly a month , Nat Parker had been seeing Elise almost daily , cheerfully abetted by her indulgent grand- parent who , nonchalantly to-helling his earlier misgivings over the warrantable annoyance of the Vaughns , had welcomed the urbane stranger to his hearth and table with a cordiality that threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenient consideration due - the elderly by their juniors , the fine old gentleman had been increasingly reckless with his genial innuendoes . Desirous of nothing so much as the happiness of Elise , and observing her avowal of affection in every tone and gesture , he seemed to be viewing with impatience any further effort to conceal something that had now become plain as a pike- staff . Apparently nothing was further from his conjecture than that Parker might have any other opinion on this matter than his own . Leaving them alone together after supper on Christmas Eve , Dr. Graham had paused in the wide doorway of the living-room to gaze significantly at the mistletoe above his head , after which he had departed with an omniscient grin . Grandpa 's so fond of mistletoe , ' Elise had explained . ' He always hangs it there . ' And then she had added , in a confidential tone , Grandpa is simply impossible some- times . ' He 's a dear old fellow , ' Nat had replied . Loves to tease . ' Seriously taking stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , Parker thought he could truth- fully say that he had done little to add impetus to its de- velopment . From the first day of this acquaintance , Elise had appointed herself curator of their fellowship , adminis- tering its affairs with a generosity at once flatteringly trustful and giddily indiscreet . The situation , he now felt , was beginning to clamor for quite a bit of taking-in-hand . He knew he was not in love with Elise . Indeed , he had never been really in love with anybody . Young women had briefly stirred his interest , from time to time , but his profession had been so jealous a mistress that there was no chance for any of these budding romances to put forth a flower . After he had been obliged to make a half-dozen last-minute cancellations of engage- ments with some attractive girl , she became justifiably indignant or tiresomely petulant.  | For Woman  --  viewed as an institution  --  he was con- scious of a deep respect bordering on veneration . She stirred his protective instinct and appealed to his chivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been of such interest to him that her body seemed mysteri- ous too , even in the face of a scientific knowledge which , one would have thought , had long since made it as prosaic as the multiplication table . But Parker had never loved any one woman , not even Elise . His calmly considered judg- ment assured him that her undisguised affection for him needed no ampler explanation than the simple fact that at the moment there was nothing better she could do with it . Any other personable man , he believed , could have had it . However much or little they might have been mutually congenial under normal conditions , the peculiar setting in which Nat and Elise had discovered each other 's social isolation was highly inflammable . His own extended period of bitter loneliness and her hopeless frustration in dull littleLeeds had given their friendship a necessitous quality almost as urgent as if they had been shipwrecked and cast up together on a desert island . Parker liked her thoroughly , sincerely admiring her superb talent , her ready wit , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had been , for instance , the inevitable inquisition to be gone through with very early in their acquaintance , concerning the exact state of his heart and the degree of his liberty . Experience had taught him to expect this . He could not recall ever having conversed a second time with any girl whose curi- osity on this subject was entirely absent . It was not , he honestly believed , that these chance acquaintances had any designs on him as an individual , but rather as if their inquiries  --  impudently direct or playfully implied  --  were propelled by some instinct demanding them to ascertain where a man stood in relation to their species . Driven by this biological urge , Elise had maneuvered their talk into this quarter with all the premeditated cun- ning of an experienced chess-player until he was left with but one possible move . Tacitly acknowledging the stale- mate , he had conceded her a bootless victory , blandly in- viting her attention to other conversational activities , a decision she accepted with a smile . Perseverant as a spider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to jump through the hoop which she had suddenly thrust in his way ; and , upon noting his hesitation , had given him the encouragement of aheartening example by jumping through it herself , in the course of which adventure she had confided more thar she had any business to concerning her relation to Randy Vaughn who , she observed , had always taken too many things for granted . But the Vaughns were like that . I t was a congenital infirmity with the Vaughns to consider it an act of impiety on anyone 's part to deny them a request . Somewhat restless in the confessional , Parker had po- litely absolved Elise of any further obligation to the Vaughns , agreeing that her life should be her own to be disposed of as she wished  --  after which he had lighted a cigarette and irrelevantly asked her if she was acquainted with the full story of Franz Schubert 's composition of Symphony Number 8 in B ' Minor . She had listened to the tale with full attention . Tonight , as he was leaving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting into his coat-lapel one of the violets he had brought her in honor of the occasion . She had had to reach up a little and stood very close , looking up into his face , offering him a temptation which he was glad now he had been able to withstand , however awkward it had made him feel at the moment of ignoring the gift she had so clearly intended him to take . Nothing was plainer than that their relationship would now have to be repitched in another key , or he would be obliged to leave Leeds at once . It would be a very un- gracious thing to run away . The Grahams had taken him into their confidence almost as a member of their householdp119and at a time when he was all but desperate for congenial friends . He felt himself under an obligation to Elise and her gentle-hearted old grandfather . It could not he dis- charged by his going through the motions of requiting Elise 's affection . He wished there was something tangible he might do for her . A bright idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . He would try to give Elise a chance to demon- strate what she could do with her voice ! If all that she required was a public appearance , set up under influential auspices , he would provide the necessary funds . After much thought about the devices he would be ob liged to invent in an effort to bring this about , Parker sat athis desk and composed a letter of considerable length to his warm friend and confidant , Eugene Corley , junior member of the firm of Corley , Corley and Corley , his attorneys . The church bells rang and the whistle at the Dietz sawmill blew while he was signing his name to it . A new year had arrived . A sudden cold wave of utter dejection swept over him . He pushed the chair back from the desk and bowed his head in his hands . Sylvia strolled over from her corner and nuzzled into the crook of his elbow . Happy New Year ! Once , a sick man at Parkway , recently bereft of his wife , to whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night  --  he sometimes reached out a hand , and , waking , was gripped by a loneliness so utterly desolat- ing that he was physically chilled . The Baptist bell and the Methodist bell and the whistle at the Dietz sawmill clamored of a new year . Presently the midnight dissonance subsided , and little Leeds was quiet again . Parker had experienced many a dark hour since his renunciation of everything that life held dear . This hour was the darkest . He felt sure Elise had the letter today , for he had re- ceived one from Eugene stating that hers was going forward by the same post . Eugene had said that instructions were being followed in every detail . There was a pen-written - postscript chaffing him . As if it was n't enough for you to lose your job and your name , you seem now to have lost your heart . Do you still have your dog ? ' At eight , he strolled down to the Grahams ' . Elise met him at the door in a grand state of exultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be kissed . He was happy to meet this impetuous display of gratitude , tendered in the presence of her grandfather , who , with beaming eyes , hovered close behind her . Everything now was exactly as it should be , Parker felt . Elise was going to be his sister . Her chance to make something important of herself had driven her infatuation for him into complete eclipse . She hurried him by the hand into the living-room , pushed him down on the end of the davenport under the reading- lamp , thrust the epoch-making letter at him , and with all the spontaneous enthusiasm of a delighted child pressed her cheek against his shoulder , following the lines of the impressive document while he read aloud . The firm of Corley , Corley and Corley was pleased to advise Miss Graham that their client , Mrs. Norma Phelps , who frequently made small courtesy-loans ' to promising artists in need of ' an encouraging subsidy , ' having learned through Mr. Nathan Parker of Miss Graham 's unusual talent , desired to place at her disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Phelps 's immediate departure for Europe would make it impossible for her to manifest a more personal interest , at this time , in Miss Graham 's success . Whatever communication Miss Graham might wish to have with Mrs. Phelps should be cleared through the office of Corley , Corley and Corley . The sum of two thousand dollars had been placed in the Fidelity Bank of Louisville , subject to Miss Graham 's order . At her convenience , the money could be repaid , '  | with or without interest , as she herself might elect . If , for any reason , the contemplated promotion failed to achieve substantial results , Miss Graham need not consider herself obliged to restore the money , Mrs. Phelps assuming this risk of her own volition . Is n't it simply marvelous ? ' shouted Elise . You 'll help me , wo n't you , Nat ? I 'll need a lot of advice . ' Parker had worried more than a little over the trans- parency of this singular proposition . He felt greatly relieved to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had so great faith in her ability to justify the beneficence of her good angel , Mrs. Phelps . For all of two hours she bubbled with plans for the stupendous event which was to put her in line for distinc- tion , Parker amazed and touched by the evident time and thought she had previously given to this matter . It showed how passionately she had longed for some such thing to come to pass . And it would n't have been possible but for you , Nat , ' she paused once to declare gratefully , to which he replied that it was Mrs. Phelps who deserved all the credit . ' Do tell me what she 's like ! ' Elise settled herself com- fortably to hear a personal sketch of her benefactress . Tell me all about her ! ' Nat had not prepared for this , and never before having ventured to assume any of the prerogatives of the Creator , this bringing Mrs. Norma Phelps into existence with no construction materials at hand except her name , obliged him to do some rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five . In her stocking-feet , ' he added , hoping Elise , already in hilarious mood , might consider it droll enough to laugh at , thus permitting him a little more time to organize the good lady 's biography in such a manner as to reflect no dis- credit on her . Mrs. Phelps , he admitted , had an odd taste in hats . She was an inveterate globe-trotter and an ardent collector ; had long since given up maintaining a home ;  |p122lived  in hotels , and liked it . Elise , full of interest , wantedto know what Mrs. Phelps collected , and Nat promptly replied , ' Rugs . ' ' How funny ! ' observed Elise . ' What does she do with her rugs , having no home to put them in ? ' ' I do n't know ! ' replied Nat , with a gesture implying that Mrs. Phelps 's ways were , after all , inscrutable . ' You 'll meet her sometime , doubtless , and you can ask her . I 'm sure you 're capable of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so inquisitive . ' Next day , Nat Parker went to the city , at Elise 's re- quest , and laid her case before an experienced advertising man . They lunched with a feature writer who was quick to interest herself in the fascinating story of the ' discov- ery ' that had been made in little Leeds . ' Of course , there is no reason why anyone should try to tell you , Miss Davidson , who Mrs. Norma Phelps is or what all she has done to put unknown artists on their feet , ' remarked Mr. Parker craftily . He had prepared himself to expect that Miss Davidson might be a bit hesitant here and accept the statement  --  if she accepted it at all  --  on the first bounce . To his happy surprise , she caught it on the fly , running eagerly to meet it . ' Mrs. Phelps ! To be sure ! ' Why , the girl will be made ! ' Free discussion was had of Miss Graham 's relation to the late Colonel Brock , a beloved figure still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sounded concerning her grandfather 's long service , largely unrewarded , in be- half of the poor for whom he had traveled the back roads by day and by night for more than two score years . It was a good story , Miss Davidson said ; nor did she change her mind when Mr. Parker , taking leave of her , tarried at the little floral shop near the hotel entrance , to present her with a corsage of gardenias . ' With Miss Graham 's compli- ments , ' he said . ' She will be wanting to meet you and ex- press her thanks . '  | Having given this effective publicity a couple of days to soak into the imagination of the city 's musically inclined , Mr. Parker made another journey , taking Elise with him . They contrived to secure an interview with Darien Moore , the best-known accompanist in that zone , whose sponsor- ship of an unfamiliar name would carry great weight . He had seen the story about Miss Graham , and agreed that whoever received the sanction of Mrs. Phelps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his studio and he was delighted . She asked him if he would preside at the piano on the night of her recital and he consented . Before they left , Parker confided to Mr. Moore the size of the fee Mrs. Phelps had suggested in the event they were able to secure for Miss Graham the services of a widely recognized accompanist . Mr. Moore blinked a little . Whatever in- quiries may have floated through his mind respecting the identity of Mrs. Norma Phelps could now be safely dis- missed . The movement was gathering speed and momentum with such amazing ease that Parker was heartened to unplanned audacities . A parlor-recital for an exclusive group of potential patronesses was arranged for the coming week . It was a notable success . Nat Parker had certain qualms about the methods he was pursuing , but he knew he was n't cheating . He could deliver the goods , however shady was the technique of propaganda . The thing of it was , Elise could sing ! Any measure that would help her to her rightful chance was pardonable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the re- turning train , when it had become assured that the recital was being backed to the limit by the most influential people in town . It has been a lot of fun , ' he said , and I 'm very happy for you . Mrs. Phelps will be much pleased . ' That night he 1 , rote to Eugene Corley telling him that the recital , slated to occur on Tuesday night , the fourthp124of February , was  --  from advance reports  --  not only going to pay for itself , but net a nice little balance . This business of serving as an impresario , ' he con- cluded , has been full of excitement and adventure . I have met some of the most charming people I have ever known , and I have told more lies in the past forty-eight hours than the sum total of all I ever told in my life .... Quite incidentally , your recent kittenish comment imply- ing that I am in love with this girl convinces me that the subject is too much on your mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Nat 's advice , Elise had gone up to the city for two weeks of intensive work with Mr. Jaqua , her former vocal instructor . Not only would it serve to give her more confi- dence , but , they were all agreed , she should be free of homeresponsibilities . Mr. Jaqua was glad enough to give her this special at- tention . He was quite ecstatic over his favorite pupil 's good fortune , and the fact that he was about to bask in the reflected illumination of her talent made him garrulously enthusiastic . Who , indeed , had been chiefly responsible for the proper placement of that golden voice if not Jaqua ? He said this in several quarters , and in consequence was interviewed at length concerning his impressions of Miss Graham , thus adding fresh fuel to the bright bonfire of publicity which was lighting her path to glory . The whole event had now been set up in such a manner that Elise would have to do very badly indeed to escape the recogni- tion planned for her . Nat , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night before she left home , you think I am to make a little money with this recital . I am very anxious to give it to Clay , so he can matriculate at the medical school at the beginning of this next semester . ' Excellent ! ' approved Nat . You are a good girl . ' But  --  Grandpa borrowed six hundred dollars from Mr.p125Vaughn when I was studying , ' continued Elise , with a troubled voice , and it really should be paid back to him . Ica n't do both things . ' Why not ? Mrs. Phelps does not expect you to return her loan immediately . Pay back part of it now , and attend to Mr. Vaughn and Clay with the balance . ' Would that be quite fair ? ' Write to Mr. Corley , ' Nat advised , and tell him all about it . As Mrs. Phelps 's attorney , he will unquestion- ably approve .... I am very glad about your thought for Clay . My dear  --  there 's something fine in you that keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , with a self-deprecatory little gesture , that I should want to help my cousin , now that so much has been done for me ? ' No , ' said Nat brusquely , it is n't . Unfortunately the genius , possessed of an outstanding gift , is more often thannot afflicted with a badly inflamed ego . And a shocking capacity for self-indulgence . The very best thing about you , Elise , is your simplicity  --  and your ability to keep your head .... Have you said anything to Clay ? ' Not yet . I did n't want to take the risk of disappointing him . ' Good sense again . But now you may tell him . He should be given time to make his plans . The new semester will be opening in a few days . ' Elise was thoughtful . How could Nat be so sure that Mrs. Phelps , or Mrs. Phelps 's attorney , would sanction her wish ? He must be much closer to Mrs. Phelps than he had admitted . The query added mystery to the vasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was terra in- cognita . For a moment he seemed almost a stranger . And afterward ? ' she murmured , half to herself . After what ? ' asked Nat absently , for he , too , had been wool-gathering . After the recital . What am I to do then ? Come back here and wait for something to turn up ? Have you any further plans for me ? ' Her eyes queried him childishly . I ca n't expect you to stay here in Leeds very long . You do n't belong here . We both know that . You 've another world . I am not acquainted with it , but I know there is one . I 've tried to piece little scraps together and paint a back-drop for you , but there 's been very little to work on . Except for your early childhood , and the music , you might as well have lived on Mars , so far as my own information goes . ' She was very pensive , her moody eyes accusing him of not being quite fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , after a little silence , when you leave me ? ' It 's quite the other way about , ' countered Nat , seizing upon her last query . You will be leaving me . Your liber- ating chance is plainly in sight . Your career is just arriving . Mine , you see , has just ' He left the sentence un- finished , and when she prodded him with  --  Has just what , dear ? ' he replied , jocularly , Well  --  yours is nearly full-blown , and mine is too full-blown ; blown up , in fact . ' He ventured a little laugh , to prove that it did n't matter ; that he was readjusted . Nat  --  did you get into trouble ? ' Elise 's voice was tender . Yes  --  will you be content not to ask me anything more about it ? It 's a very painful subject . ' She nodded reluctantly and laid her hand on his . Will I ever be told ? ' she asked . Probably not . ' He rose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , ' continued Nat , your future is assured . I shall always be keeping track of you , wherever you are , wherever I am . ' Will there ever be anything I can do for you ? ' asked Elise , putting both hands on his arms affectionately . Yes ! ' he replied , almost gruffly . Succeed ! ' He turned away toward the door , altered his mood suddenly and said , with a companionable smile , I 'll be seeing you  --  on the triumphant Tuesday ! ' It 's almost as if we 'd been saying good-bye forever , ' murmured Elise.  | Dr. Graham and Clara Brock and Clay had proudly put her on the train , next morning , Clara reporting an hour afterward that Randy Vaughn had shown up at the station to offer his good wishes . Poor Randy , ' added Clara , offering Parker a chance to comment , he 's been feeling rather left out of things lately , I reckon . ' She laughed knowingly , as if they had a little secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made Clara laugh quite gaily , for Elise and Nat had not been able to fool her very much . She knew how that was going to turn out , and had known it from the first day they had set eyes on each other . ' I think Randy knows his suit is lost , ' she said , confidentiallymuffling her prediction behind her hand . Randy never had a case , ' agreed Parker , meeting her secretive mood . ' He should have known he could n't harness the Heavenly Maid to a plough . ' Clara missed the allusion , considered it an exuberant outburst of devotion , and squeezed his hand , whispering , You two ! ' He had a notion to detain her and attempt to set her right , but she had scurried away , satisfied that her suspicions had been happily confirmed . The days dragged abominably , Parker more restless than he had ever been in his life , his sole diversion  --  except for tedious evening hours with Jeff Trumbull  --  being Clay 's eagerness to be off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the one medical school that Parker knew from crypt to spire . It was sometimes difficult , in the face of the boy 's almost hysterical enthusiasm , not to offer some detailed information and a few helpful hints . Is n't Elise a brick ? ' he exclaimed fervently , watching Parker 's face for tokens ; hopeful of learning something . It runs in the family , I think , ' drawled his non-com- mittal friend . Very stout fellows  --  all of you .... You 'll likely make a famous doctor , Clay ; mostly because you want to . That 's the main thing . Some day I might live in your town and want my liver taken out . ' I 'd do it , ' said Clay happily , ' for nothing . ' I would n't get the full value of it that way . Anything you get for nothing is no good . I 'll pay for it . I 'll pay you now ! ' He drew out his wallet . There . Run down to Nash- ville tomorrow and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker sternly , it 's on account ! ' Clay tried to protest , but Parker was firm . The next morning , after breakfast , when he went up to his room , Clara was making his bed herself , which was unusual . For a little while she busied herself with her task , paying him no attention , and then she blurted out , explosively , half- crying , ' I do n't know why you 're so good to my boy , but he just loves you  --  and so do all the rest of us '  --  after which she bustled out of the room , very much overwrought . Dr. Graham was taking his meals , through these days , at the Mansion . The slight alteration of his mode of living was a bit exciting . He tarried to talk frequently , and in the genial buzz and stir of the little hotel he seemed to find pleasure . It was doubtful , however , whether this dis- traction from the calm routine of his quiet home was good for him . They marveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so , thinking to please him . It was true . He was spry . Too spry . One afternoon Parker accompanied him into the country to make a call , tactfully suggesting in the course of their conversation that physical exercise could easily be over- done . More people in mature life , he thought , were dam- aged by over activity than underactivity . Any of your relatives doctors ? ' inquired the old man . My father , sir . ' Ever go with him ? ... Ever see him set a broken leg , for instance ? ' ' No , sir . My father died when I was a small boy . ' You would have made a good doctor yourself , I think . '  | Thanks , ' said Parker , wondering how much more of this there was going to be . Ever consider it ? ' persisted Dr. Graham , measuring his words significantly . ' Oh , perhaps . ' Parker tried to be casual . Every boy toys with the idea at some time .... It 's nice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' On the Sunday evening preceding the recital , Dr Graham was quiet and pale . He ate little and tottered feebly out of the dining-room . Parker could hear him in the hall as- suring Clara there was nothing the matter except a little shortness of breath . Shortly after nine , it suddenly occurred to Parker , who had retired to his room early to read , that he should stroll down to the Graham house . It was in darkness except for the little office where a single light glowed through the shutters . He rang the bell , rapped with his knuckles on the door-panel , and after long waiting , turned the knob . Dr. Graham , wide-eyed with agony , was seated astride a chair , his hands clutching the top , desperately struggling for breath . It was evident that he was badly frightened , as he had a right to be . His nails and lips were cyanotic . Parker laid a hand on his shoulder . Anything I can do ? ' he asked sympathetically . The old man pointed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Parker held it open on the back of the chair . After much frantic rummaging , a tar- nished hypodermic case was fetched up from the depth of the clutter of tools and bottles , and the doctor tried un- successfully to open it with cold , impotent hands . This was no time , decided Parker , for an attempt to preserve his secret  --  not at the risk of another man 's life ! He tossed the worn old bag aside and took the hypo- dermic case from Dr. Graham 's hands . Opening it , he laid out the steel syringe and what seemed to be the best of the small assortment of needles . He found a test-tube and heated a small quantity of water over a candle-flame ,  | the old man 's anguished eyes following him closely . Ile looked over the long , slim vials of tablets in the old-fashioner I case , and tapped one out of the morphine tube . ' A quarter ? ' he inquired . Dr. Graham nodded . The tablet was quickly dissolved in the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the shank of the needle deftly screwed on . The old man was fumbling with his sleeve button . Parker bared the arm , polished a little spot with a wisp of cotton saturated with alcohol , grasped the pathetically flabby skin with experienced fingers ; and , tipping up the syringe , pushed the piston gently to expel the air . He caught Dr. Graham 's searching black eyes , realizing that if nothing he had done , so far , had given him completely away , surely this last telltale gesture with the hypodermic instrument would settle the matter . It was quite beyond belief , he knew , that a lay- man would go about this business with the quick preci- sion which certified to thorough understanding and long practice . The administration of the drug was adroitly , painlessly accomplished , Parker gently massaging the little bump with his thumb after the needle had been withdrawn . The effect was almost instantaneous . The doctor drew several long sighs and began to relax . Then he looked steadily for a minute into his young friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have known it  --  that day  --  out at Pipers '  --  when you reduced the Potts ... I did know it when I took off the cast ! ' ' Would you mind  --  keeping this a secret , Dr. Graham ? ' said Parker . ' I have good reasons for asking . ' ' It 's a pity , ' mumbled the old fellow . ' It 's a secret ? ' repeated Parker . ' Not even Elise ! Agreed ? ' Dr. Graham nodded , and clung tightly to Parker 's arm as they proceeded to the living-room . ' I 'm afraid I shall not be able to go to Elise 's recital . ' ' No , ' said Parker , ' nor shall I unless you are much stead- ier in the morning . Be at ease now . I 'm staying with you tonight . ' Thank you , Dr. Parker . ' The tired old voice was very husky . Your name is Parker , is n't it ? ' No ... Perhaps you 'd better give your poppies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawl . Thank you  --  Doctor . ' It was a great disappointment to miss witnessing Elise 's coronation , but Nat felt that his first duty kept him close to the fine old man in Leeds . Unable to go , he ordered a great armful of roses , wired encouragement before and congratulations after , reassur- ingly explaining her grandfather 's absence on the ground of extra pressure of emergency work ' which was nearly true , since the old gentleman was at that time putting in twenty-four hours a day trying to keep a worn-out pump going . Next morning , he jubilantly read to Dr. Graham  --  obediently in bed  --  the abundant and flattering press re- ports of the mighty victory . All the rich adjectives of unlimited commendation were sprinkled generously through the chronicles of the season 's outstanding musical event . ' It 's what she has always dreamed of , ' said the old man weakly . And she has you to thank for it  --  Doctor . ' Elise was to arrive home that evening at eight . Her grandfather watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . Clara stayed with him while Nat went to the train . As she descended from the steps of the Pullman to the old wooden platform , it was quite evident that something epochal had happened to Elise . She had realized her pos- sibilities ; had glimpsed her destiny . She had gone up to the city a half-frightened girl , and had returned a self-pos- sessed woman , calmly conscious of her new estate . From now on , henceforward  --  her manner said  --  she was insured . Parker was delighted . In the loose-jointed little taxicab , she did not let herself splutter a torrent of superlatives , as he had anticipated while waiting for her train . Elise was a confident artist now . She reached for his hand in the dark , but he knew that her thoughts were on more important matters . ' I 've been having a very interesting correspondence wit h Phelps , thanking her for everything . Mr. Corley replied Mr. Corley , ' she said casually . ' Naturally I wrote to Mrs. that he was forwarding my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph . So I sent him one - - you remember , the one with the little black hat . ' ' Eugene will like that one , I know , ' agreed Parker . ' Yes  --  he does . So  --  then  --  I asked him if he could n't send me a picture of Mrs. Phelps to hang in my studio . the one I 'm going to have . ' ' And he sent you one ? ' ' No ; he said that unfortunately they had no photograph of Mrs. Phelps , but seeing I was transacting all of my busi- ness with her through him , he would , if I desired it , send nie one of his photographs . Was n't that odd ? ' ' Well  --  no ; not for Eugene . Is it a pretty picture ? ' ' Marvelous ! ... And Mr. Laughton , the booking-agent , is coming down to talk over contracts and such things on Saturday . ' ' Excellent ! ' said Nat , still smiling in the dark . ' And I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Sinclair  --  wife of the Robert Sinclair , you know  --  attended the reception . She was visiting her sister , Mrs. Carter . You remember . You met her . Mrs. John Fielding Carter . Mrs. Sinclair 's husband is prom- inently connected with Trinity Cathedral . Has a lot to say about the music . It 's a male choir , of course , but I 'm to sing a solo on Easter morning , and I 'm to be Mrs. Sinclair 's house guest . Is n't that marvelous , Nat ? ' He tried to keep pace with her enthusiasm . Privatelyp133he was browsing among the memories he cherished of the most important woman he had ever known and her recur- rent allusions to Trinity Cathedral . She had wanted him to go there , some day , and see for himself . She had hoped he would meet her Dean Harcourt . How strangely one 's life seemed to proceed on a definite orbit , as if predeter- mined from Without ! mined from Without ! For a fleeting moment he toyed with an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible that all the bother he had given himself , these past few weeks , in Elise 's behalf was for the purpose of driving him  --  willy- nilly  --  into the presence of the great Harcourt ? ... Ridicu- lous ! lous ! ' You 'll go , wo n't you , Nat ? ' Elise was insisting . ' Go ? ' His voice came back from a long distance . ' On Easter  --  to hear me sing  --  at Trinity Cathedral . Promise ! ' ' Yes , ' he answered soberly.  | SPRING had been in no hurry . Indeed , she was so sluggish that many of the temperamentally frail of faith had begun to wonder if the whole Universe had not been slowed up by the economic depression . But early in the second week of April , as if suddenly startled wide awake , lethargic Spring had developed an amazing energy , arriving in a few hours at full gallop and steaming hot , attended by excited convoys of overdue robins and bluejays . A noisy and colorful pageant of thunder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nearly clean as it was likely ever to be . Hyacinths , tulips , and daffodils popped up like mushrooms . On teeming side- walks , tops and marbles screamed above the din of the hurdy-gurdy for their ancient rights in the dizzying con- fusion of roller-skates and skipping-ropes . In the parks , new perambulators and old canes made long slim parallel lines and neat little round holes in the spongy gravel paths . The big busses careened top-heavily as they sputtered along Lake Boulevard with top decks crowded and plenty of room inside . The big aviary in Madison Park was a pandemonium of shrieks and squawks in every key and a-flutter with loose feathers of every hue . And everywhere the hope-reviving scent of warm , moist earth was in the air . This impetuous advent of belated Spring had put the spur to every manner of business affected by the seasons ,  |p135crowding  the streets , the shops , the suburban trains . Harried merchants , who in exasperation had daily watched great splotches of wet snow ironically blurring the windows they had decorated with straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluffies , now found themselves so busy that some of the more optimistic said , ' We have turned the corner . ' Sonia , happily weary after a long Saturday 's profitable toil in her small but elegant Parisian shop , had felt justified in the unaccustomed extravagance of a taxi , telephoning in the unaccustomed extravagance of a taxi , telephoning home immediately before taking it . Unlocking her apart- ment door , she smiled , sniffed appreciatively , and followed the aromatic trail of a sizzling steak . Phyllis , dear , ' she chided , ' you 're much too tired to be doing that . We should have gone out . But now you 're at it , I certainly am glad . I 'm tired as a cart-horse and hungry as a wolf . ' So am I. It will be ready in five minutes . ' Lingering in the doorway of the snug little kitchen , Sonia carefully lifted off her swagger spring hat and surveyed the impromptu cook with affectionate admiration . ' I believe I 'll put in a line of aprons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finesse , provided you will con- sent to act as model and show them off . Of course , no apron could ever hope to look like that on anybody else , but a lot of women might think it would . What an adorable figure you have , Phyllis . ' Thankee , mum . ' Phyllis bobbed a kitchen curtsey . ' Faith an ' ye ought to know , mum , a-wearin ' a sixteen , and it 's many a tear Oilve shed fer ye , what with yer a-drinkin ' 1 h ' coffee black , and a-rollin ' on th ' floor ivry blessed morn like an animal to presarve yer a-lookin ' like a high school like an animal to presarve yer a-lookin ' like a high school lass ... But it 's a good thought , ' she went on , abandoning her foolery  --  ' about the aprons , I mean . If our customers are to do their own work , they may as well look their best . We 'll dignify the kitchen and glorify the apron and make cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough time selling that sublime idea to me , ' scoffed Sonia . ' I hate greasy pots and pans  --  and I thank God I do ! ' ' That 's because you have another job , ' argued Phyllis . ' If it had been your destiny to run a house , and circumstances forced you into the kitchen , you 'd welcome any- thing that would make your drudgery less ugly . Perhaps if we sold pretty aprons , we should be contributing that much to the ' Oh , yes , I know , ' broke in Sonia teasingly  --  ' to the sum of human happiness . That 's what the Dean would say . ' And he would be right  --  as usual . ' ' Yes , dear . Everything one does should somehow 1w good for the troops . You still believe that ; do n't you ? ' ' And so do you , ' retorted Phyllis , ' for all your pretended spoofing . ' ' Of course . I just wanted to hear you say your cate- chism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that platter .... Now  --  scram !  --  unless you want to eat this cold . ' The intimate friendship of the two had become firmly established almost immediately upon their chance meeting at Trinity Cathedral more than four months ago . Sonia , momentarily serving as Dean Harcourt 's ' secretary , ' had met the charming stranger in the reception parlor . After a minute 's friendly talk , she had returned to the Dean , say- ing , ' A very lovely girl , cultured , in her early twenties , wants me to tell you that Phyllis is here . Perhaps you will know . ' ' Yes  --  I do , ' replied the Dean quietly . ' Bring her in  --  and after about twenty minutes , come back . ' Phyllis , quite calm and self-possessed , had followed along until they reached the familiar library door which she had so often entered with her mother . Entirely unaware of the tender relationship between the attractive caller and Dean Harcourt , Sonia had opened the door expecting the girl top137enter rather diffidently . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to turn away , Sonia heard a little cry of mingled sorrow and relief , and had a fleeting glimpse of Phyllis  --  her well-disciplined reserve utterly tossed aside  --  as she rushed across the room like a frightened child running to her mother 's arms . Obedient to instructions , Sonia returned after a while . Phyllis had drawn up a chair very close beside Dean Har- ourt 's , and had regained her composure , though it was evident that she had given way to her grief . Come here , Sonia , ' said the Dean gently . ' My Phyllis Dexter  --  and yours , too , I think  --  has been very badly hurt . Her father and mother , both warm friends of mine , recently met tragic deaths and her home is consequently broken up . She has just returned from England . Her only sister is in the hospital , convalescent from an illness . The other relatives live elsewhere . There are plenty of friends to whom she might go , people who would welcome her , but You mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonia entreatingly , confidentially , almost as if Phyllis were not present . ' Yes , you are going to take her for a few days  --  until she decides what next to do .... You see , dear , ' tightening his clasp on Phyllis 's hand , ' I knew what Sonia would say . ' ' Thank you  --  Sonia , ' murmured Phyllis , looking up with admiring eyes . ' I want to go with you . ' ' It 's like this , ' explained the Dean meditatively . ' If Phyllis goes out to the Sinclairs or the Duncans or almost anywhere else among the people with whom the Dexter family has been intimate , they will keep her thinking and talking about her trouble and treat her with the well- intended but thoroughly enervating compassion that delays prompt readjustments .... Now , run along , and see what you make of each other . ' Phyllis had risen , pensively grateful , laying her hand on Sonia 's arm in a little gesture of confidence . Sonia hesitated , and seemed suddenly depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the words came reluctantly , almost inaudibly  --  about  --  about me ? ' Phyllis , ' said the Dean soberly , do you believe there is anything I could tell you about Sonia that would alter your present estimate of her ? ' For an instant the two women looked each other squarely in the eyes . Phyllis 's lips parted in a smile , and she slipped her arm through Sonia 's , their fingers interlacing . Does that answer your question , Sonia ? ' asked the Dean gently . You are very good to me , ' she said , barely above a whis- per , again as if they were alone . They left the room , arm in arm , turning at the door to smile a farewell . Without any silly conceit , each was aware that the pair of them offered a startling contrast in feminine pigments  --  Sonia a striking brunette , hair so black it was blue , skin so white it was almost pallid ; Phyllis with yellow- gold bobbed curls , dark brown eyes , and pink cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the door was closing and they paused  --  Gaul and Saxon at their fittest , heads close together  --  to hear his parting injunc- tion , suspecting from the merry twinkle in his eyes that it was not going to be a very solemn utterance . ' If you two highly gifted women , ' he said slowly , are as different on the inside as you appear on the outside , you should have an interesting friendship . ' What do you think ! ' exclaimed Phyllis , as Sonia joined her at the table . Pat 's coming ! ' For Easter ? How jolly ! ... No potatoes , thanks . ' Gets here Thursday evening ; stays through Tuesday . Look  --  I 'll read you : " I am very anxious to see your Sonia , and I think she is a darling to want me to come By the way , does n't anybody in the whole world know that you have another name besides Sonia ? ' No  --  but I 'd like some of the Worcestershire sauce . Proceed , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of crowding you , as is likely if her apartment is as tiny as mine . " ' I 'll wire her a night letter to ease her mind .... And the pepper .... I can sleep comfortably on the davenport . No , little one , you 're too long-legged .... Does she talk like a university professor ? Her racket is English , is n't it ? I hope I 'll pass . I 've just flunked in Modern History . ' Sonia ! You do n't mean Of course I do ! The man is n't in love with me . He is lonely and Celeste likes me and that 's about all there ever was to it . I interest him because I 'm not too hard to look at , and know how to wear my clothes , and pick the right spoon , and am amusing to his little girl . But he does n't love me and I 'm not the least tiny mite in love with him . Really  --  I think Andy was relieved when I told him so . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would never feel comfortable . And there 's another reason - plenty good , too  --  that you do n't know about . ' On two or three previous occasions when confidences were being exchanged , Sonia had cryptically turned the knob of her closet-door with a hint that there was a rattle- able skeleton . If you ever want to tell me , dear , I 'll listen , ' said Phyllis quietly . And if it 's anything very bad , I wo n't believe it . ... I 've a letter from Grace , ' she continued , when it had become apparent that Sonia had no notion of pursuing the veiled topic . How is she liking it by now at Saint Agnes ' ? ' Well , for one thing , she has more liberty than I supposed . It 's an Anglican institution . I do n't think their regulations are quite as severe as the older sisterhoods .... I would like to read you part of it . She says  --  " Sooner or later I would have come here in any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing that happened to us brought me to a prompt decision . There was nothing I could have done for you . I would have been just one more problem on your hands . I 'm utterly impractical . If I had tried to go through the motions of making my own living , I would have been a mere pen- sioner on the charity of an employer who might have taken me on for Father 's sake . " ' Do n't read it to me , dear , ' murmured Sonia , when Phyllis had paused for an instant . ' It sounds very private . ' ' But I 'd like to talk it over with you . Let me go on ... " Frankly , I had grown tired of the World . It was n't the Flesh , which I always had fairly well in hand , or the Devil , who is just a fantastic old myth ; but the World , in my opinion , is n't a natural habitat for a creature of my dis- position . " ' ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonia . ' She must be awfully funny . ' ' Grace inherited her dry humor from our mother . ' You got quite a generous share of it yourself , Phyllis , besides the gift of her eyes , her mouth . Your resemblance to your mother 's picture at your age is the most amazing likeness I ever saw .... Well  --  go on ! Grace 's letter promises to be good . ' " I do n't feel a bit like a dependent here , " ' read Phyllis . ' Even if Father had n't made that lavish gift , back in ' 25 , I would have no misgivings about putting in at Saint Agnes ' . The people who support this institution get their money 's worth out of us . They know we pray for them , which is of course only common decency on our part ; though , personally , I would be willing to do my share of that , anyway . I know some of them very well and I think I can say  --  without betraying any secret  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Sister Cecilia , who is presumed to read all our out- going mail , may stroke her pretty chin and wonder whether the foregoing paragraph is discreet , but I do n't see how she can consistently delete it , for if our benefactors are not inneed of our supplications , we are wasting a good deal of our time , and we rather pride ourselves here on the worth- whileness of our daily intercession . " ... Evidently , ' corn-  |p141mented  Phyllis , ' Sister Cecilia decided to let this indis- cretion pass . ' ' Something tells me I 'd rather like that censorship job , ' drawled Sonia . ' Frightfully entertaining ! ' ' You may want to know why I grew tired of the World . I 'll tell you . In the first place , it 's too noisy , and growing noisier every day . Many of the newer noises are leading to mental decay . The World has now quite passed the point where an individual may decide whether or not to take the risk of listening to the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the observation car , on the highway . There is no place left where one is protected from the throaty sobs of bad music set to worse grammar . Do n't misunderstand me . I have no quarrel with these soloists . Doubtless they are very fine people . Nor am I contending that the general public is to be criticized for liking and wanting this sort of entertainment . The fault is entirely with me . The World loves it : I do n't . I am pleased to be insulated against it . ' There is a high stone wall around this place and it is three miles from the town . No motors , no automatic rivet- hammers , no crash and clatter of elevated railroads ; no ambulance sirens shrieking that another pair of people , showing off their recklessness , have met head on and cata- pulted through their windshields . And , what is much more important  --  no speeches ! You ca n't realize , until you 've experienced it , the ineffable peace that derives from one 's knowledge that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogant , opinionated men who harangue the World from every corner . I believe I could have stood the World if it had n't been for the loud vulgarity of the people who are trying to save it . " ' ' I wonder what the Dean would say to that , ' speculated Sonia . ' He would probably agree , ' thought Phyllis , ' though he might say it differently . ' But that was n't all I wanted to escape from . I was weary of a world of haste , worry , strain , and artificial whoopee ; weary of the frantic struggle to say and do the things that happened to be the vogue , this week , in our social set ; weary of sour grins across the bridge table and the poor sportsmanship of losers ; weary of trying to decide whether I would rather be a fuddled giggler at the country club or refuse the cocktails and be sneered at for a prig anda spoil-sport . And I was tired of being pawed and mussed by men for whom I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag that they did n't know one picture from another , and ridiculed classic music , and had n't read a book all the way through for two years ; had n't anything but money ( and now had n't even that  --  which made their poverty complete ) . They could n't talk to you intelligently ; seemed to think you ought to feel yourselfflattered if they tousled you ... " Look , Sonia ! ' Phyllis reversed the page , showing where three lines had been carefully inked out . That must have been too thick for our Cecilia , ' chuckled Sonia . I wonder if she grinned when she read it . ' Of course , ' Phyllis declared . She 's a woman . There is n't a woman on earth who would n't think that was amus- ing . ' ' Here at Saint Agnes ' , there is pleasant work to do . We have an excellent library , pianos , orchestral records for our recreation hours . The garden is lovely . Each of us has a little plot of her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serviceable things of leather , wood , brass , silver , and clay . Some of us specialize in needlework . Afternoons at five we assemble for a half- hour 's organ recital and the vesper service . Nobody preaches about the mistakes of the Government or what would become of us if we had another war . It is all very peaceful . ' I want you to come here , some day , and see me . You may find it uneventful , for you will not be permitted to staylong enough to cool off . The calmness is just a bit bewilderinguntil your nerves have had a chance to relax their ten/sion . That takes some time , depending of course on how badly diseased they were . " Do n't worry about me . I am not morbid . I am not moping . I am not fanatical . I am not goofy . We have a good time . We laugh with each other and at each other  --  not boisterously , but merrily . There is no talk of money  --  either to prattle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frets because she ca n't afford to buy the hat that would make Mary Doe 's hat look --  " Phyllis paused to explain . Cecilia has scratched out a word here and written " out-moded " above it . What do you suppose it was ? ' Lousy , ' suggested Sonia . That 's what the World was calling a bad hat when Grace retired ... In fact it 's a good word yet  --  for a bad hat , ' she added thoughtfully . " Nor am I worrying for fear the lapels on my last sea- son 's spring jacket may be three-eighths of an inch too nar- row . Saint Agnes ' does n't bring out a new model very often ; has n't , at least , since I 've been here . And in that length oftime , out in the World , I might have had two complete new outfits and already be looking like something that ought to be under glass in the Smithsonian ... Do n't pity me . I do n't need it . " ' Sounds good , does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired .... Any more ? ' ' Just a few lines . " I have n't many responsibilities here , and am still childishly indulged by my betters . They seem to understand that I came here in response to a push rather than a pull . I 'm not yet sure whether I have a vocation . ' ' Maybe it 's a vacation , ' observed Sonia . Whatever it is , I ca n't help envying her . All that peace and quiet . ' And not having to keep in style , ' added Phyllis . That reminds me ! ' Sonia pushed back her chair and beckoned Phyllis to follow her into the modernistic living- room . Opening a box and tossing aside the tissue-paper , she held up for inspection a sport blouse . ' That , ' she declared , with conviction , ' is the best-looking beige we 've ever had ! '  | Monday had been another very active day in the little shop until about four when , as usual , business slacked . Sonia had retired to the tiny cubicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phyllis , ' she called , get out ! We 're through for today except for this desk-work and you ca n't do anything about that . Run along . I 'll be home about six-thirty . ' Strolling for a few blocks on downtown Lake Boulevard , Phyllis boarded a bus , leaving it at the corner of Madison Park , where she sauntered for a while among the formal flower-beds , inhaling the fragrance of the fresh spring blooms . The massive towers of Trinity Cathedral , across the way , were casting long shadows . The carillon was booming Lead , Kindly Light . ' She was not often alone , these days . Perhaps that was just as well . Sonia had been a precious darling , had taken her into the shop and given her a chance to be busy ; useful , too , Phyllis believed , reassured by her sales-slips and Sonia'sincreasing confidence in her ability . And Sonia had taken her into her home , where she had been happier than she had ever expected to be again after the sudden devastation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bewildering novelty of the new scene had rubbed down to something like a settled order , and the days had been regimented , Phyllis was beginning to find herself occasionally inundated by an almost suffocating wave of unrest . Work in the shop had been quite a lark , at first ; ever so much more pleasant than she had anticipated . Remembering stories she had read about the trying experi- ences of sales-people , she had fortified herself to deal with women whose attitudes might range all the way from pity- ing condescension to insufferable hauteur , deciding in ad- vance that she would probably prefer forthright rudeness to toplofty compassion . To her happy surprise , there had been very little of this , and what little there was had been merely amusing . She had talked about it to Sonia.  | Both right , ' Sonia had declared laconically  --  you and the stories you used to read . There has come a great change . The customer is n't quite so sure of herself . She does n't know what minute she 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in all the shops . And worse man- ners on the street . ' Phyllis had asked for further light on this psychology and Sonia had elaborated her theory . I figure it this way , ' she said judicially . Many men whose positions were secure , a little while ago , are now on tenterhooks for fear they 'll lose their jobs or have to take a cut that will damage their pride and curtail their budget . They go about , all day long , smiling and smirking and yes- sir-ing and after-you-sir-ing ; and when they get out on the street they 've simply got to compensate for the day 's boot- licking . Of course after they 've had the big cut , and are doing twice the work for half the salary , then they begin to be a little more considerate . I 'm afraid I have n't any formula that will explain this part of it . I just know it 's true . But you can depend on it , young fellow , when some big , red-faced bruiser tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wheel at a right-hand turn , or angles close to the curb so he can splash you , he has n't got his cut yet , but has spent a bad day of crawling about on all fours , hoping to stave it off . ' ' Is n't that a pretty low estimate of people 's general character ? ' Phyllis had asked , rather ingenuously . Perhaps , ' agreed Sonia , adding dryly , Experience has taught me to practice some restraint in making up that invoice . ' This afternoon , perhaps because of fatigue , Phyllis was gradually slumping into a mood of dejection such as she had not experienced for many weeks . The future looked gray . Her awareness of being utterly bereft swept her all the way through . Impulsively she decided to attempt a brief glimpse of the Dean . Happily for her , only one caller remained in the reception parlor and in a few minutes herw  | case was dispatched . Mr. Talbot came in , smiled pleasantly , and said , You know the way . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without speaking , raised the hand he offered her and held it tightly in both of hers , pressing it hard against her throat. throat . Somebody been hurting you ? ' he asked gently . She did not answer for a moment , but stood with down- cast eyes slowly rubbing her soft chin against the back of his hand . Then , suddenly brightening , she shook her head and seated herself opposite him . Everybody 's been good to me , ' she said , forcing a smile . Sonia especially . Sonia 's wonderful .... I think these warm spring days make one restless . I ca n't remember ever hav- ing been so  --  so caged . Does one grow more restless , in springtime , as one grows older ? ' No . It is a physiological phenomenon , ' replied the Dean playfully , common to later adolescence . By thirty , the attacks are said to be quite harmless . I think the actu- arial figures on sad spring poetry report that the peak of arial figures on sad spring poetry report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April by persons in their twenty-second year . ' Phyllis pulled a pensive little smile and shook her head . Twenty-three , ' she corrected . Going on twenty-four .... Going on going where , going on doing what , going on being what ? ... Are you ashamed of me ? ' ' No  --  not ashamed , ' mused the Dean , but I presume you should be quarantined until you get over it . It 's con- tagious . ' Speaking of quarantine , I 've a long letter from Grace . ' So have I. Good place for her , down there . Valuable institution . There ought to be more of them . Perhaps there will be , some day . We ca n't afford it now ; have to spend all our money making new trinkets and whim-whams for Mars . our money making new trinkets and whim-whams for Mars . There has been a great change in Mars . He used to be a brave and burly old ruffian who made his own tools ; whit- tled out his bows and arrows ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've indulged him until he is n't content with last year 's machinery . We 've humored him with ex- pensive luxuries until I fear he has become somewhat of a coward . Quite a different fellow , shooting ten-thousand- dollar cartridges at long range , from what he was when he fought in the open with a long-handled axe . I 'm afraid his character is deteriorating .... Well  --  what I meant to say  --  we 'll probably call a halt on this big expense , some- time , and that will leave us a little money to spend on other institutions . I should like to see a number of walled towns built where people may go who ca n't bear the racket and confusion of the modern world . They could study , medi- tate , create new art-forms , compose music , verse , plays , literature . And raise their own vegetables . ' ' How does one get in ? ' inquired Phyllis , falling into step with his whimsical mood . ' I was just coming to that . Whenever any man declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dickens , and expresses his belief that the times are out of joint , he could be sent there for an indeterminate period , exactly as we put people away who suffer from any other serious halluci- nation . ' ' Would n't some people want to go there just because they were lazy ? ' ' Doubtless  --  but we should have the lazy to keep , any- way , ' observed the Dean . ' It would add nothing to the general expense . ' ' But , ' queried Phyllis , remembering the ' Brook Farm ' experiment and other similar sequestrations , ' do you think these maladjusted people , who ca n't get along in the world , could be entirely happy penned up at close quarters with one another ? ' ' Probably not ; but that is n't the point . They would not be at large , contaminating persons who are free of the com- plaint .... My thought is , ' soliloquized the Dean , ' that all our restless people  --  particularly those given to expressing their views in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to be considered a component part of the social order , believing in it , hopeful for it , sharing itsrisks , burdens , joys  --  not as spectators and reporters but participants  --  understanding its wistfulness , its infirmities , its internal contest of the angel and the tiger  --  or preferred to withdraw behind some walled enclosure and say , " Go by , mad world . " ' I 've often thought , Phyllis , that our conventional state- ments of Christian faith are inadequate at this point . We seem to be doing so little to improve the public 's estimate of our civilization . We practice a very faulty psychology , pleading on the one hand for world fellowship , neighbor- liness , and faith in the ultimate victory of the good , the true , and the beautiful , but spending the best of our time and energy berating the world for its disabilities . Instead of these flagellations , we should be offering a graphic pic- ture of civilization as it stood a hundred years ago , three hundred , five hundred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in our pulpits and journals of religious opinion about the greed of the so-called capitalistic system , but mighty little about free clinics , day nurseries , hospitals forcrippled children , parks and playgrounds , maternity homes for unfortunate girls and a myriad of rehabilitation schemes which the World had n't dreamed of so recently as a half- century ago . ' The trouble is , some of us are too impatient . We forget how rapidly we have come from the jungle and observe only how slowly we are approaching the Golden Age . Or , if forced to admit ourselves better off today than men were a hundred years ago , we contend that we are standing still now . And , of course , this ca n't be true . Civilization is an organism  --  like a tree . If it ever is required to give a finalaccount of itself , the Great Forester who cuts it down will find on its stump hard , narrow rings made by eras of drought and struggle to survive , and broad , pulpy rings left by sea- sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of ring to testify to every year of that growth !  |p149At  present , we 're making a narrow , hard , tough one ! But it 's growth ! ... Why ca n't we see that ? ' For some time Dean Harcourt sat silently contemplating the Holman Hunt picture toward which his gaze so fre- quently wandered when he talked . Phyllis 's eyes followed his and lingered on the placid face . ' He was n't impatient , ' said the Dean reverentially . ' It 's a wonder a person so sensitive as that did n't run away from it all , and live by himself , ' ventured Phyllis . ' He did think of it  --  once . Do n't you recall the wilder- ness ? ' ' Why  --  of course ! And was tempted to turn stones into bread , so He would n't starve to death . ' ' It was n't a matter of starving . A friend of His had livedout there for years  --  eating locusts and wild honey .... No - it was n't that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to make it a suitable place for people to live in . ' ' And decided that the big thing was bread ? ' queried Phyllis , with increasing interest . ' Well , He was tempted to think so , ' answered the Dean , ' because He was very hungry . For a little while it seemed to Him that if the World could solve the bread problem , the other questions would solve themselves . It was for bread that nations made war , and neighbors quarreled , and traders cheated , and robbers stole . If you could find some way to feed the World all it wanted to eat  --  some magical process such as Stones  --  be bread !  --  you would dispose of all the World 's grief and confusion and enmity in an hour . ' ' And I believe it would , too ! ' declared Phyllis . Again Dean Harcourt was silent for some moments , deep in reflection . Then , as if returning from a long distance , he &aid; softly : ' Ile did n't think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle and decided that bread ' was n't the solution . ' ' But we think so , ' said Phyllis , ' do n't we ? ' ' Mostly , ' agreed the Dean . ' But fewer people are sure of it today than ever before .... Now , I have preached to you quite long enough . Let 's talk about you . ' There is n't much to be said about me  --  not after that , ' Phyllis replied dreamily . It 's a funny thing , ' she went on , thinking aloud , I get so worried over my own problems , and then , when I talk to you , they seem to be so little and k ' ' insignificant . It 's like coming to a fountain when you 're very thirsty . ' I 'm glad you feel that way , Phyllis . But  --  I am not the fountain . I just lend you my cup . '  |p151ALTHOUGH  he had been warned that one must arrive early for the eleven o'clock service on Easter , Nathan Parker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself wedged at ten-forty on the broad steps of Trinity Cathedral . He was even more surprised at the personnel of this fan- shaped throng whose apex poured through the huge bronze doors into the enveloping gloom of the Cathedral nave . All about him were interesting and attractive faces of people he felt were worth knowing . Parker had never given any determined reflection to the matter , but he had gathered from innumerable half- contemptuous quips and flings that church-goers , as a class , were persons of restricted social interests and dubious mentality who relied upon religious forms to recompense them for their lack or loss of the material things which furnish a privileged life . The Church , as an institution , had no place in his in- ventory of significant concerns . Never in his life had he entered a church entirely on his own initiative or in response t o a personal wish . His appearance here today was pursuant t o a promise he had made Elise . Honesty compelled him to admit that he hoped also to satisfy his curiosity concerning t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm- ing personality he had ever known ; but that inquisitiveness would not have brought him to Trinity Cathedral today or ever.  | That the event , considered as a whole , would be boring , Parker had no doubt . He would slip in quietly and share a pew between a straight-lipped whaleboned spinster of the sort dear to the cartoonists and a smug old gentleman with white whiskers and a black umbrella . It was now quite evident that the mental picture he had drawn of this occasion was startlingly incorrect . These people about him , pressing forward by inches toward the Cathedral doors , failed to conform to the type that dutifullydrowsed through tedious sermons in the half-empty and wholly stupid church of the funnies . ' In fact , from where Parker stood , the waiting crowd graded somewhat higher intellectually , he thought , than an equivalent number of people congregated at 8:25 P.M. in the foyer of a fashionabletheater , or clustered about the gate leading down to the Twentieth Century Limited . A few minutes before , he had sauntered across Madison Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel to be an integral part of an audience composed of the queer , the isolate , the other-worldly . It occurred to him nowthat he might feel a bit more comfortable if he had gone to the bother of providing himself with formal clothes . The paragraphers and comic artists , he felt , had let him down . The pew to which he was shown was well to the rear , but his aisle-seat was favorable to a comprehensive observation . From overhead in the spacious organ gallery drifted musicof a distinctly sedative quality calculated to build up an i atmosphere of serenity and reverence . Every appointment of the place was symbolic of religious history , memorializingthe legends of Christianity and the earlier Hebraic culture from which it had derived a considerable amount of its emblems and tokens . Parker found himself unresistingly relaxing into the hypnosis which , he assumed , this environment promised to induce , but retaining enough active consciousness to analyze rather uncritically the nature of the appeal made by these venerable emblemata.  | It seemed clear enough that the towering Gothic arches aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect would this illusion of his own diminutiveness minister to a man 's spirit ? Of course , reflected Parker , the smaller I am , the less important are my perplexities . The smaller I am , the lighter my burdens . These tall arches and gigantic pillars invite me to look at myself through the big end of the spyglass . Thus viewed , my anxieties are reduced to a minimum . Doubtless if one considered this matter while standing on the pavement in front of the Woolworth Build- ing , one would entertain the same sensation ; for , after all , was this not a mere illusion produced by comparative heights and weights ? Or was it ? Parker half-dreamily con- sidered the problem and decided that it would be utterly impossible to think such thoughts while under the influence of the Woolworth Building  --  or the Rock of Gibraltar . The organ music continued to pour through the great nave in waves , graduated in length and strength , with the duality of an incoming tide on a level shore , the tempo and urgency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now inundating one with the roll and break and futile spray of elemental problems mounting high and dashing themselves into total disintegration by their own weight , now returning quietly to the mystery from whence they were derived . But , mused Parker , this theory of one 's perplexities being diminished by the vastly superior height of these Gothic arches can not have any foundation in fact , for the same inverted telescope that minifies my burdens also minifies my capacity to carry them , leaving me exactly of the same stature as before . My spirit would be dwarfed com- mensurately with my anxieties . Curiously enough , although he was aware of the illusion of diminutiveness in respect to his worries , Parker could not sense a relative diminution of personal power to deal with them . There must be something in the appeal of the ( ; ethic that minifies one group of values leaving other con- siderations untouched , or actually magnifying them . I I is burdens were dwarfed in the presence of these lofty arches , but his capacity to carry burdens was undiminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Parker was suddenly struck with the fact that every detail of the Gothic worked toward the creation of a majestic , harmonious whole . Not a line or a curve or a device had gone into it that distracted from the one inevitable demand to be lifted up ! The whole task of the arch and every 1 infinitesimal detail composing that arch was in reply to the Gothic 's urge to rise ! Therefore , it called to the Gothic element in every man 's soul . It did not actually diminish the importance of the un-Gothic ' in one 's mind  --  such as secular worries , fears , chagrins . It so strongly attracted and evoked the Gothic properties of a man 's life that everything else  --  including perplexities , terrors , and despairs  --  re- mained static while his aspiration mounted to meet the challenge of this strange art-form . The windows were crowded with saints who had dis- tinguished themselves for wisdom , courage , and sacrifice . They may have been separated chronologically by a double handful of centuries , but here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been blood brothers of one undernourished family with a strong hereditary leaning toward melancholia and a probable tendency to pulmonary tuberculosis . Taking stock of them by current norms , Parker decided that no one of them would be able to qualify for any voca- tion requiring genius , strength , or adroitness . He would have been very reluctant to hire this Peter to lay a wall , dig a well , stitch a wound , sing a song , or mow a lawn . But , for all that , these ancients had something ; no question about that . Query : Had this something ' been imputed to them by centuries of sacred tradition , or was there an intrinsic value resident in these anaemic figures no one of whom , if set in motion in our contemporary scene , could earn his daily bread ? Parker tried to make short work of the wholep155illusion by accounting for the spiritual superiority of these saints on the ground of their antiquity . They seemed of saints on the ground of their antiquity . They seemed of another category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer nonsense , however , for in that case one would have the same sensations in the presence of a sculp- tured Hercules . There was n't a symbol on the Cathedral dating from a period closer than the Crusades  --  a thousand years ago . I t occurred to Parker that this place was just a museum . But he knew he had never entertained such thoughts in a museum . Now he had it ! It was simply an appeal to the aesthetic . But this , too , was nonsense . People did n't feel like this in an art gallery . The organ had altered its dreamy mood and was intro ducing the stirring measures of an Easter hymn . The congregation stood . A tall young man in vestments , bearing a crosier , was moving slowly up the aisle . Behind him came the choir in pairs ; little boys first , quite angelic in fresh surplices , their childish voices shrill . Now the boys were surplices , their childish voices shrill . Now the boys were growing taller . Now they were grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered how many of the congregation observed that there was a girl in the choir . I t was not too easy to discover at a glance , with her black bobbed hair and the same uniform . The basses rumbled ponderously . Alleluial ... Alleluia ! ' After a little space , two clergymen followed , and to the rear of them an ethereal old man of obvious distinction , gorgeously arrayed . Someone in Parker 's pew whispered , The Bishop ! ' It was pleasant to know that the Bishopwas to be on duty today . Parker had never seen a bishop . Ile was disappointed , however , for he had hoped to have a glimpse of Dean Harcourt . The choir was presently swallowed up in the dimness of the distant chancel and the ritualistic service began , the Bishop in charge . The beautifully gowned woman on Parker 's right tried hard to steer him through the detours of her prayer book . He felt at a disadvantage . Wheneverher prayer book . He felt at a disadvantage . Whenever religion or the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of confessing himself a ' pagan . ' I n this declaration of ' paganism , ' he identified himself as of that genteel company who trust nothing to warm emotions which can not be accepted by cold intellect . It had pleased him to think that he was too sophisticated to consider t h e Church seriously . At this moment , however , dumbly bewildered over proceedings which these cultured people understood as thoroughly as the alphabet , his appraisal of himself was anything but complacent . He suspected that the well-groomed lady whose baffling black book he share ( I was not saying to herself , ' The man is sophisticated . ' I t was more likely she was thinking , ' Gauche ! ' Parker did n't feel a bit superior ; just de trop .... ' Pagan ? ' ... ' Hick ! ' - that was the word . It made him very warm and uncom- fortable . And humble . For a while he was so intent upon his own dilemma that the goings-on in the chancel were almost lost sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised to rise or kneel , but with an air of relative desistence from their duties , and a hush fell over the congregation . The organ  --  a generous part of whose pipes , Parker had discovered , were located in great alcoves on either side of the chancel  --  softly modu- lated into Mendelssohn 's ' But the Lord is Mindful of His Own . ' He was glad the place was so quiet for the opening notes of the solo . He had thought he knew what Elise could do with the muted ' cello in her throat , but this heart- stirring diapason of hers surpassed anything he had ever heard . Elise had demonstrated , on previous occasions , the quality of her contralto , but this was the first chance she had been given to set it free in an environment that lent it wings . To realize what Elise had to offer demanded a cathedral ! It was evident that the organist was deeply moved , too , for when the final measure of the solo had been taken , the accompaniment was throttled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left of it ; and Elise 's golden voice ,  |p157sustaining  the retarded tone , finished alone . You hardly knew exactly when the bell-like vibrations ceased . She had stood at the end of a choir-stall , facing the audience , and when she sat , there was a long , slow intake of breath , almost as if the people had suspended respiration throughout this as if the people had suspended respiration throughout this impressive event . Another hush settled over the congregation . The two clergymen Parker had seen in the processional were assisting a crippled man into the pulpit . He grasped the desk firmly with both hands as his aids turned and left him there . Nobility ' was the only word adequate to describe this man 's face . Parker remembered now that Mrs. Dexter had said Dean Harcourt was a cripple . The first words were spoken very quietly , their restraint serving to make them more unusual than they might have seemed had they , been uttered with intent to be orator- ical . The implications of this hour , ' began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audacity .... Men 's ambi- tions , throughout the ages , have mounted from their terrains of experience , dearly earned , toward heights of achievement , to be as dearly bought .... We have warmed our hearths at the world 's internal fires . We have broken white sunlight into healing rays . We have traversed under the water , through the mountains , and in the air . We have found antidotes for every poison , anodynes for every pain . Yester- day 's miracle becomes tomorrow 's commonplace ; yester- day 's luxury , tomorrow 's necessity . But no aspiration of ours will ever rival the hope we celebrate today  --  im- mortality ! ' Parker no longer attempted to analyze his own thoughts , resigning himself utterly to the appeal of the dynamic , pain- scarred , spiritually majestic prophet .... A legendary Adam scarred , spiritually majestic prophet .... A legendary Adam had been expelled from Eden lest he eat of the tree of life and live forever :  --  A comprehending Christ , when men marveled at his capacity for surmounting the pains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than these shall ye do ! ' Adam had been condemned for inquisitiveness . Christ had said , Seek , and ye shall find ! ' It was like a tonic . It was like an injection of strychnia ! It was an invigorating breeze rushing through the stuffy darkness of Parker 's unexplored soul .... But if ever you are to be immortal , ' declared the Dean , you are immortal now ! ' Never in his lifetime had Parker invested so much mental energy in following a public address . Dean Harcourt 's words were not mere words as words are commonly con- ceived . They walked up and down on Parker ! They lifted him out of his lethargy , shook him wide awake , tramped ruthlessly on his sophistications , and companionably held out a hand to his despairs . He had always presumed that sermons were tedious . This one was now finished , leaving him taut as an E-string .... God !  --  what would n't he give for an hour  --  alone  --  with this man ! As for the rest of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected the money and he tossed in the largest bank-note he had . There was a long prayer which he did not follow . The choir was filing out of the stalls and into theaisle , singing the recessional . Jerusalem , the Golden . They were out in the spacious vestibule now . The Bishop pronounced a benediction . Dean Harcourt was being led out of the chancel through a side door , two young men in vestments supporting him . Parker wished he dared go back there and see this man at close range ; wanted to take his hand and look into his face . Indeed , the impulse was so strong that he tarried indeci- sively in the foyer , jostled from all sides , until the current swept him along . The bright sunlight did not eclipse his meditative mood . He crossed the street and entered the park , still debating whether to return . Deciding that it might be an untimely intrusion , he abandoned the idea with reluctance , sat down on a sunny bench , and studied his own mental upheaval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad gravel path before him.  | Parker felt that he had recovered something that offered compensation for the most serious loss he had ever ex- perienced . To have looked toward one dominant personality for years , focusing one 's admiration there , and then to haveseen that anchorage slip its moorings , had been a catas- trophe that had shaken his life through and through . In certain bitter moments he had said to himself that he would never again risk a similar disillusionment .... But today another dynamic personality had captured him . There was a peculiar spiritual magnetism resident in this man Harcourt . Human life , which had recently seemed to Parker a mere matter of reflexes instinctively responding toheat and cold , hunger and thirst  --  mere motor-replies to the same urges that propelled Sylvia , for example  --  now appeared as a high adventure directed by forces from Without . Human interests were more than mere elabora- tions and refinements of jungle necessities and atavistic desires . Life had suddenly taken on majestic proportions . Until now , spiritual concerns , in Parker 's opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im- practical mysticisms . Today , personal power seemed to belong properly among the energies dealt with in textbooks on Physics . Under the dreamy spell of his own reflections , Parker became so detached from his environment that the people passing by meant nothing but a succession of shapes and shadows .... A man drifted out of the stream and joined him on the iron bench , but Parker , thoroughly absorbed , took no notice of him . Presently the man spoke . Beg pardon , ' he said , but are n't you Mrs. Norma Phelps ? ' The reunion with Corley was attended by some peculiar sensations . Not to have seen a familiar face for six months , or to have heard oneself addressed in terms associated with one 's true identity , had wrought changes in the lonely fellow which he himself had not been . fully aware of until momentarily tugged back into the life he had surrendered.  | For a little while they tried to conduct the conversation in a light and bantering atmosphere of persiflage . Eugene admitted , under much hectoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunately timed to coincide with Elise 's appearance at Trinity Cathedral . And did you ever hear anything like it , Newell ? ' exulted Corley . ' She had ' em completely hypnotized ! ' Newell agreed that Elise had indeed put on a very moving performance , acquitting herself with high credit , and added : ' She would have had to do very poorly not to have im- pressed you . It 's easily seen that you were in a hypnoid state , at least , when you decided to come . ' ' Yes , ' sighed Eugene comfortably , she 's a great little girl . ' That settles it , ' drawled Newell . When a hard-boiled ' That settles it , ' drawled Newell . When a hard-boiled old thing like you calls a grown-up woman " a great little girl , " it 's time to make out the commitment papers . ' When , after a while , the talk became serious  --  Corley spluttering impatiently of Paige 's aimless vagabonding  --  the vagrant grew restless and suggested luncheon . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to tell me that you take that dog along everywhere you go , ' chaffed Corley . ' It would n't seem silly to you , ' Paige muttered , ' if the only thing you had left in the world was a dog . ' Suddenly it occurred to him that this statement was giving the lie to his real feelings . Brightening , he queried , ' What did you think of Dean Harcourt ? ' There was a long silence before Corley answered . ' Well  --  you see ' he hesitated  --  ' all that sort of thing is out of my line . I never think about it  --  one way or the other . So  --  my opinion really is n't worth a damn .... But  --  1 ' 11 say this much : if somebody had gone to the trouble of drilling that idea of life into me when I was in my teens The sentence was left unfinished . ' Too late now , eh ? ' queried Newell moodily . Certainly .... Nobody does any new thinking after he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , ' explained Corley , ' one does n't do any thinking after thirty that demands a brand-new outfit of hypotheses concerning himself and his place in the scheme of things . You do n't believe it possible , do you ? ' ' I do n't know , ' soliloquized Paige . ' I would give a good deal to find out . I 'm in the market for some new ideas about myself  --  and my place in the scheme of things . ' Phyllis turned to Patricia and smiled as the congregation rose to go . Sonia , at the end of the pew , was leading the way . ' Do you think I might see him ? ' Pat whispered . ' We could try , ' said Phyllis , detaining Sonia , who nodded agreement . They went through a side door from the nave and down a long hall . Mr. Talbot was just coming out of the Dean 's library . ' Do you think he would see us  --  for a minute ? ' asked Sonia . Mr. Talbot said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The Dean was alone and would be glad to see them , he said . Sonia led the way , turning to wink a stealthy ' I-told-you-so ' to Phyllis while Pat 's attention was briefly engaged by some little amenity of Talbot 's . They had brought Pat almost by force to the Cathedral . ' Why , how ridiculous ! ' she had exclaimed at breakfast . ' To spend a glorious morning like this  --  in a musty old church ! What must you be thinking of ? ' ' But you will hear Dean Harcourt , ' Sonia had replied . ' Phyllis and I think no day is quite fine enough to interfere with that . ' After much persuasion , Pat had reluctantly consented to go with them , remarking at the Cathedral doors that she would stroll in the park until the service was over . At this , they had closed in on her , deaf to her protests . Once inside and seated , Pat had resigned herself to the affair rather indifferently , but when Dean Harcourt began to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing a sidelong glanceat Pat 's enraptured face , smiled . The Dean had taken Pat over completely . It was almost amusing . Sonia now led the way into the library . Dean Harcourt had shed his surplice and sat at the big mahogany desk robed in his long black cassock . The three of them crossed the room and stood before him . We are n't staying long , ' said Phyllis . We wanted to present Dr. Patricia Arlen . ' Patricia was uncomfortable . The use of her title seemed farcical . In this presence she had none of the sensations of a Ph.D. , or a college professor . Her state of mind was ratherthat of a small child shyly approaching an idolized teacher . Dean Harcourt held out his hand and she walked around the desk to take it . Every well-worn phrase of the conven- tional prattle employed in receiving an introduction seemed either stiffly affected or trivial and inept . While she was debating what to say to him , he kindly took the situation out of her hands . You are Phyllis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , I see . I 'm glad you wanted to come to the Cathedral this morning . ' But I did n't want to , ' Pat was surprised to hear herself saying  --  wondering whether this man 's eyes had the capacity to evoke the unvarnished truth from everybody as they were now demanding it from her . I never do . They insisted .... But I would n't have missed it for anything in the world ! You were talking directly to me . ' I always preach to myself , ' said the Dean . I 've found that if I talk about the problems that interest me per- sonally , and the hopes that are of urgent concern to me I am likely to make other people feel that I am well ac- quainted with their dilemmas  --  and their wistfulness , too . ' You make people feel as if they all belonged to one family , ' said Sonia.  |p163| Do n't they ? ' inquired the Dean , artlessly sincere . ' We seemed so today , ' agreed Patricia . Apparently deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patricia how long she was remaining in the city , suggesting that the three of them come to dinner with him on Tuesday evening , an invitation promptly and with him on Tuesday evening , an invitation promptly and unanimously accepted in face of their remembrance that tickets had already been bought for a popular musical comedy that night . Sonia , your shop should be rather quiet on the day after Faster . My secretary is to have a few days ' vacation and I need someone in the reception parlor tomorrow forenoon . Could you or Phyllis come ? ' ' I want to , ' announced Phyllis . May I , Sonia ? ' Certainly , dear  --  but you 'll not have a very good time . He sees nothing but men in the mornings , ' commented Sonia , with a slow wink . Are they ever interesting men , Dean Harcourt ? ' All men are interesting , Sonia , ' declared the Dean , smiling . ' Perhaps , ' she agreed . ' In the same sense that you would say " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't say , " All men are mortal , " ' objected Patricia . Would you ? ' he asked gently , searching her eyes . ' I do n't know , ' replied Patricia . ' I think I might have said yes if you had asked me two hours ago . ' There was a little pause which nobody seemed disposed to make use of . They said their good-byes and moved toward the door . Patricia 's steps lagged . Returning on impulse to the Dean 's desk , she said , rather nervously , ' I must have a talk with you  --  please . ' ' Quite right .... At three  --  tomorrow . ' Eugene Corley had left Paige at the hotel immediately after their luncheon , promising that he would preserve from Elise the secret of Newell 's identity . This problem had not seemed of much importance until now that they were all together at close quarters , likely to be thrown into contact at any time . I am Parker to you , ' demanded Newell . See that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Elise , are n't you ? ' asked Eugene . Newell grinned amiably . I think you 're better able to answer that question your- self . You have probably planned to monopolize all of her time while she 's here . I shall try to content myself with a telephone conversation . Doubtless she will be satisfied with that .... And you can tell her I think she was wonderful today . And that will be true ! ' He had expected to be lonely after Eugene scurried away intent on his engagement . To his surprise , he was serenely contented and glad to have an opportunity to resume his thoughts . It was strange how this two-hour association with his long-time friend Corley had reappraised his own personality . He seemed to have divested himself of the Parker concept and to have reverted to Paige , probably assisted by Corley 's frequent use of his name . It was as Newell Paige , therefore , that he strolled along the beautifully landscaped lake front , Sylvia tagging him rather demurely . He had not talked to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with him ? It occurred to him that there had been long lapses in their talk . And why was n't he more eager to meet Elise ? He had sent roses and a warm note to her by messenger , but had no desire to talk with her , or with anyone . Except , of course , Dean Harcourt . This idea kept recurring  --  his need of an interview with this man who now seemed to offer a harbor for his storm-riddled mind . If anyone had told Paige that he could possibly be gripped by a dissertation on Immortal Life , ' he would have grinned . He did n't believe in it ; did n't want to believe in it ; couldn '  |p165think  of anything less desirable than immortal life . The very thought of living forever made his flesh creep . The Harcourt interpretation of it , however , had made an incision into the problem in an unexpected quarter . The Dean had urged his listeners to be Eternity-minded . ' Eternity-conscious . ' Time that is measured in terms of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had declared , is more of an obstacle than a convenience to straight thinking .... What happens today  --  of good or ill or what promises or threatens to happen tomorrow  --  is never of enough importance to disturb the ballast of men and women who hold the concept of " the everlasting life . " Has it ever struck you queerly , ' the Dean had continued , that every race and nation , ancient and contemporary , barbaric and civilized , has possessed a built-in desire for and belief in immortality ? ... For the most part  --  probably because it was so much easier to practice  --  the people have interpreted this immortality as a continuance of conscious- ness after death . They have dated it from the grave and speculated on it in terms foreign to human experience .... Only a few , comparatively , make use of the immortality concept as a practical measure available here and now .... Whatever may be the value of it elsewhere , in some other pattern of life , its chief benefit accrues to us in our daily living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Eternity-minded are stabilized . Nothing disastrous can happen to them . Their ups and downs compensate . They expect their ship to pitch and roll , but they know it will notcapsize . When some mental , moral , or physical victory is won by a group  --  for a season  --  they do not raise the hysterical shout that the Kingdom has come ! And when some circumstance has brought on a period of savage selfish- ness , ruthless fraud , and the various phenomena of retro- gression , they do not whine , " Lo  --  there goes the King- dom . " ... If you are Eternity-conscious , you are not onlyp166insured against being kited into transient ecstasies  --  loaded with the makings of disappointment  --  but pro- tected against buckling under the strain of some apparent catastrophe . The Eternity-minded do not believe in catastrophes . There is no place in their vocabulary for such a word as " crisis . " In their opinion , what the day-by-day and hand- to-mouth opportunists would call a " crisis " is but a phase of the irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dark , physically weary but mentally alert , resolved that he would make an attempt to see Dean Harcourt tomorrow . He was not sure what ques- tions he wanted to ask . The main thing was to have a face- to-face contact with this man . He understood now the nature of the influence that the Dean had exercised over Mrs. Dexter  --  a dynamic that had given her a mysterious radiance . It amply explained her possession of the gift she had so often referred to as personal adequacy . ' Learning after breakfast that Dean Harcourt was avail- able for private interviews between ten and noon , Paige had set out for the Cathedral early , arriving as the clock was striking ten . He had taken Sylvia with him , knowing that she would wait interminably for him outside a door or wherever she was told to remain . It seemed very strange to be having an errand in a church , and as he rounded the corner and neared the Dean 's residence he wished for a better know- ledge of the procedure and proprieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glass door-panel extended an invitation to enter . This unqualified bid seemed broad enough to admit Sylvia into the vestibule . At Paige 's bidding she crouched on the rug obediently while her master proceeded along the hall to an open doorway . He moved slowly , adjusting his eyes from the bright sunshine without to the gloom of the rangy old house . The reception room was apparently unoccupied.  | Sauntering in quietly , Paige noticed that he was not alone . A young woman stood in the bay , at the far end of the room , looking out through the window . She was without hat or coat , and evidently belonged to the establishment . The sunshine lighted her gold hair . Intent upon what she was seeing or thinking , the girl remained unaware of his pre- sence . He walked slowly toward her , momentarily expect- ing her to hear his step . His position was bidding fair to produce an awkward moment . To proceed any farther in her direction was to take the risk of startling her . To be caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . At length she seemed to sense that she was not alone and slowly turned her head . Paige caught his breath at the sight of her profile . She faced him directly now . Reconstructing the baffling moment , later , Paige realized that her expression of perplexed inquiry was a mere reflec- tion of his own . She stood there motionless , unsmiling , with wide eyes and parted lips , while he silently regarded her with an amazement quite undisguised . She was the living image of Mrs. Dexter as she might have appeared in the full bloom of her youth ! Just how long they stood there staring at each other neither of them knew . At length , the girl stirred , smiled tentatively , advanced a short step , and said , in a low voice , ' You came to see Dean Harcourt ? ' ' Yes , ' replied Paige , still searching her eyes  --  same heavy lashes , same patrician arch of the brows  --  same dark-amber iris . ' My name is Parker , ' he added . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not live here . ' ' Please be seated , Mr. Parker , ' she said , with a little indication of outspread fingers toward a big leather chair  --  the same trick of hand that had made Mrs. Dexter 's brief and restrained gestures so strikingly expressive . ' I shall tell Dean Harcourt you are here . ' She took a few steps toward the door , his eyes following her graceful movement as she walked . Apparently on impulse , she halted , faced him again , and said , ' I am Miss Dexter . '  | Paige bowed and replied , almost inaudibly , ' Yes ... Miss Dexter . ' Phyllis left the room and started down the hall toward the Dean 's library in a state of complete mystification . The peculiar experience had shaken her a little and her heart was beating fast . Suspecting that her cheeks were flushed , / she delayed her entrance to the library until she felt herself under better control . Opening the door and crossing to the Dean 's desk , she said , ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dean had been poring over a letter . At the sound of her voice , he raised his eyes slowly and looked steadily into hers for a moment . Then he smiled and beckoned her to come closer . She responded , standing close beside his elbow . He took her hand in both of his , raised it closer to his eyes , bent back her pretty fingers gently , and inspected her palm after the manner of a fortune-teller , pretending to be intently studying the lines . Releasing her hand with affectionate reluctance , he nodded , after the manner of one confirming a guess , glanced up with an expression of kindly concern , and said quietly , ' Show him in . ' Making no comment , Phyllis left the room . Dean Har- court smiled as he watched her go , fully expecting her to turn , at the door , and offer some reaction to his play- ful pantomime , but to his slight surprise she did not do so . When she returned to the reception parlor , Mr. Parker was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival . She hesitated in the doorway , disliking to speak to him from that distance . It would sound too perfunctory . She hesitated also to cross the room to where he stood , for she did not feel herself disposed to face another direct en- counter with those searching eyes . He glanced in her direc- tion and walked toward her . The barest suggestion of a smile was on his lips . It was , Phyllis thought , almost a comradely smile . ' He will see you now , ' she said , leading the way.  | Thank you  --  Miss Dexter , ' said Mr. Parker , as they halted before the closed door of the library . Phyllis glanced up into his eyes and seemed about to speak ; to ask a question , perhaps ; but , deciding otherwise , opened the door , and , without accompanying him into the room , closed it softly behind him . Then she walked very slowly through the hall , past the door of the reception parlor , and toward the front entrance . Sylvia rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phyllis stroked her silky head , murmuring little phrases of friendly attention . Then , turning , she went back into the reception parlor and preoccupiedly resumed the position she had earlier maintained at the window . Presently she was stirred from her reverie by a soft , warm , wet touch on the back of her hand . She sat down on the window-seat . The dog laid her muzzle on Phyllis 's knee . ' I believe you like me , ' whispered Phyllis confidentially . You think you know me  --  do n't you ? ... Well  --  you You think you know me  --  do n't you ? ... Well  --  you do n't . I never saw you before . ' She toyed with the setter 's long ears . ' But  --  no matter , ' she murmured softly . ' I like you  --  just the same .... We will be friends  --  wo n't we ? '  |p170DEAN  HARCOURT did not extend his hand or offer any desk . Pushing aside the pile of correspondence and slowly word of conventional greeting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated the vacant chair with a gesture that was hospitable but not effusive . And what brings you in out of the sunshine , Mr. Parker ? ' he asked quietly when his guest had been seated . Perhaps under any other circumstances , the direct query , phrased and inflected as if acquaintance had already been made , might have aided a stranger to proceed with dispatch to a statement of his errand . As the case stood , this abro- gation of the conventional amenities  --  so useful to the needs of subterfuge  --  left Mr. Parker with an uncomfort- ably short runway for his take-off . However difficult it had been to look down into the long- lashed , amber-tinted Dexter eyes and lie about his identity , it was even harder to face the analytical gaze leveled at himfrom beneath the serious brows of Dean Harcourt . My name is Paige , sir , ' he replied , after a moment 's hesitation . Newell Paige . ' The Dean slowly raised his head and seemed to be mak- ing a more intensive survey of his visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deliberation . I must have misunderstood . ' For an instant , Newell debated the advisability of letting the matter rest there , but the cavernous eyes insisted onp171integrity . They did not pry . It was rather as if they entreated . There was no misunderstanding , ' he found himself confessing . I did tell the young lady that my name was ' Parker .... There are reasons why I have You need not explain , ' interposed the Dean , unless it comforts you to do so . I dare say your reasons are not dishonorable , else you would not have confided your real name .... Tell me why you wanted to see me . ' There was something peculiarly intimate in the tone of the low-pitched voice , something almost paternal ; not the slightest hint of a reserved suspicion or a suppressed curi- osity . Paige felt himself in the presence of a powerful personality whose scrutiny of him was not that of a parlor photographer but rather that of a radiologist . The deep- set , pain-circled eyes seemed to ignore such superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one 's durable inner structure . Thank you , sir , ' said Paige gratefully , drawing his chair a little closer . I came to see you about your  --  about the address you delivered here yesterday morning . ' I observe that you are not in the habit of attending religious services , ' remarked the Dean dryly . That is quite true , sir . I should be interested to learn how you knew . Perhaps I look like a heathen . ' You referred to my sermon as an address , ' the Dean explained , with a responsive smile . You were on the point of calling it a sermon , but shied off at the word because youdislike to admit that you have any interest in sermons . I ca n't say that I blame you much . Now , just what was it in my  --  in the address that brought you back to ask questions ? ' Well , sir  --  you talked about the terms of a stabilized life . The idea attracts me . I wondered if you might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my personalbenefit . I am quite in need of it . ' Dean Harcourt relaxed in his chair , stretched his long arms to full torsion , interlaced his fingers behind his head , and gave himself to a reminiscent monologue that began far afield from the focal point of inquiry . I have not driven a car for many years , ' he mused com- panionably . It used to be my favorite recreation . I dis- tinctly recall that when I learned to drive , my instructor took me out on a quiet country road in the early morning and taught me the rudiments . I think I must have had a natural feel for it from the first . Within an hour I was operating my new car with a good deal of self-assurance . I could start it , stop it , go forward , backward , and shift the gears smoothly . It seemed to me that driving was n't much of a trick , after all , and I remarked to the man that l thought the difficulties of managing an automobile had been largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mysterious air of mental reservation , and suggested that we drive back to the main highway and see how the new car behaved before company . This pleased me very much , for I knew it would be more interesting . It was after eight o'clock now and the city- bound traffic was in full swing . ' " Paige smiled his comprehension of the problem that was about to arise , but the Dean carried on with his allegory . Immediately upon being hurled into the ruck of all this i confusion , I found it difficult to remember what I had just j been taught . I became nervously sensitive to the swift scurry of cars overtaking and passing me from the rear at dangerously close quarters and appalled by the threatening aspect of reckless monsters bearing down on me from the front . The road seemed so narrow and the drivers so un- conscionably inconsiderate that I felt my confidence rapidly oozing , and at the first corner we came to I turned off , slowed my car to a jerky stop , and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other people ! " ... " Yes , " replied the man , with a grin , " that 's about all there is to driving a car : the other people . " ' The Dean disengaged his hands and made a little gesturep173implying that the story should now be able to speak for itself without need of further elaboration . ' I quite agree , ' nodded Paige , feeling that some response was expected . ' One never knows what the other people are likely to do  --  even one 's trusted friends .... I have come to believe that it 's just as well to assume , on the road , thatthe other people are going to do the wrong thing ; do n't you think so ? ' ' No , ' replied the Dean , ' I do n't think so . I did  --  at first . The man ahead of me was my potential enemy . I believed him entirely capable of enough absent-minded selfishness to nail his wheels to the asphalt almost any time without signaling his intention . And sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my brakes to avoid a collision .... But , after my indignation had cooled , I was usually able to recall that in the excitement of protecting myself , I had quite neglected to let the fellow behind me know what was about to come to pass . And then it would occur to me that perhaps the fellow ahead of me had done the same thing . ' That was a long time ago , ' the Dean continued . ' Ex- perience and observation have taught me a few facts in the meantime . I think  --  if I were able to drive again  --  I would try to do it in a slightly different state of mind ; vigilant , of course , but a little more sympathetic . Instead of glaring suspiciously at the back of the other man 's head , and wondering what species of fool he might be , I believe I would be inclined to appraise him now as a person beset by the same conditions which make my own presence on the busy road perplexing to the people who follow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the doubt ? ' commented Paige . ' It 's practically impossible to live a stabilized life in any other mood , my friend .... Sometimes '  --  the Dean went on , soliloquizingly  --  ' my cronies drive me about , and it always interests me to observe their respective at- ti t udes toward those with whom they share the highway.  | One friend of mine , in particular , keeps himself in a steam- ing stew . " Now will you look at that ! " he growls , when somebody cuts out of line on a grade . " People like that ! " he grumbles . " They ought to have their licenses taken away ! " ... Well  --  perhaps . But the fact remains that all sorts and conditions of men are on the road , and it is de- cidedly in the interest of one 's poise and peace to accept the traffic problem exactly as it is , without too much fretting over other people 's bad driving . Now  --  apropos of stability  --  it would be quite simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own machinery if it were not for the confusion of one 's environment and the uncertainty of other men 's decisions .... But  --  what is more difficult for most of us to remember is that we our- selves are contributing to this general confusion . Even the good people . Sometimes they add to it at the very moments when they are most complacent about their behavior . They go into the temple to reflect that they are law-abiding , generous , just , and fortunately unlike almost everybody else . They feel that some merit attaches to the business of being isolated from the Pack . There is almost no limit t the versatility of human error , but this is the great mistake ! What we most need to drill into ourselves is that we are essentially alike , and that  --  in the main  --  the problems of each are the problems of all . This is the first requirement of any man who hopes to achieve poise  --  stability .... If you want better information on the matter , I suggest a painstaking study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walt Whitman . ' Newell Paige was conscious of registering an expression of surprise at hearing these unrelated documents rated in the same category by an accredited ecclesiastic . The Dean , prompt to interpret the query on his visitor 's face , defended his attitude . Many persons , ' he observed reflectively , seem to think the only way you may do honor to a hero or his deed is by proclaiming him and it unique . Thus they try to sublimatep175the Author of the Sermon on the Mount high apart from the ordinary current of human life . I do not believe the Great Galilean wanted that . He was too deeply touched with a feeling of our infirmities for that . I think He would have liked Whitman 's " Leaves of Grass . " He might have regarded it as a fit companion-piece to his own rhapsody , " Consider the Lilies . " ... Yes  --  shaggy old Walt un- questionably captured the spirit of the Master when he wrote , " Passing Stranger  --  you do not know how long- ingly I look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You grew up with me , were a boy with me or a girl with me . I must see to it that I do not lose you . " ' The Dean sat in silence for a while ; then , stirring from his reverie , he asked gently , Have I been answering your questions  --  at all ? ' ' I particularly like the idea about the road , sir , ' said Paige . ' It bears acquaintance , ' nodded the Dean . Indeed , there is no end to its possibilities . Sometimes it is helpfulto attempt a mental reconstruction of that highway from the very beginning and trace it forward through human history . Endless procession . On foot , at first  --  barefoot ; then sandal-shod ; then on mule-back . Clumsy wooden sledges , sledges with rounded runners , sledges on rollers , rude carts on heavy wheels drawn by ropes . Better carts with lighter wheels drawn by horses . Accelerated speed . Reduction of drudgery . Motors ! ... Every little while a radical change in methods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession ! Ah  --  but it has passed through a lot of discomfort to come so far ! When I review it , I know that nothing could possibly happen to me which has n't happened to others  --  thousands of times before  --  and immeasurably more severe . I 'm rather proud to belong to the procession . Mighty sound stuff in that old parade , my friend ! It has traveled a long way  --  up  --  out of the wilderness . ' Do you think that we evolved from something pre/human , Dean Harcourt ? ' queried Paige , not quite sure whether the question would fit into the thoughtful church- man 's picture of the valiant pilgrimage . ' We 've been a little inclined to impose on that word " human , " ' replied the Dean . ' It 's the arbitrary names we assign to things that fog our thinking . We 've always done it ; have gone to war , again and again , over words and names . You may recall that in the legend reporting the creation of Adam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his surroundings , was to name everything in sight . That has been our chief occupation ever since  --  naming things , and getting into trouble with one another over it .... It 's very difficult to fix the day when the remote cave- ancestors of Pithecanthropus achieved the right to be called " human , " according to our present valuation of that word . It 's as difficult as to define the exact moment when an unborn child may be properly referred to as a " human " being . Perhaps we might do clearer thinking if we permitted ourselves to speak of degrees of " humanness . " In that case we might say that the uncivilized bushman of Central Africa  --  engaged in a coconut war with the ba- boons  --  is slightly less human than we , since he is more at home with the monkeys than he might be in urbane society .... But  --  let us leave the word " human " out of it for the present , and that will dispose of " pre-human " too . Agreed ? ' ' Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique of clearing away the brush before stating his views . ' Let us begin , then , with the hypothesis that from the very dawn of animate life there was a potential man-in-the- making , related to present-day man much as an acorn is related to the oak it is to be . At one phase of this creature'supward progress , he closely resembled what we know as the harbor seal . Dissatisfied with his ocean , because he was possessed of an instinctive urge to escape his limita- tions , he climbed up on a rock and at the cost of who knowsp177how much agony  --  endured by generations of his kind  --  he achieved a capacity for recovering oxygen from the air instead of the water . It is quite conceivable that of all these creatures who made the experiment , only a compara- tive few had the fortitude to see it through . The next phase in the evolution of the most audacious was to crawl and flop along the ground , inland , Nature gradually helping them and their posterity to more suitable means of locomotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a differently shaped oral arch to accommodate them , and a larger brain to handle the in- creasing business of the ambitious creature 's sensory and motor plexuses .... I feel sure you are familiar with this partof the story , but it is possible you have not considered the sub-plot . That sub-plot concerns the creatures who were left behind . Some of them had n't the courage to climb up on the rock , at all . Some climbed up and stayed a little while , but were glad enough to slip back into their sea . Some went through all the suffering necessary to achieve lungs to replace the old gills , but had n't the valor to travel in- land . They remained sprawling on the rocks , when they were not swimming about with all manner of things more or less like them . The most venturesome , then , moved upon the land , leaving the harbor seals behind them . I presume you are acquainted with the story of the next step . ' Yes , sir , ' ventured Paige . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right ? ' Exactly . And when , after a few hundred thousand years , he decided to climb down and fight it out with the tigers , he left up there in the tree-tops a large number of creatures who , like himself , had been brave enough to go through all the pain of escaping from the sea , but were n't up to the job of forsaking the shelter of the forest . They chattered shrilly as they watched this little handful of daredevilsbuild a hut , shape a stone axe , and hollow a log intop178a boat for more ambitious fishing .... Then came the day when a smaller selected group decided on a long trek into the distant mountains , the large majority voting to stay where they were and take no further risks .... Those who went forth encountered fresh hardships which taught them things they had never known in the jungle and bound them together socially for mutual defense . After that the de- velopment proceeded with rapidity . The primitive and his sons built a livable house , made a wheel , tamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fired a forge , raised an altar , elected a mayor  --  and began to pay taxes . ' His dull friends , back in the woods , were spared the taxes , anyway , ' observed Paige , with a grin . Yes  --  they dodged the assessor and occupied them- selves with their ancient flea-quest .... Now  --  our chief trouble in thinking about Evolution is that we fail to un- derstand that it is going on today ! This creature with the irresistible desire to rise is still evolving . His physical readjustments to meet the imperative demands of new climates , new soils , and radically altered modes of existence , seem to have been completed . But that does not mean that his evolution is finished  --  any more than it means a baby 's development is finished when the teeth he had cut , at the cost of much pain , have freed him from milk to meat . Man 's evolution has been operating for some time in the field of his mental progress . He is now about to make long strides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful price , learned to breathe , but who  --  at the one critical hour of deciding whether to justify this suffering by going on  --  inland  --  to possess the earth  --  is now sadly imitated by the people who have endured the pain and grief and anxiety of their existence , but lack the courage to proceed toward the achievement of that peace and personal power which is their rightful wage . Many people who have fully paid for it , have no awareness of their own personal adequacy ! ' That phrase stirs me , sir , ' muttered Paige . I have heard it before . '  | ' It is very satisfying , ' remarked the Dean . ' I often have occasion to use it . ' Yes  --  I know . ' Paige 's voice was husky , and he measured his words . The person who offered me that phrase said she had got it from you , sir . ' The Dean leaned forward attentively . Would you like to tell me ? ' he queried searchingly . ' I had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before I helped to  --  to take her life . ' Dean Harcourt folded his arms on the desk and looked Paige squarely in the eyes for a long moment . I was never satisfied with the story , Dr. Paige , ' he de- clared firmly . There was something very mysterious clared firmly . There was something very mysterious about it , even though the responsibility seemed to rest on you  --  when you ran away . I have often worried about you , my son , wondering where you were , and if you were still alive .... I confess it was a bit of a shock when you told me your name , a while ago . ' I had not meant to tell you , sir , when I came . ' Thank you , ' acknowledged the Dean . ' I surmised as much . ' ' I should like to talk to you about it . Would it be im- pertinent if I asked you to promise me that you will let me revert to " Parker " when I leave  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I leave  --  and keep my secret ? ' Yes , Dr. Paige . I shall keep your secret . ' Forgive me for asking . I did n't want to risk an accident that might inform Miss Dexter of my identity . Of course , ' he added , she might not recognize my name . ' He paused , and , after a considerable silence on the part of the Dean , inquired , Would she ? ' ' Yes ... she would . ' She thinks I was responsible for the death of her mother ? ' Yes ... she does , ' replied the Dean reluctantly . But I do n't ! ' He raised his hand , and pointing a finger directly toward Paige 's face said , almost accusingly , ' You took the blame ! ... I strongly suspected it  --  all along ! ... Endicottblame ! ... I strongly suspected it  --  all along ! ... Endicott told me  --  though he did n't mean to ! You were a brave fellow ! I 'm proud of a chance to talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave , ' muttered Paige . It 's good of you to take that view of it , sir . ' ' Do n't misunderstand me , Doctor . I said you were a brave fellow when you shouldered the blame . I 'm not so sure you were a brave fellow when you ran off and hid . Surely there must have been some better way out of your predicament than that ! ... What do you intend to do  --  re- i main a fugitive  --  for life ? ' I do n't know , sir . ' Paige bowed his head despondently . ' It 's almost killing me . I 'm not sure how long I can stand it . ' ... Then , shaking off his mood of despair , he asked , suddenly , Is she bitter toward me ? ' Phyllis ? ... Yes , and no . If anyone asked her if she thought of you bitterly , she would probably deny it . She would n't like that word . But  --  she thinks you caused her mother 's death , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name would be painful .... However  --  no occasion need arise for any further con- tacts between you . So that feature of your problem need not be worried over  --  do you think ? ' Paige raised his eyes to meet the Dean 's , was on the point of shaking his head , but  --  after some delay  --  re- plied , in a tone that was barely audible : ' I 'm not  --  so sure  --  about that .... Mrs. Dexter was one of the most remarkablepersonalities I have ever known . I think my  --  my affection went out to her more than to anyone else I ever met . ' ' And Phyllis resembles her so much that you want to be sure she bears you no ill-will .... Is that it ? ' Yes  --  something like that , ' agreed Paige , confused . Had anyone told Newell , an hour earlier , that he was likely to speak of his tragedy to Dean Harcourt , he would have thought it quite impossible . But now he found him- self not only talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes  --  to tell the story straight !  | ' Do you have any theories  --  you surely must have some  --  about Dr. Endicott 's reasons for  --  for letting you down ? ' asked the Dean , when Paige had finished . Newell shook his head . ' My sympathy is all with you , Dr. Paige . Perhaps , if I were in your place , I might find it very difficult to think of any extenuation for your chief . But it seems to me that this case calls for a great deal of calm and impartial under- standing .... Endicott had been building a reputation for many years ; had come to the height of his powers ; could n't afford to have anyone think he was capable of a mistake . Bad state of mind , to be sure , but not unique . It 's an old man 's disease . I think it quite possible that if you had n't left town that day , his spirit of decency and good sports- manship would have prodded him into doing the right thing .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the fact that you had run away made it seem so obvious you were to blame . So  --  he never got up the courage to tell the truth . I dare say he is a very unhappy man . In fact  --  I know he is . When he talked to me , on the oc- casion of an errand he had in the city a few weeks later , he was too painstaking in his explanation . It was much on his mind  --  festering , painfully .... Endicott 's development came to an abrupt halt on the day he lacked the courage necessary to the carrying-on of his evolution . Up to that hour , we may say , he had fulfilled the requirements to be a real man ! But at that one moment of testing , he decided to remain behind . Same old story that we recounted of our early ancestors . Endicott , figuratively , had gone through all the pain and fatigue of crawling up out of the ocean . l le had walked on the bleeding stubs of his flippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but ' But flunked it on the day he should have climbed down ? ' ventured Paige . ' It would seem so .... Now  --  will you not try to look at it that way ? It will ease your mind . I promise you . ' ' And I '  --  muttered Paige  --  ' I flunked it on the day I ran away ? '  | I wonder . ' There was a long silence . The Cathedral clock tolled noon . Paige became suddenly aware that he was imposing on Dean Harcourt ; had monopolized the whole morning . He rose to his feet . Just a moment ! ' The Dean 's gesture commanded him to be reseated . Before you leave I have something further to say to you . I want you to know that I am not a stranger to the problem of frustration . It has not been my custom to speak of my own dilemmas , but you have a right to benefit by my experience . Whatever I have been able to achieve  --  in personal poise , stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacles I have met .... This has always been true of men  --  since the dawn . Emergencies have always been necessary to men 's evolution . It was the darkness that produced the lamp . It was the fog that produced the compass . It was winter that clothed us , hunger that drove us to exploration . The aviator can taxi all day on the ground with the wind behind his back , but if he hopes to rise he must drive into the face of it . Doubtlessyou will find a way to solve your problem ; and , when you do , you will discover that your evolution has proceeded faster than could have been possible  --  but for this heroic test ! ' The timbre of the Dean 's voice  --  habitually low and resonant  --  seemed to have changed markedly . His tone was vibrant as he proceeded : For your comfort , my son , let me tell you that I have laid hold upon a truth powerful enough to sustain me until I die ! I know that , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward ! I know that the Universe is on my side ! It will not let me down ! I have been de- tained at times  --  but  --  eventually  --  I go on through ! ' Paige stared , almost transfixed , and listened breathlessly to the mounting crescendo of Dean Harcourt 's voice as the masterly , pain-battered prophet leaned farther forward over the desk , the deep eyes radiant with some inner light.  | Supporting himself on his elbows and outspread hands , the Dean seemed actually rising from his chair . He was all but on his impotent feet now . I go on through ! ' he repeated earnestly . I have suf- fered  --  but I know that I am Destiny 's darling ! ... You have suffered  --  but you , too , can carry on through ! ... Take it from me ! I know ! In spite of all the little de- tainments , disappointments , disillusionments  --  I get the lucky breaks ! I get the signal to go forward ! I have been delayed  --  long  --  long  --  long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIGHT ! ' It was very quiet in the room for several minutes . Dean Harcourt had sunk back into his chair , quite spent by his exertion . Newell Paige had an awesome feeling that he had witnessed a dramatic episode which very few people would have suspected possible of the calm , self-possessed Dean of Trinity Cathedral . He had heard men and women casually mumble their I-believes . Today it had been his high privilege to see  --  in active operation  --  the dynamic that propelled a majestic soul . Occasionally he had stood in great power-houses , almost stupefied and suffocated by the flashing lights and clamorous noise and vibrating floor - watching huge , tortured dynamos hurling forth energy ! Today he had seen the Herculean possibilities of a traine human spirit ! It stirred him to his depths . His voice sounded very unlike his own when he impulsively broke the silence , exclaiming , hoarsely , God !  --  I wish I had that ! ' Newell had taken his departure through the Cathedral nave , and was seated on a bench in Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter . Then he would go back for Sylvia . He felt limp . The close of his interview with Dean Iarcourt had been quite upsetting to his emotions , and he had behaved in a manner entirely out of accord with his customary management of himself . He had been in the act of going when the Dean had said , very gently , Come here , my boy '  --  and had taken his hand in hot 11 of his own .... It had been such a long , torturing strain , these past six months . He had n't quite realized , until now , how painfully tense he had become , or how near to the breaking-point .... Dean Harcourt 's fatherly tenderness had finished him off . He had pinched his eyes tight shut and clenched his teeth  --  but  --  damn it ! the tears would come .... However , the Dean understood ; knew 1w was neurally fagged . The Dean would n't think him a baby . Newell had felt like a little boy  --  a weary , hurt , bewil- dered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and steadied up again in the air and sunshine , it occurred to him that he had indeed put on a juvenile scene , especially when the Dean had said , tactfully , You need n't go out the way you came in , Newell .... Take this hall to the right , and leave through the Cathedral nave . ' But I left my dog back there , ' he had explained , for all the world like a ten-year-old . It had helped to clear the air a bit for both of them . They had laughed , the Dean wiping his eyes . Very well  --  go and get him . ' But  --  I do n't believe I can face that girl again , sir . ' Then leave the dog here , ' suggested the Dean . Miss Dexter will be going presently . About half-past , I should think . You can come back . We will take care of him . ' This had sounded sensible . He had made his exit as directed , out through the huge front door , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell in the tower had tolled the third quarter , Newell felt that he had waited long enough . About to rise , he saw them entering the park , Sylvia walking so close that she brushed her tawny flank against Phyllis 's dress . Very odd of Sylvia and quite out of keeping with her habits . His heart pounded as he watched them approaching . He strolled to meet them . Phyllis smiled  --  the same slow.  |p185rather  enigmatic smile he remembered so well when some bit of playful drollery impended . ' Really , Mr. Parker , I did n't coax her to come along , ' said Phyllis defensively . ' She followed me  --  just as if --  ' ' Just as if she knew you were going out to get something to eat , ' aided Mr. Parker , noting her slight flush when the sentence she had begun seemed to be getting her into difficulties . They were standing face to face now , Phyllis 's eyes studying his with an almost childish inquiry . ' I waited for you , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' No ... To be quite honest , I was n't up to seeing anyone  --  after I left Dean Harcourt .... I was going back , a little later , for Sylvia . ' ' Funny name for a dog , ' laughed Phyllis . Then , sober- ing , she knitted her pretty brows , and said , half to herself , ' Where was it ? Somewhere I 've heard of another dog whose name was Sylvia . ' ... A little cloud swept her face , and she murmured , almost inaudibly , ' I remember now , ' and ap- parently dismissing whatever serious recollection had been stirred she brightened , smiled amiably , and seemed about to move on . ' Now that you and Sylvia are reunited , ' she said casually , ' I shall go to my luncheon . ' He bowed , lifted his hat , and thanked her . Phyllis said good-bye , patted Sylvia on the head , and turned away in the direction from which she had come . This , too , he thought , was strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the park ? And had she come here purposely , expecting to find him ? He stared at her graceful retreating figure for a moment and slowly took a step or two . Sylvia , probably presuming her master expected to rejoin her new friend , trotted on ahead and was presently at Phyllis 's side , where she turned to make sure her deductions had been correct . He had stopped now indecisively . Phyllis , finding the dog beside her , glanced back over her shoulder , smiled , halted . Sylvia , much disturbed , slowly retraced her steps to half the distance between them , looking from one to the other . Phyllis laughed merrily . Let 's all go to luncheon together , ' called Parker , and afterward Sylvia can decide what she wants to do . ' For a moment Phyllis remained standing where she was , obviously debating whether the invitation should be ac- cepted . Parker walked toward her , Sylvia gleefully wagging q. herself almost off her balance . I 'm not sure that I ought to , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to counsel her as to the prudence of it . After all  --  leaving the dog out of it  --  we are n't acquainted , are we ? ' Well  --  we really ca n't leave Sylvia out of it , ' admon- ished Parker . It 's on account of her that we are here to- gether .... And  --  if this does n't sound too silly  --  I want to say this is a very discriminating dog , very fussy about her friends , and a little inclined to be a snob . Sylvia 's social approval should be sufficient . ' He fell into step with Phyllis and they walked slowly toward the park en- trance . I really should n't , ' she protested mildly , as they waited on the corner for a vacant taxi . I had promised to meet a couple of friends downtown at one . ' Might we  --  collect them  --  and all have luncheon together ? ' suggested Parker , not very enthusiastically . Of course not , ' murmured Phyllis , with a chiding grin . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that 's a good reason ? ' The taxi had drawn up at the curb , the driver stretching an arm back to open the door . Ca n't you telephone them ? ' entreated Parker . She nodded , and , having made her decision , gave herself to the little adventure whole-heartedly . Sylvia , with lolling red tongue , sat on her haunches , looking up into their faces with such an absurd expression of complacency that it made i them laugh . I never saw so friendly a dog , ' remarked Phyllis . It 's a  |p187| wonder you can keep her from following people  --  and getting lost . ' Sylvia is not a friendly dog , ' said Parker , turning to look Phyllis soberly in the eyes . She never followed anyone Phyllis soberly in the eyes . She never followed anyone before in her life  --  and has been almost rude to women . ' How curious ! ' exclaimed Phyllis . She acts as if she had known me . ' Parker was suddenly stirred to remembrance .... He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in com- radely conversation with Mrs. Dexter , he had mentioned his dog , and she had expressed a wish to see her . Next morning , he had led Sylvia on her leash into Mrs. Dexter 's room , where she had been patted and talked to almost as if she were a person , an attitude she had liked , apparently , since it was much the same as his own  --  for he had never since it was much the same as his own  --  for he had never addressed Sylvia with any of the puppy-talk commonly employed by most people in speaking to their dogs .... But it was incredible that Sylvia remembered ! I feel as if I had known you , too , somewhere , ' confessed Parker , with averted eyes . Is n't it odd ? ' murmured Phyllis . I felt that you did  --  though I knew you were mistaken .... And now '  --  she went on , rather breathlessly reckless  --  somehow  --  I feel that way about you ! ... I ca n't understand it . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her wide eyes ramble over his face , completely unself-conscious . Parker 's pulse beat faster under her candid scrutiny , and it was quite impossible for him to disguise his tender admiration in the responsive look he gave her .... Intent upon her study of his face , in an effort to recover a recollection , Phyllis had not looked squarely into his eyes . She met them now , and was face , in an effort to recover a recollection , Phyllis had not looked squarely into his eyes . She met them now , and was looked squarely into his eyes . She met them now , and was held for an instant , her lips parted . She glanced away quickly , and a slow flush crept up her cheeks . Where are we bound for ? ' she asked , a bit nervously , searching for solid ground on which their conversation might proceed . Parker had it in mind to say , ' I wish I knew . ' ... Evi/dently , in the anxiety of her deciding whether to accom- pany him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We 'll go up to the St. Lawrence  --  my hotel , ' he replied , ' and turn Sylvia over to the porter . He knows what to do for her .... Then , if you are agreed , we will go downtown to a nice little restaurant I know where there is quite decent music . Would you like that ? ' ' Please , ' said Phyllis preoccupiedly . At the St. Lawrence , they disposed of the dog , and were presently on their way down Lake Boulevard in the swift current of traffic , Parker endeavoring to be casual in his talk , regardless of his feelings . Phyllis was finding it dif- ficult to share responsibility for their conversation .... At length , as they were moving slower in the congestion of the downtown area , she said abruptly : ' I have remembered , Mr. Parker , where I heard about the other dog  --  Sylv in . My mother , who died a few months ago , wrote to me about it . I was in London at the time , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need n't have died . ' Her voice trembled , and Parker 's mouth was dry as he waited apprehensively for her to continue . ' There was a young surgeon , a Dr. Paige . She was so fond of him and he came to see her every day . Once he brought his dog . Her name was Sylvia .... Then they op- erated on my mother and Dr. Paige assisted . He made some frightful mistake that cost her life . Of course '  --  she went on , brokenly  --  ' it was just a dreadful accident , and he must have been terribly sorry . He ran away . They never saw him again . ' She lifted her swimming eyes to Parker 's face . It was white and haggard . For a long moment , Phyllis stared , frightened . Then , with a slow , audible intake of breath that articulated an agonized little ' Oh ! ' she buried her facein her hands and shuddered . They were approaching a corner now , and , when they slowed to a stop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertone , ' Would you be  --  just awfully hurt  --  if I were IIp189to get out  --  here ? ... I do n't believe I can  --  I know I ca n't possibly go on with it .... I 'm sorry . ' Newell tried to think of something to say to her , as they stepped out of the cab , but no words seemed adequate to express his feelings . It had all happened so quickly that , before he realized he was losing her , Phyllis had murmured before he realized he was losing her , Phyllis had murmured good-bye and sped away . He stood watching her until the little red feather on the jaunty black hat had disappeared in the milling crowd.  | DRIVEN by an almost frantic desire to escape , Phyllis had pushed half-blindly into the dense throng of midday saunterers , grateful for the shelter . At the next corner she turned to the right and with slow- ing steps and trembling knees covered the two blocks west- ward to Commonwealth , so stampeded by her unhappy discovery of Mr. Parker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the rough jostling she re- ceived while passing the exit from the roaring elevated at grim and grimy Wallace Street . On brighter and wider Commonwealth , Phyllis turned again to the right , proceeding north in the direction of the largest of the department stores , where Pat and Sonia would be waiting and wondering what had become of her . Within a block of this destination , a mirrored glimpse of her heavy eyes and drooping mouth discouraged the feeble hope that she might contrive to brave it out . While passing the entrance to the Potter House , she had slipped into the corridor and touched up her pale lips with a cold , shaky finger , but the shock she had suffered was too devastating to be camouflaged with rouge . Never had she felt so for- lornly desolate . Occasionally she paused , pretending interest in an at- tractive window display , trying to gather courage to face the two pairs of solicitously inquisitive eyes , knowing all the time that it was quite impossible . She practiced the smile they would expect , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as much genuine light-heartedness as the grinning bravado of a convict on the way to execution . Perhaps if it were either Sonia or Pat , alone , she might have made the venture , though at the almost assured risk of being called upon to explain what ailed her .... On further consideration , she knew that her problem was too com- plicated , too heavily charged with conflicting emotions , to be confided to anybody  --  even to Patricia who knew her through and through , even to dear Sonia whose sympathetic understanding could always be counted on .... Even to the Dean , incomparably kind and wise . Phyllis now decided to go home , directing her uneven steps toward Lake Boulevard again to take a north-bound bus . There was a renewed surge of panic as she contem- plated the affrighting possibility of coming face to face withhim . But it was unlikely . He would be at his luncheon by now . Unhappy , doubtless , though still able to eat . Men were said to be that way . As for herself , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she crossed with the stream of pedestrians to the east side of the boulevard and took her position at the curb where the bus would stop . It suddenly occurred to her now that Pat would unquestionably return to the apartment in a little while . She did n't want to see Pat  --  or anyone . The famous Art Institute , only a minute 's walk , offered sanctuary . She decided impulsively to go there and make an effort to compose herself . Phyllis was not a stranger to this interesting place . Frequently she came here to look at the pictures and other noted art objects . Her favorite room was the rangy , two-story hall which housed massive replicas of heroic statuary , medieval tombs , shrines , sculptured facades . An open hallway , after the manner of a viaduct , traversed the great room on the second level , narrow stairs descending from it . Standing now on this bridge , and about to go down , Phyllis moodily surveyed the huge plaster reproductions which rose impressively from the ground floor below . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated lips . For at the south end of the spacious hall , he was slowly and dejectedly pacing back and forth , his head inclined , eyes fixed on the flagging , his softgray hat crushed under his arm , hands deep in his coat pockets . Furtively , self-defensively , Phyllis retreated on tiptoe out of range , tarrying for a brief instant in the broad door- way of the corridor to look down with brooding eyes . Safe within the arch , she stopped , tugged off her hat , and nervously swept her forehead with the back of her wrist as if to erase the painful scene on which she had unwittingly intruded , reflecting that she had no right to witness his agony , however desperate her own might be . A wave of i something like compassion overwhelmed her . For so long had the name of Newell Paige been indis- solubly associated with her mother 's tragic death that it had acquired , in Phyllis 's memory , a peculiarly sinister quality , symbolic of an inexcusable and irreparable disaster . She had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in her imagination , a concrete face and form , would have been as unthought-of as to attempt a mental material- ization of Nemesis , Mythol , or Karma . Just his name  --  that was all  --  a name that served as a sort of arbitrary algebraic symbol for the catastrophe that had destroyed everything she had held dear . Sometimes she had made an attempt to resolve that frightful complication of cir- cumstances into its component parts . Doubtless her in- dulgent father 's self-destruction was to be partly accounted for by his financial losses , perhaps Grace 's retirement from normal life was on the books to happen , anyway , possibly her mother might have died of her disease in any event  --  but , after she was all done trying to disentangle the var- ious factors of the problem , the final result was Newell Paige.  | The fact that her mother 's reported interest in him had been but little short of a maternal devotion was completely shadowed by the stark calamity which he served in the capacity of axis , core , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those accidents whose recollection sears everything it touches . Phyllis had never harbored the apprehension that they might meet . It was reasonably sure that he would keep his distance .... Now  --  the whole Paige concept had been radically altered for her . It suddenly occurred to her that her mother  --  if she could be aware of it  --  would be deeply grieved over this wretched situation . Suppose it were her mother , instead of herself , who had come here and found Newell Paige disconsolately lonely , tortured by the ineradicable memory of his fatal blunder . What would she do ? Or , suppose her mother  --  by some means aware of their strangely spontaneous mutual interest , and the un- fortunate discovery that had destroyed it in a flash  --  were to walk in here today and take stock of their misery . Phyllis could hardly imagine her mother doing otherwise than taking each of them by the hand and delivering them to each other . For an instant she was gripped by an almost uncontrol- lable urge to run down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She even ventured a step in that direction ; then clutched at the wall , frightened . At length she went with spiritless , uncertain steps to the picture galleries . Seating herself in a room temporarily free of visitors , she tried to bring her turbulent mind to order . Sooner or later she must return and account for her strange behavior , and the longer she remained away , the more explaining she would have to do . She had , she felt , caused enough distress today without adding anything to it unnecessarily . But for a full half-hour she sat there dullystaring at canals and clouds in the Netherlands , and a graceful Spanish dancer , unsympathetically gay with her castanets , whose derisive , disillusioned mouth seemed about to inquire whether Phyllis had n't better get to the root of the matter , with ruthless honesty . Searching herself critically , Phyllis was obliged to admit  --  though this candid analysis made her cheeks burn that her heavy anxiety to relieve Newell Paige 's mental agony was inextricably tangled with the undeniable fact of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assay . It was n't , she told herself confidently , a mere physical attraction . His being six feet tall and strikingly handsome , really , truthfully , had nothing what- soever to do with it , she said . It was n't a matter of his being urbane and distinctly of her own world . Nor was it his slow smile , his curious trick of brief but singularly expressivegestures , his serious searching eyes that rambled all over your face and came to rest in the exact center of yours  --  not impudently , but earnestly in quest of you . No  --  it was his tenderness .... She could account for that now , though it had puzzled her at the time . He knew who she was and wanted to tell her how sorry he felt .... But  --  was n't it a little more than that ? When she talked , he had watched her lips with a queer little smile in his eyes . He had liked her . She knew that . Phyllis glanced at her wrist-watch . It was two-thirty now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult to venture out into the corridor . The long emotional strain had made her an easy victim to a peculiar hallucination . For the past few minutes she had been increasingly sensitive to the shadows moving across the open doorway . Some- thing inside her had begun to urge an attentive interest in these shadows cast by people strolling through the corridor . A timid little obsession maintained that presently one of these shadows would materialize into a person who would enter by that door . So strong had this expectation grown that Phyllis knew she would have to take herself severely in hand to move in that direction . She would meet him , she knew , directly in that doorway . It became so real that she vividly experi/enced it in imagination . Mentally she crossed the room , heart pounding hard . In the doorway she encountered him , face to face . For a long minute they stood staring into each other 's eyes , Phyllis trying to wink back the hot tears . He held out both hands to her , and she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , gave him her hands , and whispered , I 'm  --  so  --  awfully  --  sorry . ' The powerfully realistic little drama left her wet-eyed , limp , and nerveless . Summoning all her resolution , Phyllis rose unsteadily and walked toward the door , certain that the stirring day-dream would actually come true . But no one met her there . She drew a deep breath , not quite sure whether she was disappointed or relieved . Then , straightening , she achieved the briskly assured stride habitual with her , and proceeded , chin up and eyes clear , clown the corridor , her competent heels clicking regularly and determinedly on the marble floor , and thus into the outer air . The incident of her discovery of the real Newell Paige was now definitely closed . It was inconceivable that she would ever see him again . The conditions that would keep them apart were insurmountable , irrevocable . But she had , Phyllis felt , gained something of value by this chance meeting , however painful had been its eventuality . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Newell Paige would not be an embittering symbol for the chain of disasters that had made her life difficult . From now on , she told herself , his name would stand for the one enchanting half-hour of singularly sweet comradeship  --  an event to be forever cherished , though never repeated . Finding the apartment unoccupied , Phyllis went directly to the telephone and called Sonia at the shop . It comforted her to find that Sonia had not been very much upset by her failure to appear , a complacency probably accounted for by the news with which she was bubbling  --  Andy Nor- wood had invited the three of them to have dinner with hint . Tell Pat to prettify herself , ' advised Sonia . Where is she ? ' Having a talk with the Dean . Did n't you know ? ' Phyllis remembered now , thinking it odd that she had forgotten about Pat 's engagement to go , this afternoon , to Trinity Cathedral . For it had been much on her mind , yesterday , and she had wondered what might happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse on that occasion . Today 's strange events had swept it all from her memory . Breathing more freely , now that attention had been di- verted from her unusual behavior , Phyllis became almost light-hearted , made herself an egg-nog , and took pleasure in putting the apartment to rights . She carried her mother'sphotograph to the window and looked at it for a long time . Then she went with it to the mirror of her vanity-table andsat down to study their eyes . The likeness had never before seemed so uncannily identical . Perhaps her own experience today had matured her eyes a little , or at least had offereda hilltop glimpse of a destination to be arrived at in due time  --  something like the feeling of autumn briefly sensed on a crisp early morning in latter August . Exploring the box of rather pitiful little keepsakes in hertrunk , Phyllis re-read her mother 's long letter  --  her last one  --  in which there had been so much of Newell Paige , his almost obsessive interest in his profession , the high opinion in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had already nominated the talented young surgeon as his successor when the time should come for his own retirement . I think it quite beautiful  --  almost touching , ' continued the letter  --  this relationship between these two brilliant men . Whenever Dr. Endicott 's name is mentioned , Dr. Paige reacts to it much as an exceptionally devoted son might speak of an admired and revered father . I gather that he thinks Dr. Endicott is working too hard . '  | Phyllis lifted her eyes and stared at the wall , her thoughts busy . Then she shook her head , reluctantly , and read on . It occurs to me also that this charming young fellow lives a very lonely life without quite realizing how com- pletely his duties have cut him off from the interests and associations a man needs , especially at his age . Everybody seems to like him tremendously , but nobody , apparently , gets very close to him . He often talks about his love of music , occasionally dropping remarks which indicate that he is well posted . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profession . His eyes widened as if the thought had never before crossed his mind , and he replied , " Oh , dear , no ! There 's never been anything but this  --  not for a minute ! " Every morning , in fair weather , his dog comes along to the hospital and sits waiting in his car . I told him I wished I might see his clog , not imagining that he would give my casual request another thought . Quite to my sur- prise he brought her up to my room  --  a beautiful red setter named ( if you will believe it ) Sylvia ! If he has any other intimate friends I do not know about them . You will be wondering why I go on chattering about this lovable boy ( for in spite of his professional dignity he is , atheart , very boyish ) , but I ca n't help thinking about him . There are so many wide-open gaps in his experience of life . Thoroughly materialistic , and on the surface cold-blooded as the Sphinx , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive , wistful fellow in great need of something to tie up to besides tinkering people 's organs into proper running order . I already have a promise from him that lie will come to see us some time when we are all at home again . I think you would like him . ' Phyllis folded the letter and replaced it with the others in the box . Her mother seemed very near , today . And her bereavement swept over her almost as if she were fully realizing it for the first time . Pat was now quietly letting herself in , very deliberate about taking off her things . Phyllis called , but received no answer . Presently Pat appeared in the doorway of the bedroom . Hello , darling , ' said Phyllis , over her shoulder . ' Did you have a nice visit with the Dean ? ' Pat nodded , rather pensively , and turned away , Phyllis following her into the living-room , where they sat down together on the davenport . ' I 'm afraid I ca n't talk about it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled voice . I 've been up above the timber- line  --  in a strong gale .... Almost too refreshing  --  up there .... Air very light .... Makes you giddy . Makes you feel heavy when you come back to sea-level .... I 'll be all right .... But do n't ask me anything about it . ' ' I know , dear , ' sympathized Phyllis . ' He does that to people . I 'm glad you went . Are n't you ? ' Pat 's face had been averted , but now she turned slowly to confront Phyllis with cloudy eyes . ' I 'm not sure yet , ' she replied hesitantly . There was a long pause . ' God !  --  it 's a frightful price ! ' she suddenly muttered , as if to herself . ' And  --  if I ca n't afford it - I 'm worse off than I was before I saw him .... That man 's hard ! ' She pressed her finger-tips so deeply into her temples that they left little chalk-white marks . ' You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately patted the shapely arm . ' There are plenty of things one ca n't talk about .... Believe me  --  I know ! ' Pat 's wan and puckery little smile hinted that an inex- perienced young thing like Phyllis was hardly in a position to understand the full significance of her own platitude . A great deal of water , remarked the brief , bitterish smile , would have to go over the dam before Phyllis Dexter  --  dimpled and rosy and twenty-three  --  could realize what it meant to have a double handful of deep-rooted fixations ripped out of your viscera or wherever they were located , and every dangling , aching , red nerve-fiber of them coolly examined under a microscope .... Phyllis interpreted the smile , and returned to her room wearing one that looked very much like it . She too  --  if Pat only knew it  --  had been pretty thoroughly ploughed up since they had break- fasted together . Pat ! ' she called , after some minutes had passed . We 're going out to dinner with Dr. Norwood . Sonia telephoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel quite up to it , Pat , better make the effort . Sonia will be frightfully disappointed , you know . ' There was a stir in the living-room , but no reply . ' I 'd rather be shot , myself , ' pursued Phyllis , from the depth of her clothes-closet . I 've had a rough day , too , I 'm telling you ! ' telling you ! ' Very well , ' came Pat 's weary voice resignedly . But I do n't feel very playful . ' ' Of course you do n't , dear . But we must n't let Sonia down . She 's counting on us .... What are you going to wear  --  so our colors wo n't fight ? ' Perhaps this query might prove diverting , Phyllis thought . ' How about sackcloth and ashes ?  --  both of us . ' Phyllis grinned . The sardonic note in Pat 's voice was encouraging ; sounded more natural . Pat strolled in and sat on the bed . Sonia now arrived breezily , glanced suspiciously from one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long face , and intoned , lugubriously , ' If there are no further remarks concerning the deceased , we will now repair to the cemetery . ' Sonia ! ' chided Phyllis . ' Pat 's been talking to the Dean . ' ' I know it , and I 've a notion she feels as if she 'd been tugged feet-first through a knot-hole .... I had that experi- ence , Pat , and damn ' near cried my eyes out for three days . ence , Pat , and damn ' near cried my eyes out for three days . But you 're a lot steadier person than I am , and you 've just got to pull yourself together ! You 're going to meet my Andy Norwood . And he 's quite a dear  --  if I do have to say it myself . ' How silly ! ' chuckled Pat . Sounds as if you 'd brought him up  --  from the bottle . '  | ' Well , ' blurted Sonia , ' when I began to take charge of Andy , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't talk about anything more recent than the French Revolution . Now he can dance  --  ' n ' every- thing .... You go and take a hot bath and a half-hour 's rest . ' Unable to withstand Sonia 's blithe commands , Pat yielded and was presently a-splash in the bathroom . ' You must have had an exciting day , little one , ' began Sonia , when they were alone . ' One o'clock  --  we were hungry as bears  --  I called up the Cathedral office to see what had become of you . Mr. Simpson answered ; said he had seen you going down Marlborough , a few minutes earlier , accompanied by a red dog .... Is Simpson crazy  --  or am I ? ' ' A little , I should say  --  both of you , ' replied Phyllis , ' but '  --  her voice grew confidential  --  ' there was a reel dog . Her name was Sylvia . ' ' Sylvia !  --  a dog ? ... Well  --  go on .... But it does n't listen the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; would you ? ' ' There was a Mr. Parker came to see the Dean . He left his dog in the hall . After two hours he escaped by the front entrance . Sylvia remained . About half-past twelve I went to the Dean 's library  --  the other man who had come to see him had given it up and gone away  --  and , finding Mr. Parker was not there , I said , " He forgot his dog . " " Perhaps he will remember  --  and come back , " the Dean said . ' ' Why should you have cared ? ' demanded Sonia mean- ingly . ' It must have been an uncommonly attractive dog . ' ' Yes , ' replied Phyllis absently . ' So was 1Zr . Parker  --  I 'll bet you a pair of gloves ! ' Under this affectionate but relentless inquisition , Phyllisproceeded to narrate her strange encounter with the absent-minded Mr. Parker , the amusing circumstances of his inviting her to go with him to luncheon , their taxi drive to the St. Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But this is most exciting ! ' beamed Sonia , as the reel snapped , leaving the story hung up in midair . ' And then ? ' Phyllis , a bit frightened , busied herself with a rearrange- ment of the vase of blue irises on the table , Sonia waiting with shining eyes . ' So then we drove downtown , ' she continued reminis- cently , ' to a little French restaurant that he knew of  --  it was on Hayes Street . ' ' How funny ! ' interposed Sonia . ' On Hayes Street  --  of all places . ' ' Yes , ' lied Phyllis gallantly , her voice trembling a little , ' and we had  --  let me think  --  a caviar canape  --  and sherry  --  and an omelet  --  and ' And one of those sweet wooden pancakes on fire , I suppose , ' assisted Sonia , eager to push on with it . ' Yes  --  crepes suzette ... And then Phyllis re- plied with a nod and a brave though not very convincing smile , still fingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per- sisted Sonia . ' Of course I see you did . You look no end guilty . ' Pat , in her dressing-gown , rejoined them at this juncture , ' to Phyllis 's immeasurable relief , Sonia suggesting that she follow Pat 's example . As soon as the door closed on Phyllis , Sonia perched on the arm of Pat 's chair and grew suddenly confidential . ' Look ! ... Phyllis met a man today , more or less by ac- cident , and he seems to have put her in some kind of trance . I gather that they fell for each other  --  hard . For he took her to lunch on short notice , and she was terribly fussed when she tried to tell me about it  --  leaving big chunks out of the story , and ' ' And probably , ' drawled Pat , ' putting big chunks in.

' If everything was in order , I do n't believe Phyllis would have found it so hard to tell you . She 's been quite upset about something . Maybe she does n't want to see this man . Better ask her  - -  -  do n't you think ? ' Sonia impulsively went to the bathroom door , rapped , opened it an inch , and called , above the racket of the shower , ' Phyllis ! Will it be all right if Andy asks your Mr. Parker to dinner tonight ? ' There was a protracted silence , during which the water was shut off , and much swift thinking could be imagined .... Pat closed her eyes , shook her head , and felt that Sonia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He wo n't come , ' said Phyllis , as from a long distance . ' Thanks , just as much , Sonia .

She has been the loneliest thing , restless , discon- tented as a fish out of water  --  and here comes the first man she 's had any interest in  --  and something silly has turned up to make them peeved at each other . ' ' If we knew a little more about him --  ' speculated Pat . Muttering something unintelligible that began with ' damn , ' Sonia walked determinedly to the telephone , called the Cathedral , and got Mr. Simpson , who , locating Dean Harcourt in his private rooms , put him on the line .

I would have no hesitation about inviting him to my house . ' ' Wonderful ! ' exclaimed Sonia , ' Maybe you will ... To- morrow night ! ' ' I 'll  --  see , ' hesitated the Dean , after a lengthy pause . After Sonia had put down the receiver , she sat for a while with puzzled eyes , tapping her knuckles against her pretty teeth . ' Pat , ' she said seriously , ' we 've stumbled into a secret . Parker is all right  --  fine fellow  --  good enough to be in- vited to the Dean 's table  --  but not tomorrow night . ' ' Better let it go now , ' advised Pat , ' before you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' declared Sonia . ' I 'm going to see it through ! ' Taking up the telephone again , she found Norwood , explained that Phyllis had made a delightful new acquaint- ance , and easily secured his consent that Mr. Parker should be asked to the party . ' It 's a little late to invite him , ' commented Norwood . ' He probably has something else to do .... But I 'll call him .... St. Lawrence  --  did you say ? ' Phyllis , emerging , found Sonia at the telephone desk in a tense attitude of expectancy . She glanced from one to the other inquiringly , and Pat , feeling she should be loyal to her hostess 's well-intended intrigue , no matter how much she privately doubted the wisdom of it , explained , ' We 're going to have a pleasant little surprise for you in about a minute . ' The telephone bell jangled , as if to offer prompt con- firmation of this threat , as Phyllis stood wide-eyed and undisguisedly apprehensive of whatever dismaying plot might have been contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ago , ' boomed the friendly voice of Andy Norwood . ' Did n't say where he was going and left no forwarding address . Phyllis must have had a bad effect on him . Perhaps he jumped in the lake . ' Sonia begged his pardon for the trouble she had caused him and clatteringly dropped the receiver into its slot . ' Well , ' she said , with an air of finality , ' that 's that ! ... Your Mr. Parker has left town . ' ' I could have told you that , ' replied Phyllis quietly , ' and saved you all this bother . ' ' Oh ?  --  ' Sonia 's inflection hinted at a trace of chagrin over her audacity in trying  --  with so little co-operation  --  to accomplish a generous deed . ' So  --  he informed you he was leaving  --  at once ? ' Two pairs of affectionate eyes waited , watched , and wondered , Phyllis realizing that she had misled Sonia into an awkward situation . Impetuously deciding that the truth was now demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she replied . ' He did n't . ' Sonia rose with a little gesture of bafflement and saun- tered toward the door . Pausing , she grinned rather sheepishly and facing Pat remarked , in the approved man- ner of litigious dryness , ' You may take the witness .... The State rests . ' Phyllis quickly followed her into their bedroom , put an arm around her , and murmured : ' Darling  --  I did n't mean to hurt you . But I simply could n't see him any more . Ca n't you understand ? Forgive me for not telling it all quite  --  quite as it was . I could n't ! ' ' It 's not your fault at all , Phyllis , ' conceded Sonia gently . ' I was a meddlesome Miss Fixit .... But I thought you really liked him and I wanted to do you a good turn . You know that ; do n't you , dear ? ' ' Oh , Sonia  --  of course !

'  | Shortly before five on Tuesday , Phyllis went to the Cathedral , relieved to find that the last caller for the daywas just leaving . Dean Harcourt was alone in the library . Crossing to his desk , she stood very close to the arm of hischair , almost childishly , waiting for him to say something . So  --  you delivered the dog to Mr. Parker , ' he said , at length , looking up into her moody eyes . They told me the dog was in your company when you left , and there has been no report that Mr. Parker returned to claim him . ' Yes , ' admitted Phyllis . ' We met in the park . ' Pleasant fellow . ' Very . ' Something tells me you rather liked Mr. Parker , Phyllis . ' I 'm afraid he deceived you . His name is not Parker . ' What makes you think that ? Did he tell you ? ' No . Not directly . But I have reasons for being quitesure that he is the Dr. Paige who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . ' Does Mr. Parker know that you suspect him of being this Dr. Paige ? ' Yes  --  I 'll tell you all about it , ' said Phyllis , seating herself opposite him . It was quite a long story and not an easy one to tell , es- pecially the part in the Art Institute . Several times Phyllistopped and waited so long that it seemed the story was ended . Then she would compose herself and continue . At length she relaxed in her chair . Perhaps , ' reflected Dean Harcourt , you would have ( lone better to obey your impulse . I agree with you that your mother , under such circumstances , would probably have gone to him and relieved his mind . ' But I 'm a girl ! I could n't ! ' she protested , with swim- ming eyes . ' I 'm not chiding you , dear , ' assured the Dean kindly , but it seems to me you might have approached him  --  seeing how distressed he was  --  with some little token of , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! ' Phyllis expostulated . ' If it had been only a matter of forgiveness , but ' She dropped her eyes and her voice lowered almost to a whisper . ' I likes l him  --  very much  --  and I 'm afraid he could n't help knowing it .... That put me in an  --  an awkward position to go to him  --  about anything .... If it had been the other way about  --  and he had come to me  --  it would have been different . ' There was a little silence , and Phyllis , coming to atten- tion , seemed struggling with a desire to say something more  --  something that was difficult to express . ' Would you mind if I asked you a question ? ' she en- treated . ' Yes , ' replied the Dean . ' If it 's the question I think you are going to ask , I would indeed mind  --  very much ... You must n't . ' ' No  --  I suppose not . ' She brightened a little and be- gan tugging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for asking ? ' ' You did n't ask , Phyllis . ' ' That 's true . ' She rose to go . ' We 'll be seeing you tonight at our dinner ? ' said the Dean . She nodded , patted his hand , and crossed the room . At the door , she paused , smiled , and said softly , ' I 'm glad he wanted to tell you all about it . '  | IN HER gentle and modest way Mrs. Crandall felt that she was an efficient hostess , and enjoyed a secret pride in her accomplishments at the buzzer-end of Dean Harcourt 's table . But tonight she had occasion to question the inerrancy of that sixth sense on which she had long relied for guidance in the suitable seating of his guests . At five-thirty she had written their ten names on as many slips of white paper , spreading them out on her tidy desk and jockeying them into position with a due regard for their respective superiority , their precedence in relation to this particular affair , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , even when her knowledge of a dinner 's personnel was so sketchy that she had little more than instinct to direct her , plus the practical belief  --  which Mrs. Crandall confidently carried into her various undertakings  --  that all things work together for good to them that love God , including such minor articulations as the one in which she was at that moment engaged . Because they were interesting out-of-towners , it was clear enough that Professor Patricia Arlen and Miss Elise Graham should be seated at their host 's right and left . The distinguished lawyer whom the Sinclairs were bringing  --  probably a business friend of Mr. Sinclair  --  might find Miss Arlen an enjoyable companion .

Dr. Norwood far as he was concerned there was peace on earth and good grinned amiably , nodded an indulgent affirmation , and will among men , nor did any constraint exist between him- self and a fellow creature.  | And Miss Graham , not to be outdone by this geniality , was demonstrating a guileless gladness that would have made a surly cynic of Pollyanna . Elise had , it appeared , been just now in receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , was an awful blarney and the table , gradually drawn into it , was making appreciative little noises in confirmation of this tribute which she well deserved , for she had indeed sung beautifully , and it was no more than fair , Mrs. Crandall thought , that Elise should have the entire stage to herself while she took her bow . She accepted the applause very prettily , and began re- plying to queries , the Dean 's first , who wanted to know something about life in little Leeds ; and Simpson 's , who hoped she would give them the high lights on her recent spectacular debut in Louisville . Perhaps it was the pro- prietorial complacency of Mr. Corley 's expression that determined Elise 's decision to share her honors with her valued friend , Nathan Parker , who , she gratefully con- ceded , was responsible for her success , and without whose timely assistance she might have gone on for life unrecog- nized . She spoke his name softly , caressingly . ' Tell them about him , dear , ' urged Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added , intimately and with promisinglittle nods to Sonia , whose eyes she had happened to pick up at the moment . ' Well  --  to make a long story of it --  " began Elise , girlishly ingenuous . ' Nathan Parker mysteriously dropped in at Leeds , late last fall , on no particular errand , accom- panied by a valuable red setter . ' ' I say ! ' piped Mr. Talbot 's Oxonian treble . ' Dashed if that is n't odd ! Was n't that the chap 's name , sir , you said would return to claim a dog he 'd left here yesterday ? He must have done so while I was out . ' Dean Harcourt seemed unimpressed by this coincidence , returning his attention immediately to Miss Graham , im- plying with a nod that her narrative had the right of way . Simpson was observed to be grinningly mumbling somethingp211into Phyllis 's ear which brought a quick flush to her cheeks and an entreating glance toward Sonia whose alert eyes registered a knowledgeable interest . ' But  --  by Jove ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Simpson 's , ' you must have seen him , Miss Dexter  --  and the dog , too . Whatever became of him  --  the dog , I mean ? ' ' Better tell him , ' growled Simpson , ' so Miss Graham can proceed . It 's his British instinct . Once he gets hold of an idea , you might as well help him work it out , for there 's no peace until ' It 's no secret , ' said Phyllis evenly . ' The dog insisted ongoing along with me when I left , and we met Mr. Parker outside . ' ' Then that ca n't possibly be my Mr. Parker , ' commented Elise decisively , ' though it is a fact that Nathan Parker is in town . I hope to see him  --  tomorrow .... But I happen to know that Sylvia would n't walk away with anyone . ' ' Sylvia ! ' exclaimed several voices in various pitches of incredulity . ' Yes  --  and a one-man dog if there ever was such an animal . If Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  --  I 'm sure it would not be a girl . She hates women . I saw her nearly every day for months and she never thawed out  --  not the least bit . ' Mrs. Crandall thought she observed a little smile playing about Phyllis 's eyes which were raised to meet Sonia 's . And Sonia , looking into them , was replying with a slow sly wink .... This whole affair was becoming more complicated every minute . ' That point being cleared up , then , ' the Dean was re- marking quietly , ' Mr. Nathan Parker arrived in Leeds , and ' And lived at my Uncle Clay Brock 's hotel , ' continued Elise dryly , the interruptions seeming to have dampened her enthusiasm . ' Naturally  --  we met , and  --  well '  --  she hesitated , lowered her eyes shyly , and groped her way  --   | that 's about all there is to it . Nat took an interest in my voice and arranged everything for my recital in Louisville . ... And my grandfather liked him so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' There was another pause , ac- companied by a delicious telltale confusion which fetched a high-keyed Ah-ha ! ' from the privileged Talbot , followed by a brief outburst of merriment . Elise , it seemed , had unwittingly given herself away . I wonder what she 's up to  --  the little rascal ! ' muttered Mrs. Sinclair out of the corner of her mouth . Punishing Mr. Corley , I should say , ' reflected Mrs. Crandall . Well  --  she must n't ! ' decided Mrs. Sinclair . Raising her voice , she said sweetly , Oh  --  do tell them , Elise , how Mr. Parker helped your grandfather the time he fell ill while putting on a cast ... Such a droll story , Dean Harcourt . ' Elise , who had recovered now from her embarrassment , told it all and told it well  --  the interesting case of the Potts fracture  --  Really , the very worst kind of break there is , Grandpa says '  --  and how , by sheer accident , and not knowing a blessed thing about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recital , Sonia 's eyes never left Phyllis 's face , and Phyllis 's eyes did not rise from herplate . ' I say !  --  but that was odd ! ' squeaked Mr. Talbot . Incredible ! Maybe the chap was a doctor ! ' Elise shook her head , smiling tolerantly . My grandfather would have known , ' she said . Would n't he , Dean Harcourt ? ' One would think so , ' agreed the Dean , politely but rather non-committally . Sonia still intently studied Phyllis 's face , and Phyllis , actively interested again , had turned her eyes questingly toward Dean Harcourt , who , briefly encounter- ing them , gave his attention to Miss Arlen , his attitude seeming to say that we could now do nicely with another topic of conversation .... Mrs. Crandall had definitely decided that there was a great deal going on at this party.  | Dr. Norwood , in excellent spirits on arrival , was taci- turnly tinkering with his squab . Sonia had left off prodding him back to life and was herself preoccupied and demure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulling over Mr. Parker 's lay performance of difficult surgery , was blinking rapidly in that curious way he had when agitated and perplexed , a nervous batting of the eyes that twitched his nose , rabbit fashion . Mr. Corley , whose exact relation to other objects was in doubt , smiled glassily as if in a moodto welcome good tidings from almost any quarter . And how is our little Celeste ? ' inquired the Dean jovially , rousing Norwood to attention . Quite contented , sir , in Miss Warren 's school . ' Patricia leaned forward , smiling interestedly . Dr. Norwood 's little girl , ' explained the Dean , con- tributed a valuable thought to a weighty discussion here , some weeks ago . ' It was also the final thought on that occasion , ' remarked Sonia . Most amusing ! ' said Talbot , who was requested to re- cover the event for the benefit of the party . It was n't too easy a job , but Talbot managed , general laughter rewarding his tale . Unfortunately , ' observed Norwood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of absorbing interest . As Mr. Talbot has said , Dean Harcourt was declaring , or at least strongly implying  --  if I misquote you , sir , please correct me  --  that a whole generation may be involved in a violent clash of opinion , apparently of local and transient significance , and never live to realize that their fanatical struggle was of signal importance to the progress of civilization . I remember , sir , that I was eager for this question to be pursued . ' Why not ? ' called Mr. Sinclair , I think we should all like to hear something of the sort from the Dean . ' Attention promptly centered on Dean Harcourt , who sat for a moment with narrowed eyes apparently debating a suitable point of departure toward the suggested talk.  | ' It all gets back at last , ' he began thoughtfully , ' to the engaging story of the Long Parade . We must break our bad habit of talking about human progress as if it were a gradual upward journey from the jungle to Utopia . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that upward course in terms of planes , as if mankind proceeded on a series of steps up ' Like climbing a terrace ? ' asked Mr. Sinclair . ' Exactly ! The half-dozen generations comprising a cer- tain era will move along rather uneventfully , at times almost apathetically , on an approximately level plane . The up- heavals , revolutions , and excitements of climbing up out of the era immediately preceding will already have become legendary . In this particular economic and political set-up that we are considering , customs crystallize rapidly into laws , the laws take on dignity and resolve themselves into codes , constitutions , charters . Manners beget morals . Traditions become established . After a while , there is a well-defined group of reliances : the State , the Church , hero worship , ceremonials ; norms  --  norms of beauty in art , norms of gallantry in conflict , norms of social conduct , norms of intellectual fitness ... Very well . Then  --  when everything has become neatly integrated and the Parade has had its relatively serene period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the level on which it is traveling , it wants to look out !  --  for the time has come for the taking of another steep grade ! ' Customarily , these sharp ascents have been made within the space of a single generation . Sometimes it has taken a little longer  --  but not often . The people who are called upon to make the climb , up to the next level , unquestion- ably get a more comprehensive view of the Great Plan for humanity 's eventual destiny than is possible for the people who live midway of an era when things are , as we would say , normal . In the course of this rough scrambling up to the next plane of living , practically all of the old reliances are under heavy stress . Long-respected statutes are found to bep215obsolete and obstructive . Emergency measures of an economic nature inevitably upset the morals which had prevailed  --  for the ethical imperatives of a given time are , in most cases , the product of economic conditions . Cher- ished dogmas , vital and useful yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Art  --  supposedly long , in relation to the fleetingness of Time  --  yields to theclamor for reappraisal , along with everything else ... A hectic period that does strange tricks of transformation to the people appointed to go through it ... ) ' Appointed ? ' asked Patricia . ' I  --  think  --  so , ' declared the Dean , measuring his words . The room was very quiet . Yes , ' he repeated , after a little silence , I think so ... Appointed to go through it . Because they 're stronger , better , fitter ? ' wondered Talbot . No  --  not necessarily . And not appointed as individuals . The time had come for another step upward . The era  --  as an era  --  had --  ' Had done its stuff , ' suggested Corley , as the Dean hesitated momentarily . Exactly ! If a fair judge were to have analyzed its personnel , perhaps it would be seen that if all the people participant in that era were as forward-looking as three per cent of them , the era would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sluggish as half of them , it would have been longer . But  --  taking the era by and large , it now had  --  as Mr. Corley puts it  --  " done its stuff . " ... No , Mr. Sinclair , the people who happen to be in the line of march when 1 ) estiny determines that a grade is to be taken may be no better , no stronger than their fathers ; no fitter than their sons . They just happen to be in and of the Long Parade when it arrives at the foot of the ascending hill ... ' Hard on the old folks , ' grinned Mr. Sinclair . Quite ! ... ' Whatever sympathy may be felt for bewildered Youth on these occasions , the people in the Parade who find the climb most difficult and painful are the mature.  | For they have learned all they know about living under the more or less stable and predictable regimentation of the long plateau over which they have come . It does strange things to them , as individuals . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pine forest  --  and that does n't mean that a pine forest is of no vtlue . In such periods of transition many individuals who , in a normal time , might have been very useful , crumple into defeat . Many others who , under normal conditions , might have lived mediocre lives , endure the unusual with high distinction . ' ' Proving , ' reflected Mr. Sinclair , ' that the race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong . ' ' Under ordinary circumstances , ' the Dean observed , ' that old saw is backed by a substantial element of fact . During the period of taking a grade , all the old saws are valueless . ' ' And then the good people and the wise people get their innings ? ' piously inquired Elise , whose conservative re- ligious training inspired her to think it was about time for the Dean to be insisting on something of the sort . ' That 's where most of the trouble comes from , my dear , on these difficult ascents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and the wise people who had earned their reputation for goodness and wisdom by steadfastly maintaining that twelve inches make one foot , and a penny saved is a penny earned , and that children should be seen but not heard ' And a woman 's place is in the home , ' aided Sonia . ' Where charity begins , ' added Talbot . ' And ends , ' remarked Patricia . ' Thanks , ' said the Dean  --  ' all of you --  These wise and good are usually persons of ripe age who have become incapable of drastic readjustments . ' ' Which gives the youngsters a chance , ' declared Simpson brightly . ' Who are too immature , ' said the Dean , ' for such a re-  |p217s|ponsibility  . So  --  they all go scrambling up the hill , every- body talking at once , very shrilly . And , at length , they reach the top and come out upon a broad plateau ; write off their losses , tie up their bruises , mend their tattered boots , and the Long Parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes are framed . New constitutions written . New moral standards agreed upon .... And then --  ' Another half-dozen generations of that , ' assisted Nor- wood . ' Yes  --  and when everything has become nicely articu- lated again in that era , so that the people know practically what to expect of their institutions , their schools , their banks , their parliaments , their methods of transportation , communication , propaganda , social welfare ; then you need to look out ! It 's about time to take another grade ! ' ' Why  --  we 're taking one now ! ' exclaimed Elise , wide- eyed . ' Are n't we ? ' ' And we 're having coffee in the parlor , ' announced Mrs. Crandall , who for the past ten minutes had been on the edge of her chair waiting for a semicolon to appear . Simpson chuckled merrily . She felt like shaking him sometimes . And he knew it , too ! They all rose , and Simpson stepped to the back of the Dean 's rolling-chair , prepared to guide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and they came to attention , grouped near the doorway . ' A moment  --  before we leave this , ' he said soberly . ' As Miss Graham has just observed , we are taking one of these grades  --  now .

And the only option extended to us , as individuals , is our privilege to determine whether we prefer to be dragged up  --  in which case we are an obstacle and a liability  --  or to proceed under our own power .... Some of us  --  like my good Simpson  --  will have to give others a push , now and again .... Very well , ; beloved , ' he finished , giving Simpson 's hand an affectionate pat , ' lead on ....

' ' I wonder what will come of that ? ' speculated Phyllis . Did n't you think that yarn was exaggerated  --  about Vacancy on the Vassar faculty , ' said Sonia . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Andy had stopped now and were shaking hands . Phyllis , sitting on the edge of her bed , continued patting Then Pat waved a hand to Sonia and Phyllis . Andy fol- her face with cold cream , silent so long that Sonia slowly lowed her into the car . The porters shouted ' All aboard ' turned toward her inquiringly. and tossed their portable steps into the vestibules . Andy ' No , ' replied Phyllis absently. stepped down as the train began to move and waited until ' It did n't sound right to me , ' declared Sonia . ' I do n't Pat 's car had passed , holding out a hand toward her believe anyone would have known how to do that  --  not window ; then , with squared shoulders and shining eyes , he the way she told it  --  but a surgeon . ' came back to the gate . ' He is a surgeon , ' muttered Phyllis.  | Then she was just stringing us about Mr. Parker ? ' I do n't think so .... I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently . ' Well  --  I know that much about her Mr. Parker . He is a surgeon . ' Phyllis rose and strolled toward the door lead- ing to their living-room . And his name is not Parker ... I think I 'm ready to tell you all about it now , dear , ' she added unsteadily . For a half-hour they sat facing each other on either end of the davenport , their feet drawn up under them , Phyllis reciting from the beginning all that she knew about Newell Paige , Sonia infrequently venturing a query . Mrs. Dexter 's final letter lay open between them . I know how painful it must be , ' said Sonia gently , for you to be reminded of the operation , but do you think you could recall the details of it as Grace gave them to you ? ' I do n't think Grace knew very much about it , ' replied Phyllis , with a deep sigh . She and Father and the nurse went up with Mother to the operating-room  --  or to a little room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the telephone . Mother had been taken in , and was under the operation when he returned . Father seemed very much excited . Grace did n't know at the time what troubled ' him . Of course they were both anxious and nervous be- cause Mother was in there . They walked to the end of the hall , she said , and waited . Father was white and shaky . ' You said Grace saw Dr. Paige for a moment just before the operation . Was he upset or excited ? ' No  --  she did n't notice anything like that . The nurse said they were being delayed a little because Dr. Endicott had been required to go to the telephone . ' Was n't it queer , ' speculated Sonia , that he should be doing any business on the telephone at the moment when everything was set for an operation  --  patient waiting  --  and all that sort of thing ? ' Emergency call , perhaps , ' thought Phyllis.  | Maybe it was the same emergency that took your father to the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I recall now  --  Grace told me it was reported that Dr. Endicott lost nearlyeverything he had , that day . ' Sonia shifted her position , leaning forward , her arms folded , her brows contracted studiously . Let 's try to organize a little picture , Phyllis . Dr. Endicott is getting to be an old man . Everything he thinks he owns is tied up in stocks . He is just ready to go into adifficult operation . He is called to the telephone and toldthat he has n't a dime left to bless himself with . He is an older man than your father  --  and you know what that same news did to him . Then  --  Dr. Endicott comes back from the phone  --  and operates . ' Phyllis stared , pressing the back of her hand against her lips . Now '  --  pursued Sonia steadily  --  let 's come at it from another angle . Young Dr. Paige is the assistant . Dr. Paige '  --  she tapped the letter with her finger-tips  --  ' is devotedly attached to Dr. Endicott ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away  --  and hides , ' said Phyllis thickly , which he would not have done if he had n't made a terrible mistake . ' I 've just been wondering , ' reflected Sonia , half to herself . I 've been wondering which of those two men would have been the more likely to make a mistake  --  on that particular occasion . ' Yes  --  but why should he have taken the blame ? ' Sonia took up the letter , and slowly read a few lines aloud . " I think it beautiful  --  almost touching  --  this rela- tionship between these two brilliant men . Whenever Dr. Endicott 's name is mentioned , Dr. Paige reacts to it much as an exceptionally devoted son might speak of an admired and revered father . " ... Listen to this , dear ... " I gather that he thinks Dr. Endicott is working too hard . " '  | Phyllis shook her head . ' I tried to make something of that , too , ' she said dis- mally . ' But it does n't make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his profession . I think it very doubt- ful that he would throw his life away to shield another man . ' You mean , ' queried Sonia seriously , that from what little you saw of him , yesterday , you doubt if he is the sort to do such a thing ? ' No  --  I do n't mean that , at all ... Perhaps he might . ' Phyllis was thoughtfully silent for a little while . ' I think he might , ' she added . ' And I think he did ! ' said Sonia decisively . There are people loyal enough to do that . I fancy he 's one of ' em . ' We 'll probably never know . ' Phyllis slowly disengaged herself from the steamer rug , and tugged Sonia to her feet . Come , dear , it 's late ... There 's nothing we can do about it . I 've told you everything . Let 's forget it now . ' k Meaning  --  truly '  --  said Sonia , putting an arm around her  --  that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever ? ' Phyllis nodded pensively . I 'm going to put the whole thing out of my mind , ' she insisted . ' I never expect to see him again  --  and no amount of worrying on my part would do him any good . ' Very well , dear , ' agreed Sonia , ' if that 's the way you feel about it . ' They went to their beds , snapped off the lights , and there was a full half-hour of silence . Phyllis cautiously rose up on her elbow and listened . Sonia ! ' she whispered . ' You awake ? ' ' Of course . ' Was n't that absurd  --  what she said about his dog ? '  |p123MOMENTARILY  stunned by Phyllis 's impulsive decision to leave him , Newell had stood at the open door of the taxi  --  deaf to the indignant honking of impeded traffic  --  dazedly watching her until she was lost in the crowd . Jarred now to full consciousness of the driver 's rasping demand for further instructions , he clumsily fumbled in his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had all come to pass so suddenly that he had not even said good-bye . Her final I 'm sorry ' lingered in his ears . It hadbeen spoken hardly above a whisper , intimate , almost sympathetic , as of a shared disappointment . With no definite plan except to seek some quieter spot where his painful bewilderment would be less conspicuous , he crossed to the comparative tranquillity of the east side of the boulevard , finding himself in the immediate vicinity of the Art Institute . It suggested a temporary refuge . Mounting the broad steps , he entered and proceeded along the main corridor . Such vague attention as he paid to his surroundings seemed vested only in a fantastic desire to know how many people annually drifted into this place for the sole purpose of self-recovery from a cruel blow or privately to take stockof what little still remained after some unanticipated loss . Doubtless  --  especially now that the tide was exceptionally strong  --  a considerable quantity of well-gowned flotsam and white-collared jetsam washed up here , dismayed people of the better sort who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them down for an hour while they made pretense of interest in these various art-forms . Nor need it be a mere pretense . It was not inconceivable , thought Newell , as he strolled down the corridor lined with exquisite statuettes and busts on pedestals , that many a thoughtful person  --  subconsciously remembering that the greatest of the artists lived in poverty and executed their best work under stress of heartbreak  --  might find in these things a strange comradeship . Arriving in a great hall of gigantic reproductions of Euro- pean church-doors , elaborately carved choir-stalls , shrines , and the like , Newell sauntered among them with mis- givings . For it was quite impossible to appreciate , today , either their historical significance or their artistic value . Under normal circumstances , he knew , they would have stirred him deeply . He paused before the Colombe tomb-statue wrought in memory of Francis II , last Duke of Brittany , and Margue- rite de Foix , his wife , whose recumbent figures surmounted the catafalque . A stringy , high-domed lad of fourteen , accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tutor , discreetly palmed a yawn and indifferently asked in a fluty treble , ' What did he do ? ' ' Oh  --  nothing , ' replied the bookish one with equal un- concern , as if this sort of immortality could be had at smallcost . ' Then why is he here ? ' queried the boy , with unexpected wisdom , thought Paige , glad to be diverted for a moment . ' Well  --  he really is n't , ' confided the tutor . ' It 's Co- lombe that 's here . This Duke Francis was a nobody . He was n't even there '  --  he chuckled dryly ' that is , he was n't all there . ' ' Was Colombe so important , then ? ' grinned the boy . ' As a matter of fact  --  no , ' replied the tutor with a shrug . ' Michel Colombe was just a good all-round stone-mason . He made this piece from a drawing by Jehan Perreal . ' ' So  --  Colombe is n't here either , ' decided the youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  | Mmm , ' agreed the tutor , with a forward thrust of his underlip . That is , if Perreal actually conceived the idea . There 's no telling . He may have stolen it from sketches drawn by some bright pupil . ' Like me , for instance , ' suggested the boy , apparently willing to toss his teacher this cue for some astringent pleasantry . Yes  --  at least that bright . ' Pleased with his disciple 's reaction to this sally , the tutor sobered and pointed to theforemost of the supporting figures on the west side of the statue . This one , you will observe , has two faces , the younger looking forward , the grim , bearded , old one look- ing backward . Make note of that and do me a page or two of your impressions ... ' His further instructions became inaudible to Paige as the pair ambled away . It occurred to the eavesdropper that he would be much interested himself in seeing what this smooth-cheeked , in- experienced lad might write about the ironic playfulness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this celebrated memorial to a good , all-round stone-mason who had copied the drawing of an artist who might have filched the design from a clever student . It was incomprehensible how some men were tossed into the hall of fame accidentally , while others , who had earned a right to be there , lacked even a grave-marker in some neglected cemetery . Paige thought it would be interesting to hear a few words on that from Dean Harcourt . And what might the Dean have to say about this gloomy old owl who looked backward over the course that the bent-shouldered bearers of Francis the Unimportant had plodded , these three thousand miles and four hundred years ? How much of this bewhiskered old philosopher 's dull-eyed apathy was attributable to fatigue , how much to saintly patience , how much to human under- standing , and how much to a fuse-blown disgust ? ... Oh , well what the hell ' ... The longer you thought about this sort of thing , the more be-addled you were . Newell turned away and walked to the extreme south end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paced slowly back and forth . I 'm sorry , ' she was still saying in that low- pitched voice of hers that made everything she said sound almost like a confidence . He sensed her presence as keenly as when she had sat close beside him in the taxi . Doubtless the feeling would pass , presently , and the image would fade , but for the moment Phyllis seemed very near  --  so near he could see the little gold flecks in the amber of her uplifted eyes . The spot on his wrist where her bare forearm had rested for an instant when they were fondling Sylvia 's silky head was still aware of that accidental contact . His longing to have another word with her  --  to replace the poignant memory of that ultimate I 'm sorry '  --  was so strong that Newell tentatively sparred with the idea of writing her a note , but when he ventured in imagination upon the first sentence of it , he rejected the thought . It would only cause them both more unhappiness to reopen this hopeless case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inquisitive glance and slowly moved away , mounted the narrow stairs to the next level , and sauntered down the long corridor whose succession of open doors led into the picture galleries . He walked aimlessly around the walls of two of them , the paintings blurring into a motley panorama of meaningless irrelevance . In the third room he sat for a while trying to debate what next to do .... Elise had called up saying she would be engaged throughout today and to- morrow . He had promised to see her on Wednesday after- noon . But what was the good of it ? The very thought of trying to be sprightly and amusing for Elise 's entertain- ment was irksome , repugnant . He would drop her a line . So  --  what ? Go back to weedy little Leeds ? For what purpose ? True , he had told the Brocks and Dr. Graham that he would return  --  but what mattered it ? He was un- der no obligation to do so . If he did , he would probably be trumping up errands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of a reconciliation that could never be effected.  | No  --  the farther away the better . Why not to the Coast ? Why not now ? He glanced at his watch . It was half-past two . Plenty of time to gather up his light baggage and take a late afternoon train . He rose , reproaching himself again for his dull indifference to the pictures , and crossed the room , glancing briefly at two or three of the more arresting subjects . With listless steps he continued along the corridor which , forming a huge square , would lead him back to the main entrance . At open doors he halted briefly , wishing he might shake off his lethargy and take advantage of an opportunity he would have welcomed in any other state of mind . Through one doorway he caught a colorful glimpse of the lithe , life-sized figure of a green-gowned dancing girl , a mocking , twisted smile on her red lips . He stood , for a moment , half-minded to go in and view her at closer range . After an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street again , he hailed a taxi and drove across town , secured accommodations on a five-forty-five train , returned to the St. Lawrence , and began packing . Once more the idea of writing Phyllis a brief letter was debated and dismissed . Common civility suggested his canceling the engagement he had with Elise , but after experimenting with several explanations to account for his sudden departure , he damned all the half-scribbled pages into the waste-basket and gave it up . His mind turned toward Dean Harcourt . It would be ungracious to rush away without some expression of gratitude to this wise and kind priest . The note he composed was brief , but the Dean would understand . ' I am leaving this afternoon , ' he wrote , ' for the West . You were very good to me ... ' He tapped the barrel of his pen against his teeth , meditating a sentence that might explain his abrupt decision to go so far away , but shook his head . A few moments later , in the lobby floral shop , he ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ean , accompanied by the note . Sylvia eyed him reproachfully as he led her past the long row of Pullmans to the baggage-car . She had become ac- customed to traveling in this manner , but it was plain to be seen she did not care for it . The train rolled out through the yards , gathering speed . A white-capped , white-aproned waiter passed through wit h a dinner-gong under his arm . The elderly lady across the aisle considered the respective merits of the half-dozen magazines her relatives had handed her to beguile the time . The heavy trucks pounded the rail-ends with increasing zeal . Newell stared moodily out the window . I 'm sorry , ' murmured Phyllis . I 'm sorry . ' The tall , tanned young man with the bronze hair and belted sport clothes had ineffectively snapped his lighter several times and Paige , who also had been among the earliest to emerge for the comfort of a cigarette , offered the appropriate courtesy . Thanks , ' said the accommodated , after a deep inhala- tion . Pretty fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' agreed Paige . It 'll do for a time-killer . ' By consent they fell into step , moving slowly through the chattering foyer 's increasing crowd , which they conspicu- ously overtopped , bringing up in a quiet corner well out cat the foggy whirlpool . You San Franciscans , ' Paige was remarking idly , have a great lot of fun panning the golden sunshiners farther down the coast , do n't you ? ' They really do , ' chuckled the other mirthlessly . Sure- fire stage joke . The childish interest these two big towns take in berating each other is quite beyond all sober calcu- lation . ' You do n't belong out here , I take it , ' said Paige un- necessarily . Nor anywhere . ' The grin accompanying the growl was unpleasant . Once upon a time '  --  a little more graciously  --  the south shore of Lake Erie was my habitat . ' Indeed ? Same with me . My name is Paige . ' Might as well tell the truth this time , he thought . Not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Mine 's Ingram  --  David Ingram . Glad to have run across you . ' They smiled briefly and shook hands . ' Been here long , Mr. Paige ? ' ' Since noon . Spent most of the time since arrival in a Turkish bath , boiling out the sand . Dirty trip . Very tedious . ' ' Do n't I know ? ' grumbled Ingram . ' Landed here from Shanghai , two weeks ago yesterday . Round-trip to New York since then . ' ' Back to China now , eh ? ' wondered Paige . ' No . ' Ingram was curt . Paige flicked the ashes from his cigarette and gave an involuntary shrug as if to say it was of no momentous conse- quence to him where sullen Mr. Ingram went . ' I did n't mean to be rude , ' said Ingram gruffly . ' I 'm sorry . ' Paige nodded his acceptance of the apology . When would people stop telling him they were sorry ... I 'm sorry ... There was n't a phrase in the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his cigarette-butt in a convenient ash-tray . The buzzer sounded a warning that the third act was ready , and they sauntered into the crowd drifting toward the entrances to the aisles . ' Doing anything in particular afterward ? ' asked Ingram . ' No , ' said Paige brusquely , ' nothing . ' ' Meet you  --  out here , maybe ? ' ' I do n't mind . ' They separated in the dimming light , Paige groping into his seat down in the third row center . The comedy carried on , noisily overplayed but amusing . The ingenue was fairly good , Newell thought , but thinned down cruelly for thirty- two . Women at that age had to be careful . Could n't stand continued starvation , especially these blondish types . Odd thing about that : brunettes could take more punishment ;  | seemed to be strung up better , neurally . Room for some intensive thinking on that subject : relation of pigmentation to nerve-structure . This Clarissa Montrose ought to he carrying at least fifteen pounds more . Knife-edged clavicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from the top . ' And you thought I was Jerry 's wife ! ' twittered Clarissa coyly . ' All the eggs she can hold and a quart of milk a day , and keep her quiet , ' Newell heard himself saying to the nurse , outside her door . ' Angel ! ' cooed the leading man , tipping up her lean chin with his fingers . ' Not yet , ' reflected Newell , ' but she 's going to be . ' He pulled down the sheet , applied the dangling end of his stethoscope to the upper tip of her right lung . ' Say " ninety- nine , " Clarissa ... Now , take a deep breath . That 's good . Hold it ! ' He moved the bell of the stethoscope across to the pitifully flabby left breast and listened to the regurgitationof a gallant but not indestructible heart . ' We wo n't tell Jerry yet , ' counseled the leading man . ' He might not approve . ' ' I know I would n't , ' meditated Newell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are full of copper , Mr.  --  Mr.  --  er ' Ile consulted the program . '  --  Mr. Romaine ....

And your highballs for the next six months are going to be made of sauerkraut juice with a little dash of spinach . ' ' My mistake ! ' Jerry was expostulating , as he blundered into the scene while Clarissa was being kissed . ' You 're making a bigger mistake than that , ' mused New- ell , eyeing him critically . ' You 'd do well to have a dental X-ray . I saw you wince when Clarissa clutched your armp231a while ago .

' Newell 's entertaining pastime of conducting these imaginary clinics was growing on him of late . Sometimes , as he sat in a hotel lobby or a railroad station , he diagnosedeverybody in sight , fervently wishing he might verify the more abstruse by laboratory tests . On the train coming out , two middle-aged cronies seated next him in the club car were engaged in desultory talk and the one with the squint remarked that he 'd lately been having hot shooting pains in his legs  --  like rheumatism , only worse '  --  and could n't read very long without seeing double .... Newell had put down his book and glanced at the speaker out of the tail of his eye . A moment afterward , he resumed his novel disinterestedly , reflecting that it would n't be long  --  a couple of years , perhaps  --  until the least informed layman could interpret the exact meaning of those two canes this fellow would be stamping hard against the pavement , to steady his shambling gait . Funny , ' the man was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm walking on wool . ' It 's not a bit funny , ' Newell mentally replied , ' locomotorataxia is n't . ' Yep , ' sighed the man , ' it 's difficult getting around , these ( lays . ' ' Oh , well , ' thought Newell , ' you 've been around . ' Sometimes he held extended debates with himself on the ethics of his former profession . This code had constituted the fundamental premises of his loyalty . Its demands were , to him , the most urgent of all the moral imperatives . Lack- ing a religion , this had served in its stead . Indifferent to political movements and an adherent of no party , this was his politics and this his patriotism . In his present plight , Newell had occasion to wonder whether some of these recommendations were sound . For instance , there was that old man with whom he had rubbed elbows in the Pullman dressing-room . With elaborate care the fine old fellow had gingerly shaved around the edges of a small sullen sore on his cheek-bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own business and volunteer no counsel . He wanted very much to say , My friend , if I had that little spot on my face , I would see a goodcancer specialist without delay . ' He could n't and didn't. say it . But something told him he had failed of a duty that made a higher bid for his action than the code of ethics which forbade it . Ingram was waiting for him after the show , and they strolled out into the balmy May-day evening headed to- ward the hotel where both were stopping . Prudently casual queries were exchanged and discreetly evasive replies were given , Ingram taking the initiative , for Paige still remem- bered the fellow 's gruffness in the theater lobby and did not propose to encore it . Two hours later , lounging with unbuttoned collars and open waistcoats in Ingram 's room , they had admitted to each other that they were adrift . Neither had come to the point of disgorging details , but after much careful cat- footing around the rim of their respective predicaments and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice and ginger ale from below , it became clear enough that however they may have arrived at their present state of uselessness , they were equally useless . Suddenly candid , Ingram launched upon his story . Most of it was hot and spluttery , for the rank injustice that themed it was fresh in his mind . He had been out in China for five years in the employ of a great American industry . Under no circumstances would he have endured all the dis- comforts incident to this small-paid job but for the promise  --  at least the reasonable expectation  --  of frequent ad- vancements in salary and responsibility . The girl had finally decided , two years ago , after a tedious and nerve-destroying correspondence , that she was n't quite up to spending her life in a foreign land . So  --  that wasp233that , and Ingram had got over it without much damage ; with a sense of relief , indeed , to have the matter settled . With increased interest in his job  --  for it was now up to him to demonstrate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingram became a glutton for work , permitting himself to be shockingly imposed upon by his superiors . Nothing mattered any more but to please the company . He merely grinned when Hortense wrote that she was marrying Bradford , his closest friend back home . It had always been in the back of his head that Bradford would be his best man . He wished them luck and hurried to catch a train to Tientsin on an errand another chap should have done . Entitled to a six months ' leave , he had sailed for the States , not hilariously , for there was nothing he cared to come back to , but mildly curious to note the changes in his country . He had gone directly to New York for the cus- tomary interview with the people at The Top , and had been informed of reorganization that would demote him both in pay and prestige , explained of course by the Depression , which Ingram profanely declared would now be offered as an excuse for fraud , ingratitude , extortion , and the evasion of contracted obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paced the floor , gesturing with his glass , just drunk enough to disclosehis real feelings , but not so drunk as to convert the story into maudlin melodrama . Newell 's eyes interestedly and sympathetically followed him up and down the room , vicariously relieving his own pent-up sentiments by listening to Ingram 's passionate speech . On occasion he , too , could be fairly competent in the use of strong terms , but he was obliged to concede to- night that this man 's versatility in all the accepted tech- niques of vituperation made him feel very humble indeed . Newell learned , during David 's peroration , that certain adjectives of damnation could be converted into adverbs , giving them a fresh piquancy . Deeply as he sympathized with his new friend , it was difficult at times for him to keep his face straight when the tempest was in full fury . He kept wondering whether Ingram 's complete purgation of all his bottled-up venom was going to require him to turn himself inside-out also . Even in the sweat and sacrilege of David 's address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adequate to account for his own plight . He had no notion of telling Ingram the exact truth . It soon appeared , however , that the red-faced chronicler was much too obsessed with his own misfortunes to insist on knowing the nature of Paige 's calamity . Look ! ' Ingram , winded and perspiring , had become suddenly inspired with a large idea . You and I need a long breath of absolutely fresh air . Away up in the moun- tains . Away up above the fog . We got ta get out of the sight and sound and smell of the whole damned farce . W'e 'll buy a coupla blankets and some beans and lease a burro - and lose ourselves for a month or two . Whaddayuh say ? ' Paige grinned and shook his head . ' I would n't be any good at that sort of thing . Never went camping in my life . ' Neither did I. We 'll take a guide . Get one for a song . ' Maybe we 'd better wait and talk it over when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' How do you mean  --  " both sober " ! ' challenged Ingram truculently . When I 'm sober , then , little one , if you 're so sensitive . ' Ingram slumped into a chair , scowled , grinned , mopped his face , and said he needed a bowl of hot onion soup . Paige reflected that a glass of iced buttermilk would be more to the purpose . After a quarrel about the respective merits of these restoratives , they started to go down to the grill . You 'd make a much better impression there if you wore your shirt , ' advised Paige . Here it is  --  and brush your hair . ' Yeah  --  that 's what comes from living soft ! ' rumbled Ingram . ' Got ta wear a shirt . Got ta brush your hair . I  |p235| want a breath o ' air . Mountains ! Beans ! Burro ! Open spaces ! ' All right ! A-1-1 r-i-g-h-t ! ' drawled Paige . We 'll do it . Sounds silly  --  and I 'll bet we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ' But  --  we 'll try it . ' They had considered themselves lucky to have found a guide at liberty . True , Pete was an ugly , sullen rascal , but  --  as Ingram said  --  they were n't taking him along as a  --  as Ingram said  --  they were n't taking him along as a social companion , and if he minded his own business and did n't try to be too chummy , so much the better . It was late afternoon when their train arrived at Bayley 's Gulch . Leaving their dunnage with the station-master , they had sauntered up the shabby street to the General Store which was also the Post Office . Restrained curiosity dully smouldered in the eyes of the loafers seated in all the postures of indolence and fatigue on the unpainted wooden postures of indolence and fatigue on the unpainted wooden steps . Something like a sneer accompanied the unanimous inspection of the strangers ' new boots as they came to a stand in front of the ramshackle building . Ingram inquired pleasantly whether it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains on a hiking trip . Two sourly shook their heads , three or four shifted their positions slightly and gazed at one another in silence ; then they all spat , in concert. silence ; then they all spat , in concert . Well ! ' said Ingram testily ; and the two of them tramped tip the steps and into the store . The postmaster was gruffly responsive , but did n't know of anyone who might want the responsive , but did n't know of anyone who might want the job . How long ? ' growled a swarthy hulk of a fellow , seated on a nail-keg in the far corner . Ingram and Paige moved in his direction and outlined their plans . Pete  --  he seemed not to have another name  --  drove a hard bargain , but they were in no position to haggle in such a tight market . It was agreed that they would start in such a tight market . It was agreed that they would start in the morning , shortly after sunrise . The postmaster gave them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin mattress in a bed that squeakingly protested.  | They were off at five-thirty , Pete and the burro leading . The day was fine and the adventurers were in excellent form . Sylvia , unused to walking on sharp stones , picked 1 her footing daintily , pausing now and then with elevated nose to sniff the new atmosphere with an amusing attitude of distaste for this unprecedented foolishness . Pete , ' remarked Paige , as they sat eating their lunch at eleven beside a noisy little mountain stream , we 're not trying to break any records , you know . This climbing business is not exactly in our line and we 'll be needing a day or two before we 're tough as you are . Better take it a little slower this afternoon . ' At six they called it a day and sprawled on the ground , admiring the sunset and condoling their lame feet . Pete stolidly prepared supper . It was delicious  --  thick-sliced greasy bacon , beans  --  Ingram was especially pleased with the beans  --  leather flapjacks , and heroically strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseled Ingram . We 've got all the time in the world . ' In spite of the admonition , breakfast was a-sizzle at five and they were scrambling up the difficult trail at six . Pete seemed in slightly lighter spirits when they halted at noon in a comparatively level spot where a waterfall had encouraged some hardy vegetation . He suggested that they might camp here for a day or two , his clients heartily approving . At one Pete sauntered off with a pick on his shoulder and did not return until dark . They watched him leave the trail a hundred yards up the slope and turn to the left , disappearing among the white crags . When it was supper- time , and he was still absent , they proceeded to do their own cooking , agreeing that it was more tasty than Pete 's , and not caring whether the contemptuous fellow ever came back . One thing about the Chinks , ' continued David , reload- ing his pipe as they lounged on their elbows before the smouldering fire , they 're fundamentally honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their jobs . The Chink 's employment is never thought of as a vocation . It is an inheritance . If his honorable parent is a cobbler , he has no itch to be something better or other than a cob- bler . His great-great-grandfather was a cobbler and his great-great-grandson will be a cobbler . If he was born on the land , he stays on the land  --  same land that was tilled by a whole graveyardful of ancestors . ' Which , I presume , ' reflected Newell , accounts for their lack of enterprise . ' Judged by our Yankee conception of progress  --  yes . ' David tugged energetically on his pipe for a while , and continued : A fellow was telling me in New York , the other day , that when you have your oil changed at a garage you would better stand right there and watch carefully to see that the chap screws the nut back on tightly , or he 's likely to neglect it , and he would n't care if all your oil leaked out at the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burned bearing . ' I do n't believe that happens very often , ' Newell ob- jected patriotically . Well  --  this fellow thought it did ; said he thought the majority of the young fry in this country considered them- selves too good for their jobs , ingenious only in devising methods to avoid work , hating the idea of serving anybody , and with no interest whatsoever in sound workmanship for its own sake . No more guild-pride .... You do n't think that 's so ? ' In the main  --  no . But perhaps I 'm not the person to consult . As I remember the conduct of the people who worked with me , I think most of them were very attentive to their business . It might have been a bit different in their case , however . It was rather dangerous to be reckless in that institution . ' Powder factory ? ' Newell delayed his reply , making quite a task of poking the embers into a blaze .

I think I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten o'clock when they rolled into their blankets , Ingram indignantly muttering that they 'd both had a rotten deal , Paige replying that perhaps they 'd better try to forget about it and make use of their excur- sion , in view of what it had done to their feet . Pete was gone , the next morning , before they were up . ' I 've a notion , ' observed Newell , ' that instead of hiring a guide , we 've grubstaked a prospector . ' ' It 's no matter , ' chuckled David . ' I 'm just as glad he is n't hanging about all the time . So long as he does n't abscond with the food and leave us marooned up here , I 'm willing he should keep out of sight . ' After breakfast they decided on a tramp to the right of the trail . It was rough going and an hour of it was plenty . They sat to rest near a wash that had once been a water- fall . ' Pretty bit of rock , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone about with the toe of his boot . ' The green is copper , no doubt . What are those bright brassy flecks ? ' ' Yeah  --  you 'll be finding gold , ' yawned David , stretch- ing flat on his back , hands behind his head . ' Boy !  --  if there was any of that stuff lying around loose on the ground , this close to civilization , there 'd be a mob up here fighting for it . ' ' I 'm not sure about that . We 're three quarters of a mile off the trail . This particular spot may never have been visited before . ' Newell was idly hammering his discovery with a hefty round stone . ' And it 's never going to be visited again , far as I 'm concerned , ' muttered David sleepily . ' I say , old man , ' exclaimed Newell , ' have a look at this stuff ! ' It was dusk again when Pete returned to find his em- ployers making the fire . Paige told him he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he acted upon reluctantly . It was evident that Pete was in an ugly mood . He had had a bad day , no doubt . ' Might as well push on tomorrow , ' he advised gruffly . ' No hurry , ' replied Ingram . ' We like it here ... Eh , Sylvia , old lady ? ' ' There 's nothin ' to see , ' growled Pete . ' Better view  --  higher up . ' ' We 'll see it when we get there , ' said Paige shortly . ' We 're staying here for a couple of days . If you want to ramble about , that 's your privilege . ' Pete sulkily lumbered off after supper , tethered the burro some fifty yards farther away , and seated himself at some distance from the fire . ' He has thoughts of moving on early in the morning with- out us , ' suspected Ingram . ' I think I 'll drag the pack over here where he is n't so likely to be tempted . ' If Pete had been meditating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning . He was sur- prisingly attentive at breakfast and made no move to leave camp . Ingram grinned and winked . ' I wonder if the chap has n't smelled a mouse , ' he sug- gested . ' We can easily find out , ' thought Newell , outlining a plan . Lighting their pipes , they strolled off toward the left of the trail , elaborately unconcerned about their course , leaving Pete polishing the pans with amazing diligence . After nearly a half-mile of wearisome clambering over t umbled rocks , they agreed they 'd had enough and sat down in the lee of a big one to smoke their pipes . Ingram took off his cap , twenty minutes later , and cautiously drew himself up to peer over the top of the ledge . ' Yep  --  he 's a faithful guide , ' reported Ingram . ' Corn- ing right along . ' ' That kind of devotion should be rewarded . Let 's go back and present him with one of our pebbles . If he wants to think we found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete was back in camp when they returned . Paige dug in his pocket and handed him a little stone with the remark that it looked as if there was a bit of gold in it . " Bout five cents a ton , ' scoffed Pete disgustedly . ' That all ? ' Paige threw it away , appearing indifferent to the assay , an episode that seemed to amuse Ingram . As they had expected , Pete strolled off early in the afternoonon an unnecessarily circuitous route toward the place where he had seen them in the morning . When he was safely out of sight , they retraced their steps to the wash where they had found the gold . ' God  --  Newell  --  do n't let that dangle ! ' groaned In- gram . ' It 's broken in a dozen places  --  grinding  --  ends scratching . ' ' I know , ' panted Paige , ' but there is n't anything I can do about it  --  not out here . I 'll be as easy as possible . ' The one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head swim . Sylvia was ex- citedly scampering in aimless circles , with high-keyed littlewhimpers of sympathy as if she regretted her inability to help . Pete had set off early that morning with his pick on hisshoulder , David watching him go . He shook Newell awake . ' Look ! ' he said , laughing . ' Hot on the gold-trail ! ' Newell yawned , stretched mightily , and raised up on anelbow , his thick mop of hair tousled . ' That leaves us free for a good day 's work , ' he said . ' Our Pete is n't as crafty as we thought . ' Arrived at the precipitous grade where long ago the wash had been left on the mountain-side by a stream whose course had been deflected , perhaps by an avalanche , they began to climb , admitting to each other that it was very risky business for inexperienced people . A dwarf pine had snapped with Ingram , dropping him twenty feet  --  rigid and topside up  --  on a slanting rock . He had crumpled , clutching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding , clawing for hand-holds . A hasty examination of the injury showed a serious frac- ture . The torturing trip back to camp was begun . Stiff upper lip , old fellow ! ' encouraged Newell . Not very  --  far  --  now . ' He heartily wished he was telling the truth . At times he feared he was about all in . After a few eternities , with his head pounding and his lungs on fire from the grueling strain , he gently eased his burden down , and set about the task of attending to Ingram 's hurt . Now this is going to be nothing but a makeshift , my lad , ' he warned , as he began tearing up their shirts into bandages and drawing nails from the wooden box contain- ing their tinned meats . We 'll have to wait until we 're down before this can be properly set . I shall do the very best I can for you . ' By the way ' Ingram gritted his teeth  --  how are we going to get down ? Think this rapscallion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched his fists and watched Paige 's experienced hands fashioning the splint . No , ' muttered Paige . We are all going down to- gether . ' Look  --  he 's coming now ! He followed us , after all . ' Paige hotly confronted Pete with the charge that he had trailed along behind them , too lazy and indifferent to offer help . Pete grinned sourly and declared it was none of his help . Pete grinned sourly and declared it was none of his business if they broke their legs trying to hide a find from him. him . Ingram ventured to express his feelings on this subject , but Paige silenced him with a shake of the head . They could n't afford to make war on Pete  --  not in this predica- ment . Break camp at once , Pete , ' commanded Paige . Pack the stuff . We will start down immediately . ' Not today , ' growled Pete . I 'm staying here over tomorrow . Mean to have another look around  --  over there where he broke his leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit of his forbearance had been reached . His right fist crashed into the fellow 's jaw . Pete measured his length and lay very still.  | FOR the first time in his adult life , Newell Paige had slept all the way around the clock . He , awoke drenched with perspiration , his eyes blinded by the dazzling sunshine . Dully exploring his stiff lips with the tip of a sluggish tongue he encountered the longest bristles he had ever acquired . The severely simple appointments of the room helped him to orient himself . He closed his throbbing eyes for a long moment and shuddered at the recollection . Every sore and swollen muscle of his body protested as he raised up on an elbow to reach for his watch on the white enamel table beside the high narrow bed . It was ten-thirty . He grimacingly eased himself back on the damp pillow and ventured a sigh which was so strongly objected to that he gave it up . There was a gentle thumping on the floor beneath the bed . Newell grinned , lowered an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt Sylvia 's wet tongue on his hand . Then her red head appeared and her forepaws were laid on the mattress close beside his pillow . What have you got there ? ' inquired Newell . Sylvia opened her jaws and put down on his chest a ragged piece of dusty , hard-textured cloth about the size of a man 's two outspread hands . Newell held up the doubt- ful gift and inspected it closely . Then he chuckled , and Sylvia laid her muzzle against his arm . The door , which had been left ajar , was now cautiously pushed open . The nurse , with basin and towels , smilingly approached the bed , Sylvia dropping down on all fours to make way for her.  | So  --  you 're awake . How do you feel ? ' She began washing his face . If we did n't have the most awful time with this dog , last night ! We tried to keep her out of your room , but she made so much racket that Dr. Stafford said room , but she made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in before she roused the whole hospital . ' I ca n't remember much about it , ' said Paige listlessly . ' I ca n't remember much about it , ' said Paige listlessly . She just now handed me this . It looks suspiciously like a fragment of somebody 's corduroy trousers . ' Yes  --  it 's the seat . I know about it . We found you and your friend Mr. Ingram lying out in the driveway , the dog barking furiously . You were so thoroughly exhausted that you passed out completely . A big rough-looking fellow was leading a burro away . And while we were carrying you both in , your dog turned and went after the man and And paid her parting regards , ' finished Paige . Did she hurt him ? ' Probably not seriously . He got away under his own power . ' A big bushy-haired man in white duck appeared in the doorway . This is Dr. Stafford , ' said the nurse . I suppose you do n't recall much about being put to bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiably , with his arms folded , and his rubber-soled feet . wide apart . His expression hinted that he had a joke on his patient . Paige nodded in response to the sly smile and wondered what sort of banter was to follow . Well  --  what can we get you first ? ' asked Dr. Stafford companionably . Poached eggs on toast and a cup of coffee ? ' ' I think I 'd like a deep breath , ' replied Paige , with a wince . The doctor stepped forward , unbuttoned the coarse white jacket and gently prodded him in the ribs with inquisitive finger-tips . Hurt ? ' he asked . It 's deeper in , Doctor . '  | ' Where does it seem to catch you  --  internal intercos- tals ? ' The doctor gave the nurse a slow wink that tipped up the corner of his friendly mouth . They were sharing a little mystery . Paige thought he knew what it was and decided to be dumb . Perhaps he could bluff it out . ' You 'll have to talk English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a child . ' Now do n't you try to kid me , my son . ' Dr. Stafford pointed a challenging finger close to Paige 's innocent eyes . ' When I took off that splintage I found it to be the work of an experienced surgeon . And you put it on because your friend Ingram said so . He denied that you were a doctor , but I know better . I have just seen the plate and the adjustment is perfect . The fracture was slightly com- minuted , too , if you know what that means  --  and I damn ' well know you do .... Now ! Just where does it grip you when you inhale . You may tell me " in English " if you do n't mean to come clean about yourself .... Where ? Ribs or belly ? ' ' Cordiform tendon , ' growled Paige . ' Attaboy ! ' Stafford nodded a triumphant I-told-you-so at the nurse . ' Now , how do you want your eggs , Dr. Paige ? ' ' Promptly ... How 's Ingram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . That must have been a frightful trip . You got your lame diaphragm by heavy lifting . Mr. Ingram says you not only had him to look after , but had to keep a vigilant eye on your rascally guide . Never mind  --  we 're going to make it hot for that fellow . I do n't see how you managed . ' ' My dog helped . She stayed very close to him with her nose wrinkled and all her teeth on display . ' ' I see she got her name in the paper this morning , ' said the doctor . ' Miss Adams , go and see if you can find a copy of The Chronicle ... We had a little accident in the mine , late yesterday afternoon , ' he explained . ' Somep246timbers slipped and produced a couple of cracked heads and a flock of bad contusions . Young fellow here  --  Johnny Malloy  --  wires mine news to San Francisco . He dropped in to inquire about our patients just as your party was ar- riving . We had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall with this piece of pants in her mouth ; youwere dead to the world ; your friend would n't talk ... Natu- rally , Johnny was curious . ' Printed our names , too , I suppose , ' muttered Paige , rather testily and revealing a good deal of anxiety . No  --  we did not give him your names . Your friend objected . However , Johnny heard him call to the dog . That 's how he got her name . And I think somebody told him that the broken leg had been uncommonly well looked after , which led him to hint  --  as you will notice  --  that the whole affair seemed a bit mysterious . ' Paige took up the paper which the nurse had laid on the bed before scurrying away with the announcement that she would be back presently with his breakfast . The brief dispatch had dealt jocularly with Sylvia 's revenge on a disobliging guide who had refused to be of assistance to an injured friend of hers . The accident had occurred in the mountains and a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his extraordinarily competent friend , who knew more about first-aid than most , had seemed to prefer that their names be kept out of the news . When he had finished reading , Paige glanced up to find Stafford 's eyes fixed on him interestedly . He seemed to have something perplexing on his mind . I feel forced to say '  --  he lowered his voice  --  that you two strangers , and this long-nosed Johnny Malloy , have placed me in an awkward position . This hospital is main- tained by the Gray Lode Mining Corporation for the exclusive use of its employees . Emergency cases from the immediate neighborhood are accepted , but the company is very particular about full reports on outsiders . I 'm especially sensitive because I really do n't belong on this  |p247| job . I am pinch-hitting for my friend Newcomb , who ii the chief here , while he is East on a three months ' leave . The company will see this squib and ask questions . As for you , a day 's rest should put you right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . Ingram ca n't be moved to report on you just the same . Ingram ca n't be moved for some time . He will have to make arrangements We will want to know more about both of you than you have been disposed to tell . ' I understand your position , Doctor , ' conceded Paige . Ingram 's all right . ' Well , I hope so . ' Stafford 's tone was curt . ' We do n't want to get ourselves in a scrape ... Sure he is n't wanted somewhere for something ? ' Paige pulled a wry grin and shook his head . No , ' he said dryly . That 's his trouble . He is n't wanted anywhere  --  by anybody . Lost his job . But  --  he can tell you about himself . Probably will , if you explain your reasons for wanting to know . ' That 's good . How about you ? ' Stafford 's voice was more conciliatory . It 's a bit different  --  with me . I can assure you that no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble will come to the hospital or you because of my being here . But my little problem is n't the sort of thing that I care to talk about . In short  --  I do n't want anybody to know where I am , and I 'd like to keep my name out of circulation . ' His breakfast had arrived now , and Dr. Stafford , not wishing to pursue their talk before the nurse , picked up the paper and strolled out of the room , promising to return paper and strolled out of the room , promising to return later in the afternoon . He wished this affair had n't turned up . It had been the first annoying situation since he had taken over for New- comb . The brief assignment had been very pleasant , after his long and dangerous twenty months in the Govern- ment 's research laboratory in a Montana forest studying the virus of the deadly Rocky Mountain spotted fever . He would be expected to return to that pestilential little workp248shop three weeks from today to resume a monotonous , repulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly unpleasant and risky . Three young bacteriologists had died up there . It would be unfortunate if , during his brief tenure at Gray Lode Hospital , the institution became implicated in some kind of mess . Could n't take the chance of harboring a couple of criminals . These chaps might be all right  --  but he had only their own word for it . Back in his little office Stafford looked again at the copyhe had made of the only scrap of writing they had found in Paige 's pockets . Having noted Ingram 's reluctance to confide , and disturbed by the obvious lie he had told when asked if Paige was a physician , he had felt obliged to go through their clothes . It went against the grain to do it . Both were abundantly supplied with money , but that was no recommendation ; it might even be considered a reason for suspicion . The only thing he had found on Paige was an address written on the stationery of the Hotel St. Lawrence  --  Harcourt , 9721 Marlborough . ' This Harcourt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If young Paige was trying to lose himself out here  --  which certainly did n't look very well for a highly trained surgeon , prowling about in the hills , unwilling to give himself a clean bill when queried by a colleague  --   --  perhaps this Harcourt , man or woman , might supply a few of the missing links .... For a while he meditated a letter of inquiry . Then an idea occurred to him . He pursed his lips and nodded . This , he thought , should fetch a query from Harcourt . Opening his pocket-knife , he cut the provocative dispatch from The Chronicle , slipped it into an envelope bearing the hospital insignia , wrote his name below the device , addressed it  --  as bluntly laconic as the memorandum he had found in Paige 's pocket  --  and affixed airmail postage . The company messenger lounged in with a capacious leather bag slung from his shoulder and Stafford handed him the outgoing mail . It was a hot day , they agreed ... Miss Adams stood in the doorway . Dr. Paige would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stafford nodded and proceeded down the hall to Number 63 . Paige was sitting up in bed . He had shaved and his lean jaw was flexed determinedly . It was evident that he was in a serious mood . Thank you for coming , Dr. Stafford . I want to apolo- gize for putting you in an embarrassing position . I am ready to tell you about myself . It would please me if you were to regard it as a confidence  --  at least as much of it as may not be absolutely necessary to your report . ' Stafford pushed the door shut , straddled a chair , and folded his arms on the back of it . Very well , ' he said quietly . Tell it straight  --  because I am disposed to believe you . ' Ingram bore his misfortune with easy fortitude , chuckling dryly when sympathy was offered . He was really having the time of his life . What with a half-dozen impressionable nurses competing in their efforts to entertain the urbane stranger , and Dr. Stafford 's leisurely calls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im- proved until it was evident that the accident which had detained him was worth all the bother and discomfort it had cost . Nor had Paige fretted over his unanticipated sojourn at the Gray Lode Mine . Stafford had secured comfortable accommodations for him in the company 's clubhouse , where several of the bachelors among the younger execu- tives were quartered and where their married seniors drifted in after dinner for cards and pipe-chat. in after dinner for cards and pipe-chat . He had been very cordially received . Nobody seemed actively curious about him , his presence being amply ex- plained by the fact that his friend was laid up . Only one trifling incident , which occurred during the first week , caused him an anxious moment . Twice he had been invited to sit in at the nightly poker game pursued by a few of the junior members in the far corner of the big smoking- lounge . He had declined graciously , and when pressed had replied that it would n't be quite fair to pit beginner 's luck ' against experienced skill . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , and had just left  --  Newell was starting up the open stairs to go to his room when Billy Masters , a callow young chemical engineer , called to him from the card table . Masters had been steadily winning all evening and was in an expansive mood . The stakes had not been large , but he seemed pleased with the little handful of crumpled ones and twos and fives which represented his success . Better join us , Mr. Paige , ' he called , his tone just a bit derisive , and contribute something to this worthy cause . ' Not wishing to appear standoffish , Newell turned , came down , and approached the table , inquiring icily how they had all fared . The losers grinned sourly and Masters pointed to his winnings . Want a stack of chips ? ' he inquired . The blue ones are a quarter , the red ones are only a dime , and the white ones can be had for a nickel . A few white ones  --  maybe ? ' The smile that Paige had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown . He rolled his magazine tightly in hands that seemed to need some distracting employment and replied , Thank you . I 'm turning in . ' Spoken like a Scotchman , ' drawled Masters , without looking up . The other four glanced inquisitively at Paige , observing his flush of annoyance and wondering how much of this sort of thing he would be likely to take without active resentment . I regret to have conveyed the idea that I am too stingy to risk some small change , ' he said frostily . I do n't care toplay  --  but I would n't mind cutting the deck with you , Mr. Masters . ' That 's the proper spirit ! ' Masters handed the cards top251Madison , with a gesture inviting him to shuffle the pack . ' How much  --  ten dollars ? Best two out of three ? ' ' As you like . ' Paige 's nonchalant rejoinder hinted that it was a very small matter , the outcome of which gave him no concern . ' Let 's say twenty , ' suggested Masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a hundred  --  and one cut instead of two out of three . ' Paige drew out his wallet and laid his bet on the table , the money in one piece . ' Agreed ! ' snapped Masters , counting his wager in bills of various denominations . It was observed that he held his pocket-book rather close to his face as he extracted the bulk of the money , obviously unwilling to reveal the strength  --  of the money , obviously unwilling to reveal the strength  --  or , more likely , the weakness  --  of his resources . Madison shoved the deck toward the newcomer , the others leaning forward in their chairs attentively . Paige unconcernedly made a cut and produced the Jack of diamonds . Masters more deliberately drew the eight-spot of spades and gave his money an impatient flick of his fingers . ' Want to cut again  --  maybe ? ' asked Paige , making no move to pick up his winnings . Masters growled his agreement and pushed the deck back to Madison for another shuffle . ' Two hundred ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then , grimly , added , ' Provided you 'll take my I 0 U for half of it if I lose . I 'm not in the habit of carrying everything I own on my person . ' not in the habit of carrying everything I own on my person . ' ' It 's good with me , ' consented Paige indifferently . ' Your rst cut this time . ' Masters 's hand trembled a little as he slowly exhibited he ten of clubs and swallowed noisily . Paige topped it with he Queen of spades . ' Another ? ' he asked , with exasperating disinterest . ' No  --  that will do for me , thanks , ' muttered Masters , ribbling a memorandum on the back of his card , the thers quietly winking at one another with sly grins.  | Paige pocketed the money with no show of pleasure , said good night with quiet cordiality , and started upstairs again . He left his door open , knowing that Masters would pass it presently on the way to his own room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in here a minute , wo n't you ? ' Masters paused at the summons and strolled in , hands deep in his pockets , an unpleasant grin twisting his mouth . Sit down , wo n't you ? ' invited Paige pleasantly . I hope you 're not going to be offended , but I do n't want your money . There it is . ' He laid it on the table beside Masters 's I elbow . Well  --  excuse me ! ' snarled Masters , rising . I 'm no piker , I want you to understand ! ' You sit down there , young fellow ! ' commanded Paige , crossing the room to close the door . And keep your shirt on ! ' The sudden outburst , so unexpected , dazed Masters a little and he resumed his seat , scowling darkly . You say you 're no piker , ' continued Paige , towering over him ominously . You tried to insult me before your friends clown there tonight , feeling pretty sure that as a guest of this club I would ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get away with it .

A whole minute passed in silence , Paige dreamily puffing at his pipe , his far-away eyes  --  mere narrow slits  --  search- ing in the milling crowd for a final glimpse of a jaunty little  |p253| red feather on a snug little black hat aslant on bright-gold curls ...

Masters scowled and grinned . I would have kept it , ' he muttered , if I had won it from you. , Perhaps , ' said Paige , after a pause . Perhaps not .

' There was an extended silence , Masters blinking rapidly as he meditated an appropriate reply . Paige studied his face and gave way to a smile . A short time ago , ' he said cordially , a very keen old chap was telling me about his experience in learning to drive a car . Fellow in front of him would come to a sudden stop a car .

' ' I do n't see how it 's any of your business , ' grumbled Masters . There you are , ' said Paige quietly . Just as I thought . It is n't any of my business , but what I 've been saying is true . Somebody has been getting your goat , and because you felt bereft without it , you thought you 'd get mine . And I 'm bound to say you did . ' Masters ventured a chuckle . Yeah  --  I 've had a rough day , all right . Old Man Huntington . Tired of licking his boots . He 's my boss in thelab . Mean as hell ! ' Had it ever occurred to you that the old man may have been having his tail twisted by some of the Higher Ups ? ' I hope they tie a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an infected tooth - - or a kidney stone . ' Masters noisily exhaled a cynical sigh through a cloud of cigarette smoke . I suppose it 's easy enough for you to dope up some psy- chology that explains it all very nicely . If somebody had handed you a dirty deal , maybe you would n't be quite so damned calm . You 're probably sitting on top of the world . You act like it , anyway . ' After Masters had sauntered out  --  he had refused the money , but was plainly weakening in his resolution not to accept it and would undoubtedly comply by tomorrow  --  Newell lighted his pipe and gave himself to some rather cheerful reflections . This young cub had felt sure that nobody could be so damned calm if he had experienced a serious injustice . Sitting on top of the world ! That was the impression he had made on Masters . Perhaps Dean Harcourt 's phi- losophy was n't so fantastically impractical after all . It could n't be dismissed with an indulgent grin and a smoth- ered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explainp255it to Masters , it sounded every way plausible . At all events , he had impressed Masters as a person who had himself well he had impressed Masters as a person who had himself well in hand , with nothing to worry about and possessed of a sense of  --  of what ? The haunting phrase , so frequently recurring on Mrs. Dexter 's pretty lips , came back to him with a fresh vitality . ' Personal adequacy . " Phat 's what young Masters had seen at work in him . Come here , Sylvia . ' With a prodigious yawn , she rose , came to his chair , squatted facing him , and looked up inquiringly . ' I observe , ' confided Newell , ' that you took no em- barrassing interest in the savage remarks I exchanged with Mr. Masters . I presume your serenity may be accounted for on the ground that you knew I could have pitched him through the window without your assistance . You showed excellent taste , I think , in remaining quietly seated on your haunches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not giving way to your private sentiments . I thank you . As I have often remarked in your presence , it 's a pity you ca n't talk . I am sure there is something you would like to say . ' Sylvia yawned again , self-consciously , and , assuming that the brief conference was adjourned , went to her favor- ite corner and sprawled on her cherished steamer rug . ' I 've something else to say to you . ' She returned deliberately and putting her forepaws on his knees thrust her muzzle so close to Newell 's face that he leaned back a little to dodge the caress which Sylvia occa- leaned back a little to dodge the caress which Sylvia occa- sionally bestowed if he was not vigilantly on guard . He gently tapped her on the nose with an impressive finger-tip . ' Sylvia , ' he declared solemnly , ' perhaps you had n't noticed it , but we 're sitting on top of the world . ' As an interested and competent student of the genus homo , not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological states , Newell Paige was well aware that a superficial view of a casual acquaintance is likely to be misleading.  | On meeting a stranger , he often found himself speculating I on the probable depth , contents , configuration , and natural history of the subterranean mountain whose exposed sum- mit , painstakingly landscaped , had possessed its com- paratively little self of an identity , a name , a tongue , a fleet , and a flag . Sometimes , on further acquaintance , he had made dismaying discoveries just below the sea-line , and again , of course , he had been happily surprised . He presumed there were two Staffords , but he was totally unprepared for his first glimpse of the sub-Stafford . So much of the Dr. Sidney Stafford as had been candidly on display was rather noisily amiable , fussily energetic , and artificially gay with a good-humor that seemed to be oper- ated under forced draught . Newell could n't help liking him , though he found the man 's nervous tension somewhat wearing after an hour with him . More often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , after a breezy round of the loungers , whom he hilariously teased and spoofed without regard for age , rank , or brevity of acquaintance , he would suggest to Paige that they go up to his room for a quiet chat . One smiled at the recollection of these quiet chats . Stafford was never still for an instant , forever lighting his pipe which seemed always to be out , shifting from one chair to another , pacing the floor , tousling Sylvia , fiddling with the magazines on the table . On a couple of occasions , Newell had tried to sound him out concerning his work in the research laboratory in Mon- tana , but his replies were laconic and the conversation was swiftly led into other quarters . When Newell persisted , Stafford waved the subject aside with a dismissing gesture of his pipe . The Government was trying to find out what was the source of spotted fever , that was all . They had been at it long enough to know that the virus was carried by some sort of insect  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to find what manner of poison the bug carried , and where he got it , and under what circumstances he madep257use of it . Then  --  if they ever discovered these facts  --  doubtless they could contrive an antitoxin . Damned tiresome job , ' said Stafford , and waved his pipe to indicate he was ready now to talk about something more interesting , such as travel tales and stories of adven- ture on the sea and in the jungle . He had seemed almost obsessed by blood-freezing yarns of foolhardy fellows risking their lives in big-game hunts , and he had an inexhaustible repertoire of frightfulness that made one 's flesh fairly crawl . No matter what you talked about , sooner or later you knew you were going to be plopped down into tall jungle-grass for a debate with a nest of cobras , or pitched out of the boat into a flock of crocodiles . Sometimes it seemed as if Stafford studied your face to see how you liked the idea . He 'd let a shark bite your leg off at the knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his hands were never in repose  --  to stare at you for your reactions . Tarantulas in your bed , exotic nettles that pricked your hand and ' grinned at you while you swelled up and died . Odd mentality  --  Sidney Staf- ford 's . Funny thing  --  he never seemed to get going on his pet horrors in any other company but Newell 's . I should think there would be plenty of danger in your tick business , ' Newell had remarked . Oh  --  now and then , ' Stafford had replied , offhandedly , rummaging through his pockets for the match-box that was always eluding him , now and then ... Mostly dull and nasty tinkering with bug-juice ... Ever take any special interest in bacteriology ? ' Very ' much . If I had n't gone in for surgery , I might have moved in that direction , I think . ' Ever find time since school days , ' asked Stafford , to squint into a microscope ? ' Yes  --  quite often . It was a little hobby . I own a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stafford . I 'll say it was a little hobby ! '  | On the sultry morning that Newell made his startling discovery of the sub-Stafford that was not on public view , he had dropped in at the hospital to take Ingram the papers . On the way out , as he passed the chief 's office , he met tAdams girl who had looked after him when he had arrived with Ingram . She seemed upset about something as she closed Stafford 's door behind her and stood holding the knob and looking frightened . ' Go in there , ' she said huskily , ' and talk to him . ' Stafford was slumped down in his swivel-chair with his elbows on the desk and his face in his hands . He looked up , heavy-eyed . ' Hope I 'm not intruding , ' said Paige . ' Anything I can do ? ' ' No . ' Stafford 's voice was thick . ' Look at that wire . Spaulding 's dead ; my chief , up there , you know . Died of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted hint down . Sick eight hours . And practically alone , except for old Murray , our orderly .

Just been talking to San Fran- cisco . I 'm to be relieved here in the morning . So I can go back . I 'll be in charge now . Alone , too , until I can find somebody that 's as big a damn ' fool as I am . ' ' Do you think I am ? ' asked Paige quietly . Stafford slowly drew himself up , leaned heavily against the desk , and looked him squarely in the eyes from under level brows . ' Do n't say that , Paige , unless you mean it ! ' he growled . ' I mean it , Stafford . I 'm going with you . ' ' Do you realize that it may cost you your life ? ' Paige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be ready to go at noon tomorrow ? ' ' Quite ! ' Paige 's eyes were shining . Stafford studied him with frank interest . ' I hope , ' he drawled meaningly , ' that you 're not think- ing of this as some sort of pleasure excursion . '  | ' No , ' said Paige seriously , I understand  --  but I do n't mind telling you that I was never so happy in my life . I 'll be dying , sometime , anyway  --  and I 'd rather burn than rot . '  | DR . STAFFORD 'S lengthy letter was , he felt , the most inter- esting communication he had ever received . And this was saying much , for no small part of Dean Harcourt 's daily labor was the handling of correspondence voluminous in bulk and confidential in character . His incoming mail was of infinite variety . Most of it came from troubled people who had heard him speak in the Cathedral  --  as if to them individually  --  and , lacking either the audacity or opportunity to confer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective tempers , dipped their pens in their hearts ' blood or their livers ' bile to write of every conceivable perplexity in moods ranging all the way from saintly resignation to sour despair , frequently shrilling up to shrieking crescendos of spank-worthy hy- steria ; pardonable , of course , for the times were bad and you could n't blame the poor things , said the Dean , for blowing the whistle , which was ever so much better than blowing the boiler . Some , to be sure , were mere cranks with windy verbosi- ties to exploit . Chip-epauletted , they challenged him to substantiate the public statement that had pricked their pet balloon , waxing vehement in defense of fine-spun dog- mas and hair-splitting categories . He did not permit such documents to annoy him . When he had read into one of them far enough to see which way it was headed , he would sigh , smile , and pass the letter across the desk to Talbot , who usually helped him with his mail , and Talbot , inter-  |p261| preting the gesture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of controversial communications relating to dog- housing of controversial communications relating to dog- mas and categories  --  the label on which he had absurdly abbreviated to Dogs , and Cats . ' But Dean Harcourt would have considered himself seri- ously impoverished without this mounting flood of agony mail . Most people , he believed , were more likely to state their cases honestly and clearly in letters than under the stress of oral confessions in an unfamiliar atmosphere . And it was to these letters , the Dean freely conceded , that he owed much of his intimate knowledge of the various anx- ieties which bedevil the mind of the average citizen . Talbot had just left the room with the usual armful of mail bearing penciled notations for his guidance in replying to fully three fourths of it . Such letters as the Dean pro- posed to answer himself lay open on his desk . Stafford 's he read again more slowly . He had almost given up hope of hearing from Stafford . Two months had gone by since his mystified receipt of the newspaper clipping and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that occasion , would have decided that Dean Harcourt had encountered a difficult problem . He had read the clipping through several times with alternating smiles and frowns . Then he had slowly relaxed in his tall chair , tipped back his head , and with half-closed eyes had sat for a long time meditatively tapping his tightly pursed lips with his gold pince-nez . As for the clipping itself , deduction was simple enough . Paige had evidently fallen in with another gentleman - vagabond who had met with an accident forcing them into the nearest hospital . They had refused to give their names , which seemed unnecessarily imprudent in Paige 's case , whatever good  --  or bad  --  reasons the other man may have had . No  --  the real mystery of this affair concerned this Dr. Sidney Stafford 's strange action in mailing him the clipping unaccompanied by a note of explanation  --  sent by air , too ,  |  | as if he had thought its prompt delivery important .

If it was n't for the Gibsons , our life would be pretty bleak .

Frank Gibson told me a couple of days ago , when I was in his office , that about a dozen families of the more prosperous sort who have girls approaching college age are thinking seriously of or- ganizing a private school for them and want to find some well-educated , socially experienced young woman , recently graduated from a high-grade university  --  preferably East- ern , Gibson thinks , for the sake of importing a little of that atmosphere  --  who will come out here and supplement what these girls are getting in the local High School , which seems to be a very frail institution . Gibson asked me if I knew of anyone who might be likely to fill the bill , and of course I did n't , for I have lost all contact with such matters .

' Dean Harcourt put down the letter and sat for some time absently toying with his paper-knife . A happy twinkle began playing about the innumerable pain-chiseled crows ' - feet at the outer corners of his deep-set eyes ... Phyllis !  --  why not ? Sonia rattled her keys and opened the mail-box . One for you , dear , ' she called , sorting the letters . That would be Pat , I suppose . ' Phyllis , who had pre- ceded her up the short flight of steps in the apartment-house lobby , waited at the open door , leaning wearily against its stiff tension . They had been invoicing stock all day . And it was hot as Tophet . She reached for the letter . Wembelton !

Is n't it simply wonderful ? ' she kept saying . I ca n't believe it ! Are n't you glad , Sonia ? ' Sonia was glad . No end sorry , of course , but more re- lieved than she cared to say . It was going to be very hard to give up Phyllis . The radiant girl had been a Godsend , coming into her life at a moment when she was desperate for some new interest to divert her mind from the drab little tragedy that had made everything seem so futile . But business in the shop was bad , with no prospect of early improvement . Small enterprises like Sonia 's were collapsing daily . She had not confided to Phyllis the extent of her anxiety , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been reassuring . Nonsense ! ' she would say whenever Phyllis voiced her misgivings . I could n't possibly get along without you . Do n't give it another thought . ' ... The Wembelton offer had come along at the right time . It would be possible now to retrench considerably . She would give up the apartment , pare her expenses to the elementary necessities , and try to weather the gale . Glad ? ' murmured Sonia . Why , of course , dear . But I shall miss you frightfully . You know that . ' She jangled her keys again and unlocked their door . I do n't see how I can live here after you 're gone . ' Mr. Gibson offers to advance me money for travel , ' called Phyllis , from the little hall where she had tarried by the pillar light to read her letter more carefully . Do n't take it , ' counseled Sonia , from the bedroom . Never let a man accommodate you in money matters . If you have n't enough on hand to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I can let you have it . ' You 're so suspicious , ' reproved Phyllis , amused.  | I 'm so experienced , ' defended Sonia in a muffled tone that sounded as if she was already in the throes of peeling off her natty blue frock . The Dean says , ' bantered Phyllis , that we should be more trustful of our fellow-men . There 's something about it in the Bible , too . ' Well  --  the Dean never was a woman , ' came Sonia 's reflection from deep in the clothes-closet . And the Bible was written by men  --  for men . ' Dare you to say that to the Dean . ' Phyllis lounged in , tossed her hat aside , and sat on the edge of her bed . About the Bible ? It was the Dean who told me . He says there should have been at least one book in the Bible written by a woman  --  for women . ' Sonia turned on the shower . Would n't mind taking a shot at it myself ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " Prissy Proverbs "  --  and the first one would be  --  " All men are savages ; do n't trust any of ' em . " ' Phyllis laughed ; then sobered . A pair of entreating steel-blue eyes invited her to believe that Sonia 's declara- tion of unfaith in men should be qualified .... She walked slowly into the living-room and laid the epoch-making letter on the desk . Montana ! The wan little hope she had nourished that sometime she might meet him  --  just long enough to see a bit of relief come into that haggard face  - -   - -   must now be definitely given up . Every mile and every hour of her impending journey west would diminish the likelihood of a chance meeting . It was n't , she told herself , that they could ever get to- gether on a basis of friendship . But the feeling had been growing more and more intense that by some means she must rid herself of the torturing haunt  --  those dazed , hurt , questing eyes . In her dreams they kept following her about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflected in her own . Sometimes she wondered if the hallucination had not become at least mildly obsessive . Whenever their telephone rang , the query involuntarily flung itself into the  | front of her mind  --  There !  --  he has come ! ' A telegram  --  a special-delivery letter  --  when she met the boy with the cap and the book and the pencil , her heart would pound cap and the book and the pencil , her heart would pound hard . There ! ' she would whisper to herself . He is com- ing ! ' ... Now she was going to put some more distance be- tween them . But she must be happy ! The Wembelton position was setting her free from a situation that would shortly become impossible . The Dean must be notified at once . What a impossible . The Dean must be notified at once . What a darling he had been to find this place for her ! She called him and after a moment 's delay heard his deep voice . Yes , him and after a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , he too had heard from Mr. Gibson today . Yes  --  he was very glad it had turned out that way . Yes  --  Phyllis must come and see him soon . And Sonia too . Things always must come and see him soon . And Sonia too . Things always came out right  --  did n't they ?  --  if you were n't too im- patient . It 's almost too much to hope that everything will always come out right , ' Phyllis was saying into the telephone , come out right , ' Phyllis was saying into the telephone , wondering why she said it , for surely this was no time to be pensively doubtful . There was a little pause before the Dean commented on this remark . She reproached herself for having expressed the implied lament in the face of all he had done for her . Do n't stop hoping , Phyllis , ' he said slowly . Hope is brimful of vitamins . Better for you than spinach .

Now that they had been living together for a month , Sonia had quite altered her snap judgment . Elise was rather a dear , after all , with a pretty wit , a desire to be companionable , and bubbling with refreshing news of companionable , and bubbling with refreshing news of interests to which Sonia had never experienced such direct access . She had found a good position in a well-paid church quartet and was filling club engagements in the surround- ing suburbs . Later in the fall she would be en tour in the Mid-West under direction of a manager . She was going to marry Eugene  --  ' eventually , but why now ?

' I was rather hopeful of seeing you today , ' he had said , when she was seated opposite him . ' In fact , I was so con- fident you would come that I ordered these violets for you , remembering that you like them . ' She had taken up the little vase on his desk , inhaled deeply of their shy fragrance , and smiled gratefully . ' That 's one of the many things about you , Dean Har- court , that I 'll never quite understand . ' Sonia 's eyes were misty . ' So many people coming to you , leaning on you , and yet you remember all their little likes  --  and their little hurts .

It interests me to think about a few choice spirits and I spend much time wondering how they are  --  and what they are doing . ' ' And scheming plans , ' added Sonia , with a knowing little pucker of her lips . ' That was awfully sweet  --  what you ( lid for Phyllis . ' ' She got off all right , last night ? ' Sonia nodded , and buried her face in the cool violets . ' You 'll be lonely without Phyllis . That 's why I had hoped I might see you today . You remember Miss Graham ? She was in here , yesterday , telling me she was looking for a j congenial place to live . ' With me  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't thought much about her . She seemed a bit silly at your dinner when she was hoping to torture Mr. Corley . We were amused over her pretense of intimate friendship with that Mr. Parker who had done so much for her . I happen to know that it 's little enough she knew about him . She did n't even know his real name . ' ' Do you ? ' Phyllis told me . He is Dr. Paige  --  the man who made the terrible mistake in her mother 's operation . Did n't you know ? ' Sonia shook her head involuntarily , as she often did when anticipating a negative reply . The Dean had dropped his pen on the floor and after several efforts to retrieve it was assisted by his guest . Sonia carefully scrubbed off the point with a piece of crumpled paper from the wastebasket and returned to her chair . Thanks , Sonia . What were we talking about ? Oh , yes  --  Elise . ' The Dean 's tone was dry  --  just a bit office-like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ! Elise is an interesting person and she is looking for an interesting companion . I took the liberty of asking her if she remembered you . She seemed much pleased . I told her I would speak to you about it . ' Do you want me to take her in with me ? ' Sonia searched his eyes . Why not ? She would be pleasant company . ' Any other reason ? ... Because , if there is , I ought to be let into the secret , do n't you think ? ' The Dean regarded her reproachfully . And after I went to all the trouble to get you the violets , Sonia , you calmly sit there and hint that I 'd keep a secret from you . ' Well  --  I dare say I 'll find out what I 'm expected to do , ' she countered , pretending a pout.  | ' Doubtless , ' replied the Dean , with the merest suggestion of a smile . ' Will I hear from her ? ' ' Very soon . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go now ? ' she asked childishly . ' Yes . Want to show the next lady in ? ' She pulled off her pretty hat and walked to the door of the little dressing-room , not bothering to close it while she stood toying with her exquisitely coiffured blue-black hair before the mirror in plain sight of the Dean . The spon- taneous gesture of unrestraint implied a filial affection thatbrought a brooding tenderness into his shadowed eyes . Returning , she paused for a moment at his side , detained by his outstretched hand . Sonia took it in both of hers and held it tightly . ' Sonia , my dear , ' he said gently , ' you and I have a little job to do . And as I am sworn to secrecy I fear I ca n't co- operate with you very helpfully . But you will know exactly what your own part is , when the time comes . ' ' Is it  --  something  --  about ' Perhaps you 'd better run along now . She will be waiting for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . ' ' That 's good , ' rejoined the Dean , as she slowly released his hand and moved away . ' I wish somebody would tell me all I want to know . ' In a week it was arranged , and Elise had moved in . Sonia had been somewhat reserved at first , partly because she felt a bit ill at ease with a comparative stranger in her house after the many months of close comradeship with Phyllis ; partly , too , because she had had a letter , that afternoon , brimming with unusual and absorbing interest . It was difficult to think about much else , and Elise found her rather more preoccupied , on the evening of her arrival , than she had expected . Phyllis had written lengthily of her first impressions . The Gibsons had met her at the train  --  delightful people , Mr. G. tall and slim , Mrs. G. short and fat , young Gerry sweetly pert and pleasantly spoiled . Drove home in a big car . Huge house . Plenty of servants . Almost everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing I saw when I went in ? I 'm trying to write about it calmly , but I never was so completely at a loss to know what to do . I tell you , for a minute I was paralyzed ! Mrs. Gibson was leading the way through the wide hall . I saw this red dog lying there , chin on front paws , looking as if it had lost its last friend , and it seemed odd to me that it did n't get up , as any normal dog ought to do , to welcome the family . Well  --  if you 'll believe it  --  as soon as I passed the dog , it scrambled to its feet and began to jump up on me .... And Mr. Gibson , following me , shouted , " What do you suppose has got into that dog ? " And Mrs. Gibson seemed terribly embarrassed . Then it occurred to her that I might want to go at once to my room , so we went up , and the dog came too . She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , so close Icould hardly keep on my feet . I told her she might as well let the dog stay ; that it did n't bother me ; and she said it was the oddest thing  --  for Sylvia did n't pay any attention to anybody .... So  --  I closed the door and sat down , a little weak in the knees , and Sylvia came and put her two front feet on my lap and stood there looking into my face with her mouth wide open and her red tongue lolling out , and her eyes fairly popping with excitement . You would have sworn she was wanting to talk  --  the way she would close her mouth , and swallow , and then open it again , panting , just as if she was ready now to  --  to say it  --  whatever it was . Well  --  I do n't want you to think I 'm a baby . I was tired from the long trip , and about ready to do something silly .... And I was lonesome too , dear , away off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's neck and held her big soft head against my face and cried until I was com- pletely frazzled . And  --  I 'm half-ashamed to tell you this , though I know you 'll understand  --  I let that crazy dog lick my face and my neck and my hair until I smelled like a spoiled steak and looked like a peeled onion . When I could n't stand it any more , we went into the bathroom and looked at ourselves , Sylvia standing up beside me with her paws on the basin . Then the whole thing began to seem funny and I laughed until my stomach ached . Really  --  I was n't fit to be seen . I do n't know what they thought of me . I did n't try to go down for an hour . Sylvia does n't leave me . It 's just a bit embarrassing . Wherever I go  --  there she is . Mrs. Gibson explained that the dog had been left in their care by a friend of Mr. Gibson 's who is up in the mountains hunting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hunter would n't park his dog somewhere . They do n't seem to want to talk about it .... Of course I 'm con- sumed by curiosity . ' Sonia had finished the rest of the letter hastily . Then she went to the telephone and called Dean Harcourt . I 've heard from Phyllis . ' Good ! Make the trip comfortably ? ' Yes . She is stopping at the Gibsons ' until she locates permanent living-quarters . Who do you think met her at the door when she arrived ? ' One of the Pharaohs . ' Sylvia ! ' Sylvia who ? ' Do n't you know ? ' How should I ? ' Sylvia Paige ! ' Sonia 's voice rose a little higher than she had intended  --  almost an impatient shriek . There was a pause . Oh ? ' ... The Dean 's rising inflection hinted that he was mildly interested . So he 's out in that country , is he ? ' Yes  --  it 's a strange coincidence . ' Sonia 's tone indicated that there was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' he asked paternally . Well  --  I 'm just about the way you 'd think I 'd be  --  with a big mystery on my hands  --  and  --  and '  | ' Yes  --  I realize that , ' said the Dean steadily  --  though Sonia felt that he was smiling : it seemed somehow to get into his calm enunciation  --  ' and is Elise with you yet ? ' ' Comes tonight . ' There was another long pause  --  so long that Sonia said Hello ? ' ' Perhaps you 'd better not confide anything to her about Sylvia  --  yet awhile . If she has anything to impart , let her do it . I 'm told it is customary  --  anyhow  --  for the visiting lady to deal first . ' Then Sonia laughed  --  and murmured something into the telephone that sounded like an endearment that had got itself tangled up with an exasperation . He was an old meanie , she reflected , as she plopped the telephone down , but he was also an old dear . Elise had returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a half-hour had been luxuriating on the davenport in a pink negligee , reading her mail . Suddenly she sat up and perforated the midnight silence with a startling , ' Well  --  I 'll be ! Sonia , curled up in a big chair on the other side of the lamp , deep in the most exciting episode of a detective story , responded to the clamor with a jerk , and dropped her book on the floor . ' I 've found out who Nathan Parker is ! ' declared Elise , measuring her words dramatically . ' Well  --  who is he ? ' asked Sonia , still jumpy . ' Nathan Parker ? ' ' Come here ! I 'll tell you a story that will beat the one you 're reading . ' Elise moved over and made room . ' You 've often heard me speak of my pet cousin , Clay Brock . Lately he has been seeing much of a young nurse at Parkway Hospital . The other night there was a party  --  nurses and medics , mostly  --  and Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Listen ! ... ' She wanted to know where I lived and I told her about Leeds . She asked me about my people and I told her about you . She seemed interested in your story , so I told her about Mr. Parker and what all he had done to give you a push . Then she wanted to know about Mr. Parker  --  most inquisitive woman I ever saw , I think  --  and I told her a good deal . When I mentioned Sylvia , she shut up like a clam and grew very sober . ' Later in the evening , as we were leaving , she pulled me aside and said she wanted to talk to me , and would I come to see her , the next afternoon . I did  --  and she told me that Mr. Parker was Dr. Newell Paige who had been Dr. Endicott 's associate surgeon and had run away after an operation in which the patient died .... All that will be interesting enough to you , I imagine , if he never told you himself .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know whether anything can ever be done about it , but Miss Ogilvie says the surgical mistake was made by old man Endicott ! She saw it with her own eyes ! It was this way , if I can explain it so you 'll understand . The old boy was doing a kidney excision . The renal artery is well covered with a thick sheath of membranes . He was all shot to pieces , that morning  --  day of the first big crash on the Stock Exchange , and he had just got word of his heavy losses  --  so , Miss Ogilvie says , he was in no condition to be operating at all , much less on such a job as that . " Well  --  Endicott failed to dissect out the artery from the fatty sheath and naturally the tie slipped off and the patient died on the table . And here 's where Paige comes in . He had applied the ligature . So it 's his fault . And why did n't he deny it ? Because  --  says Miss Ogilvie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was dippy in his devotion to him . She says it 's a clear case that Paige decided to take the rap and save the old man 's reputation . ' " And there never has been a peep out of Dr. Endicott on the subject . He is n't known ever to have inquired what became of Paige . Lately he has n't been doing very much surgery . He delivered the convocation lecture at the
