in one simple word , " we should not hesitate . The word is " surplus . " Too much of everything . Too much wheat , too much sugar , too much cloth , too many shoes , too many motor cars , and , worse still , more machines and tools and tamed energy for the endless production of these goods than we know what to do with . Nevertheless , set here an immovable post . Formerly there was another word to express all the economic woes of the race . It was " scarcity . " We have come so far as to have forgotten the terrors of that word . We can not even imagine them . Only a few generations ago , if we could have conceived it at all , we should have said that once we had achieved the power of unlimited production , then the economic problem of the human race on earth was physically solved . And we had been right to say so . That problem is solved . Depression on a Grand Scale I IS not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus , but because we do not understand surplus as phenomena , that suddenly we come to this ditch . Colossal and senseless absurdity ! That is all we can think of today at first . Then , to account for it , we begin to talk an idiom we do not understand , all the time staring in a helpless manner at miles of bread lines . Or , gazing into the ditch , we utter great nonsense , as to say : " That is what capitalism leads us to . Capitalism itself is on trial . " Thereby compounding absurdity . Capitalism is no more on trial than human nature . We are all to blame . They are to blame , among them very eminent economists , who kept saying that what had happened before could not happen again , and believed it .. They are to blame who , when the signs became ominous , said part of it could happen and no more , and who , when the Wall Street delirium collapsed , in 1929. said nothing need happen on that account to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1928 that the inflation of bank credits in the dazing item of brokers ' loans for purposes of speculation was not dangerous . Actually the aggregate of such loans at that time may not have been dangerous ; the momentum was , but , nobody could imagine how dangerous it was . They are to blame who spent their imaginary Wall Street gains by going gayly into debt against credit balances with their brokers . The Federal Reserve Board is to blame for not having strangled a speculation in which everybody was taking part , under the delusion that wealth and gain were alike , and that if the multiplication of wealth were unlimited , so might profits he . Wall Street , as always , was greatly to blame , but for once Wall Street itself lost . money along with the rest of us , for it believed what everyone else believed , in the same way . They are more or less to blame , too , who for a while went to and fro saying : " Nothing has really happened . She is not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And lastly , for some of the deep after consequences the Government is to blame for trying to support prices with public funds , as if prosperity might be bought by subsidy . Which is only to say , of course , that nobody is really to blame . We were all stupid , greedy , hallucinated . Remember , we had but . recently discovered a new world  --  this world of surplus . We had just begun to get some grand idea of it . All that was the matter with the Mississippi Bubble was that people did not know what to do with a new world . They had in that ease , too , just got the grand idea of it . The reality in time turned out to be a millionfold greater . In no trivial sense does one say it was a grand ditch . It had to be , for what fell into it . The worst depression in the history of modern business , yes ; but depression on a very high level  --  the highest over touched . Therefore , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the great evil of unemployment which is inseparable from depression . It was inevitable , if it happened at all , that it should happen on this scale . You may ask what saving there is in a sense of proportion touching the absolute fact of human misery . Here now are the richest countries in the world counting their unemployed by the million . If these millions were not fed and warmed by some awkwardness of organized public relief , there would be famine among them more deathly than famine was in ancient times , or may be still in China . They are strangely helpless . They are too far from the soil to get hack to it in time to save themselves . We know , and they know , that if they seized the surplus to devour it , their next state would be far worse ; since in that way they would wreck a scheme that does contain within it the magic of unlimited plenty , if only we knew what rationally to do with it . On the one hand , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unemployment Committee , " we have millions of idle workers , many of them now desperately in need of the very commodities they might produce if they had work . On the other hand , we have idle plants the owners of which are eager to put these idle workers to work and are steadily losing money because of their inability to do so . While these two groups stay separated , employers , employes and consumers alike are victims of depression . No one profits by the situation . Everyone loses . And no one seems to know how to bring the two groups together . Now , how do we allow ourselves to get into this stupid situation ? All we know is that it comes about through vast , far-reaching and as yet uncontrolled economic forces . " Well , there is the ditch , the very bottom of it. , soft . with despair or else hard with the honesty of saying , " We do n't know . " That may he as you take it . Yet even here  --  especially here in the uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to set a post . One or more . Three at least ; and these to mark new attitudes , new ways of feeling , the sense of new directions . 11 New . Rttitude Toward Unemployment 7111E first will he a sign to indicate a new attitude 1 on the part of industry toward unemployment , wherein now it is recognized to he a total evil . Formerly  --  and this was not long ago  --  industry not . only was complacent . about . unemployment. ; more or less of it was very favorably regarded . From the feudal capitalist 's point of view the ideal condition was that in which there should be always four jobs for five men . That kept labor in a state of mental docility , made it very anxious to work , and reasonable about wages ; moreover , there was then a constant reservoir out of which to draw cheap labor as it was needed . When depression occurred , this feudal capitalist , taking care only that his machines did not rust , simply shut up his plant and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployed . But what now is the case ? American industry we are talking about . In the Old World there is an ugly hang-over from the feudal attitude . The sense American industry now has of unemployment is one of moral and rational abhorrence . For American industry the idea ! condition is that . in which every man shall have a steady job , suited to his knack and capacity , at the highest possible wage . There may be some altruism in it , but that need not stand in point . By altruism alone we should never overtake the ideal . There is reason in it , and that is important . No longer in this world of surplus may industry shut up and wait for demand to require again its capacity on its own terms . Demand , or , that is to say , consumption , now is more important than supply , or production , since the power of production is unlimited , so that what a broad line represents , besides the heartache , is a positive and irreplaceable loss of demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would all be buyers . Each hour of their idleness is like a cargo of common wealth sunk in the sea . Bread Lines Yesterday and Today rr HE second will be a sign referring to the effect of 1 surplus on the fringe  --  a sign with certain silent implications . Have you seen a bread line ? Go to look at one . Say it is one in New York City , at St. Vincent 's Hospital , six in the evening , weather cold . There may be two hundred men in line . If in that whole line there are three or four without overcoats , they will be noticeable for that reason . They may be hungry , but they are comfortably clothed . Do you remember what a bread line was like twenty or thirty years ago ? If not , ask someone who can to tell you . It was terrible . Men in rags , in tied-on shoes , shivering with cold . And they were uncounted . We do a new thing to count . the unemployed . It is as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people in bread lines are , as a rule , warmly clad . What is much more remarkable is that one almost dare not call attention to the fact lest one shall seem , even in this degree , to belittle human misery . In this world of surplus , the sight . of people asking for food or receiving it at the hand of public charity fills us with a sense of frustration , and this is a rational sense much more to be trusted for effects in the future than the beautiful emotion of heartache . The third will be a sign to indicate that we begin to perceive  --  though as yet dimly  --  how the // meaning of industry has changed . After all , what is industry for ? Whore is it going ? What is it all about ? A few years ago , if you had asked what industry was toward or what was the first concern of the capital in it , the answer would have been  --  its own profit .. And what . a silly ques-tion ! As well ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question : Why do people till the soil ? For food primarily . For money profit , maybe . Yet in any case , with or without money profit , we should till the soil , as we did for thousands of years before there was any such thing as money profit. , and we should do it because agriculture is a process of life . Well , so now , also , industry is a process of life , the proof being that human life simply can not proceed without it . This was not always so . In the beginning and for a long time industry was a private adventure for private profit . In that character it grew very fast , but in that character it belongs to a world that no longer is , together with many of its original suppositions . Here is matter of profound and dramatic significance . What has hitherto obscured it is the difficulty of seeing when and exactly how a change of degree becomes a change of kind . Industry as it was when Adam Smith wrote about it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still survive , but with industry in the new character and the new meaning rising all about it and overthrowing it . There was no single moment of time in which industry , in fact , became a process of life ; yet no one will thoughtfully deny that this has definitely happened . Once that view is clarified the whole prospect is altered . Admit that industry is a life process and you can no longer say that its first concern is its own profit ; identify it with life , and immediately the certainty appears that in seeking its own profit selfishly and egoistically , it is bound to defeat itself . it can not prosper but as it serves life . There was a time when , if you had proposed that the first concern of industry was human welfare , even human happiness , and that the security of its own things lay in this recognition , your words would not have made sense . They would not have made sense because they were not yet true . But now this construction actually is taking place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to seize the fact that the world we are born into is really a new world ! Its history and traditions are continuous . We know how different it is in degree of things . Statistics give us that knowledge . But to realize it is new in kind , though it has changed by degree , is not so easy . Until we do make this transla tion there will be no clear thinking . Wherein and why , for example , does an economic crisis now differ from the corresponding episode , owing apparently to the same causes , in the world of Adam Smith , or in the Pharaohs ' world before that ? Tuning In With Nature I N THE life of primitive mankind there were very desperate and recurring crises , stalked by want and famine . For ages these terrible events were traced to the displeasure of the gods . Why else should the grass sometimes flourish and sometimes wither ? Why else for seasons together should the rain descend as it should and then withhold itself ? Why else gaunt years at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind made a strange discovery . There was a rhythm in Nature , the same for the good as for the wicked , the same for those with these gods as for people holding with other gods , a rhythm unmindful of rites and incantations , unpredictable in the particulars , and yet with some law of average in it , since it never failed that lean years were followed by fat years again . Gradually the intelligent races learned ways of accommodation  --  first how to make granaries and hoard the surplus of good years , and then , at length , how to impound the rainfall and flood in reservoirs and lead the precious water to their crops as it was required . Never has man , ancient or modern , been able to control this rhythm of Nature or to predict it exactly . But by thought and engineering he learned how to beat it . Then for the first time fixed forms of civilize-Lions began to rise on a solid base of agriculture . As primitive man traced his crises to the displeasure of the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for if he but continued his rites of propitiation the good seasons did certainly return . It took him thousands of years to break this delusion and begin really to think in a purposeful manner ; and then very soon , by observation , forethought , ( Continued on Page 95 ) discipline and works of engineering , he began to gain control of the circumstances . In this artificial modern world , though we have ourselves created the circumstances , we are hardly beyond the stage of thinking we think . We still believe in rituals and incantations . Just now we have thought we might save the ecstasy of great prosperity by chanting all together , " We are prosperous  --  very prosperous , " or , when that had failed , that we could banish depression in the same way by toning , " It is not so . " We erect an elaborate theory of cycles to explain the inevitable alternation of good and bad times , and prove it as the ancients proved their theory of propitiation , by the coincidence that the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand at holes in the ground measuring the quantity of yellow metal annually dug out of them , thinking if it is more the times will be better , if it is less the times will be worse . Mass Progress From Mass Thinking Never have we squarely faced the fact that in this artificial world we make the phenomena . We are ourselves responsible for good and bad times , for booms and depressions , for unemployment . Here is no blame between man and Nature ; no matter for prayer , either . Therein lies the first difference between the natural world that was and the artificial world that is . Formerly man was in bondage to the rhythm of Nature . He could never control it , and yet he did contrive to deliver himself from its terrors . Now he is in bondage to a rhythm that runs in his own scheme , or thinks he is , and behaves as if lie could not control that . As time is in the life of the race , this modern scheme , called the artificial world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and did evolve day by day , and so it is impossible to say precisely when the center shifted . There was no moment in which civilization , that had rested so long upon agriculture , came to rest upon industry  --  meaning machine power and machine method . You may think civilization has now two points of suspension  --  one agriculture and one industry . That is ' not so . Agriculture itself rests upon industry . The structure is vertical , with industry fundamental . To prove this , you have only to consider what would happen to agriculture if machine power vanished out of the world like a dream . Half the population on the western side of the world would vanish also like a dream , since by man and animal power alone . the food to sustain it could be neither produced nor distributed . This strange event , never included in the plan of Nature  --  that is to say , the event of civilization , life itself , coming to rest upon machine power  --  is profoundly momentous . We are still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the whole of its implications . The most singular of all its consequences is this  --  that whereas formerly business was a tenth part of human activity , or anything less , and in no sense vital , suddenly it is the universal condition of human existence . Formerly business consisted in the exchange of marginal quantities and luxuries ; now it represents the exchange of everything we eat and drink and wear and use  --  and there is no living but by exchange . ( Continued from Page 5 ) Where once people lived in direet virtue of their own exertions , feeding , clothing and housing themselves , seeing always the end of their own labors , and where this had been for thousands of years the way of life , now suddenly in this modern scheme we live by the labor of one another dependently ; for the most part , invisibly ; in general , anonymously . That is to say again , we live by exchange . People no longer directly consume what they produce . Labor is reduced to functions and operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thing  --  motor cars , typewriters , textiles , shoes , the separate staples of food . The mass product of mass labor , whatever it is , has then to be broken up , distributed and sold ; it has to be sold back in consumable forms and quantities even to those whose functions and operations have produced it . There is no such thing as an automobile worker making himself a motor car . He first sells his labor on the assembly line and then buys a motor car . All this we . know . The advantages are enormous . The cost of human satisfactions is progressively reduced , the quantity of them is multiplied to any extent . The whole of our material progress is so explained . It is mass progress from mass thinking and mass acting . There comes at length a sense of mass security , and the more of this the less we consider the weakness , the strangeness , the utter helplessness of the marginal individual when something goes wrong . A break in the rhythm is like a convulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at the periphery , are without the means of life . They have nowhere to sell their labor . When Drought Hits Industry In this scheme the simplest and most obvious fact is , perhaps , the one most startling . This is the fact that no one lives but by selling something first . Beginning with the wage earner , he must sell his labor in order to live . The necessity to sell it is from the fact that he can not live directly by his own exertions . How shall he consume the product of his own labor when that is an operation , one of thousands contributed to the making of a complete thing ? Then the complete thing must be sold ; if it is not sold he can not continue to sell his labor , and unless he can sell his labor he can not live . And what is true of industry itself becomes true also of agriculture . The farmer is in the same ease . Ile , too , must sell in order to live , because , like the wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since that product is no longer a thing but an operation , so also the farmer , whose product is not a year 's food supply in his own cellar , smokehouse and barn , but a cash crop produced by methods of specialization  --  it may be wheat , or cotton , or lettuce , or citrus fruit , and nothing else . What the farmer himself consumes he buys , even much of his own food , When the life was agricultural , cause , effect and cure were all very simple . The benign rhythm failed ; there was drought , the food supply failed . Then , whether man prayed or not , all he could do was to wait for Nature to bring him back his fullness . In the industrial scheme of life suddenly the machines stop . That , too , is like a drought . For millions of people the food supply has failed , and it has failed for reasons they can not individually control . Then we wait . Depression runs its course . The machines start . Prosperity returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines to supply the demand for more goods than had . over been consumed before . There is no danger that this will not happen again , in just that way . Nothing could be more certain . Prosperity will presently rise from this ditch ; all statistics will quicken ; all quantities will increase again . The danger is that we shall be content merely to let it happen ; and so proceed to a greater disaster without knowing why the machines stop , what starts them again , or what it is that takes place in a time of depression to make a further advance possible . Wanted , Booms Without Depressions We have just made an enormous involuntary investment in experience . Take it to be fifty billions of dollars  --  a modest and arbitrary figure . By no means does it represent the total loss , hardly the deflation alone in the market value of stocks and bonds . Let it stand for that part of the loss which is not bound to cancel itself . Say it was the difference between illusion and reality . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be very easy to do  --  much easier , indeed , than to save it  --  for in losing it we should be under the delusion of getting it back . A sudden return of prosperity , another inflation of prices , a redeeming bull market in Wall Street  --  and nothing thought through to a new premise . That would be to lose it . But if again you were an omnipotent being and could promise this , or an oracle and could predict it , a great many people would stop thinking . They want back the delirium of 1928 . They want to know what happened to it , not with the idea of preventing its recurrence but with the thought first to recover it and then to keep it forever . Again like the people with the Mississippi Bubble . They would sooner have their bubble mended than take the trouble to explore a new world of reality . In the midst of a boom there is always foreboding of a depression ; never in the midst of a depression is there any fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are opposite aspects of one evil . Yet if- you had a formula guaranteed to abolish one with the other , many who voted for it would be secretly hoping that only one-half of it would work . Certainly we have less intelligence than we need , and yet more than we can use . Therefore , of this i'mponderable thing , too , we have a surplus  --  meaning more of it than we know what to do with . Instance the discrepancy between the way we think and the way we behave about speculation . Everyone understands the principle of a balance wheel in the machine . Its function is to absorb the variations and keep the rhythm . For that reason it must itself be constant in weight and speed . A balance wheel of whimsical speed , changeable weight , and unpredictable , would wreck a machine . In the economic mechanism is the great wheel of finance , composed of money , credit and securities . All the economic transactions of life are related to this wheel in a very sensitive way . How ( Continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page us ) important , therefore , that its behavior should be constant ! But its behavior is not constant . Speculation affects both the speed and size of the wheel of finance . The faster it turns the bigger it grows , in a manner contrary to any natural or sane principle , and there is the further peculiarity about it that it acts upon its own source of energy to increase it . Its momentum creates more of the thing that gives it momentum  --  namely , speculation . Until this strange effect of action and reaction becomes dangerous nobody wishes to stop it ; and then , when it has become dangerous , nobody dares to stop it , for fear of the consequences . Everybody knows what will happen and that the longer they are postponed the worse the consequences will be . Suddenly , instead of flying to pieces , the wheel contracts to much less than its natural size and rapidly slows down . The shock to the economic structure is terrific . It is like going from high to low gear at full speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the windshield . And at last , when it is all over , there is nowhere any sense of responsibility . Overrunning Capacity to Buy The eminent literature of Wall Street now is full of austere comment on the speculative mania that ended so disastrously in the autumn of 1929 . You would hardly believe Wall Street had provided the credit to finance it . When the American banking system alone could no longer supply enough credit , Wall Street bought credit all over the world to go on with , buying it at very high rates . The price of credit everywhere advanced , to the distress of the whole world 's proper business . Mad  --  perfectly mad . It is Wall Street saying so . Yet how well it could do with some of that same madness hack and how easily persuade itself again to the prismatic view ! In this contradiction Wall Street is more or less everybody . We know what booms are made of and what they cost . We know what a terrific price we are paying for the last one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it . This kind of thing ought never to happen again . Stability is the great blessing . Yet what a solacing thought to hold in secret that what does always come after a depression is still another boom . Such is human nature . And that is , perhaps , why , in a time such as now , so much that passes for thought on the profound problem of industrial civilization is but a reaction of the mind to trouble . Anything to get out of this ditch . Consider what we are saying and hearing about cause and remedy . Overproduction , the rise of tariff barriers to obstruct the free flow of goods internationally , the war debts , high wages , the fall of silver , the unequal ownership of gold among nations . So , therefore , lay the tariff barriers , cancel the war debts , liquidate wages , restore the buying power of silver by fiat , redistribute the gold holdings , and so on . When the logic is all in , it appears that we have made a profound saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indisputable .. The cure for illness is to get rid of sickness . That also bears no argument . One way to get rid of sickness is to give it to someone else . That , perhaps , is arguable ; nevertheless , it has been known to work temporarily . if there is a surplus that can not be got into the hands of the people who have produced it and want it and need it , then sell it in a foreign market . The use of selling it abroad is that then you will be able to produce another surplus , which will bring you to the same problem again ; only while it is being produced you may have some illusion of prosperity . This is mostly the thought of thinking . Try to make sense of overproduction . How can you say there is overproduction while yet there are human wants to be satisfied ? And if there is overproduction in the sense that all things have been produced in excess of society 's total needs and wants , then why should n't unemployment be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited meaning from the point of view of t he machine itself . Since the beginnings of modern industry it has happened every little while that machines have overrun the immediate capacity of buyers to buy and have for that reason stopped . The first one hundred machines did it , the first one thousand did it , the first million did it . Then in another little while either these machines.or new and better machines were all running again at high speed , trying to overtake the demand . So it was never overproduction actually , or in any social sense ; it was overproduction only from the point of view of industry suddenly with more goods of certain kinds on its hands than it could sell at a profit  --  that is to say , at certain prices . From no other point of view does the word make sense . Never yet actually has there been overproduction , if you take it to mean that the power of industry to produce human satisfactions has overwhelmed desire . The power of industry , remember , is flexible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take any form imaginable . Nature is inflexible ; her patterns , so far as we can see , are fixed . From the acorn an oak and nothing else ; from the seed of one elephant another elephant , and nothing else is possible . In this artificial world of our own creation , on the contrary , it is first the want that determines the form . Want is the seed . Let people say what things they want and machines to produce them in quantity will immediately appear . Production Gone . Nwry All the more difficulty , therefore , ' to make sense of overproduction , this side of satiety . But if ever you say wrong production . the sense begins to come . What we call overproduction is , in fact , wrong production . It is wrong in kind , wrong in cost or wrong in price ; and if it were not wrong in one or all of these three ways , it could be sold . Buggies would be an instance of production that.is wrong in kind . There is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wheat produced at a cost of $1.50 a bushel in competition with wheat produced at eighty cents is an example of production that is wrong in cost . There is a great deal of that in both industry and agriculture . But the great trouble conies from production that is wrong in price . That was the invisible trouble in 1929 . A very large proportion of the country 's production had become wrong in price , and this was an ominous fact long before the autumn collapse of the Wall Street speculation . There was an illusion about it that curiously disguised the truth or made it easy to conceal . Commodities and goods had not been rising in price . Therefore , how could anyone say production was wrong in price ? Even after the panic in Wall Street people said : " The fact that will save us is that all this time there has been no inflation of commodity prices . This never happened before . A wild boom in securities with no parallel speculation in commodities . Hitherto , after the collapse of a bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a deflation of commodities to take place . For once we shall not have to wait . Commodities were not inflated ; therefore , they need not be deflated . The ground is solid . Let business proceed as if nothing had happened . Everybody back to business ! Forget this Wall Street nonsense . Only keep the machines going and we shall be all right . " It did for a moment seem feasible . The effort was heroic . Then the illusion broke and the decline in commodities was terrific . Production had been wrong in price . Yet , how so ? Well , that is to be explained . It was true there had been no rise in the price of goods and commodities . For seven years the price index , the average of prices , or , let us say simply , the commodity price line , had been flat and horizontal , going neither up nor down . This was a very notable fact . It looked as if we were approaching a sane stability of prices ; as if speculation had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that reason , spending its force in Wall Street . But all this time , from the improvement of both machines and method , the cost line was falling . That is to say , the cost of pro-clueing goods declined ; it fell , perhaps , more in those seven years than in any corresponding period before . High Cost of Lowered Costs The effect upon profit was as if the cost line had been horizontal and the price line had been rising . The spread between selling prices and manufacturing costs  --  prices standing still and costs falling  --  was the margin of profit Wall Street was capitalizing with ecstasy in the valuation of common stocks . For many of the great corporations it was a prodigious profit . Yet how could anyone complain ? The profit was from reducing costs in a scientific manner , not from increasing prices to the consumer . Nobody complained . That is not what happened . What happened was that demand began to fail . On that one constant price level it had been filled full . Long before the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in every direction it was touching the dread point of saturation . Then the cost of selling began to rise very fast . Very often the cost of selling goods was more than the cost of manufacture . Industry had forgotten the lesson it had once begun to learn . The lesson is that as your profit increases from falling costs , you must divide it with the consumer by letting prices down  --  not that to do so is either fair or moral , but because it is necessary . Unless you do it demand will not expand as fast as production , and thus production , right in kind , right in cost , becomes wrong in price . Industry in this case tried to keep the whole profit and lost it . Instead of dividing it with the consumer , it permitted Wall Street to capitalize it , and then Wall Street lost it . In spite of anything that could be done , prices did break , and the more desperate the organized effort was to hold them up the worse they broke . Thus you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was production wrong in price . Next take the notion that tariff bar-riers cause depression by hindering the free exchange of goods among nations . This notion is running world-wide and // rises to the point of obsession in  --  well , where would you think ? In those countries that raise around themselves the highest tariff walls to keep out other people 's goods . We coniplain of the European tariff walls . Europe complains of the American tariff wall . What sense can you make of it ? Each of these countries that possesses the industrial power of surplus trying to keep out the goods of every other such country ; each at the same time complaining that the others unreasonably do likewise to it ; each one thinking its own unemployment problem would be solved if only it could sell its surplus away in a foreign market . What is this but the idea of giving the sickness to someone else ? In all these countries there is the same sickness of unemployment , the same kind of power and equipment , the same kind of surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one night so that all markets were thrown wide open to free trade . What would occur ? There would be , indeed , a great movement of goods ; everyone rushing to fill up the highest market . Simply , a series of bargain sales on a grand international scale , with certain consequences , such as , one , that unemployment would temporarily decrease in some countries and correspondingly increase in the others , and , two , that one , low-cost country would be in a position to bankrupt industry in all the others . Seeing this , the others would be bound , of course , to raise their tariff walls again , and thus a return to the first problem . Putting Blame on War Debts . What is that problem ? It is how people who have already found the means whereby increasingly to satisfy their own wants by collective exertion may find also the way whereby without fail the individual shall be able to produce the equivalent of what he wishes to consume and then to consume the equivalent of what he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we receive a million pairs of shoes from Czecho-Slovakia  --  sound shoes at prices very much less than for American shoes . And then suppose in exchange for these shoes we export a quantity of wheat . That would seem a fair transaction . The buyers of shoes are served ; the sellers of wheat are served . But wherein is the benefit to the American shoe industry and its idle wage earners ? There is in this country both a surplus of food and a surplus of shoemaking power . Swapping food for shoes with a foreign country will not tell us how to get our own goods into the hands of our own people . Certainly a sudden fall in the volume of the world 's trade will cause machines to stop and unemployment to increase all over the place . Therefore , we say the fallen state of foreign trade is a cause of depression . in the several countries . But again we are talking in a circle . What is the cause of this cause ? Why does foreign trade decline ? The cause of depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of depression in the several countries . People will say it is surplus  --  all of us trying to sell our surplus to one another . Is it the surplus ? Or is it that we do not know what to do with the phenomena of surplus ? Related to the obsessional notion about foreign trade and how each country might get rid of its own sickness by giving it to others is the idea that war debts are a cause of depression . There is a new tune here . The cancellationists now are saying that for purely selfish reasons we should forgive or further reduce the debts owing to us by European countries on account of war loans . If they were not obliged to find several hundred millions of money a year to pay us on their war debts they could be spending that money for American goods , and our export trade would improve . They can not pay us and buy from us at the same time . Therefore , let them stop paying for goods bought from us on credit before , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do this we shall be able to start our idle machines . Is this to say we must run our machines for the sake of running them ? Is it to say we must have a foreign market for our surplus product , instead of consuming it ourselves , merely in order to keep ourselves at work ? But consider that Europe has the same notion , and is thinking she must have a market in this country . for her surplus product in order that her people may have employment and livelihood . Take it that the war debts are forgiven and that the money is spent in this country for the surplus products of agriculture and industry . What shall we do with the money ? The other complaint is that we have already too much of the world 's total gold money . Here is the president of Columbia University saying : " We are the chief sufferers by the war-debt settlements . . . . While millions of dollars of money are being brought across the sea at stated intervals to be lodged in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the American farmer , the American wage earner , the American , business man and the American investor through destruction of values , loss of markets and disruption of trade . " He seems to be saying that if Europe were not paying us hack the war loans , she would be buying , among other things , American wheat . But Mr. Legge , chairman of the Federal Farm Board , after having used several hundred millions of public money in , the futile attempt to support the price of American wheat , says it is impossible for the American farmer to produce wheat for export at a profit , because land , labor and transportation are so much cheaper in other wheat-producing countries , among them Russia . He thinks Russia a menace to the wheat market of the world . Down to the Sea With Surplus Whether she were paying us back our war loans or not , Europe would buy wheat in the cheapest way , and that would not be to buy it in this country . Moreover , it is notorious that Europe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anxious to sell goods here . That is not because she has war debts to pay and would sooner pay them in goods than money . It is very slightly that . Much more it is that with American capital borrowed since the war  --  billions of it  --  Europe has enormously ' increased her industrial capacity in a manner parallel to ours , adopting even the American method ; and now she wants a way to sell her surplus . If she could sell it here she could put her unemployed to work . But if we could sell our surplus in Europe we could put our unemployed to work . Surplus of the same character ; goods of the same kinds . The flight from surplus ! From that to what ? One expedient not yet proposed would be for the surplus-haunted countries by agreement to sink their unsalable quantities at sea . The effect upon prices would be very favorable  --  the greater the destruction the more favorable the effect  --  and then we might start all over . As why not ? From what we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what we are thinking about is this surplus and this depression . Anything to be rid of one and out of the other , and on our way again . It has been proposed that the world in concert give its surplus to China  --  not primarily for the sake of the Chinese , but that it may be temporarily rid of the curse of unemployment  --  and there is much counsel for our giving our surplus to Europe for a selfish reason . Amazing confusion ! Virtue in Failures Nevertheless , if you ask , " On our way again to where ? " you are obliged to remember the perSpective . The posts have not moved . They are where we left them . For all that is wanting to be made right , for all the stupidity we are guilty of , there stands the fact of the world 's prodigious progress in material wealth  --  an achievement altogether fabulous but as a statistical fact . Moreover , it is certain that prosperity will rise again . Exhorting one another to do all the wrong things  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if nothing had happened ; saying it is all a state of mind and chanting slogans together  --  all the same we do the right things . Principally what takes place in a time of depression to make another advance possible is that we slough off a great burden of obsolescence . The failures are important . Obsolete capital is wiped out . High-cost production , by obsolete method and equipment , is discontinued  --  much of it forever . In place of it will come low-cost production . Everything is put remorselessly to its survival value . The longer the depression lasts and the more severe it is , the deeper the pruning goes . And the mind inclines to new ideas . . It is fairly easy to make a case for complacency . Let it be supposed on reasonable ground that whatever else happens the wealth of the world will continue to increase , and there is the temptation to say : " We make too much of the declivities . They are steep , but so are the peaks . Why not take the evils of wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay for the progressive cheapening of human satisfactions ? We can not anticipate change . No one knows when or where its lightning will strike next . Change causes loss , disturbance , displacement , obsolescence at a frightful rate . Yet it is change that keeps the great wealth curve rising . " In one way or another , we are saying this all the time . Then we look at unemployment and our complacency ends . The consequences of change , as we deal with them intelligently , will be episodical and soon absorbed . That is not so of unemployment. , Depression increases it temporarily as an acute evil , but in good times there it is still , tending to become chronic . In Europe it assumes menacing proportions ; well , but in this country , during the most prosperous seven years we ever knew , unemployment never ceased to be a. problem . In these years for the first time we began to hear of technological unemployment  --  meaning workers whose aptitudes are made obsolete by changes in the industrial method  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less and less wanted by industry . And then there is the utterly senseless fact of unemployment distress and surplus existing at the same time together , tending , in fact , to become chronic together . You may sink one in the sea . What will you do with the other ? Human welfare in total is higher than ever before , and rising . There is no doubt of it . Nevertheless , in the presence of many effects , we get the helpless feeling that we are controlled by the forces we have created , almost as if the machine had a law of necessity in its own being . Probably if we knew more about the painful process of learning by experience we should understand that in this circular confusion we are about to take another step . Never does man advance , but with a chattering mind . Nor does he go raging round and round in a ring of absurdity until there is already acting in him the necessity to break through . The struggle means that ho is defending what is and attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less clearly , the struggle is between an egoistic philosophy of business that is hard to give up and one , as yet unformulated , that is bound to supersede it , and bound to do so because the meaning of business has changed . Who could have imagined that industry , beginning in one obscure corner of the world as a few awkward wheels and levers hitched to steam power , would in only four or five generations become the base of life ? This has happened . Obviously , the philosophy that grew up with it  --  a philosophy of responsibility to itself alone  --  can not comprehend it in this vital character . New View of the Worker The most significant single event in the history of our industrial philosophy was a change in our way of thinking about the wage earner . As in Europe , so here , the wage earner had been regarded only as a producer . Suddenly we saw him as a consumer . From this came first the American theory of high wages to insure a high standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product to ihsure that the standard of living should rise as the wealth of the country increased , curve for curve . The time may have come to see the wage earner in a third light  --  as a producer still , as a consumer of course , but primarily as a seller . It is evident that the individual worker can not produce , can not consume , until , in the first place , he has sold his labor . He must sell it for a money wage for the reasons , first , that in this scheme of mass production one does not consume the product of one 's own labor directly , and , second , that he can not as an individual own the tools of modern industry . Formerly , in the agricultural life , Nature bought all the labor and rewarded it generally as it deserved  --  sometimes . whimsically , sometimes generously , yet , on the whole , in proportion to the amount of intelligence and forethought that informed the labor . Now , since industry has displaced agriculture at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking place above them that vast business of money translation , which we call distribution and exchange ; and since , for millions of people who have no access to the soil , industry is the one means of livelihood , it may have become literally true to say that industry , substituting itself for Nature , incurs the unlimited liability to buy labor . Where else will these people place their labor if not with industry ? Unless they can place ( Continued on Page 1021 ( Continued from Page 98 ) it there , how shall they sustain themselves ? As for the possibility that industry , having bought all the labor , can not sell the product , how can that be , since the worker who sells his labor to industry is necessarily the buyer of its products to the equivalent of his wage ? It seems perfectly simple . Industry as the soil . ? It need not be a plan at all ; only an idea or a way of thinking . There was no plan for treating the wage earner as a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything else followed . Once there had begun to be this further way of thinking altout him and about industry 's liability to give life such a sense of security as it once felt in agriculture , then , naturally , we should see many other things in a new light , especially anything tending to break the rhythm of production and exchange , such as abuse of credit in Wall Street for purposes of speculation . the light of a traitor to the common good . As for Noel Cedric , he rented a bedroom and a parlor . This was unprecedented . The Mansion House had no parlors , but it was persuaded to concoct one by removing the bed and substituting less soporific furniture . This done , the door closed upon the guest and he became invisible while he consolidated his position ; but at four o'clock he appeared , walking in that modest , self-effacing , absent-minded way of his , and proceeded slowly down the street toward the river . The common opinion was that he did n't look like much . Noel paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decaying straggle of buildings which , ten years ago , had been the family fortune of the Brays and the mainstay of North Bagdad . The slingshots of enterprising boys had blasted out every inch of window glass ; dilapidation had set in and desolation perched upon the smokeless loftiness of the stacks . Noel Cedric regarded the pile in a vague , unsearching way , and then sat down upon a rock , his chin cupped in his hands , and seemed to forget all about it in his interest in watching the waters ripple over the stones . Noel arose presently , his eyes still upon the bustling water , and took a backward step . He stepped into the midst of a startled scream , and when events once more adjusted themselves to immobility , he found himself grasping the handlebars of an ancient bicycle to hold erect a young woman who had ridden into him with a fortunate lack of speed . He stared at her through his round glasses without an alteration of his expression of placidity , and saw a girl whose hair reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that singular clarity of outline which gives the effect of aloofness and is puzzling to sophotnorem , and whose eyes were of that lovely , gray-bluish , noncommittal variety which makes a young man wonder if ho dare or not , and decide that he doesn't. " llow do you do ? " said Noel Cedric gravely . " Very well , indeed , " said the young woman . " And you ? " " Time , " said Noel Cedric , " can not age nor custom stale her infinite variety . " " I beg pardon ? " said the young woman . Here is new ground beyond the ditch . There is no place yet to set a post . Yet , if you look , you will find footprints indicating the survival of an American trait . A way of doing the thing even before there is a way of thinking about it . Action preceding the theory . What has already marked this depression to be different from any preceding one is the strong feeling of industry , especially at the top , against liquidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs for five men , the opportunity had come to cut wages , and from industry 's point of view , this was one of the consolations of depression . But this time the honored practice among the great corporations has been to divide the four jobs among the five men and keep them all  --  on shorter time , of course , hilt with no cut in the rate of pay per hour or per day worked . And so it was between man and Nature . She did often put him on foreshortened pay for a season , but without prejudice to NENCOMPOOP ( Continued from Page 7 ) " Merely a quotation , inaccurate in detail . You gave rise to a train of thought and the quotation emerged . " " I have nothing in common with Cleopatra , " she said severely . " You ca n't tell . Cleopatra was a creature of environment . It you were in Alexandria instead of North Bagdad ? " " I should continue to despise snakes . In answer to your unuttered question , I found this bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers and oil cans , so I gave it a thorough housecleaning . It is in the mood of North Bagdad . One feels out of place in a ? motor car  --  sort of blatant and boastful . I never saw you before . Where did you come from , and why , and what is your name , and how long are you stopping ? Other biographical details may be added at will . " " Would you mind putting your feet on the ground ? I 'm a bit tired of holding you up . " " Ungallant and evasive , " she said . " Produce the dossier or I shall feel compelled to scream for help . " " My name is Bray . I came here in search of uneventfulness , and I propose to remain as long as that condition obtains . " " The principal product of North Bagdad is uneventfulness ever since ? " She paused and her eyes narrowed in speculation . " Are you one of those Brays ? The ones who deserted this town and left it punctured ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North 13agdad and then vanished to let it collapse and peter out and disintegrate and die of anaemia ? " " Surely , " he said , " my family can not deserve this fulsome praise . " " Are you the miraculous Andrew ? " " On the contrary , I am the regrettable Noel . " " Oh , " she exclaimed , " the nincompoop . " " Pardon ? " " Only a quotation , " she said , " from the oracular lips of old Pazzy Richey . " " Ile utters a searching tribute , " said Noel Cedric . " Is there some grave reason for keeping your identity secret ? " " I am Beatrice Grey . " Ile shook his head . " You would n't remember me . " She nodded . " I bring sunshine into the precisely genteel lives of two outrageously ancient , spinster aunts . " his interest in the full season , and she never cut him off . The inability of industry in place of Nature to give its dependents certainty of access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than plenty , simply can not be accepted as an absolute fact . Hence doles and various forms of unemployment relief out of public funds , representing a division of the surplus by arbitrary action where it ought to be dividing itself in a simple , automatic manner from the source direct . Even when we have found the way of doing that , so that no one willing to sell his labor to industry shall be denied the reward of livelihood , we may still have the problem of wrong production to solve ; possibly in time a problem of absolute surplus . On the other hand , we may discover that instead of surplus being the cause of unemployment , it is partly the other way around : Unemployment itself may be one cause of surplus . " The old-maid Grey twins ! " exclaimed Noel Cedric with some slight animation . " So described by the vicinage . We still live in the big house on the ill-gotten gains of an unworthy , probably common or vulgar , but efficiently piratical , grandfather . It may interest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous investments . Hence our lasting prosperity in the face of universal disaster . " There fell a little silence , which Miss Grey broke with a question . " Well , " she demanded , " what are you going to do about it ? " " About what ? " asked Noel . " Restoring the faded glories of North Bagdad . As a family duty . As an act of filial piety to your birthplace ? " " Nothing , " said Noel . " I never do anything . I am static rather than dynamic . I would n't be able to think of anything to do . " ? " Is Andrew coming ? " " He did n't mention it . " " Ask him , " said Miss Grey . " Ask him what ? " " How to bring hustle to our deserted streets and prosperity to our desolate countryside . He 's a genius . He makes fortunes . He 's the great man . Would n't he know the way to do it ? " " Unquestionably , " said Noel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall expect you to announce his plans for us at an early date . " " I 'll take it up with him , " said Noel . " Not really ? " " Why not ? " Noel asked . " Oh , grand ! If the great Andrew takes an interest in us we are saved . I 'm going to announce it all over town , and then you wo n't dare back out . Andrew to the rescue ! Saved ! Saved ! It is Uncle Sam 's Marines ! " With that , she somehow set her bicycle in motion , and before Noel Cedric could do more than blink mildly she was yards away , whizzing toward the heart of the village . He blinked three more times slowly and reflectively and rather lugubriously , and then sat down again on his stone to fill a very cheap pipe with very cheap tobacco , and to light it with a match which had come into his possession free of charge . Such were the luxuries affected by Noel Cedric Bray .
