Since their marriage the Duke &; Duchess of Windsor have bathed and lolled on beaches , put in an appearance at the Salzburg Festival , made a tour of swank night-spots-all the fun of a carefree honeymoon . <P> Last week they were in Venice where on the fashionable Lido Beach they entertained the former Barbara Hutton , Woolworth heiress , and her husband Count Haugwitz-Reventlow. * At a loose end on the last night of their honeymoon the Duke &; Duchess hopped into a motorboat , glided through tortuous canals up to the faade of the stately Foscari Palace now converted into a school . Here in the open courtyard they had come to see Romeo &; Juliet . As they entered-the Duke in a dinner jacket , his Duchess with sapphire earclips and a white evening gown-the audience jumped to their feet to roar Viva l'amore Viva l'amore ! ( Long live love ! ) . At the end of the play Romeo bowed to the couple , threw up his hand in a Fascist salute . The crowd went wild with excitement .

Rumor immediately went round that the Duchess of Kent , a former Princess of Greece who is " class-conscious " to a degree , and a bit snippy about being " the best dressed woman in the British Royal Family , " had changed her mind about visiting her sister-in-law . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news than that the Kents were " leaving for Yugoslavia and would visit the Windsors en route . " <P> British newsorgans continued meantime to devote more &; more space to the ex-King and his wife . The evening Star reported last week that the couple propose to devote their future to social work in England as soon as " calumnies and slander " have abated . A stanch little pro-Windsor party in Britain , who would like nothing better , regarded it as a favorable omen that the Duke last week sent $500 to a Leicestershire agricultural society for a new fair ground and the Duchess $25 to a fund for a new church school in Warfield , Berkshire , from which one of her ancestors sailed for the New World in 1662 . <P> The British Government , however , still showed no signs of encouraging the prodigal 's return . In a revised list of royal warrants giving merchants the right to say " By Appointment to His Royal Highness So-and-So " Windsor 's name was left out , though those of his younger brothers , Kent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
