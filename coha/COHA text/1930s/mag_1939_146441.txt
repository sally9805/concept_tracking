While General Goes Monteiro , Chief of Staff of Brazil 's Army , last week basked in a warm welcome from the U. S. Government , U. S. educators found Brazil 's capital , Rio de Janeiro , somewhat chillier . <P> The World Federation of Education Associations , a nonpolitical , nonsectarian , decidedly conservative organization , this year accepted Brazil 's invitation to hold its biennial conference ( from August 6 to 11 ) in Rio de Janeiro . Few weeks ago , after some Federation members had already started to roll down to Rio , Brazil 's Government ( in which General Goes Monteiro 's Army is potent ) abruptly called the meeting off . <P> Investigating this strange change of heart , the U. S. State Department learned that the Army had smelled a Red rat : they did not like the radical sound of World Federation of Education Associations . Brazil 's Government politely said that Rio de Janeiro would be glad to wine and dine the world 's teachers but drew the line at a formal meeting . <P> This rebuff left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed delegates , who had looked forward to fun in Rio , and 2 ) where to hold their meeting . Last week they neatly got around their difficulty . Accepting the Government 's explanation that the invitation had been withdrawn , not for political reasons , but only because a new convention hall had not been completed , they decided to go to Rio for their fun , hold their meetings afterward on the homeward cruising S. S. Rotterdam .
