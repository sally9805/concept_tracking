From Chinwangtao , the seaside resort just below the Great Wall , to Singapore , the big British naval base at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , the coast of Eastern Asia rumbled last week with warlike activity . At Tientsin Japanese soldiers tightened their two-weeks-old blockade on the British Concession ; at Chefoo and Tsingtao Japanese officials sponsored anti-British demonstrations ; at Shanghai British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was surrounded with a heavy guard after " terrorists " had threatened his life ; the Japanese captured one Chinese port , closed another , attacked two more ( Foochow , Wenchow ) ; at Hong Kong British troops feverishly erected barbed wire entanglements and built pillbox fortifications ; at Singapore 44 French and British naval , military and air officers conferred on " common action " in the Far East . <P> Swatow . Japan 's victory-of-the-week over China was at the treaty port of Swatow , 180 miles north of Hong Kong . Here Japan also suffered a minor diplomatic defeat from western nations . Once a city of 178,000 , Swatow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten weeks . All electric lights had been cut off , the waterworks were out of order , the municipal buildings were all destroyed . By day Swatow was a deserted city , but at night , when no bombers came , it hummed with shipping activity . To the port came British , French , U. S. , Scandinavian ships bringing war materials . From Swatow they were taken overland in trucks to Shiuchow , 240 miles away , headquarters of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek 's Southeastern Chinese Army . <P> Determined to put an end to this traffic , the Japanese last week sent seven warships to the port and after a brief shelling landed sailors and marines . In twelve hours the city was occupied . In the harbor , however , lay the U. S. destroyer Pillsbury and the British destroyer Thanet . On shore were 40 U. S. citizens , mostly missionaries , and 80 Britons . During the occupation of the city Japanese naval authorities peremptorily demanded that British and U. S. warships leave at short notice . <P> Admiral Harry E. Yarnell , commander-in-chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flagship the cruiser Augusta , anchored off Chinwangtao , some 1,500 miles North , where he had gone after a brief inspection trip to Tientsin . He replied by 1 ) ordering the Pillsbury to remain , 2 ) dispatching another destroyer , the Pope , to the spot . The British seconded the U. S. by not only keeping the Thanet at Swatow but by sending the Scout to join her . Nothing happened to the ships , nor to any of the U. S. or British nationals ashore .
