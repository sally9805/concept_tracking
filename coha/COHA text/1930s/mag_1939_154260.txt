Robinson Jr. , Karpis gang Trigger Man Larry de Vol . <P> More startling was a recent radio capture . Four desperadoes in jail in Omaha slugged their guards and got away .

Back went May and began asking pointed questions . The man stirred himself wearily . <P> " O. K. , Foster , " he said , " I 'm your man . I 'm all shot . . . .
