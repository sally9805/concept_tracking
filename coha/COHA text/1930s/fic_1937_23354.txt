MR . SWEENEY 'S SHADOW A STORY BY JOAN DETWEILER nAuLINE and Hugh Westbrook were r what people call an ideal couple . They liked practically the same things , sailing and dancing , for instance , living in the country , their two children , and each other . Pauline had never wanted the last word on any subject and during six years of marriage had never raised an eyebrow , sighed , sniffed , or shrugged to suggest that something she had said might he right after all , therefore making Hugh wrong . Although Pauline liked dogs Hugh did n't , so there were none in the family . And because Hugh enjoyed buying jewelry for Pauline , which she did n't care about particularly , she recognized it as a means of expression for an inarticulate young man and never hinted at better ways of spending his money . Of course their income was more than adequate to cover a few hobbies , as Hugh 's salary and commissions were augmented by a tidy little inheritance from his mother . He met every date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jewelry . He apologized for any act of thoughtlessness or loss of temper with a ring , a bracelet , or a diamond brooch . The night he had got drunk with an out-of-town client and forgot to telephone was straightened out , to his own satisfaction , with the ruby heart-shaped earrings that he had been saving for St. Valentine 's Day . When he would fly into a rage over last month 's bills Pauline could be sure of a little satin box folded into her dinner napkin thefollowing evening instead of a few well-chosen words . After six years of continual celebration and apology she had quite a collection . Pauline was n't really interested in jewelry because at least three-quarters of their life was spent in old clothes for the boat . Every spring , usually very early in April , they left New York and hurried back to Long Island where they had built their house on a rise of ground beside the Great South Bay . It had beenconstructed for comfort and easy living , with sun-decks and simple gardens , and the boathouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , Hugh Liked her to be gowned in something soft and floating even when they dined alone , and Pauline always remembered to add enough jewels to please him . She kept her valuables in a haphazard arrangement of boxes in the several drawers of her dressing-table . Occasionally she was convinced that a ring or a brooch was missing and resolved to keep the drawers locked and hide the key . It really was n't fair , she told herself , to tempt Mary , the nurse , and the cook beyond their better natures . She also assured herself that some day she would list everything and arrange the pieces properly and had approached Hugh with the suggestion of a safe-deposit box for the summer anyway . " You might as well sell everything , " he had said . " When people begin locking things in vaults they might as well have the cash and start over . I ca n't understand the fun of owning the biggest diamond in the world if you have to keep the original under lock and key and wear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but it 's silly , living the way we do , to have a lot of diamonds lying round so that anyone could walk right in and go off with them . " " All right , " said Hugh , rattling the evening paper and letting his eyes drift back to the financial columns . " Put them all in a bag and I 'll take them to town to-morrow . With the cash you can buy yourself a sable coat and have something else to worry about . " " Listen , " said Pauline very gently and patiently . " I simply do n't need them until we go back to New York . And besides it is n't fair to put temptation in the way of the servants . . " " Listen , " he interrupted forcefully . " If you have any reason for suspecting your servants , fire them ! Do you mean to tell me that you will put your children in the care of dishonest women ? Fire them and get people in the house we can trust ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emerald clip at her throat , " They 're perfectly reliable but everybody has a weak moment , and anyway you read of things in the papers every day . I suppose being out here .. . " " You are twice as safe here , " said Hugh , " as you ever were in New York . You only read about millionaires getting robbed on Long Island . But if you are going to let that junk get on your nerves put it all in a bag and 1 ' 11 take it to town to-morrow . Would you rather have an ermine coat ? " " No , thank you , " said Pauline , " but it would be nice to have a watch dog who would be sweet with the children . " They never mentioned the subject of safety boxes again and Hugh did not follow up the matter of the watch dog . On a rainy night in the middle of October Pauline , wearing a yellow satin gown and diamond clips in her remark-able red hair and rings on her fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had missed the 6:18 the next train would not get him there until nearly eight . She had reminded him that morning that this was Mary 's movie night and dinner must be prompt . In the country you did not deliberately cross a servant 's reasonable request with no more excuse than forgetfulness . She stood in the bay window staring out into the darkness of the lawn where the circle of the driveway took shape under her steady gaze . Now that the leaves had thinned , the high street Iamp was intermittently visible through the restless branches of the elms beyond the hedge of privet . She watched the chips and splinters of light that were flung up as the rain caught the reflection and struck the puddles in the driveway . Every now and then a gust of wind sounded like the tread of a car turning in , but when the clock in the hall chimed the first quarter Pauline knew that Hugh had missed the second train . She let the curtain fall back into place and turned to face the room , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors softened and glowing under the light of scattered lamps . The children were in bed and there were no audible sounds from the kitchen . Pauline felt terribly alone and frightened without knowing why . She stood twisting her hands together , conscious of their burden of rings . Things happened to people , sometimes swiftly and shockingly , with no warning , and your lovely smooth life could be wiped out in one second . She could feel that inexplicable fear moving through her veins like a sudden injection . She lifted her hands in a soothing gesture to touch her temples and finger the thick bright mane of her hair . Then she walked slowly through the open French doors into the dining room where six tall candles on the table raised their buds of flame , reflected again and again in the silver , in the glassware , and in the long mirror above the console . It was somehow reassuring to push open the swing door and call out , as much to herself as to Mary , " Mr. Westbrook has been detained at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary , and we 'll manage without you . " Pauline let the door swing to and stopped a moment to extinguish the candles , knowing that Hugh could not be home before nine . When the headlights of the car hit the front windows in making the arc of the driveway , Pauline put down the book , the pages of which she had merely been turning during the past half hour . With the sound of his key in the lock , her heart took up its normal routine of pumping warm blood into her veins . His casual hello from the hail while hanging up his hat and coat made her almost angry . Why could n't he have telephoned ? She retrieved the book and merely raised her eyes when Hugh came into the room . " I 'm terribly sorry , darling , " he said . He walked over and balanced himself on the arm of her chair while attempting to kiss some portion of her drooped face . " I do n't blame you for being sore . " He forced her chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . " You do n't get a whiff of alcohol , clove , or chewing gum , do you , lady ? " She shook her head , trying not to smile . " I got tied up with McCollum and two other guys in confer-1 ence . I did n't realize how late it was until the party broke up and I had to run for the 7:50 ? no one at the reception desk and if I had tried to ' phone myself I should n't be here until after ten . " Pauline kept watching him as he talked , thinking how brisk and efficient and completely co-ordinated with life he was . She felt assured that nothing could ever happen to him but well-constructed age . His round cherubic face was burned deep by sun and wind and , although he was somewhat under six feet , his swagger in walking effected height . Pauline was small and slim , with childlike freckles on her nose , and perhaps it was her perpetual upward glance that was the basis of their perfect understanding . After dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire and Hugh talked vaguely about fixing a highball . Pauline said not to bother because it was late and they must get to bed . They continued to sit quiet and dose together staring into the flames , with her two little hands folded into one of his . Hugh 's head dropped back against the couch and he began to talk sleepily about what he had said to McCollum and how those two fellows from Chicago sat up and took notice . Pauline felt relaxed and comforted , hearing only the sound of his voice and watching the triangle of light from the fire take shape on the shadow of his throat as he talked . The sudden slam of the knocker against the front door resounded like an explosion in the stillness of the house . " Visitors ? " Hugh made a face at Pauline . " Not at this hour , " she said . She watched him cross the room and heard the wind echo in the chimney as the door opened . Then she could hear Hugh talking to someone and the blurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and went into the front hall , Hugh was saying , " I ca n't see how I can help you if you have n't a chain . " She stood behind him out of the cold draught . " What 's the matter , Hugh ? " " This guy 's car is stuck in the mud down near the Bay , " he said . " I suppose we have n't anything tougher than a clothesline ? " " No , " Pauline said . In the oblong of light on the darkened porch she could see the tall bulky figure of a man and felt that curious injection of fear chilling her blood again . She touched Hugh 's sleeve with her fingers and then became unpleasantly aware of her rings . She whispered , " Please do n't go out . " " Why do n't you come in and use the ' phone ? " Hugh suggested . " You can probably get some one to tow you for a couple of dollars . " The man took a step forward into the light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face and clothing streaked with mud . Water dripped in a circle round his feet as he stood there . " Thanks , " he said . His voice was low and husky . " I 'm too wet to come in . " Hugh said , " There 's a garage about a quarter of a mile up the road . I 'll try to locate them if you like . " The young man stood motionless with both hands in the pockets of his overcoat . " Thanks , " he said . " Do n't bother . " Pauline was sure that at least one hand was clutching a pistol . " It 's too cold , Hugh , to stand here with the door open , " she spoke sharply and the young man glanced at her . " Listen , lady , " he said , laughing a bit foolishly . " I 'm all right . I 'm Bert Sweeney from Bayville  --  do any kind of odd jobs , electric , paint , or plumbing . I got off the road to-night because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missus I would n't drive like that again ? just celebrating a new job . " His voice died away and he brought one hand out of a pocket and passed it over his face . " Gee , she 'll guess I had one too manyl " He laughed again . " Excuse me for bothering you , thought you might have a rope , mister . If you got any work , lady , just call Bert Sweeney at Bayville 790 . I 'd appreciate the business . Good night . " He saluted listlessly and swung round , stepping out of the light . They could hear him going down the steps and then the sound of his feet crunching the wet gravel . " Poor devil , " Hugh said . " He 's soaked to the skin . We should have made him stand here in the hall and called the ga-rage . " Pauline banged the door shut and hooked the chain across and leaned flat against the heavy panels . " I do n't like that , " she cried . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round here to get an idea of the house . We ought to have a dog , Hugh , just to show strangers we have some protectionl " Hugh laughed at her . " Maybe I would look more helpful waving a gun . You certainly are a sensationalist , Polly . I feel sort of like a dog myself letting him plod through all that mud . " " Of course he does n't work alone , " she said fiercely . " There are at least three other men waiting for him in a black sedan at the end of the road and they 'll sit there until all the lights go out in the house and then come here later . " Hugh stood staring down at her , frowning . " What in  --  for gosh sake , Pauline , what 's the matter with you ? " She was furtively replacing her rings one by one on her fingers . " I was sure he was looking at them when I put my hand on your arm so I hid them in my handkerchief . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just jumpy this evening . " " Oh , that damn trashl " he burst out . " Will you please put it in a bag and let me take it to town to-morrow ? " When Hugh went downstairs to bank the furnace Pauline hurried from room to room , trying the locks of the windows and the porch doors . She could hear the swing of the shovel into the bin and the clatter of the coal and Hugh coughing and swearing with the gas fumes . She stood in the center of the living room , listening to the familiar sounds and deciding that she was being pretty silly and hysterical . Maybe , she thought , the young man really was Bert Sweeney from Bayville , maybe he did have a missus who was pacing up and down , the way she herself had done , wondering why he was so late . He had said 790 and the combination was as clear in her mind as if he had just told her . On sudden impulse she went to the telephone in the hall closet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow signals , thinking of the bell ringing violently in a small darkened house where the family had gone to bed an hour ago . Agnes could hear the ' phone ringing like mad downstairs so she put on her slippers and bathrobe and made her way cautiously down the wooden stairs . You 'd have to break your neck before Rogers would leave a light on in the hall . Jerry came thumping clown behind her like a weary shadow . The door was open into the shop , which explained why she had heard the bell so distinctly . It was the pay ' phone back of the door , and it might be Bert calling because nobody would be after Rogers this time of night . If it was Bert she 'd certainly tell him a thing or two and he had his nerve thinking he could fix it up with her over the telephone . She whipped off the receiver with all the strength of her round strong arm and shouted , " Hel-lo . " Jerry sighed and sank panting at her feet . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bert Sweeney there ? " " Bert 's out on a job , " Agnes snapped . " Who wants him ? " " I want to speak to Mrs. Sweeney then , " the voice continued . " All right , " said Agnes . " You 've got her . And speak louder , please . " " Your husband 's car got stuck in the mud near our house in Southport and he 's gone to a garage to get someone to tow him . " " Who 's talkin ' ? " demanded Agnes . " Is this a gag or somethin ' ? " " I thought you might be worried , " Pauline said . " This is Mrs. Westbrook on Southport Road . Your husband got off the highway , and on a rainy night it is quite confusing down this way . " " Confused ? " repeated Agnes with scorn . " I guess you mean he 's drunk again  --  the trampl " " Oh , no , " said Pauline hastily . " He would have ' phoned you himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Anyway do n't worry , Mrs. Sweeney , he 'll be home soon . " " Well , thanks , " said Agnes , frowning . " Thanks a lot . " When she had replaced the receiver she turned suddenly and tripped over Jerry . " How many times have I told you to keep from under my feet , you muttl " She retraced her steps through the hall and up the sagging stairs with the dog right at her heels . In the light you could see that he was small and shaggy with uncombed black hair over his eyes . He slid expertly through the crack of the door just before Agnes slammed it and waddled over to the bed where he stood whining until she cursed him with no particular rancor and lifted him up on the quilt . She was a plump pretty woman with an irritable worried expression and a mass of unkempt dark hair like Jerry 's , almost over her eyes . Agnes made up her mind that she would n't go to sleep until Bert got home , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and the bathrobe held tight round her with the other , stopping occasionally to scratch her head and murmur , " Well I 'll be ? " There was something up of course . He was n't worth a damn , she thought , get a job and then have to drink up the first day 's pay and never get a second chance . She had wasted five years on him and every time she got really mad and on the point of leaving he would swear off , " This time forever , so help me God , Aggie , " and he promised to take out some insurance before he fell to pieces . " If he 's drunk to-night , " Agnes thought , " it 's just once too often and I 'm through . I 'll go back to New York and show him I can take care of myself plenty good enough . " When it got to be after one o'clock and the house was as cold as a tomb Agnes climbed into bed in her bathrobe and lay shivering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awake at seven and there were no signs of Bert . It made her good and sore that she could n't give him a piece of her mind before she left . After breakfast she threw some of her old rags into a battered bag and put Jerry in his leather carrier . She took one look round the miserable room , with the unwashed dishes stacked just to annoy him in the closet-kitchen , and breathed in once more the odor of burned grease that hung in a perpetual haze through the house . Five years thrown away on this mess , thought Agnes , getting nowhere but older every day . It sounded good five years ago to get married and give up working and settle down in a nice little home in the country . Anyway they did n't have any kids so she could walk right out and only regret she had n't done it three years ago before she got too fat to model eight-seventy-five dresses for Maxie Frieman . She hailed the bus at the corner of Main Street and swung the bags up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going through to New York , as she thought she was going to , Agnes flopped down in one of the front seats and talked to him over his shoulder . " Do you know where Southport Road is ? " " Sure , " he said . " It cuts right across the highway about half a mile from Southport . " Agnes sat nodding her head and chewing on her underlip . She might do a little investigating just for the fun of it , get an idea what he was up to for her own satisfaction . So she got off at Southport village , decided to park the big bag in a drugstore , and lugged the carrier with Jerry rattling round in it until he could walk on his own four legs when they were off the highway . When she came to Southport Road it took a left turn toward the Bay and she saw that it was one of those avenues of fine old trees and houses built back from the road , surrounded by well-trimmed lawns and clipped shrubbery . Agnes began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Bert had been stuck in the mud as the lady said , but where did he go afterward to celebrate getting pulled out ? Anyway it was a nice day for a walk , clear and snappy . When she let Jerry out of the carrier he started off after squirrels as if he knew something about hunting . Agnes walked slowly on her high heels with her hat stuck under one arm and let her eyes appraise the handsome homes . That , she thought , was what she had understood by living in the country , none of this one room over a bicycle shop on the main street of some little burg . It was wet under foot , shuffling through soaked dead leaves , but she did n't mindbecause it was fun thinking about herself in a house like one of those , ordering a couple of servants around . If she had n't been such a fool to fall for a sap like Bert she certainly could have got Maxie to marry her , in spite of his mother . Even if he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something better . Maxie would n't look at her now . Probably married anyway with a bunch of kids . If you did n't grab your opportunities without mixing up good sense with love and foolishness you were out of luck . Agnes did n't care now whether or not she found the Westbrook place . She knew she would never have the nerve to walk right up to the door and begin asking about Bert . She was headed for the Bay so she 'd go on down and have a look . Several cars passed her going her way and far down the road she could see a crowd of people gathered in a field as if to watch some school game . As she drew closer Agnes could see that there was a short inlet way over to the left , cut right between two big estates . There was a boathouse built close to the water and all the people and cars were bunched together on both sides of the inlet . You could see that there must be something going on , and she guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being locked up for the winter . Agnes decided that she might as well join the throng , and it never occurred to her when she saw the fellow in a diving suit and helmet and a big derrick swing out over the water that it had anything to do with Bert . She noticed a red-haired girl standing back a bit from the crowd and knew without being told that she belonged to one of those nice places . She was dressed in simple clothes that could n't fool you if you knew anything about them . A sweater from Scotland that must have set her old man back fifteen or twenty bucks and tweeds that Maxie Frieman never handled in his life . " Class , " thought Agnes , Lost in admiration , " real genuine class . " Just then Jerry came bounding over the bracken and tough huckleberry bushes , his ears matted back with cockleburs , and the redhead bent down and held out one hand to him . She said , " Hello , pup , " and Jerry sniffed her fingers . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer . " What 's all the crowd for ? " " A car went over the embankment last night , " Pauline said . " It sank right down in the mud and a fisherman ran into the top of it this morning in a rowboat . " Agnes put the dog-carrier on the ground and stated at the other woman . She felt sort of sick suddenly . " Was there anybody in it ? " Her voice was thick and she laid one hand against her throat . " They think so , " Pauline said . " The diver has just gone down . " " Oh . " Agnes was swaying as if the ground were breaking under her . She kept thinking over and over , " Poor Bert . He was all right . He did the best he could . Honest , I would n't really have left you , Bert , I just wanted to show you . Honest , Bert . " She stood there with the tears pouring down her face , crying silently with her mouth twisted out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauline caught her arm . " Do you think it is someone you know ? Oh , I 'm so sorry . " There was a murmur in the crowd and one man said , " He 's gut him now , poor guy ! " And everyone pushed forward and you could hear the police shouting directions to the men working the derrick . They pulled the car up slowly and it was Bert 's car , that little old piece of junk she used to get so sore about and ask him if he was n't ashamed to be seen driving it in daylight . The diver was on the other bank now with his helmet off and that thing on the ground was Bert , a good swimmer too , caught in a trap . Agnes remembered how you had to kick the doors to get them open or just climb over . She ran forward screaming at himbefore she fell headlong on the wet trampled ground . Pauline insisted that they take the stricken woman to her house and two men carried her upstairs to Pauline 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She set the dog 's bag on the floor and watched Jerry sniff it and wander over to lick the limp hanging hand of his mistress . " It 's all our fault , " Pauline thought frantically . " My fault  --  I would n't let Hugh help him . " She chafed the woman 's hands , loosened her clothing , and kept Mary running back and forth with cold compresses . All the time she was thinking about what the police had said , that the man had been going so fast he had driven right over before he could see that the road turned sharply . " They 'd better get that iron railing up instead of talkin ' so much , " the chief said . Someone began to argue with him about how the guy must have been pretty drunk to be driving that fast on a rainy night , and Pauline did n't tell anyone that he had come to their house asking for help . He must have gone back and struggled with the car and finally got it out with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow the road was . When Agnes came to , Pauline put a cover over her and fed her hot water and whisky from a spoon . " You just lie here , " she said , " and I 'll talk to the police so they wo n't have to bother you . " Agnes felt better and raised herself on the cushions , eying the pretty room in all its rosy silks and painted furniture . " Tell them I have n't a penny to bury him . Tell them to send him to his father . He did n't leave a cent , poor fella ; he had a lot of big ideas that never panned out . " She watched Pauline , dry-eyed now . " I telephoned you last night , " Pauline said . " Do you know , Mrs. Sweeney , I think he had a premonition . I really believe that things like that can happen , I really do . He wanted you to know for some good reason so that you would be here when they found him . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept remembering the number until I had to call you  --  just as if something were making me do it . Perhaps he knew I could help you and I want to do everything I can . " " I do n't know , " Agnes said dubiously . " Maybe you 're right . Anyway it would be the first time he ever thought that far ahead . " Pauline wrote down all the necessary information , lowered the shades , and told Agnes to sleep if she could . She went downstairs with Jerry following her and he found his way unerringly to the kitchen . It was almost three o'clock when Pauline got back to the house after all the rigmarole at police headquarters . They had to notify Mr. Sweeney senior , who evidently had not been on the best of terms with his son . He announced that he was saving up for his own funeral . Pauline insisted that they tell the old man an anonymous friend was willing to donate the amount necessary to bury Bert . She felt that was the least they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she returned to the house , wondering how it was going to be possible to fulfill her obligations to the bereaved wife . Jerry met her at the front door and was apparently delighted to see her . Mary was in the dining room giving the children their orange juice . Both little voices piped high in praise of Jerry . " Is Mrs. Sweeney asleep ? " Pauline asked . Mary was a blonde skinny girl whose English accent and better days made her ideal for the children . " I fetched her some lunch , madam , " Mary said . " Arid a short time after she came downstairs with her hat and coat on and the bag . She said she was going to the village and that if she did n't see you to tell you thank you . " The girl hesitated , frowning slightly . " Oh , yes , and she did say that you might be right about her husband wanting her to come here and to tell you that it was the first good hunch , yes , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . " " That 's funny , " said Pauline . " I wonder what she meant . " " I thought she took that odd little creature with her , she was carrying the bag , you know , but he seems to have taken quite a fancy to cook . " " Oh , we really need a dog , Mary ? " Pauline suddenly remembered why . She turned and hurried upstairs to her bedroom . The drawers of the dressing table were open and empty , as Mrs. Bert Sweeney had done a very thorough job .
