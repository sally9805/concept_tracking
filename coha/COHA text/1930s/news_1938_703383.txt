txt tie naa an itt Inch bayonet anti two swords under his arm when they arrested him yesterday at Van Buren and La Salle streets . He said he was John Smith , a carnival showman who lives at 517 North Clark street . When the police took him to the Central station he began to boast of his fire-eating capabilities , and protested strenuously when they took away his matches . Then he showed them the picture gallery he wears on his throat , arms , hands , back , and chest . There was n't much they could do about those  --  they were tattooed on . Bitter were his cries when they took away his bayonet and swords . He said he had swallowed them so often they would be lonesome in a cold station safe . Then they locked him up on a disorderly conduct charge for hearing today .
