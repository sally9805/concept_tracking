A thin , wiry lowan of 49 , U. S. Commissioner of Education John Ward Studebaker points with pride to the Public Forums , modeled after the oldtime New England town meeting , he ran three years ago as Des Moines ' Superintendent of Schools . Adult education is Commissioner Studebaker 's strongest interest , and he believes that public discussion is the foundation of any adult program . Last week in a little book called Plain Talk , * he wistfully told what he would do if the U. S. Government were to allot him $70,000,000 for experimental purposes . He would train 10,000 forum leaders , set them to leading 50,000 forums a week all over the U. S. <P> During the bottom of Depression , forums sprouted spontaneously throughout the nation . The current issue of School Life , organ of Commissioner Studebaker 's Office of Education , reports that more than 1,000 forums are still functioning , concentrated chiefly in the East and Midwest . Favorite discussion topic , said School Life , is International Affairs , with Economic Recovery a close second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of the Federal Government extended into the communities . . . either through the office of Education or through any other Federal agency , " says Commissioner Studebaker . " I am a strong believer in local administration . " His forum project would give the communities Federal funds , let them pick their own leaders and subjects . Hopefully he concludes : " The Federal Government can do nothing better calculated to inspire confidence in our democracy of free learning and discussion .
