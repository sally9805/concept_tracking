From the tortuous , terraced streets of Chungking , frightened Chinese saw doom in the blood-red discs on the under side of raiders ' wings before ever a Japanese bomb had been dropped . The people of Madrid and Barcelona learned to duck whenever they saw the red- &-yellow; wing insignia of Nationalist ships overhead . Fighting tribesmen in Palestine know they must take to cover whenever attack planes sweep down on them with the blue-white- &-red; wing targets of Great Britain . <P> Distinctive national insignia for fighting planes were originated early in the World War so that in the split-second action of aerial dogfights pilots could quickly identify friendly planes , would fire on none by mistake . After the War their use soon spread to all the world 's air forces . Even with camouflage they will probably be used in the next great war , both for their identification factor and because the sight of friendly wings overhead is a morale builder for ground troops . As the flags of nations have disappeared from modern battlefields , they thus reappear , in new forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air . <P> That they also enable panicked noncombatants to identify low-flying raiders , and even bombers in the middle military altitudes , is of no great military importance . Defending anti-aircraft crews identify friendly and enemy planes by their distinctive silhouettes , and to them wing and tail markings are only confirming evidence that approaching ships should be fired on or allowed to go by .
