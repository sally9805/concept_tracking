It was a good thing for Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg that he skipped out of Vienna to holiday near Salzburg last week . To President Wilhelm Miklas and Prince Ernst Rdiger von Starhemberg , Supreme Sports Leader of Austria , who remained behind to greet Olympic athletes ( see p. 40 ) , massed and vociferous Austrian Nazis offered the most humiliating of insults . <P> In the first place it is illegal to give the Nazi salute or sing Nazi songs in Austria . Moreover , Adolf Hitler has just made a pact with Kurt von Schuschnigg pledging Germany rigorously to abstain from interfering in the political affairs of Austria ( TIME , July 20 ) . On the strength of this agreement , Austrian amnesty was granted thousands of imprisoned Nazis . Last week these brawny fellows turned out to heckle Prince von Starhemberg and President Miklas . The Prince had the advantage of speaking into a microphone . <P> Even though technicians turned up all loud speakers connected to it full blast , Starhemberg was completely drowned out by roars of " Heil Hitler ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his speech . <P> Kindly President Miklas fared even worse , had to stand for a whole hour in which nothing could be heard but the frantic cheers of Austrians for the ruler of Germany . Vienna police , either anxious for their own skins or under secret orders from absent Chancellor Schuschnigg , not only permitted Nazis to roar their forbidden Horst Wessel song but let them slug and beat up Socialists , Communists and Jews . Four plug-uglies wearing Nazi white socks dumped a blood-bespattered youth in front of some policemen , mockingly declared : " Here 's a Red for you who 's been shouting against Hitler ! "
