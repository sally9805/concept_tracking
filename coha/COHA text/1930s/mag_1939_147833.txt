( See Cover ) * <P> Harbert , Mich. , is a crossroads town about 60 miles east of Chicago across the lake . To get there you have to drive through the gritty desolation of South Chicago , through Gary , where in autumn the blast furnaces at night make a glowering sheet lightning , through the smoke of Michigan City and into clean air again , along Lake Michigan behind some of the biggest sand dunes in the world . Carl Sandburg 's place is on top of a dune a mile or so from the Harbert post office . On the land side the house is a triple decker , the top deck open and sunny . The front porch looks over ten miles of beach through the crests of some tall pines . Inside it is the kind of house a good workman likes to have for his family . <P> Sandburg bought this place eleven years ago , about the time he started work on The War Years , the second part of his biography of Abraham Lincoln . In the attic he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of book shelves . Near a corner window he put his typewriter on an old box whose height suited him . He liked to tell people that if Grant and those fellows could run their war from cracker boxes , a cracker box was good enough for him . This attic and a room on the second floor called the Lincoln Room came in time to resemble second-hand book stores . In the first two years alone Carl Sandburg went through more than a thousand source books and marked them for copyists , of whom he had two at a time working downstairs in the glassed-in porch . His pretty , white-haired wife , Paula , and three daughters helped with the files . Gutted and exhausted books went to the barn . <P> From April to October each year Sandburg made no engagements ; he sat at his cracker box and wrestled with a bigger job than any army commander ever faced . Fifty years old when he started it , he could summon to his aid a lifetime of singularly useful experience : as a shock-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( his father was an immigrant blacksmith ) listening to talk of Lincoln and the Civil War ; as a harvest hand , a migrant worker , a volunteer in the Spanish-American War ; as a young reporter in Milwaukee and Chicago getting ten years of schooling in the hard facts of politics , business , labor ; as a poet , a big Swede trying to shape American lingo to fit his anger against bunk artists , his vague tenderness for common people , his sense of the power of U. S. Midland cities . <P> When the literary history of his time comes to be written , Carl Sandburg may well be esteemed the luckiest of his Midwestern generation . Vachel Lindsay and Edgar Lee Masters had as great if not greater native talent ; even Ben Hecht , whose desk was next to Sandburg 's on the Chicago Daily News in the early ' 20s , seemed a more brilliant , sophisticated writer . Of them all , Sandburg , the immigrant 's son , got the surest roothold in authentic U. S. tradition , and got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Abraham Lincoln . " That son-of-a-gun Lincoln grows on you , " he once told a reporter . Before he finished The Prairie Years , which carried the biography to 1861 , he had meditated on the basic Lincoln material , had achieved a clear , homely , sometimes lovely style . The greater demands of the Civil War material in range and stamina and subtlety unquestionably deepened and instructed him still further .
