txt The smaller neutral powers , led by Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Finland , Mexico and Colombia , today hotly condemned Japan 's aggression in China and its menace to the League , before the general committee of the Assembly meeting in extraordinary session to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute . Never before in history has a sovereign state sat in any chamber and had its policy so severely criticized . Never before have such criticisms been publicly uttered by responsible ministers . Never before has public opinion been so concentrated upon a single objective . Japan 's name was not mentioned , but one speaker after another referred to the invasion of the territory of another state , to military occupation , to warlike pressure being brought allegedly to protect nationals and right old grievances . Mr. Naotake Sato and Mr. Tsuneo Matsudaira , leading Japanese delegates , flanked by minor experts . sat stonily in their places as this torrent of scarcely veiled indictment poured from the tribune . They never flinched and seldom lifted eyes from their papers . But they had one consolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented in the Assembly would have dared to express such criticism . Another great power which might have shared in the critical flow sat in a corner of the room  --  the full American arms delegation , augmented by local consular officials had a private section roped off from the rest . Pressure on Japan At yesterday 's session , after Dr. Yen , leading Chinese delegate , and Mr. Sato had exchanged pungent contradictions respecting the actual state of the armies around Shanghai , the " steering committee " produced an important resolution actually designed to end the hostilities . This resolution , which Mr. Sato fought vigorously , and only accepted when the utmost pressure had been brought to bear upon him , definitely recommends that the neutrals in Shanghai should " regulate the withdrawal of the Japanese forces . " Mr. Sato wished to nullify this phrase and bring the Chinese under equal supervision . But the Assembly refused to accept this claim that Japanese troops might still remain . M. Paul Hymans of Belgium . president of the Assembly ; Mr. Giuseppe Matta of Switzerland and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of withdrawal of the Japanese troops had already been decided upon and could not again be called into question . Yesterday was the fiist occasion on which genuine pressure was brought upon Japan In League circles . The Council has always shied from verbal force . and the great powers have avoided strong statements . But M. Hymans , Mr. Motta and Dr. Bene5 seemed too anxious that the League should not doom itself to perpetual impotence , if not actual collapse , to permit Japan to continue its- evasive negotiations . Perhaps the most notable fact of all is that Japan , confronted for the first time with force , immediately gave in . This is taken here as a good augury for the future . Tokyo 's Propaganda Alleged Today 's concentration of smaller states was preceded by another unseemly succession of contradictions between Dr. Yen and Mr. Sato . Hot words included a charge by the Chinese that Japan is expending millions of yen annually on bought propaganda in Europe and America . His reference was to the widely repeated charge that leading papers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for proof and made China responsible , for the statement . The argument over whether hostilities have actually ceased was momentarily ended by telegrams from the French and British military authorities in Shanghai , stating that , although the landing of Japanese reenforcements continues , although desultory skirmishes are taking place , the main battle has actually ceased . The observers did not throw light on Dr. Yen 's charge that Japanese airplanes are still bombarding unfortified towns . After these interchanges , six neutral speeches brought their , combined offensive on Japanese action . Mr. Birger Braadland of Norway announced that he would introduce recommendations to the parties with the , purpose of averting further hostilities and settling the whole conflict . He stressed the word " whole " and clearly referred to Manchuria as well as Shanghai . If either party refuses the League 's recommendations , Mr. Braadland insisted , public opinion would force the nations to bang sanctions into operation . Dr. Antonio Restrepo of Colombia , with his historical background dominated by apprehension of armed intervention , insisted that no state has the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senor Ortega of Mexico said . in reference to Japan . that " no nation can be a judge in its own cause . The League alone is judge . " Mexico demanded that sovereignty be respected , territorial integrity reestablished , and armed intervention abolished . " no matter what name is invented for it by legal , political or moral cunning . " Mr. J. E. Lefgren. of Sweden . insisted that the disembarking of troops by one League state on the territory of another League member was in flat violation of the covenant and the Pact of Paris . Expansion of the doctrine of legitimate defense to this extent rendered maintenance of international order impossible . As hostilities end , he said , the League must take care that future negotiations shall not be influenced by the military positions of any power . Thus spoke the small stales  --  states which come to Geneva with hands unstained by occupation and armed intervention by their own forces . Their influence on the whole Assembly and on the future should now be determined . America to Cooperate Yesterday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseeing the peacemaking was strengthened today when Mr. Hugh Wilson , American Minister at Berne , communicated to the League his Government 's willmgnes to cooperate in the work . Mr. Henry L. Stimson American Secretary of State , has advised the League that the American military authorities at Shanghai have been telegraphically ordered to coOperae . The final speakers this morning were Dr. Rafael W. Erich of Finland and Jonkheer Beelaerts van Blokland of the Netherlands . Dr. Erich stressed the smaller powers ' favorite thesis that aggression can be committed without war being declared , and applied his reasoning to the present case . Jonkheer Heelaerts was more guarded than his colleagues , but he pictured the almost unanimous public opinion of the world " despite which party in conflict continued its military acts . " League Resolution Demands Withdrawal Of Japanese Troops GENEVA , March 5 4Y1 ? Cessation of hostilities at Shanghai and withdrawal of the Japanese troops was demanded in a resolution unanimously adopted last night by the League of Nations Assembly . The resolution read : " This Assembly , recalling suggestions made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures envisaged therein . " 1 . Calls upon the Governments of Chinn and Japan immediately to take the measures necessary to insure that orders which , as it has been informed , have been issued by the military commanders on both sides for cessation of hostilities , shall be made effective . " 2 . Requests that other powers which have special interests in the Shanghai area inform the Assembly of the manner in which the invitation set out in the previous paragraph has been executed . " 3 . Recommends that negotiations be entered into by Chinese and Japanese representatives with the assistance of the military , naval and civilian authorities of the powers mentioned above for conclusion of arrangements which shall make definite the cessation of hostilities . and regulate withdrawal of the Japanese forces .
