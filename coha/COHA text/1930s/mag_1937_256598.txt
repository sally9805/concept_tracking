The incessant trailing of Dr. Mattson father on his visits around the city , by these same newspaper men . . . . Unwarranted and untruthful emphasis on the words " mansion " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals who drew from their imaginations . . . . The publication by some newspapers of the alleged ransom note secured improperly , in all probability through bribery . . . .
